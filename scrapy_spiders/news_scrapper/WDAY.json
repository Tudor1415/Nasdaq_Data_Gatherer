And for longtime shareholders, CRM stock has been one of the biggest winners.Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com\n\tLed by forward-thinking and acquisition-happy founder and CEO Marc Benioff, CRM stock has rocketed from under $4 a share in 2004, to all-time highs around $195 a share earlier this year.The company just released earnings, and while not every analyst loved them, the numbers weren\u2019t disappointing enough to suggest the long-term tailwinds at the company\u2019s back are changing. In fact, some of the numbers were pretty good.If all you did was look at CRM stock immediately after fiscal first quarter 2021 results, you\u2019d think its recent numbers just weren\u2019t very good. Shares fell about 4% following the results.However, let\u2019s get one thing clear: Salesforce\u2019s last quarter was good: the company beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. Revenue rose 30% year-over-year to $4.87 billion, better than the $4.85 billion consensus, and adjusted earnings per share clocked in at 70 cents, better than Wall Street\u2019s expectation for 69 cents per share.That said, Salesforce stock didn\u2019t fall for no reason. Wall Street took issue with the company\u2019s second-quarter guidance, which called for revenue between $4.89 billion and $4.93 billion, below the $5.04 billion consensus. Analysts also didn\u2019t see their second-quarter EPS estimate of 74 cents matched by the software giant\u2019s guidance, which called for EPS between 66 cents and 67 cents.Does guidance matter? Yes. But at the end of the day it\u2019s just a bunch of numbers in the air. It\u2019s the long-term earnings potential, growth potential, and staying power of any business that matters to Salesforce stock investors.By that measure, it\u2019s been nothing but good news filtering in for the cloud-based customer relationship software company. The same day CRM announced first-quarter earnings,  what he called \u201cone of the largest transactions we\u2019ve ever done\u201d: a deal with  (NYSE:) that will allow the wireless giant to compile customer data into one place and access it from multiple touchpoints.Another partnership between Salesforce and enterprise cloud software company  (NASDAQ:) further shows that Salesforce has simply become an absolutely vital part of a space that isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. If you\u2019ve got customers \u2014 especially if you\u2019ve got a lot of them \u2014 Salesforce can make your life easier, strengthen your customer relationships, and optimize your interactions with them.Workday will integrate more deeply into Salesforce\u2019s Work.com, an incredibly relevant new suite of technologies focused on helping businesses re-open from the coronavirus-induced shutdown.Short-term gyrations in the wake of earnings reports are par for the course. What\u2019s not par for the course is a $150 billion growth stock like CRM, which has compounded revenue growth above 25% in the past five years and which is expected to continue posting 20% growth for the next five.Betting against Benioff has never been wise in the past, and with Salesforce firing on all cylinders in an economy facing record-setting unemployment claims and unpredictable business closures, it\u2019ll be a pleasure to watch what happens when the economy gets back on track.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system \u2014 with\u00a0.

While uncertainties remain with the COVID-19 impact, Workday provides essential HR and finance management software that is well-insulated from pandemic disruption.The company\u2019s extensive collection of cloud-based solutions, such as accounting, financial reporting, analytics and compensation, gives it a pathway to multiple years of growth, particularly as businesses adjust to a remote-work environment. Workday\u2019s solutions, which aim to increase business efficiency, while lowering costs, are driving market share growth in two of its main profit drivers \u2014 SaaS and enterprise resource planning.\u00a0While these business functions are critical to maintaining efficiency amid lockdown restrictions, the likes of Salesforce () are also vying for those dollars.

This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 43 cents per share on revenue of $825.05 million. For the full year ending in December, earnings are projected to rise 11.5% year over year to $2.10 per share, while revenue of $4.27 billion would mark a 17.6% increase year over year.Owing to the digital transformation taking place across all industries, strong revenue and earnings growth projections are commonplace for Workday, which has topped or matched the Street\u2019s earnings estimates in ten straight quarters.

Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2020.With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. -- Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's first quarter FY'21 . Before we get into our results, I want to express my sincere appreciation to our more than 12,000 employees who have responded in such a remarkable way to support one another and our customers during these uncertain times. This team continues to push forward across all areas of our business and I've never been more proud of them. As we continue to navigate this period, we've stayed very focused on our core values as our Northstar. That means our employees come first always and without exception. I also want to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to our customers, many of whom are on the frontline and putting yourself in harm's way everyday. Thank you from all of us at Workday.Over the past few months, we have worked closely with our customers to configure their Workday solutions to help them navigate new challenges and opportunities presented by this current environment. We've also heard from countless customers who, like us, are using Workday to seamlessly close their books 100% remotely for the first time ever. We have healthcare customers that are relying on Workday to redeploy critical people resources with great agility and we have heard from our planning customers who are using our solution to dynamically adjust their financial workforce plans. In fact, in late March we saw more than 30x increase in the number of scenario models that our customers were running. These are just a few examples where Workday has empowered our customers to better navigate this challenging and fluid environment.Just before today's call we announced one more. Workday and Salesforce have been great partners for a long time and now have countless joint customers. When the pandemic hit, many had to flip to a completely remote workforce overnight, closing offices, schools, services and more and others had to turn on a 24/7 team in an instant. Our HCM customers are leveraging the power of the data in Workday as a source of truth to manage their workforces which has included things like identifying essential workers, deploying people with relevant skill sets and more. And at the same time, Salesforce has just announced Work.com, which is a powerful platform for organizations to reopen safely and manage their logistics and returning to work. So, it only made sense to bring Workday and Work.com together in a way that will simplify things for our customers immensely, eliminating the need for reconciliation between various systems and more as they prepare their workforce and return to work safely and securely, and this is just a start.Now, moving on to the business highlights from Q1, beginning with Workday HCM, where the journey to the cloud continued despite the challenging backdrop. In Q1 we were selected as core HCM vendor from one of the largest city governments, the City of Los Angeles. We also welcomed a utility company in EMEA with over 80,000 employees, as well as a large insurance company in Asia-Pac with over 50,000 employees among the many new HCM customers in the quarter.Turning to Workday Financial Management. I'm pleased to say that we now have over 900 customers that have selected us as their core financial system. We saw continued momentum in Q1, including Financials first win, a Fortune 50 company, Fannie Mae. Other new financial customers included Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government, Okta, as well as a large healthcare company with more than 60,000 employees. Amongst the many financials go-lives in the quarter, I would like to highlight Lithia Motors and RaceTrac Petroleum. We also saw solid demand for our expanding suite of products that support the office of the CFO and the Chief Procurement Officer.On the planning front, we expanded our partnership with Microsoft, so Workday customers can run Workday Adaptive Planning on Microsoft Azure Cloud. Microsoft became the first Workday customer on Azure as they adopt Workday Adaptive Planning to help them with their planning, budgeting and forecasting. Scout RFP had a solid first full [Technical Issues] quarter under Workday with multiple Fortune 500 wins, including its largest-ever transaction with a large healthcare company and wins at Lowe's and Albertsons. One of the many benefits of the cloud is that, we can deploy our customers 100% virtually and we showcased the strength in Q1 with more than 90 customer go-lives in March and April alone. Quite notably, two of these customers have more than 85,000 employees each; Jardine Matheson in APJ and John Lewis Partnership in EMEA.Turning to product. We delivered our latest major release in March, which included enhanced workforce planning with Workday Adaptive Planning, availability of Workday Assistant, an intuitive chatbot to guide employees, new machine learning-based skills capabilities with Workday HCM to verify current employee skills and supporting reskilling efforts and new data visualization and benchmarking features with Workday Prism Analytics.In addition, we made great progress on our extensibility journey. Just this past weekend, we moved our latest offering on Workday Cloud Platform, Workday Extend to GA. This is a significant milestone for us that we believe further increases our strategic positioning with customers and partners. In addition, to our powerful integration capabilities, customers can now build deep extensions from Workday's core applications. As an example, within just a few short weeks, one of our customers built an app on Workday Extend that help facilitate hazard pay to their workers on the frontlines.I'm confident that this period will ultimately serve as a catalyst to accelerate the adoption of our growing platform supporting HR and finance systems in the cloud. Now more than ever, companies are realizing the incredible importance of having agile flexible systems to support their mission-critical business processes.With that, I'll turn it over to our Co-President, Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano. -- Thank you, Aneel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to spend a few minutes providing an update on the sales [Phonetic]. Before I do that, I would first like to thank our entire go-to-market team for their response to this new selling environment. Though I may be biased, I've long-held the belief that we have the best sales team in enterprise software and I have never been more confident in that belief than right now, having watched our teams engage with and take care of our customers and prospective customers over the last few months.As Aneel mentioned, there were many highlights in the quarter, including the Financials first win in April at Fannie Mae. Key to signing this deal was Accounting Center, one of our new products that will enable Fannie Mae to account for and analyze their robust loan portfolio. The Medium Enterprise team also had another stellar quarter, continuing a multi-year trend we have seen since introduction of our launch program, a pre-configured deployment approach with a streamlined sales and delivery, which has dramatically reduced the cost to deploy.In addition, momentum with our back-to-base team continued in Q1 with 50%-plus new ACV growth performance with our back-to-base team spanned across customer segments and products, including core FINS, Adaptive Planning, Learning and Prism Analytics. The mix of new ACV coming from installed customers has been on the rise for us over the last few quarters. We continue to add resources to better target the growing installed base opportunity and we expect to continue to lean into this effort in the quarters and years ahead.We had considerable sales momentum across all areas of the business entering FY'21. However, as COVID-19 forced a lockdown across much of the global economy, we saw higher than normal deal pushouts, particularly in industries most impacted, including travel, hospitality and healthcare. All major geographies were affected, though we saw an earlier impact in our Rest of World markets.Making the decision to move on to Workday has always been a very important and strategic one for companies and one that is not taken lightly. Given the importance of the decision and the strategic nature of the partnership with our customers, in this uncertain environment, there are companies that are prolonged with that decision process as they focus first on assessing and responding to the immediate impacts to their business. The good news is that, based on where we stand today most of the pipeline impact has been opportunities moving into later periods rather than deals altogether going away, with the largest expected impact to be in Q2 and Q3. It's also important to note we have seen improved prospect engagements since April. We have also seen healthy pipeline growth for FY'22 as opportunity shift from first half to both Q4 and into FY'22.Finally, we have adapted our messaging in areas of focus-based solution and industry, doubling down on the go-to-market motions that we are confident will yield the best returns in these times of uncertainty. We are in a competitive market but we feel very confident in our positioning and saw no meaningful changes to competitive dynamics in Q1. In addition, our discounting was in line with historical levels as most customers' negotiations centered around more flexible payment terms to help ease the initial upfront cash burden. We view our customer relations as long-term partnerships and we are willing to leverage our balance sheet where we think it makes sense. We strongly believe that this unprecedented environment only strengthens the importance of having a single cloud system to plan, execute, and analyze your business.I cannot tell you how many prospects I have spoken with over the last few months who have told me this environment has highlighted how ill-prepared their legacy ERP systems are for rapid change. At the same time, I have also spoken with many of our customers who have told me just how mission-critical Workday has been in helping their business respond to this crisis. And I have heard from many customers currently implementing, who are experiencing a faster, a more productive project on a fully remote basis.There are many potential outcomes that will determine what the pace of recovery will look like and we expect the environment will remain very fluid throughout FY'21. Yet, despite some near-term uncertainty, we are confident that as the recovery takes hold, we're incredibly well positioned to capture on the multi-decade opportunity that we see ahead of us.With that, I will turn it over to Robynne. -- Thanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite a challenging environment, we reported solid first quarter results, which we believe is a direct reflection of the mission-critical nature of our solution. I'm going to briefly recap our first quarter and provide updated guidance for FY'21 and then we'll open it up to your questions.We had our first ever $1 billion revenue quarter in Q1, with subscription revenue of $882 million, up 26% year-over-year and professional services revenue of $136 million, up 10%. Total revenue outside the US was up 30% to $256 million. Subscription revenue backlog was $8.19 billion at the end of the first quarter, growth of 20% year-over-year. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $5.52 billion, growth of 21%. In Q1, our retention rates continued to be strong with gross retention over 95% and net retention, which includes upselling at the time of renewal, over 100%. As Chano mentioned, our add-on business is growing rapidly and we see strong sales back into our customer base, both during and outside of the renewal process.Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $130 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 12.8%. To help support our employees during these unprecedented times, in April, we paid a one-time cash bonus equivalent to two weeks pay to all our non-executive employees. This added $79 million to our first quarter and full-year FY'21 expenses both GAAP and non-GAAP that was not contemplated in the guidance provided during our Q4 call. Excluding this one-time bonus payment, our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin would have been 20.6%, well above our guidance, driven by top line outperformance, lower spend on travel, some non-critical program delays and more measured hiring. Q1 operating cash flow was $264 million, growth of 26% year-over-year. During Q1, we successfully added and integrated approximately 150 net new employees, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to roughly 12,400.And lastly, in April, we closed a $1.5 billion credit facility, comprised of a term loan and a revolving line of credit, which we believe strengthens our financial position and provides us greater flexibility as we plan for the future. As of the end of Q1, $500 million of the term loan had been funded. Overall, we're pleased with our results and execution against a very challenging environment.And now I'll turn to guidance. When we provided our outlook in February, it was very early in the COVID-19 crisis and we could not yet reasonably predict or quantify the potential impact to our fiscal year. In the 90-day since then, we've started to see an effect on our business on several fronts, including new business bookings, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses and cash collections from customers. The updated guidance we are providing today takes into account these impacts based on what we have observed over the last few months. Significant near-term uncertainty still remains, however, so we are providing wider than usual guidance ranges to help take that into account. Built into our revised guidance is the expectation that the pace of recovery will be relatively slow with Q2 and Q3, being the most challenging periods, followed by a reasonable improvement in Q4.Before providing our updated outlook, I wanted to make a few high-level comments around our business model. First, we primarily serve a large and medium enterprise market and although even the largest companies are not immune to the current economic environment, we believe they're better positioned than SMBs to weather this downturn. Second, while our licensing model is based on the number of workers within our customer's organizations, we have measures in place that help reduce near-term volatility from employment changes. As an example, our contracts are typically only trued-up annually to account for increases and decreases in worker counts. In addition, our contracts have base minimums, which limit our downside and it is only upon contract renewal, which is typically every three to five years that our customers have the opportunity to reset these base levels.And finally, we are very strategic to our customers, which makes our products incredibly sticky. As a result, while we may see some moderation in retention rates in the near term, likely due to increased bankruptcies and reduction in base work accounts during renewals, we expect that our retention rates will remain high and we will continue to update you on this metric as we move through the year.With that as a backdrop, we are lowering our FY'21 subscription revenue estimate to be in the range of $3.67 billion to $3.69 billion, or 19% growth. We expect our Q2 subscription revenue to be $913 million to $915 million, or 21% growth. We now expect professional services revenue to be $500 million in fiscal '21 and $128 million in Q2. As always, our priority is to support our customers' successful deployment and drive the highest levels of customer satisfaction. In line with these goals, we expect a balanced approach in terms of partner and Workday primes to ensure our partner ecosystem continues to be healthy and active. For Q2, we expect subscription revenue backlog growth in the mid- to high-teens. Given the current uncertainty around net new business, renewal rates and potential changes to contract durations during the remainder of the year, we will only be providing Q2 backlog guidance at this time.Now, moving to margins. We estimate Q2 non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 19%. For the full-year, we now expect the non-GAAP operating margin of 16%, up from our prior view of 14.5%. This margin improvement reflects our expectation of lower operating expenses versus our original plan even as we continue to invest and position ourselves to emerge from this period as an even stronger Company. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margins by approximately 26 percentage points in the second quarter and 27 percentage points for the full year.Our FY'21 capital investment guidance, excluding owned real estate, is now $280 million, down from our prior view of $350 million, as several large leased real estate projects have been postponed. We currently do not expect to invest any further in owned real estate during FY'21.The FY'21 non-GAAP tax rate remains unchanged at 19%.We had strong operating cash flow in Q1, but we have received and continue to receive requests from some existing and new customers for flexible payment terms. As always, customer relationships and customer retention are a top priority for us. During this challenging time, we're committed to providing flexibility to those customers that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, so that we can emerge stronger together. Our ability to remain flexible in the area of cash is critical in supporting these goals, and we will, therefore, cease operating cash flow guidance for the remainder of this fiscal year.In closing, we are confident in the fundamental strength of our business model, the resiliency of our customer base, and in the long-term shift of HR and financial applications to the cloud. We plan to operate with agility, while continuing to drive innovation to support sustainable long-term growth.With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A process. Operator?Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. -- Thanks very much and I hope you all are doing well. I really wanted to ask Aneel, why you jinxed fell on the long drive contest on Sunday. But, I guess, I'll keep it to business for now. Chano, you mentioned that customers obviously deferring decisions, I don't think that's surprising to anybody. Is that just a matter of just business confidence and sort of managing budgets? And can you talk a little bit about whether or not that conversation is different if you're having an HCM discussion versus a Financials discussion or it's more -- it's pretty similar across both those product offerings? -- On the HCM and FINS is a good question, but I would say that so far we haven't seen one of these necessarily more or less impacted than the other by COVID. In both cases, there is significant ROI that we deliver to our customers and significant business benefits, but both of these are, as you know, very important systems and the drivers of the change vary by company and situation. So, it could be they need to have more agility or a burning platform or an executive change. And what we're seeing our data is that, no one area either HCM or FINS is necessarily more or less impacted in the near term by COVID.In terms of the overall -- sorry, go ahead, Kirk. -- Good. Please, you go. -- No, in terms of the overall, I think you asked about the pipeline move, if -- am I right? -- Correct, yes. Thank you. -- Yeah. Well, certainly, as we said on the prepared remarks, our pipeline has definitely moved around. And in some cases, deals push out a quarter or two, maybe in the large enterprise and really not significant or no changes in the medium enterprise. But I would say, we don't have enough data yet to really call these accurately at this point in time. Definitely this is something that my team is carefully monitoring. -- If I can just ask one quick follow-up, you mentioned the back to the base growth was really healthy this quarter and I was just curious, given the fact that some of your customers might be pushing back bigger decisions for now, are you able to sort of toggle the sales force to focus maybe more on those back-to-base opportunities within your existing customer base? It would seem that the hit rate on those might be a little bit higher until some of the uncertainty dies down. Thanks very much for taking the questions. -- Yeah. Thanks to you Kirk. As you know, we already did significant investments at the beginning of this year to prepare for -- to cover the demand of the back to the base because we have a happy customer base, a great subset with SKU and solutions. So, definitely that demand was already increasing. So, we felt ourselves very well prepared for it, and as we said, we had a good growth in that back to base customer in Q1, but we also had the same in Q4 as well. So, we feel prepared for that market motion. -- If I could just add one comment to Kirk's question. We did go through a similar environment with '08 -- in '08-'09 and we really focused in on a couple things. One was a quick payback for customers and rapid implementation cycles where we could get HR up and running in six months and Financials maybe in a little bit longer than that. And we're just dusting off that playbook and using it again to -- for the net new business. I think that's important to recognize now. It's very similar to '08-'09 from that perspective and there is a way through it. -- Thank you all.Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. -- Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And I hope everybody is safe and healthy out there. This is a question for I think either Chano or Aneel. One of the things that I get asked a lot by investors is the priority for core HCM and core Financials when we get to the other side of this COVID-19 crisis. Can you talk to us a little bit about sort of the conversations you're having with your customers on where they think sort of these HCM investments and Financials investments will fall on their kind of priority stack, if you will, once the spending opens up again, once those IT budgets start to get spent again? -- Well, I think first and foremost on the finance side, I think this crisis will be a catalyst for people switching from on-premise into the cloud for finance and we are already seeing the growth rates, but the growth rates are at healthy levels, but I've talked to lots of CIOs who said, I wish I had everything in the cloud right now. I'm struggling with my on-premise both because of the labor required and people required to be on-site and because of systems are really not very agile are flexible. And we see our customers coming up with new reports, with new work streams, all these things that they're able to do in Workday. And so, I think it's going to be a high priority on the finance side.On HR, HR is going to continue to be healthy. I think what we're going to see is a growing emphasis on the area of skills, the skills cloud, learning, talent marketplace, all the areas where we're going to have over 30 million people unemployed, we've got to get these folks back to work and we got to get them the right skills and I think a lot of companies are going to be working probably alongside some of the states and local governments to figure out how to get these folks back to work and that will be right up our sweet spot.And Chano, you want to add anything? -- No. -- And then plus one follow-up for Robynne. First of all, super cool of you guys to give that bonus to all the employees, I'll hook you up with the Morgan Stanley CFO and maybe you guys could have a chat. And -- but nonetheless, the full-year operating margin is still come up versus your prior expectations, definitely from what we had in our model. How should we think about like -- and it makes a lot of sense, right? There is no travel going on and a lot of events are coming out of the equation. How should we think about the durability of that margin gain, of that 60%, if you will, as we move our models forward into FY'22, is that new base and then it's going to grow from there or is this more a temporal step-up? -- Yeah. That's a great question, Keith, and it's -- given all the unknowns that we're facing right now, it's really hard for us to look into FY'22 at this time and we certainly do plan, as we start to see recovery, particularly in Q4 hopefully, that we will continue to invest in the business. So, I'm not sure that this is a new baseline but we certainly believe that we are showing the value of our business model and how it can leverage as we scale. But we still have a lot of important work to do and we've got a long-term very massive opportunity ahead of us, so we will continue to invest. -- Got it. Excellent. Thank you, guys.Our next questions come from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. -- Great. Thank you so much for taking the question and hope you and your families are all doing well. I just had two. I was wondering if you could talk to us about how your salespeople and your partners are kind of dealing with lead-gen in this environment, kind of how they adopted if there is some stuff you could share with us there on how they might being creative on that front?And then, Robynne, I know this isn't something that you normally comment on any more, but just given the environment and your comments about 2Q and 3Q, being probably the more challenging quarters that you're going to face, any high-level comments even about how to think about unearned revenue trends for the July quarter? Thank you. -- Yeah. Heather, so I think we definitely expect that unearned will lag behind our backlog growth, right? And we'll continue to do that. And part of that has to do with the fact that, as Chano and I both mentioned, we're trying to be more flexible on cash, particularly for customers that have been most impacted, and Chano mentioned that a lot of his new customer negotiations, really that's what they're pushing on. And so, we really want to use our balance sheet to help them out during this time. And so, as you know, that will impact the billings and unearned, as well as the cash flow, and you should expect to see that throughout the rest of this year. The good news is, that actually doesn't impact our revenue recognition profile. And so, we think it's a good investment and that flexibility has and we believe will continue to allow us to maintain our discounting levels. -- Heather, in terms of the -- and thanks for your question and I hope you're doing well, and keeping healthy too. In terms of your question on demand gen, our sales team obviously had to pivot during the course of Q1 to a fully virtual environment. But the reality is that, we have always had a pretty significant portion of our sales cycle that virtually anyhow, particularly the pre-sales motion and the demoing of our software. And so, what has changed is that, we have moved the entire process virtually.In terms of what we adapted, as I said on my -- some of my remarks, we adapted our messaging and areas of focus by solution and industry. And we clearly focused more on double down from those go-to-market motions that we have more confidence that would yield best returns during these times. And, obviously, you can think focus on more in some of the surging industries, or some solutions like it could be Planning or Prism, Learning or Scout, some of the motions that we think will produce better results. -- Great. Thank you.Our next questions come from the line of Mark Murphy of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions. -- Yes, thank you. I'll add my congrats. I am interested in how you would characterize the environment so far in the month of May just in terms of generating pipeline and booking new business? Should we think of that as being kind of a night and day difference versus late March, early April? Or is it something you'd call directionally better, but it will still kind of take some time to get back to the original plan? So I'm just trying to understand if you think it's improving or degrading kind of between late March and the month of May. -- Chano? -- Hey, Mark, it's early days but we are still below our normal engagement levels and also we do all our normal pipeline builds. But there has been a significant uptake in engagement and positive sentiment relative to, I would say, four weeks ago. So, much of our activity, as I said, is now focusing a set of industries where we're seeing the greatest near-term demand but we also continue dialogue in verticals that are more impacted by COVID to ensure that we're well positioned as we emerge from this environment, Mark. -- Okay. And then, as a follow-up, Robynne, I'd say it's understandable that you are withdrawing the subscription backlog guidance in the back half. But that said, just considering that you still landed essentially within the original Q1 guidance for subscription backlog, I think surprisingly and during a real chaotic period of time. Do you see high odds that that backlog growth is going to end up, say, materially below this type of glide path that you're on? Or is the confidence a little better than that, but it's just kind of such a wide range of potential outcomes at this point that it's hard to know? -- Yeah. Mark, it's a pretty wide range. Let me look... -- Well, let me start with this. I think what everybody needs to recognize is that, no one knows how it's going to play out over the next couple quarters. We don't know if there's going to be another outbreak. And so, everything that we are saying is our best information at this point in time, Keith. I mean, if you know how it's going to play out, please let me know.So, with that, Robynne, jump in, but I think that has to be the backdrop on everything right now. -- Yeah, that's right. And as you know, the backlog is tied to net new, it's also tied to renewals and then it's tied to duration. And we really haven't seen -- we don't have enough data yet to predict those and how that could play out over the back half of the year, because we just have far less visibility. -- Sorry, I didn't realize that was Mark. Sorry, Mark. -- Yeah. Thank you, Aneel. You can call me Keith, it's fine. -- I called you Keith, I hope you are well. -- Take care. You too.Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. -- Hey, thank you very much. I'm curious that the net new ACV growth of 50% within your base. How does that compare to recent quarters and how sustainable is this? And also curious what kinds of products are you having the biggest hit rate with -- within the installed base? Thank you so much. -- Well, I'll let Chano answer the first part. I would say that, it's a lot of the -- not surprisingly the customers that are adding are adding on to core HR and core finance. In this environment and Tom can comment on it, both Planning and Scout RFP have been very strong solutions. People are really struggling with the legacy planning tools. And, I mean, I even look at Workday, how many plans we generated in the last couple months because no one knows how this is all going to shake out.And with Scout RFP, it's a quick implementation, you can get in control of your spend in a very global and unified way, and that's another thing that's been doing well. But maybe I'll let Tom comment and then Chano comment. -- Yeah. Thanks, Aneel. That's right. What we've seen is a real uptick in interest in planning. Companies are running, as you would expect, significantly more scenarios, as Aneel said. I think there was a period of time in March, we saw about a 30x increase in the terms of the number of scenarios that our customers are running. So it's not surprising. So I think the importance of planning, and particularly cloud-based planning solutions, where the whole team can be connected holistically, has resonated with customers. We've seen tremendous interest in Workforce Planning. Everybody is thinking through what the next-generation workforce looks like. There's obviously fundamental changes being driven to both location and the way we work, and that requires a focus on Workforce Planning.And then, as Aneel mentioned, I think we've also seen a lot of interest in our sourcing products, because in periods like this, companies are extremely focused on ways that we can save money. As Chano mentioned in the script, we had the -- we saw the largest deal ever in Scout's history this quarter. So I think there's a lot of resonance with customers, and we're seeing that uptake. Chano? -- Just listening to you Tom, it sounds like that or maybe this is the case or maybe it's not the case. The shift to cloud-based financials could accelerate post-COVID. Is that right or too optimistic? -- Well, I think generally -- and there has been a lot written about this period of time accelerating trends that were already in place. And certainly, the trend toward cloud-based applications and the need to -- and how effective it is during a period of time like this where people have to work remotely. As Chano and others have stated, there is uncertainty in the short term in terms of what the uptick in terms of adoption of enterprise applications will be in the short term. But there is no question in the intermediate and longer terms that there will be tailwinds toward the adoption of cloud-based planning and cloud-based applications more generally. Chano? -- Thank you, Tom. Kash, we've seen the 50%-plus new ACV growth in the back-to-base motion in Q4 and in Q1. That's the data we have disclosed so far. And I think this is an outcome of A, we having a happy customer base and certainly, the investments we've done on the go-to-market motion to cover that our customer base and as well, of course, the increase on broader solutions set and deeper one that solution offering that we have today at Workday.Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions. -- Thank you and good afternoon. I wanted to follow-up on the Microsoft relationship. I know you guys first announced the global partnership back in the summer of 2016. So, my question here. What -- how is the Microsoft relationship evolved over the last three-plus years and maybe the new scope of what you're working with them on today? -- So, we've had a great partnership with Microsoft for a long time, really around Office 365 and where we play around teams and this just builds on that. Adding Azure into the mix right now just for Adaptive, but that's -- it's also the first time that Microsoft has become a Workday customer, although LinkedIn has been a Workday customer for quite some time. So, it's just adding -- it's just the natural progression of a partnership. I think Microsoft is a great company, Satya is a great CEO, we'd like to do more with them. -- Awesome. And then just a quick follow-up relative to the concessions that you're giving some of the most heavily impacted customers. I know, Robynne, you talked about the base minimum not really being up for negotiation every three to five years. But I just wondering, are you proactively looking to kind of work with these customers that are impacted, or is it something where it's non-negotiable and you really don't really see a change there until that is up for renewal. -- Yeah. Brent, I mean, we're taking all of our customer requests on a one-by-one basis, case-by-case. But really the vast majority of requests we're getting are long payment deferrals, not renegotiating contracts but just deferring payments. So, we have not really run into an issue with customers trying to renegotiate base levels at this time, although certainly that could be the case for some that are most impacted by this. -- Got it. Makes sense. Thank you.Our next questions come from the line of David Hynes of Canaccord. Please proceed with your questions. -- Hey, thanks very much guys. Congrats on the results. Maybe I'll take the other partnership question. Aneel, can you talk a little bit about -- more about Work.com? What you're doing with Salesforce? What it could mean for Workday's business and maybe how you see that opportunity evolving over time? Can you guys hear me? -- Sorry. Mark has been driving the contact management piece for some time around contact tracing. And we actually had started that thinking and that work all the way back to SARS. So -- and the Salesforce application at the end of the day is a content management -- sorry, contact management application. So, it's really well suited to that. Mark has the same goal, and Salesforce has the same goal that we do. We want to enable our customers to get their people back to work safely. And so, what we're doing is, we have all the data about employees, locations, what they're learning in terms of the learning content, and Salesforce has a whole set of things with Work.com around contact tracing, track and skills, shifts. And we're just making sure that the two technologies are completely synced so customers don't have to reconcile between the two. And so, if you're a joint customer, hopefully, this solution is really going to help you manage your way back into the office. And I think, as you all of you know on the phone, I mean, Salesforce has been one of our best partners, if not, our best partner, almost since the day we started Workday. -- Sure. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe a follow-up for Robynne. So, a few folks have hit on back to the base strength in the Q&A. And I just want to tie that into net revenue retention. Gross retention has always been really strong, right, at 95%. But on the net side, is the consistent commentary about north of 100% just out of practice, or are you actually seeing improvement there? And, I guess, could you get any more granular on a number for net revenue retention? -- Yeah. The way we actually measure net revenue is we only count add-on sales at the renewal point. And so, now that we're really focused more on selling back into the base and that's happening during renewal cycles, but it's happening a lot more than ever outside of renewal cycles and that's not captured in the net retention rate. So, I think it's -- we're actually looking at a better way to measure it now that we're doing so many add-ons outside of renewals and we'll probably make a change there over the coming quarters. But for now, I would just think of it as, as long as the way we are calculating, it remains over 100%, that's great news. And then on top of that, we're selling a lot more into the base outside of those renewal cycles. -- Right. Okay. That makes a lot more sense. Thanks, guys. -- DJ, I'm going to ask Pete Schlampp, our Head of Applications to weigh in on the Salesforce partnership, too. He's closer to what we're actually doing from a product perspective. Pete? -- Sure. That'd be great. -- Yeah. Thanks, Aneel. Good question, David. As I think about Salesforce and Workday, Salesforce has all this rich information about the workplace, and Workday has... -- Pete, your -- I think your volume is on -- not on. -- Better? -- Got you. -- But you need to mute Zoom. -- Thank you. Got it. So, as I think of the two, Salesforce has the data about the workplace and Workday has the data about the workforce. And some of the most rich data that we have is, data about skills. And so, as companies are going through these big transformations that are happening with workers, with, all of a sudden, some demands in certain areas that they didn't have before and vice versa, being able to make those transitions quickly and use that skill data is so essential. So, when we think about getting companies back to the workplace safely, securely and their people back safely and securely, it's about the data and bringing these two datasets together, whether that's in Salesforce's, in their Command Center, in the Work.com Command Center, or whether it's within the Workday application set itself. And that's how we're going to really start things off is with the data integration and then develop more applications as we go forward. -- Okay. Got it. Makes sense. Thanks for all the color.We have time for two more questioners. The next question comes from the line of Scott Berg of Needham & Company. Please proceed with your questions. -- Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I only have one here in essence of time. Aneel or maybe Chano, or probably, Aneel, just wanted to see if you had some additional comments on Workday Extend now that it's finally available in GA? Trying to understand the revenue model of it going forward, kind of, how has it evolved today versus the initial announcement two years ago? And do you envision customers or other companies building commercial apps that they could actually sell off of it, like what happens on Force.com? -- Well, I'll take a quick crack, then I'm going to send it over to Pete. And hopefully, Pete gets his technology right this time. -- Sure. -- Teasing Pete. So, Workday Extend is really focused on extensibility for our customers. And we're not looking to open up an ISV community to build commercial applications. Our customers are getting great value from Extend. I mean, we've had Extend in limited general availability for several quarters. And so, we really got a good handle on the used cases. And now, what we're seeing customers doing is building, I call it, more mini apps or an extensions. They've done a lot of it around COVID-19, whether it's to track essential workers, to track -- one of our customers is tracking cases of COVID around the globe for manufacturing plants. So, it's really whatever that our customers wants to do and extend our business model, but definitely not ISVs. And Pete, what else should we add to that? -- Thanks, Aneel. You think I have the mute thing figured out here after working from home for the last two months. The -- really I think the success we've had so far I'd like to highlight, 50 -- over 50 customers using it, over 90 different solutions built on the platform already, so we're going into this GA period with a lot of existing momentum. As we think about the products, we think about really extending the entire use -- the entire surface of the Workday platform, all the applications that we have in Workday and then enabling our customers to extend those. And so, we continue to open up new surface areas. And I guess, that gives the different possibilities that customers can develop on top of the funnel. -- And, I guess, just to come back to the revenue question or the bookings question, I still wouldn't expect much for fiscal year '21, but I do think it can be a decent contributor in fiscal year '22 and beyond, and a high growth contributor. -- Excellent. That's all I have. Thanks for taking the question.Our next questions come from the line of Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions. -- Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chano, I had a follow-up question. I think it was to Heather's about the marketing funnel on the lead generation. You commented on what the timing could be for these sales cycles. But can you shed light on what you are seeing in terms of the values? The deal value is holding up at a similar rate as you've seen in the past as they are progressing through the funnel toward closing. Thanks. -- Thank you for your question, Brian. I would say, it's very early days. And we've seen no shift of significance to comment on. Certainly, when I monitor the pipeline coming in for either, I know, later on to this year or new pipeline coming in from FY'22. At this point in time, we have been -- and we've managed as well to qualify some significant or large deals in terms of value, even on the environment we are into. Of course, then we need to be able to progress those deals and finally closing, but nothing to highlight in terms of change on those deals either being consider that they are shrinking or are they having less duration or any kind of things like those, not really. We need more -- definitely a bigger trend, and more data points during the rest of Q2 and Q3. But right now, that's what I can share, Brian. -- Thank you very much.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Out of  with a market capitalization of more than $10 billion, Wayfair stock has the 10th-best performance, up 74.9% year to date.\u00a0\tSource: Shutterstock\n\tIf you were fortunate enough to buy Wayfair stock near its 52-week low of $21.70, which it hit on March 19, you\u2019re sitting on a paper profit of more than 650% over two months. On an annualized basis, that\u2019s near 4,000%.\u00a0Now, I don\u2019t want to sound like a killjoy, but some experts believe the markets are . Wayfair, which is notorious for losing money, has been able to generate significant revenue during the novel coronavirus as people working from home look to create more comfortable cocoons.\u00a0The good times won\u2019t last. When the world gets back to normal in 12 to 24 months, Wayfair will have to rev up its ad spending once again, pushing its pathway to profitability farther down the road.\u00a0But forget about that for a moment and consider the idea that Wayfair\u2019s momentum can\u2019t possibly remain this hot. If it were profitable, or at least much closer to profitability, I might suggest holding tight with cash in hand to buy more should it see a correction.\u00a0Alas, that\u2019s not the case for Wayfair, despite its efforts in 2020 to achieve operational efficiency through job cuts, more focused ad spending, etc.\u00a0If you\u2019re wise enough to take profits, you might consider these three stocks trading around the same price as Wayfair.\u00a0Trading $10 higher than Wayfair as I write this, Workday (NASDAQ:) seems to me to be a company that will gain permanent traction post-Covid-19. In April, Workday\u2019s stock gained 18% on positive analyst comments combined with the human capital management software company securing $1.5 billion in additional liquidity to deal with any pandemic-related issues that might surface.\u00a0At the end of February, it announced its fourth-quarter results that included  for the year to $3.63 billion, 85% of which were subscription revenues, and recurring in nature. On the bottom line, it lost $480.7 million on a GAAP basis and earned $463.4 million on a non-GAAP basis.\u00a0Importantly, it hadn\u2019t seen any real impact on sales due to Covid-19. The software provider\u2019s first quarter might show otherwise.\u00a0Long term, I think Workday\u2019s business is far more resilient to economic pain than Wayfair\u2019s because companies will always need this kind of software. Furniture, to a certain extent, is a discretionary purchase.\u00a0Strategic Education (NASDAQ:), the company behind Strayer University and Capella University, provides post-secondary opportunities for adult students. In its first-quarter report announced April 29, the company delivered strong results, with sales up 7.6% to $265.3 million, while income from operations increased 16.6% to $44.0 million.\u00a0Despite the fact Strategic Education conducts more than , the company reacted quickly to Covid-19, including shifting all on-ground courses to an online format. The company expects an increase in bad debt over the next three or four quarters as students struggle financially during the pandemic. It has a strong financial position \u2013 $500 million in cash at the end of March and $250 million in undrawn credit \u2013 and will not seek financial aid from the federal government or other government entities.\u00a0STRA stock continues to outperform both its educational peers and the Morningstar US Market Index over the short and long term \u2013 it has a year to date total return of 7.1% along with an annualized total return of 30.3% \u2013 providing Wayfair sellers with an excellent place to put their fortuitous profits.\u00a0Icon PLC (NASDAQ:) provides outsourced development and commercialization services to pharmaceutical, biotech, medical device and public health organizations. Interestingly, despite the pandemic putting a spotlight on biotech research and development, its stock has a total return year to date of -2.6%.\u00a0However, over the past five years, it has an annualized total return of 20.2%, 350 basis points higher than its diagnostics and research peers.\u00a0 in 1990 in Dublin, it has grown to more than 15,000 employees at 98 locations in 40 countries.\u00a0\u00a0In April, Icon announced its first-quarter 2020 results. They included a 6.5% increase in sales, excluding currency, while growing earnings per share by 4.3%. Despite the fact it expects Covid-19 to affect its business throughout the remainder of 2020, it finished the first quarter with a record backlog of $8.7 billion.\u00a0Given it will likely continue to face headwinds over the next two to three quarters, there\u2019s a good possibility you\u2019ll be able to buy its stock for less than $166 where it currently trades.\u00a0\u00a0Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

To those brave men and women, thank you for your service.Unofficially the beginning of summer, in this three-day weekend investors should also thank the Fed and the U.S. Treasury. While we\u2019re not yet completely out of the woods regarding the pandemic, the fact that the stock market has rebounded some 35% from the March lows is an incredible accomplishment. All told, stocks are holding up well amid all of the uncertainty. But as a market participant, a capitalist and proponent of growth, \u201cholding up well\u201d or hoping for \u201cless bad results\u201d is a mindset I don\u2019t want to get used to. This was nonetheless the case on Friday.Stocks held up pretty well, shrugging off not only increased tensions between the U.S. and China, but also amid the ongoing uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery from the coronavirus. Investors are still trying to decide what headlines are more important.\"The biggest thing out there today is the Hong Kong/China saber rattling,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \"We still think COVID-19 concerns are in the driver's seat, but we could see U.S.-China relations move back into the front seat.\u201dOn Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u00a0fell 8.96 points, or less than 0.1%, to end the session at at 24,465.16. The S&P 500 index\u00a0closed 6.94 points higher, or 0.2%, at close at 2,955.45, while the Nasdaq Composite\u00a0added 0.4% to finish the week at 9,324.59, a gain of 39.71 points. Optimism that the impact of coronavirus on corporate earnings will be relatively short-lived helped averages to post strong weekly gains. For the week, the Dow rose 3.3%, the S&P 500 advanced 3.2% and the Nasdaq rose 3.4%.\u00a0Investors are encouraged by actions taken by state leaders to allow businesses to reopen. As it stands, all 50 states are engaged in some stage of business-restarting plans. In the process, whether curbside service, long lines, or indefinite remote work, investors are starting to come to terms with what the \u201cnew normal\u201d may look like. That, combined with less volatility has renewed confidence in the market. Will this sentiment continue this week? Here are the names to keep an eye on.Wall Street expects Box to earn 5 cents per share on revenue of $182.08 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the loss came to 3 cents per share on revenue of $162.97 million.What to watch: Although the company has quickly emerged as leader in the highly competitive cloud content management market segment, the market hasn\u2019t fully bought into the long-term growth story. But it seems sentiment is starting to change. Box shares have risen 22% over the past thirty days, besting the 5.5% rise of the S&P 500 during that span. The company is benefitting from the rapid shift of work-from-home. Box\u2019s recently-launched Box Shield and Box Relay is a strong catalyst to drive growth not only through the company\u2019s current customer base, but also could support margin expansion via price increases. The company has a lot to prove on Wednesday sustain the recent performance of the stock.Wall Street expects Workday to earn 49 cents per share on revenue of $1.01 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 43 cents per share on revenue of $825.05 million.What to watch: Software stocks have been a key driver of the market\u2019s strong rebound from the March lows, but Workday has underperformed during that span. While WDAY stock is up about 2% year to date, it trails the likes of Microsoft (), Salesforce and Adobe (). The company\u2019s extensive collection of cloud-based solutions such as accounting, financial reporting, analytics, compensation, among others, gives it a pathway to multiple years of growth as businesses work to adjust to a remote-work environment. However, for the shares to keep rising, Workday\u2019s guidance and its billings forecast will be the metrics to keep an eye on.Wall Street expects Costco to earn $1.83 per share on revenue of $36.58 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.89 per share on revenue of $34.74 billion.What to watch: Expectations are high heading into Costco\u2019s earnings report as many analysts project market share gains for the nation\u2019s largest warehouse retailer. Notably, this is despite weak consumer data, showing a 16% decline in retail sales. Costco\u2019s \u201cbuy in bulk\u201d business profile has made it a standout during the pandemic as consumers rushed to stockpile on household products such as toilet paper. Its membership business model continues to receive praise. Not only is Costco still finding ways not to grow its membership total, the company also getting its club members to spend more. But can this continue with so many Americans out of work?Wall Street expects Salesforce to earn 70 cents per share on revenue of $4.85 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 93 cents per share on revenue of $3.74 billion.What to watch: Shares of Salesforce have risen some 16% over the past month, besting gate 5.5% rise of the S&P 500 index. The company\u2019s SaaS business model and its customer relationship management services are a must-have for companies looking to add capabilities such as sales, marketing, e-commerce and analytics to grow their businesses. However, the company's acquisition-led growth is seen as less sustainable amid the pandemic. That, combined with softer IT spending environment and the fact that corporations are shifting (or postponing) IT projects, there are concerns that Salesforce will struggle to reach its own revenue target.Wall Street expects Zscaler to earn 2 cents per share on revenue of $106.11 million. This compares to the previous quarter when earnings came to 5 cents per share on revenue of $79.13 million.\u00a0What to watch: Zscaler has grown to become the biggest provider of cloud-based web security gateway on the market. The company\u2019s cloud platform enables customers to route data traffic to external data centers where Zscaler houses its software tools. But the cybersecurity specialist has grown even more popular amid the pandemic. The shift to work-from-home has driven the demand for increased cloud-based security. With the stock surging some 70% from the March low, expectations are high. To allay sales execution risks, analysts will want to know how the company plans to maintain its robust growth if IT\u00a0projects are postponed or canceled.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["1/VACCINE RACEU.S. President Donald Trump has put his faith in anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to ward off COVID-19, but governments and investors are focusing on a vaccine.

The Software-as-a-Service giant saw its shares tumble from $195 to $115 during the March crash, but has rallied back above $170 now. Investors have shrugged off a slowdown in revenues at many internet companies \u2014 in particular ones exposed to advertising \u2014 by instead focusing on how the stay-at-home orders will speed the transition toward a digital-first economy.Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com\n\tSpecifically, Salesforce is likely to see a short-term slowdown in billings thanks to the virus. But the crisis may force a lot of previously offline companies to start using digital software to manage their sales channels; Salesforce could end up gaining from this in the long-term.In any case, traders are wondering what will happen next, as Salesforce is set to report earnings next week. As of last quarter, it appeared Salesforce was experiencing accelerating growth. We can say that because while Salesforce grew revenues 29% for the full year, it saw revenues spike 35% higher last quarter. It was on an upward trajectory until the virus hit.Now, however, several analysts have cut estimates for Salesforce, and other related companies such as  (NASDAQ:) on the expectation of a significant slowdown in revenue growth. Earnings reports from firms such as\u00a0 (NYSE:) have shown weakness in areas that could filter through to Salesforce as well. All in all, traders probably shouldn\u2019t expect a fantastic quarter, nor great guidance for the rest of the year either. But the market seems willing to discount 2020 and look to the future.There has been some concern about Salesforce\u2019s outlook in the near future. Surely with the economy in a slowdown, people will need less sales software, right? However, the good news is that Salesforce\u2019s core functionality can be used for other tracking and monitoring applications outside of the sales function.For example, Salesforce has its Salesforce Cares program, specifically tailored to helping companies manage health and human resources during the Covid-19 crisis. As of April 30, more than  had signed up for Salesforce Cares. Clients include tele-health firms, medical clinics, apartment property managers and insurance benefits providers among others. This shows the wide range of applications that Salesforce can support beyond its traditional core capabilities.If you look at Salesforce on a pure earnings basis, the stock usually tends to look expensive. Next year, for example, consensus estimates have Salesforce earning just shy of $4 per share. That would put the stock at more than 40x forward earnings. However, keep in mind that Salesforce tends to plow its earnings back into the business via marketing spend. In doing so, it gives up accounting profits now in return for far larger revenues and cash flows in the future.Thus, the most reliable way to judge Salesforce\u2019s stock is by its price-to-sales ratio. Coming out of the financial crisis, CRM stock sold for just 4x sales \u2014 a veritable bargain. It shot up to 11x revenues in 2011-12, and became somewhat overpriced for a time.Since 2013, however, the stock has settled into a remarkably consistent range, with Salesforce almost always being worth between 7x and 9x sales. Any dips to 7x or below have been strong buying opportunities. Meanwhile, when it has gotten up above 9x \u2014 such as late last year \u2014 it was a good time to take some profits. The stock is now selling at 8.5x sales, which puts it within the normal range; a correction that knocked the stock down 10% from here would move it toward a compelling buying point. But the current price isn\u2019t half bad, either.In one sense, Salesforce\u2019s short-term trading fate will ride with the broader cloud and SaaS stocks. Salesforce is one of the big players in the sector, and its stock is approaching key resistance levels. Whether or not it surges to new heights next week will have as much to do with tech stock sentiment as anything else.That said, Salesforce could surprise some investors with this next earnings report. Sure, there\u2019s probably going to be a slowdown in growth from their existing customers. And margins may suffer in the short-run. Salesforce is run with long-term objectives in mind; CEO Marc Benioff promised  any significant number of workers during the acute phase of this crisis, for example, which is great for long-term loyalty but could have an effect on margins in the short-term.However, if you own Salesforce as a long-term investment, part of what you\u2019ve signed up for is maximizing future value rather than shooting for immediate profits. So don\u2019t worry about this one earnings report too much. That said, it could come in with more positive news than you expect. That\u2019s especially true when you consider all that\u2019s going on with Salesforce\u2019s efforts in fostering more client relationships in telemedicine and other adjacent lines of business. Salesforce is one of the core blue chip companies within the cloud software universe. As such, CRM stock represents a decent value heading into earnings.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $155.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $145.80 (before broker commissions).

The enterprise software provider's share price may also have gotten a boost after the company secured a new loan and received favorable coverage from analysts.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Workday published a filing with the SEC on April 6, reporting that the company had entered into an agreement on April 2 to secure a principal long-term loan in the amount $750 million and a $750 million revolving credit facility. The terms of the agreement state that the revolving loan may be borrowed, repaid, and reborrowed until April 2, 2025.Needham analyst Scott Berg maintained a \"buy\" rating on Workday in a note published on April 13, but he lowered his 52-week price target on the stock from $250 to $175. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss published a note on Workday on April 14, upgrading his rating on the stock from \"equal weight\" to \"overweight\" and raising his price target from $165 to $170.However, positive coverage wasn't unanimous at major firms last month. Cowen analyst\u00a0J. Derrick Wood cut his rating on the stock from \"outperform\" to \"market perform\" in a note published April 24, citing the possibility that economic uncertainty and businesses making budget cuts in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic could translate to reduced sales momentum for the enterprise software company.\u00a0When Workday reported its fourth quarter results on Feb. 27, it laid out a target for first quarter subscription revenue between $873 million and $875 million -- representing 24.7% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the target.

The company\u2019s mission is  But is Knightscope a business you can invest in?Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\tThe company is actually raising capital through an online crowdfunding platform, called  The goal is to raise $10.3 million.Note that Knightscope has already raised $46.6 million from prior rounds of financing, such as from family offices and retail investors. So let\u2019s get a backgrounder on the company and its prospects:Knightscope\u2019s bots are known as Autonomous Data Machines, or ADMs. These machines can be both for indoor and outdoor environments to patrol for security issues. There is also the Knightscope Security Operations Center (KSOC), which is a cloud platform that allows for remote access and management of the ADMS.There are different versions of these ADMs, which range in height from four to five feet and weigh anywhere from 150 to 398 pounds. They also travel autonomously \u2013 within in a geo-fenced area \u2013 and can avoid running into people, vehicles and other obstructions. This is done by using lasers, wheel encoders and other technologies.Currently, Knightscope is working on its next-generation version: . It actually looks like a mini  (NASDAQ:)! The K7 also will weigh 770 pounds and should work well in settings like wind farms, large corporate campuses, solar farms and power utility substations.A key benefit of Knightscope\u2019s ADM system is data collection. Consider it can gather one to two terabytes per week. Then again, there is 360-degree HD video and live-streaming, as well as other capabilities like license plate recognition and thermal imaging (which is based on temperature, such as to detect fires).In , the company provides a case study via the Huntington Park police department in California. A year after adopting the K5 bot, the number of calls for service dropped by 10% and the number of crime reports plunged by 46%.No doubt, the security market is massive. In the US, there are more than 8,000 private security firms and close to 18,000 law enforcement agencies. According to Knightscope\u2019s own analysis, the annual spending on security is about $500 billion.To capitalize on this, the company has adopted a unique business model:\u00a0 Machine-as-a-Service (\u201cMaaS\u201d). Yes, it\u2019s similar to how cloud companies sell their software, such as  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:). In other words, Knightscope\u2019s charges recurring fees for its ADMs, with the monthly revenues averaging from $4,200 to $8,400.As for the company\u2019s finances, the latest SEC filing only has numbers for 2017 to 2018. During this period, . However, the losses were substantial. They came to $12.4 million in 2017 and $13.4 million in 2018.All in all, it seems reasonable that bots will increasingly become more important in the security market. The AI technology is getting much more sophisticated and the hardware components are getting cheaper. Knightscope also has the benefit of much experience with its own systems, which have logged over 700,000 operating hours in 15 states.Regarding the senior executive team, it is seasoned. The CEO, William Santana Li, has worked as an executive at  (NYSE:) and founded GreenLeaf, which is now a part of  (NASDAQ:). Then there is Aaron Lehnhardt, who serves as the chief design officer. He has more than two decades of experience in sophisticated industrial design.But of course, when it comes to early-stage investments, there are many risks. Despite the benefits of ADMs, there continues to be skepticism about the technology. This is certainly the case with anything that is new. What\u2019s more, there are heavy costs because of the construction materials and equipment.Thus, it is important to review the investor materials before making a decision.As for the deal StartEngine, Knightscope has raised $5.7 million at $8 a share.

Just when it looked like the market\u2019s losing streak was set to continue, several tech names stepped up to the plate and led Wall Street to a small victory this week. As investors praise the efforts to reopen many major economies, U.S. stocks and oil prices ticked up.Does all of this mean market watchers should start snapping up tech stocks immediately? Not necessarily. Wall Street pros remind investors that while the industry does in fact house names with strong long-term growth narratives, not all tech stocks are bound for greatness.This is the stance taken by Rosenblatt analyst . The five-star analyst recently kicked off his coverage of two major tech players by putting Sell ratings on each, noting he isn\u2019t convinced that either stock will take off on an upward growth trajectory even after IT spending resumes.Bearing this in mind, we used  to see whether or not the rest of the Street agrees with Kim. Here\u2019s what we found out.Salesforce is the leading player when it comes to customer relationship management (CRM) software, with it enjoying a de facto enterprise standard status in the market. However, the Rosenblatt Securities analyst points out that this has actually created a significant problem for the tech company.Kim argues that given CRM\u2019s standing in the market, there has been a growing number of large enterprise standardization deals. As a result, the number of customers with $1 million-plus annual recurring revenue (ARR) has increased by 2.3x since full year 2016. Not to mention revenue from $1 million-plus ARR contracts achieved a CAGR of 30% over the past four years, and now these customers represent about two-thirds of the business. This in turn has helped fuel CRM\u2019s impressive annual revenue organic growth track record of 20%-plus.That being said, after conducting industry checks, Kim found that for larger organizations, the need for large scale business application deployment is declining. \u201cHence, we believe that when the enterprise IT spending environment returns, the pace of large-scale business application deployments is likely to lag other initiatives with higher priority...As a result, we are wary that the company may not be able to achieve 20% organic revenue growth due to possible weakness in its large deal activity,\u201d he stated.On top of this, Kim warns that the company could experience some disruptions with co-CEO Keith Block\u2019s exit, highlighting the fact that some key sales executives could leave with him. He added, \u201cThis possibility could impact its large deal execution since many of them were instrumental in building and scaling a sales organization that could close large strategic deals.\u201d Calculating its organic growth rate has also been challenging as salesforce.com (SFDC) has been acquisitive over the last few years.Kim concluded, \u201cWe believe the stock already fully reflects the company's de facto standard status in the market and its ability to leverage its large installed base.\u201dIt should come as no surprise, then, that Kim joined the CRM bears. He initiated coverage by putting a Sell rating and $120 price target on the stock. Should this target be met, a twelve-month loss of 26% could be in store. (To watch Kim\u2019s track record, )Based on the word of the Street, Kim seems to be the sole bear running loose here. Salesforce is one of Wall Street's favorite stocks, considering TipRanks shows a bullish vote from 27 analysts polled in the last 3 months. With a potential upside of 21%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $197.64. ()Known for being one of the dominant SaaS vendors in the industry, Workday has executed well over the last few years. However, past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future results.Kim believes this is true for Workday, telling clients he is cautious when it comes to the company\u2019s long-term growth prospects. The analyst points out that over the last two years, WDAY\u2019s subscription revenue growth rate has slowed from 36% in full year 2018 to 29% in full year 2020. In addition, its billings growth saw a material deceleration over the previous year, from 32% in full year 2019 to 23% in full year 2020.Expounding on these declines, Kim wrote, \u201cWe believe this declining trend reflects the overall slowdown in its core human capital management (HCM) business as the law of large numbers starts to catch up and also its core HCM market is entering the saturation point (about 65% of Fortune 500 has replaced their HCM system). Our industry checks prior to COVID-19 in late January indicated that the pace of large-scale business deployment, including large HCM initiatives, was likely to slow meaningfully this year, reflecting that they have become a lower priority vs. previous years.\u201dSo, what are the implications? Kim thinks that a rebound in enterprise IT spending still won\u2019t be enough to spur an acceleration in large scale business deployments like HCM. This means that the declining growth rate in its HCM segment could slow at an even faster pace. A tangible slowdown in HCM could also impact the company\u2019s overall subscription growth rate. As a result, Kim says there\u2019s a risk that both WDAY\u2019s subscription and billings growth could drop well below the 20% level in the medium-term.It should also be noted that WDAY\u2019s growth is dependent upon the execution of multiple growth opportunities including international market expansion, medium-sized enterprise market segment, add-on products and vertical solutions. Speaking to this strategy, Kim commented, \u201cWe note, however, much of this multiple growth vector strategy has been in place for some time, and we do not see any inflection point in any of its growth vector that is meaningful enough to offset the continued decline in its core HCM business.\u201dConsidering all of the factors at play, Kim started off his WDAY coverage by issuing a Sell recommendation. Based on the $110 price target, shares could dip 26% in the next twelve months.Looking at the consensus breakdown, 14 Buys, 7 Holds and 2 Sells have been received in the last three months. This gives WDAY a Moderate Buy consensus rating. With a $183.61 average price target, shares could surge 24% in the next year.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new December 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $145.00 strike price has a current bid of $21.30.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $145.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $123.70 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $147.32/share today.\n\nBecause the $145.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 14.69% return on the cash commitment, or 22.43% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, and highlighting in green where the $145.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $21.60.  If an investor was to purchase shares of WDAY stock at the current price level of $147.32/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 16.48% if the stock gets called away at the December 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if WDAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing WDAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 44%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 14.66% boost of extra return to the investor, or 22.39% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 51%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 48%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $147.32) to be 48%.

But a growth-dependent valuation has also predisposed the stock to large swings when performance comes in below expectations.\u00a0The stock's movements tracked roughly in line with the broader market in March, but its share price declined roughly twice as much as the  index's level.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Workday's strong track record of customer satisfaction and its heavily  model suggest that the company should hold on to most of its current subscribers even if economic conditions worsen. The company also has substantial long-term growth opportunities as it adds customers for services like procurement, but it's reasonable to expect that business momentum will be hurt in the near term.\u00a0With the coronavirus causing many companies to shut down or temporarily switch to work-from-home operations, Workday's potential customer base will likely be less inclined to pursue big growth projects or make the switch to new software platforms.\u00a0Workday stock is up roughly 1% in April's trading amid positive momentum for the broader market. data by The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year when it reported fourth-quarter results at the end of February.

Citrix, known for\u00a0virtual private networking (VPN) software that lets users remotely access work computers and networks over an encrypted connection, became a go-to tool for home-based employees.The company already had wide acceptance. With 2019 annual revenue of $3.01 billion, Citrix solutions are in use by more than 400,000 organizations, including 99% of the Fortune 500.\u00a0But demand is exploding as it becomes apparent that employees all across the globe will be working from home for at least the next month, and probably longer.Image source: Getty Images.The COVID-19 crisis forced a lot of changes upon businesses. Operational fundamentals had to be reworked, and some changes will become permanent. Many companies will continue remote work as a way of doing business. Done well, it can save a company money and result in better situations for employees.Citrix comes with established integrations with , , and\u00a0, among others, and it has connectors with cloud providers such as \u00a0and Microsoft Azure.

Employees and employers alike are realizing the benefits of securely working from home, and long-term demand will manifest itself.Although the stock has run up, I think there's still more upside left. Citrix has been around since 1989, and with 99% of the Fortune 500 as customers, it has a lot of credibility.\u00a0That will carry a lot of weight with smaller businesses who are now making purchase plans.Citrix has been moving to a more profitable subscription-based model for the past year.

Shares of WDAY stock are up 12% since Monday\u2019s lows near $125 as investors return to the market in force.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\tBut is it worth chasing gains on Workday stock or is this rally too fragile in the current market? Despite the market stringing together two days of gains on the promise of federal funds, most are still expecting a lot of volatility in the days ahead. Here\u2019s a look at where Workday could be heading next.Workday had been trading significantly lower than its July 2019 highs for months before the coronavirus became part of the equation. Investors abandoned the stock after management announced  in its Human Capital Management products. The firm\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings revealed subscription revenue growth came in at 30% for the full year, but projections for fiscal 2021 expect HCM subscription revenue growth to be in the high teens.Part of that is due to the fact that Workday is maturing\u2014 growth rates above 30% can\u2019t continue forever. In the absence of that subscription growth, investors should be looking for profitability, something Workday did deliver.Then there\u2019s the fact that Workday relies on a subscription-based model, which will provide a steady, dependable revenue stream.In the current climate where a recession looks inevitable, it\u2019s important to consider the risks a software firm like Workday faces. In an effort to suss out the impact of Covid-19 on software firms, Credit Suisse outlined the potential risks the industry faces.Workday ticks several high-risk boxes on Credit Suisse\u2019s outline. Among the most worrying factors is the criticality of Workday\u2019s offerings. If the macro environment continues to decline, businesses will be forced to make budget cuts eliminating non-essential spending. According to Credit Suisse analysts, Workday\u2019s suite of products is unlikely to fall under critical processes worth saving.Other risks include the firm\u2019s dependence on expansion to drive future growth and its \u201chigh-touch\u201d sales process.While Workday\u2019s overall growth story outside of the coronavirus crisis is a strong one, I don\u2019t think right now is the time to buy shares. With all the uncertainty that lies ahead, investors who are ready to start buying should be looking at cash-rich companies with strong positions.Now is a great time to upgrade your portfolio with a basket of high-quality stocks that have previously been too expensive to consider. Workday may have fallen into that category when it was trading at $125 per share, but at $144 per share, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not a rally worth chasing.The current rally is precarious and based heavily on the relief that government stimulus has offered. The market\u2019s euphoria will most likely wear off as more bad news hits the airwaves in the weeks ahead.While the market\u2019s stunning recovery over the past few days has certainly injected some optimism back into Wall Street, the battle against coronavirus is long from over. The economic impact that the virus will have on the world is still unknown and there is likely more bad news on the horizon as the number of cases in the U.S. continues to grow at an alarming rate.History shows that the market will probably suffer a few more ups and downs before finally getting onto a steady upward trajectory, making it worthwhile to keep a level head. Now\u2019s not the time to jump headfirst back into the market\u2014 especially not to chase WDAY stock\u2019s rally.There\u2019s no reason to completely discount WDAY stock, especially considering the company\u2019s underlying business looks strong. However, I think there are better opportunities to be had in stocks like  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:) and  (NYSE:). If you believe in Workday stock\u2019s long-term growth story, put it on your watch list because there are likely better entry points coming in the days ahead.Laura Hoy has a Finance degree from Duquesne University and has been writing about financial markets for the past 8 years.

Accenture counts among its clients more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500, and 91 of the top 100. The company cultivates long-term client relationships with 95 of its largest 100 clients having been with Accenture for 10 years or more.\u00a0Accenture develops this customer loyalty by anticipating needs and offering expertise in maximizing growth opportunities for clients.\u00a0CEO Julie Sweet said, \"We create value for our clients from building out their digital core to helping them innovate across their growth agenda and realize significant value from optimizing their operations. The new digital, cloud, and security is now our core, accounting for about 65% of total revenues.\"\u00a0Accenture has five operating groups: communication, media, and technology; financial services; health and public service; products (like consumer goods); and resources (such as chemicals and energy). The operating groups are staffed by industry specialists who provide research, consulting services, and technology solutions to their relevant sectors.Key to Accenture's core business is its Intelligent Platform Services business, which accounts for 40% of total revenue and posted double-digit growth in fiscal 2019.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Intelligent Platform Services leverage partnerships with , , , , and \u00a0to guide client technology evolution. Accenture partnership relationships extend to cloud platforms, including\u00a0\u00a0Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google\u00a0Cloud.\u00a0For example, Accenture used artificial intelligence and communications industry resources to help Verizon improve the process of more than 70% of customer calls. The company helped Verizon reduce a 20-minute customer call with a human agent to a short three- to four-minute digital interaction. As a result, customers were served faster, agents were freed up to do more complex work, and the company streamlined operations. Accenture customizes and applies this process across industries. The Verizon solution was applied at the New Mexico Human Services Department, helping employees reduce the time providing Medicaid coverage to newborns by up to 75%, producing an immediate cost savings for the department.\u00a0As  solutions have become more complex, guidance like Accenture's has become increasingly valuable. The company's expertise and business runs the gamut of industries, and it's a global, evolving business that relies on collaboration. Accenture is investing in what they call Innovation Architecture, which combines research, ventures, labs, studios, and innovation centers across a network of more than 100 facilities. This makes sharing across the global organization a reality and allows the company to quickly provide clients with valuable insights.Accenture's strategy is working as illustrated by its financial results.  earnings, reported on Dec. 19, showed revenue of $11.4 billion versus $10.6 billion in the first quarter of 2019. Diluted earnings per share were $2.09 compared with $1.96 for the prior-year period.\u00a0Overall fiscal-year 2019 highlights included record new bookings of $45.5 billion and free cash flow of $6.0 billion. The company returned a record $4.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Diluted earnings per share came in at $7.36, a 9% increase over fiscal year 2018.Company guidance for fiscal year 2020 was increased slightly after first-quarter 2020 earnings were announced. Accenture now forecasts revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% in the local currency, and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.66 to $7.84.Currently, Accenture's trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 24 comes in below averages for both its sector and the . Looking ahead, the stock trades at just 21 times forward earnings estimates.Business is growing for Accenture and clients are loyal, building the company's reputation and brand in the marketplace. Risks lie in overall economic conditions, which could decrease corporate spending, potentially affecting Accenture's revenue. However, corporate cost-cutting efforts are often centered on decreasing IT expenditures and outsourcing, two of Accenture's strengths. The company's business would likely remain solid even in the event of an economic downturn.Considering Accenture stock is somewhat undervalued compared to its industry and the broad market, combined with the company's growth initiatives and impressive client retention over the past decade, I believe Accenture stock is a buy. Investors can sleep easily at night knowing this company is staying on the cutting edge of technology and helping its clients harness that power.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That is pretty rare for stocks these days.\tMoreover, it looks like this dip is just temporary. For example, Shopify stock was up 5.7% Friday, Feb. 28, when most stocks were down.Investors should consider taking advantage of this opportunity. In fact, it looks like revenue and earnings will do well during any downturn resulting from the coronavirus outbreak. The most fundamental reason for this is that people will be more likely to buy goods online on sites like Shopify\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s.A major reason why Shopify stock has done so well recently is its latest earnings report. Shopify\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s fourth-quarter revenues grew 47% to $505.2 million, significantly ahead of the market\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s forecast of $482.5 million.Moreover, net income was positive for the first time at $771,000, or one cent per share. This compares with a net loss of $1.5 million, or one cent per share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, EPS was 43 cents, which was also significantly ahead of the Street\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s estimate of 23 cents.Shopify also had a very positive outlook for both 2020 and Q1 2020. It expects revenues for the year to be up 36% at the midpoint of its guidance.However, this guidance from Shopify was on Feb. 12, well before the recent coronavirus outbreak. That is why Shopify stock took a hit from its highs.At today\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s price Shopify stock has a market value of $54 billion. This is a stratospheric 34 times its last 12 months revenue of $1.578 billion for 2019. Moreover, it is also 25 times the expected midpoint range of $2.15 billion for Q1 2020.So there is no room here in that valuation for any performance issues. And the coronavirus could clearly dish up some difficulties for Shopify.Moreover, a  points out that Shopify stock trades at a premium to public SaaS companies.For example,  (NASDAQ:) trades at an EV/Sales ratio of 11.6 times for the trailing 12 months.  (NYSE:) is at 22.5 times sales and  (NYSE:) is at 17.9x. These are lower than Shopify\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s 33 times EV-to-Sales ratio for the last 12 months.Shopify makes two general types of revenue. It provides an eCommerce software solution for merchants. About 36% of its sales come from subscriptions from merchants who set up their online stores on Shopify.But 64% of revenue comes from taking a fee derived from Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). In other words, they get a cut out of every sale.The problem here is that many merchants order their goods from China and the Far East and then sell them on Shopify. Their access to goods recently has been disrupted by the general shutdown in China.For example,  that Amazon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s third-party sellers are struggling to keep their inventory in stock as a result of the general China economic shutdown. The point is that many of these sellers are also Shopify merchants. In any case, Shopify merchants will be having the same issues.The point is that Shopify\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s GMV is likely to take a hit during Q1 2020, and potentially longer. It will depend on how long it takes China to get up and running, so to speak.This may lead some Shopify merchants to find other suppliers, or possibly even set up their own selling sites. Both of these will lead to lower revenues for Shopify in the long run.Shopify is addressing some major issues that face its online merchants. For one, the company has started the Shopify Fulfillment Network that will compete directly with the Amazon Fulfillment Network, run by  (NASDAQ:). It will allow Shopify to order inventory from multiple sources and store them at Shopify warehouses.This will dramatically reduce the shipping times for Shopify merchants. For example, the typical Shopify merchant works on a drop-shipment method to source its inventory from China and other Far East suppliers. Right now that is what is causing the delays in shipments.With the Shopify Fulfillment Network, the merchant can pre-order inventory, have it shipped to Shopify\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s warehouses, then have the order sent out to customers much faster.Shopify indicated in its latest release that it is scaling up the Shopify Fulfillment Network. It purchased  last year to develop robotic warehouses just like at Amazon.As a result, Shopify merchants, many of whom also use Amazon Fulfillment Network, will likely have lower costs and more choice on how to source and fulfill their orders and shipments.Shopify stock is at a temporary low that is not likely to last, given the huge growth it is expected to have over the next year.  believe that Shopify is growing so fast that its valuation is not that high given the growth curve.Moreover, once Shopify\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s huge capital expenditures are over with its Shopify Fulfillment Network, free cash flow and profits are likely to spike. This is exactly what happened at its rival Amazon.Don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be confused. Shopify stock is not a value stock. There is not much of a margin of safety. It is a classic momentum stock, but so was Amazon stock during most of its massive rise. In effect, the idea is that Shopify will grow into its valuation. If you believe that, you might want to take another look at Shopify stock while it is trading at these levels.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter fiscal year '20 . I am pleased to report that Workday had another strong quarter ending the year with significant momentum and positioning us well as we enter fiscal year '21. Our success continues to be driven by the relentless dedication of our workmates and by our forward-thinking customers who expect more from their enterprise applications and who continue to choose Workday as their partner for their finance and HR cloud transformations. We now have over 3200 customers and our commitment to their success is demonstrated by our 97% customer satisfaction rate and broad referenceability. In Q4 we saw healthy demand across all product areas. Starting out with Workday HCM we had another strong quarter as we continue to be the market leader with our differentiated suite of products. In total we added 11 new Fortune 500 customers almost equaling our best-ever quarter and now have 45% of the Fortune 500 as HCM customers including 60% of the Fortune 50. We also added 16 new Global 2000 customers and now have almost 20% of the Global 2000. New customers include Spanish multinational bank BBVA; Southwest Airlines and Wells Fargo Bank. Notable HCM go-lives in Q4 included NatWest Group Banco Santander and the Prudential Company of America as we continue to have over 70% of our HCM customers in production. Switching over to our financial management applications. Q4 was our best quarter ever.We added a record number of core financial management customers including Keybanc Beth Israel Lahey Health Dun & Bradstreet and West Virginia United Health System. In addition to the strong growth from our core financial applications we saw continued momentum from our expanding suite of products that support the office of the CFO. Both Workday Prism Analytics and the Adaptive Insights business planning cloud had outstanding quarters. We added over 100 new Prism customers and over 350 planning customers which includes over 100 on the broader Workday platform. Our new workmates at Scout RFP had an excellent initial quarter as well with strong momentum on sourcing opportunities both stand alone and as part of Workday spend management offerings. We believe the depth and breadth of our cloud-based finance products in combination with our industry-leading HCM suite Workday Prism Analytics Adaptive Insights business planning cloud and expanding spend management offerings with Scout RFP delivers a goal solution that is highly differentiated and helps to empower business leaders to plan execute analyze and extend all-in-one system powered by machine learning. Switching to the people front. A key part of our success continues to be our vibrant company culture which allows us to maintain high levels of employee satisfaction and really helps us attract and retain talent across all levels of the company. To that end we are proud of our recent recognition as Fortune Great Place to Work announced their 100 Best Companies to Work For list ranking Workday as number five.This is the sixth consecutive year that Workday has made the list and the third year in a row that we've been in the Top 10. Being a Great Place to Work is something that Dave and I have prioritized since day 1 so it's an honor for Workday to be on this prestigious list. As we look forward to fiscal year '21 and beyond we are relentlessly focused on innovation and expect to see continued momentum on our growing family of applications. We're confident in the pipeline we have built and the sales execution model we have in place. As such we expect fiscal year '21 to be another strong year of growth. We continue to invest heavily in our company culture and our value system and have a great group of employees committed to delivering the highest levels of customer satisfaction to our great customers.I will now turn over to our CFO and Co-President Robynne Sisco. Over to you Robynne. -- Thanks Aneel and good afternoon everyone. Our fourth quarter kept a strong year driven by solid executions across the company. We not only added a record number of net new HCM and FINS customers our high levels of customer satisfaction continued to drive 95-plus-percent gross renewal rates as well as strong add-on sales to existing customers. Subscription revenue was $840 million in Q4 and $3.1 billion for the full year representing growth of 25% and 30% respectively. Professional services revenue came in at $137 million for Q4 and $531 million for the full year. Fourth quarter revenue outside the U.S. increased 33% year-over-year to $244 million representing 25% of total revenue. We see significant global opportunity ahead and expect that our revenue mix from the rest of the world markets will continue to increase over both the near and longer term. Subscription revenue backlog was $8.29 billion at the end of the fourth quarter growth of 23% year-over-year. Backlog growth was driven by healthy net new bookings add-on business and strong renewals with our net retention once again over 100%. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $5.48 billion growth of 22%. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter was $117 million or 11.9% of revenue with a margin overachievement primarily driven by our top line outperformance. For the year our non-GAAP operating profit increased 66% to $484 million or 13.4% of total revenue up more than 300 basis points from FY 2019 as we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our business.Operating cash flow for Q4 was $297 million bringing our operating cash flow for the full year to $865 million or 43% growth. This strong performance was driven by a combination of operating margin expansion and exceptionally strong collections in Q4. We successfully added and integrated more than 1650 net new employees to Workday this year including approximately 150 from the Scout RFP acquisition in Q4 bringing our total employee count at year-end to over 12200. Overall we're very pleased with the strong companywide execution in our seasonally most important quarter. Now let me turn to guidance. We entered the year with considerable momentum and we see significant opportunity ahead to support both our near and long-term growth aspirations while continuing our progression toward 25-plus percent non-GAAP operating margins. We are raising our FY '21 subscription revenue guidance to a range of $3.755 billion to $3.770 billion representing year-over-year growth of 22% at the high end. As a reminder Scout is expected to add less than one percentage point to our overall subscription revenue growth in FY '21. For the first quarter we expect subscription revenue to be between $873 million and $875 million representing 25% year-over-year growth. We expect subscription revenue to sequentially increase from the previous quarter by just under 6% in Q2 approximately 4% in Q3 and 4.5% in Q4. As we continue to expand our product portfolio we want to provide investors with increased visibility into the growth vectors across our business. At our Analyst Day last October we provided incremental disclosure around our HCM and FINS plus businesses.As we look into fiscal '21 our current full year guidance assumes high-teens HCM subscription revenue growth and low-40% growth in our FINS plus business. We do not plan to provide quarterly updates to these numbers but we'll revisit them annually. On the professional services front we continue to value and support a growing systems integrator ecosystem. Our partners are seeing robust growth in their Workday practices and we will continue our tight alignment with them to help ensure customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value. We're expecting professional services revenue to be approximately $137 million in Q1 and $580 million for FY '21. We expect FY '21 professional services margins to be flat from FY '20 as we continue to invest in programs to support customer deployments and to sustain our high levels of customer satisfaction. Based on our current outlook we expect total subscription revenue backlog growth in the low-20s for the first three quarters of FY '21 moderating to the high teens in Q4 against a very tough comp. We are raising our non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the full year to 14.5%. As a reminder our margin guidance includes roughly 150 basis points of dilution from the Scout RFP acquisition. We estimate non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 15% in Q1 and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2 as we invest in our people through our annual compensation process. The GAAP margins for the first quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 26% to 27% points lower than the non GAAP margins.We expect operating cash flow in FY '21 to be approximately $1.08 billion representing growth of 25%. The FY '21 non-GAAP tax rate is 19%. We continue to invest in our real estate footprint at our Pleasanton headquarters to support our continued growth. In FY '21 we expect approximately $230 million of owned real estate investments which includes the potential purchase of a 5-building complex that we are currently occupying. We expect to spend an additional $350 million in FY '21 to support our other capital needs including investments in customer data centers leased facilities and corporate IT infrastructure to support our continued business expansion. And finally I'll close by thanking our amazing employees customers and partners for their continued support and hard work which allowed us to deliver great results this past year. We are still in the early stages of executing against our long-term vision as a company but our progress wouldn't be possible without shared goals. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.With that I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. -- Thank you and congrats on a very strong finish. Aneel I wanted to inquire about coronavirus situation. We certainly understand that there's no reason you would be experts on this. But we have seen the headlines about changes to your sales kickoff and I'm just wondering what you are seeing from your customers whether they are pulling out of conferences or restricting travel or having employees work from home if they visited Italy or Southeast Asia? And then just at a high level whether any disruption kind of seems manageable to you through this fiscal year or whether it's just too hard to gauge that. -- It's still early and we're not experts. As it relates to the sales kickoff I and I think the rest of the team didn't think the risk was very high in the U.S. but our Asia Pac folks could not attend. And then with the outbreak in Italy and we actually had a joint meeting with some of the U.K. and Italy team. We felt like just the U.S. team that's not really inclusive enough. It's not really the way Workday would go forward with a global sales kickoff meeting. So we're going to wait until we can get all the people together in person after this outbreak gets past us. In the meantime we're going to do things virtually. I think in the U.S. though right now it still feels like mostly business as usual. -- Okay great. And just as a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could just comment on how far-reaching your ambitions are going to be in procurement and whether you think in the long run it could be possible to replicate the kind of success you've had in recruiting. I think it took you five years to go from 0 to number one market share in the Fortune 500 there. Just curious whether you see that type of potential in that market. -- There's definitely a ton of potential. And as we've gotten smarter about the spend management market and in particular with Scout RFP and first of all they had a great first quarter as part of Workday really a great team. But the dollars that flow through sourcing are just massive. Even out of Workday the amount of money that goes through the procurement organization is huge. And I do think there's a chance to build a differentiated solution. In the short term that is more Scout as a stand alone solution plus as part of our suite. But over time you could see our procurement suite be a best-in-breed best-in-class suite and I think the market's only going to grow. I think it's a really exciting market opportunity for us. Can it mimic recruiting? Time will tell. I think what it can do is be a great driver of financial sales and I think financial sales can be a great driver of the spend management marketplace. And every company on the planet has to manage their spend effectively so it is a truly global opportunity. -- Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, thank you very much. I'll add my congratulations as well to the Workday team. Aneel I know that you started just a little cautious about the slowing HCM business. I'm curious given the particular strength in the quarter are we doing more of a smoother standing with the HCM business showing obvious trends in the quarter? And also if you could talk to the network effect of the platform. It looks like you are able to sell financial deals to existing HCM customers that have been very successful. And one for you Robynne. Should we stop looking at billings Scout as deferred revenue change and instead focus on your backlog because that calculation of bookings comes up with 28% and it has been more predictable more consistent. So is that the right way to look at total indicator of your business? -- Yes so on the HCM market we had a great fourth quarter. We had 11 Fortune 500 accounts the second best where we've ever had as a company. So the large enterprise market is alive and well for HR. But we continue to gain and see growth in the medium enterprise business for HR and there's still a ton of greenfield opportunity in that medium enterprise market across the globe. So as we head into this year I think we're thinking about high-teens growth for HR. I think that's what we've been forecasting. And I think it's going to hold up. I'm not necessarily focused on the next 12 months. I think longer-term we'll just have to understand how that market matures and what we can do to come up with more add-ons to continue the growth of that marketplace. No question that the suite market is picking up. Today I think one of every four customers has both product lines. And what we saw in the fourth quarter for another quarter was a bunch again of financial-first customers and that's a great sign for us. That means our financial products are winning on a best-of-breed basis even without the without the leverage from the HR marketplace. And I still think for the foreseeable future large enterprises or the mega enterprises they will buy HR and finance separately. They're just that's just the way they've done it historically. But medium enterprise increasingly is buying HR and finance together and that's a really powerful trend for us. -- And Kash to your second question yes we absolutely do believe that looking at subscription revenue backlog is better indicator of our performance than billings or deferred revenue. Keep in mind however that there are several factors that influence the bookings calculation including renewal volume duration. So the quarterly bookings count can vary widely from actual ACV net bookings as we discussed at Analyst Day. We've been saying all along that this will be a back-end-loaded year for us and that's exactly what's played out which has led to the high-growth in the bookings number as you noted. -- Congratulation. Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. -- Thanks very much. I'll echo the congratulations on the good quarter and finish to the year. Aneel just on the financial side in talking to your partners healthcare seems to be one vertical and I think you mentioned a couple of companies in your prepared remarks that seems to be picking up some steam for you all. Can you just discuss that a little bit? And when you think into fiscal '21 maybe in addition maybe to healthcare are there any other verticals you feel that are starting to pick up some momentum for you in that area? -- Sure. So we did have a good year and quarter in healthcare but we also had a very strong year and quarter in financial services. And I think that is a really key market for us. And of course Keybanc was a big win for Workday. That's a huge bank well-respected bank and they were already Workday HR customer. It was great to see them buy Workday financials. I think financial services is the next market. We've had good success in government. I think you'll see that continue. And I think you'll see business services be another great market for us with financials. But candidly it was strong across the board. It was the best quarter we've ever had for financials the best quarter we ever had for adaptive planning business insights. It was not only their best quarter. Growth accelerated in the fourth quarter for the planning products. And that was a it's a testament to the fact that the office of the CFO was looking at planning analytics and transactions together and want a unified system and our message is resonating so it's resonating to all types of companies. -- And then if I could just ask one quick follow-up along the same lines where you're just talking about. When you think about sort of selling in the office of the CFO are your partners aligned with you now in terms of being able to go in there with both planning and financials to have a little bit of a broader-based discussion? Because it seems like that's where the market wants to go. I was just kind of curious I know you all are there. But do you think your partner base is with you at this point? -- Chano you want to comment on that? -- Yes. Thank you I will. Kirk definitely they are. I mean the interest on our partners in terms of enabling training resources both in planning and now in procurement has been increasing significantly. And we're pretty happy now with our vertical strategy as well very much easier to align toward the go-to-market for our partners. -- Super, thank you all.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. -- Great. Thanks so much. And I'll echo my congratulations on a great finish to the year. I wanted to ask a question a competitive question perhaps Aneel or Chano specifically relative to Oracle. Because while we're all very familiar with your success replacing legacy HR systems we more recently picked up a couple of significant Oracle HCM cloud displacements which stood out to us just because this is their current generation product. Can you give us a sense of how prevalent these conversions are and what might be in common when you come across them? -- I'm not going to comment on how prevalent they are. I would just say that as it relates to all of our legacy competitors they were slow to move to the cloud. They have not had the success on the deployment side. They might have done a good job on some of the sales opportunities but the deployment side hasn't worked out and so those accounts come back to market. And that's happened with Oracle accounts. That's happened with SAP accounts. And what we hang our hat on is a great experience for our customers first on the deployment. And then once they're on deployment in their production phase. And that is how customers measure the success of these projects. It's not about what they buy. It's what they get live and what they get value from and that's going to continue to be the case. -- And if I can follow-up with one for Robynne. I just wanted to check on the variability from your preliminary view of 14% non-GAAP op margin in 21 to now 14.5% what areas in the business gave you the flexibility? Can you speak to the levels of investment into Scout? Or is it sales and marketing? How should we think about that? -- Yes. So our raise in the margin guide is really the top line overperformance in the business in Q4 and running that through the year and the raise in the guidance that we had for sub revenue. But we do expect to continue to get efficiencies across all areas of the business. But one of the things you're going to see this year and going forward which is different is given our scale we do expect to start getting efficiencies out of R&D in FY '21 and beyond even as we continue to incrementally invest in our products. -- Excellent. Thanks so much.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Ms. Bellini can you check to see if your line is on mute? Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, This is Josh Baer on for Keith. There's been a couple of large acquisitions in the HCM space recently. And I'm just wondering how you expect those changes in the market to impact the competitive environment for you in HR? -- I think the two are probably Cornerstone and Saba. I don't really see any impact on us. We have displaced both of those learning products over time. I don't really see anything except upside for Workday on that one. As it relates to Kronos and Ultimate time will tell. I have a lot of respect for Aron a lot respect for the Ultimate team. I think bringing together two companies of that scale and that and different cultures is not an easy thing to do. But again Aron is a proven excellent CEO. The Ultimate team was strong so time will tell. It's definitely not a negative. Could there be some disruption that gives Workday some benefits? Yes but we're not going to count on that. -- Great. That's helpful. And I'm just wondering do you anticipate any disruption from canceling your the in-person sales kickoff conference? -- No. We'll replicate as much of it as we can virtually. And at the appropriate time we'll get the people together in person. There will be in-person meetings across the globe it just will not involve travel. And that what we want to do is minimize while we're in this kind of uncertainty minimize plane travel and I should say international plane travel. But you'll see clusters of folks getting together in all parts of the U.S. as we do this virtually. I don't know Chano if you want to add anything. -- Nothing to add. We're really excited about the virtual experience that we are creating for our colleagues across the world and as well in some of the EMEA offices that will be getting together. We're pretty positive we can deliver most of the content enablement and strategy that we have to through the virtual mode that we are creating. -- I actually think it's I actually think the there's no silver lining in a virus that's affecting so many lives but it's going to cause us to learn how to do things on a virtual basis that frankly we haven't thought about before. And I think that will be something we'll learn and use in the future. -- That's really interesting. Are there any costs that are shifting around associated with that? Or is it not enough to show up in a meaningful way? -- Not really. Not really. -- Good, thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. -- Well, thanks for taking the question. Just hoping wondering if you could give a little bit more color on international performance this quarter any specific geos of outperformance. And then just which areas you're most excited about for FY '21. -- Yes. Thanks for your question. International remains a very big focus for us and we continue to see healthy subscription growth out of the international markets. I mean we saw great growth in terms of net new for. In terms of the areas mainly to highlight I would say our DACH which are Germany Austria and Switzerland markets as well as some of the continental markets did great performance. Our ANZ region in the other side Australia and New Zealand were some of the markets that maybe I would like to highlight in Q4. But overall we saw a healthy subscription net new ACV growth in Q4. -- Got it. Any new areas to focus on for FY '21? -- From a geographical perspective nothing relevant to highlight. I mean we are considering entering Mexican market during this year but that would be basically more a market that we will be developing going forward FY '22 and onwards. -- Alright, sounds great. Thanks so much.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. I wanted to ask. Maybe it was impressive to me that you saw Prism Analytics becoming part of the net adds. Maybe could you talk about what you saw specifically in terms of deal flow in that and what it represents for the future? -- We saw 100 new accounts add Prism Analytics this past quarter which is a really strong showing again for a relatively young new product area. I think as we bring out more specific solutions like people analytics and we go into finance analytics and spend analytics I think it's going to be even more powerful. But the idea that you can plan execute analyze in one system and not have to worry about how data goes back and forth between the different systems and can do it in a real-time basis it's resonating. And as a result people look at Prism as a really great extension to gain not just better transformation from the business process side but better insight into their business. -- And then one quick follow-up if I may on the Workday Cloud Platform I was wondering if what the customer feedback has been when if when will it become generally available for deployment. -- Customer feedback's been very positive. As we get ready I'd say stay tuned. You'll hear about our general availability fairly soon in the coming quarters. We are very focused on a set of repeatable use cases that we discovered in terms of working with our first wave of customers and we're just making sure that the platform is really ready for prime time with those set of use cases. So just stay tuned. You'll see it fairly shortly. -- Great, thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. -- Yes, guys, thanks for getting me on. Just wanted to ask on the vertical strategy for financials it seems like some of the efforts that you've put forth especially in healthcare and financial services yielded some nice results in your fiscal '20. Any plans or update on additional protocols that you plan to work on building out over fiscal '21? -- Matt this is Chano speaking. As Aneel mentioned I mean healthcare has been a vertical we've now been working for the last three or four years highly successfully on the back of inventory management as a unique value proposition. And then clearly customers taking on to financials and HCM on top. Education and government is another vertical with being quiet for a long time now. And the latest to our financial services where as you say we are seeing some good success with customers like Keybanc and some others on the back of our accounting center solution. And as Aneel also mentioned professional business services is becoming another significant one that we're going to start tackling from a go-to-market perspective and product perspective as soon as this year. -- And just one follow-up. Have those vertical efforts resulted in larger enterprises whether being signed or in the pipeline in those specific verticals that you've put that effort into? -- Yes definitely when we are setting our vertical strategy as I said on the back of a unique value proposition that we have a good product and strategy for it and then we put our go-to-market efforts in terms of aligning toward our customers. And yes you are right in saying that that is pursuing more larger customers more with a financial solution offering onto those verticals and customers.. -- Great, thanks, guys.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. -- Great, thanks, Maybe two for Robynne. Robynne just to start the growth rate of deferred revs and the growth rate of your subscription revenue backlog have been relatively similar through the first three quarters of the fiscal year just ended. But in the fourth quarter DR grew by 18% backlog by 23%. So the gap widened a little bit. I'd just love to ask you what might have happened in terms of invoicing duration or anything interesting around contract structure maybe more back-end-loaded deals something that might have caused that spread to widen a little bit. -- Yes Karl there's no really one thing for us to point to. I mean these metrics are going to vary with occasionally deferred revenue growth being above sub revenue and sometimes it being or backlog sometimes it being below. As you mentioned it really does vary with invoicing and contractual terms and renewals so don't read anything into the difference in those growth rates. And you'll continue to see some disconnects in those going forward just based on contractual invoicing terms. -- Yes. Okay. Got it. And then my second one for you Robynne is thank you for the beginning of fiscal year guidance around the seasonality in subscription revenue growth. When we look at it and try to compare it to the sub revs growth seasonality you experienced in the last couple of years it's a little bit tricky given that you've had some acquisitions that might have distorted that. So do you mind just taking a moment and just maybe qualitatively reflecting on how seasonality might be changing in fiscal '21 on the revenue growth line? -- Yes. I think the one thing I would point out is we've got an interesting dynamic in Q1 when we look at sequential growth from Q4 to Q1 this year and there's really two things behind that. First of all Q4 linearity within the quarter was actually more pronounced than what we've seen in FY '20. And so that's going to increase the step-up in revenue from Q4 to Q1. And then layering on top of that is the fact that we are in a leap year. And so we get one extra day of revenue recognition in Q1 as well. And so that's changing the sequential dynamics from Q4 to Q1 and then also from Q1 to Q2. But that's really the only thing that I would point out as being different this year. -- Yep. Got it. Okay. Thanks, Robin.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please proceed with your question. -- Good afternoon. Let me add my congratulations with regards to the strong end of the year. Obviously this is occurring real time and it's very fluid. But I'm just wondering to what extent COVID-19 ended up being factored into the guidance. And there have been other periods of uncertainty that we've gone through together over the years. Just wondering how you think that ends up playing out. I know it's obviously this is different but how are you thinking about how it could end up impacting things? And then I've got a couple of vertical questions. -- So Mark we really approached guidance this year the same way that we have every single year right? And so we think we've provided a realistic view based on what we know today. We today to date have not seen an impact to our business so far. But as you mentioned it's really early in this situation. We're going to continue to monitor and we'll obviously update you as we go through the year. -- Great. And then with regards to financials sometimes you give us client counts and you've had some really nice wins. Can you talk a little bit about like Keybanc who you ended up beating out key reasons why they went with you? And I think there's a few other companies within the Fortune 500 that you ended up winning within financials over the recent few months just the progress that you're seeing there. -- Without getting into the deal-by-deal basis the two major competitors we see on everything are SAP and Oracle for financials. The more cloud-centric opportunities favor Workday. And if there's a second one we see it's Oracle. The more cloud-centric people are looking at it SAP tends to fall away. So you can you'll have to talk account by account. As the cloud continues to mature in the finance marketplace I think we'll see more of Oracle than we will have of SAP. -- Great. And any update on the number of clients on financials now? -- We did 90 in the quarter which was our most adds ever in any given quarter so we're really pleased with that result. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. -- Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to touch a little bit on the success that you guys have had with planning. You gave some stats in the quarter about how many customers you've added. I guess if you could share with us kind of if you were since the acquisition if you could tell us kind of the number of customers if you could kind of give that to us on a cumulative basis if you have it. So just as if you could give us a sense as you look to this year how you think about the growth of this add-on and the penetration you're seeing into your installed base right? If you can you've given us some stats in the past about like payroll penetration into the installed base and learning and things like that. Just wondering if you could share with us kind of the momentum you're seeing there with the planning product. -- Yes. Heather this is Tom. And we continue to see excellent progress with our planning products. I don't have an exact customer number but it's well over 1000 new customers that we've added. And that's a combination of customers that we're selling planning first as well as customers that we're selling into the Workday installed base. I'd say that it's we're very pleased with the progress we've made particularly with larger enterprise customers both as they look at financial planning and for workforce planning applications as well. So six quarters into the acquisition I think we're really pleased with the progress. There continues to be significant opportunity in the Workday installed base in terms of selling planning into that base as well as penetration both for large enterprise and middle enterprise customers. -- And just if I may just one quick follow-up. Any commentary on kind of are you typically seeing greenfield opportunities legacy opportunities? Or is it head-to-head versus kind of newer companies such as Anaplan? -- Yes we see both. I think there are customers who are converting from legacy on-premise solutions and they want a cloud solution for planning. And they are typically coming from an Oracle or an SAP solution. There are also customers who have used we see spreadsheets in many parts of their enterprises. Even if they have a legacy planning solution the model and business logic is in spreadsheets and we're a great solution to bring that planning process into the cloud. So it's typically Anaplan or Oracle for our cloud competes and we have we do exceptionally well in those competes. -- If I could just add two things. In my prepared remarks I mentioned 350 new planning customers for the fourth quarter. That was really an outstanding performance. And the growth rate for the business planning cloud is significantly faster than the rest of Workday.Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question. -- Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me. I guess Aneel when you think about the durability of the growth rate in your HCM business and you think about the tailwinds there maybe even beyond next year but over a longer time duration which is going to add more of a growth tailwind in your mind? Going down market and seeing kind of continued success there selling into the base? Or new additional functionality that we haven't seen yet? -- I would definitely say that the biggest opportunity at least in my mind is bringing the medium enterprise solution to the rest of the world. We've been doing that in the past 12 months where we brought the medium enterprise offering which is a different pricing and packaging and lower-cost services. We've taken them to places like the U.K. A lot of the rest of the world is a medium enterprise marketplace so that's a big opportunity. And it's largely a greenfield opportunity. Combine that with we're still largely underpenetrated in almost all parts of the world outside the U.S. where the market was first hot for cloud so we still have a tremendous amount of opportunity. There's always the ability to sell back into the base. But landing the new accounts is what drives the longer-term growth and durability growth because you need to first land the account before you can sell back into them. And so we're still very focused on that. Chano do you want to add anything? -- No I think the only thing obviously is kind of the financial plus opportunities. But I think it's a combination of those just to recap medium enterprise totally with you Aneel. Selling into the base we had a very strong record quarter this past Q4 Alex with over 50% growth in add-on ACV. So that was really good. And clearly me personally I'm very excited about the rest of the world opportunity joining with the ME1. -- That's super helpful. And maybe just as a final one. If we think about the sales tweaks and changes that you make every year around this time what's the best way to characterize kind of the go-forward kind of or the focus areas that you're looking at for 2020 and kind of giving us a bit of a help on the magnitude of the changes made this year versus previous? -- Alex it's a great question. I think we try to always keep an evolution more than a revolution on our go-to-market and it's supporting our growth opportunities. So if you characterize those changes clearly one is the verticalization that we talk on our Analyst Day and we've been talking on this call and that is more to support our financials plus opportunity. I think strengthening our motion into the selling into the base during last year I just commented on some of the results in Q4 and you're going to see that going on and happening. And clearly last but not least Aneel is saying extending that medium enterprise and our offering in terms of shorter time to value in the rest of the world with the success we've been seeing in the U.S. So we've been taking go-to-market decisions to support some of these growth opportunities and motions. And as I said it's been more an evolution with some strengthening onto the talent that we have in some of the markets we needed to do so. -- Perfect. Thank you guys.

What started out as little more than a buzzword among techies has grown into a massive industry, hauling in hundreds of billions of dollars a year worldwide. A quick look at the  , which tracks an index focused on the accelerating cloud computing industry, shows that cloud stocks are collectively up 200% since the fund's inception in July 2011.In spite of their fast rise, though, cloud stocks will likely continue as a prominent driver of investment returns in the next decade, serving as a key ingredient in the \"digital transformation\" of many organizations as they update operations for the 21st century. This guide will help get you started selecting the best of the many dozens of pure-play cloud companies available to invest in.Image source: Getty Images.So what is this high-in-the-sky technology term actually referring to? In simple terms, the cloud is a global network of data centers. These remote servers are used to deliver a service or complete a task for a user via the internet or other network. Functions of these data centers are diverse: They store data, run applications like email and business software, operate social networks, and deliver services like streaming TV. Generally, there are four methods by which the cloud is delivered to end users.Organizations are making use of the cloud in myriad ways, but no matter the type of data center, all of them are still on the rise after a decade of busy construction activity.The concept of services being stored remotely and available on demand is nearly as old as the concept of the internet itself, but it wasn't until the 1990s that the term \"cloud\" actually came into use in the tech world. An early pioneer of the concept was , which was founded in 1999 and was the first software application developed from scratch to run in the cloud. In 2002,  quietly launched its cloud service, dubbed Amazon Web Services, or AWS. The e-tailer hit on the concept of renting out its excess computing power to businesses and quickly became a leader in the cloud movement as a result.Since the late 2000s, a flood of cloud businesses has come online. However, the marketplace is dominated by several big players, such as Amazon's AWS, 's  Azure, 's  Cloud, and 's   Google Cloud. Across the Pacific,  and  are leading the charge in  and are also an important part of the conversation.Just like different layers of the atmosphere, there are layers to the cloud, too. Generally, cloud services are split into three tiers. Some companies offer just one tier of service, while larger companies often span two or all three.The first tier and the base for all cloud offerings is infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). IaaS provides the nuts and bolts for a business wanting to operate in the cloud. An IaaS provider offers the actual server space for storage, computing, networking, and security. Notable IaaS companies include Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and . Companies that don't operate their own cloud infrastructure host their services on another company's IaaS.Many tech companies tout their software \"platforms.\" Sometimes this is a generic term for their overall suite of software, but as it pertains to the cloud, a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) enables software developers to build, manage, and deploy applications. PaaS is built on top of an IaaS service, and many of the abovementioned IaaS providers also operate as a PaaS as well. Some software providers, like Salesforce for example, offer a PaaS in addition to SaaS (see below), as they allow developers to custom build apps using a set of tools. Another notable example of a PaaS is communications company  .Built on top of IaaS and PaaS is the end result of the cloud, the applications themselves. Companies that operate and sell software applications are known as  providers. SaaS outfits build and provide ready-to-use apps for a wide variety of both business and consumer tasks. Often the most visible part of the cloud to everyday consumers, notable SaaS apps many people run daily are Netflix and  for entertainment and Microsoft Office 365 and Salesforce on the business productivity end of the spectrum.The cloud has grown to epic proportions in relatively short order and has become a driving force behind technological advancement. According to researcher , global public cloud spending should come in around $266 billion in 2020, up from $228 billion in 2019. When considering the entire realm of cloud computing, research from Statista and  expects general global cloud spending to top $400 billion in 2020.Digital transformation -- a phrase describing the wave of businesses and organizations using data center-based computing to update their operations -- is expected to fuel double-digit growth in cloud spending for the foreseeable future. Gartner's report expects global spending to increase by 13% a year in both 2021 and 2022. Fellow researcher IDC thinks spending will more than double by 2023 and top $500 billion.Image source: Getty Images.Business analysts and economists generally think the 2010s were the first half of the cloud's development and that the 2020s will be phase two of the computing concepts' rapid global deployment.As it gets bigger, though, it is playing a role in the advance of other technologies. Edge computing, for example, is the move to push computing from the cloud to locations closer to the end user -- either at smaller localized data centers or within devices themselves. Edge computing is quickly becoming a new category for cloud providers as they try to speed up the computing and data delivery process and is on its way to being worth tens of billions of dollars a year. The cloud is also powering applications like artificial intelligence as businesses use data centers to train and then deploy AI-based systems. Over the next decade, these could be powerful investment trends to watch that the cloud is making possible behind the scenes.For those who want a comprehensive cloud portfolio, IaaS and PaaS providers are the place to start. Incidentally, even though IaaS and PaaS are already covered by some of the largest stocks around -- Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet's Google, Alibaba, even  and its PaaS for advertisers -- these building blocks for cloud-based services are expected to be the fastest-growing segments of the cloud. Gartner expects annual IaaS and PaaS spending, which came in at $40 billion and $32 billion, respectively, to nearly double by the end of 2022. As large, diversified tech giants, these companies can make up the core of an investment portfolio.Not to be forgotten, though, are the hardware companies that make cloud infrastructure and platform services possible. Hardware must exist before applications can be built. Arista Networks and NVIDIA are two of the largest companies in this space, but investors who want to broaden their search even further should look for companies categorized as \"network hardware, storage, and peripherals.\" The best bets will have business segments labeled as \"cloud\" or \"data center\" revenue, with those segments at least keeping up with the double-digit average growth forecast.Now on to the software itself. SaaS is the largest portion of the cloud pie, making up nearly half of annual spending in 2019 per Gartner. As the largest chunk, it is also, on average, the slowest-growing segment, expected to \"only\" increase 50% by 2022 and top $150 billion a year.Within this massive subset of the industry, though, are an overwhelming number of options. For every nontech company, there is a SaaS that can help (or disrupt) the industry -- from retail to finance to healthcare. Here are a few examples by sector.Image source: Getty Images.There is no shortage of cloud stocks to choose from, but choosing which ones to own is the real trick. For the well-established, large, and profitable cloud companies, traditional valuation metrics still apply. For smaller firms operating at little or negative profitability, some business and revenue growth metrics are the best indicators to consult.Many investors look at  (the stock price divided by earnings per share from the last 12 months) when selecting a stock, but that metric only tells part of the story. In the high-growth cloud computing industry, the  can be more helpful, as it accounts for elevated price-to-earnings multiples by comparing to expected growth rates.Another profitability metric to weigh is price to . Free cash flow is revenue minus cash operating expenses and capital expenditures. Unlike basic earnings, free cash flow excludes noncash items like depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation and thus provides a clearer picture of a company's true profitability profile. For example, Salesforce currently has a sky-high price-to-earnings ratio of 173.8, but price to free cash flow values it at 39.6. Using price to free cash flow makes quite the difference here and would indicate Salesforce isn't all that bad a deal for a company that has consistently been able to grow over 20% year-in and year-out.Traditional methods of  often break down when evaluating the cloud industry -- especially the fastest-growing  providers. When a company is expanding fast and sees ample opportunity ahead, profits are often foregone in lieu of reinvestment for rapid growth.Fortunately, business growth metrics provide an alternative method. Growth in total users or customers can be telling. Is customer count accelerating? Then quickly rising expenses might be an acceptable situation. Is customer count decelerating? If so, expense growth should also be falling.Another key component is the dollar-based net expansion rate, sometimes called the revenue retention rate. This metric shows investors how much money the average existing customer is spending on a cloud service. A rate of less than 100% implies the average customer is spending less than a year ago (not good), while greater than 100% implies they are spending more. If customer count is decelerating, a dollar-based net expansion rate over 100% means a cloud company can afford to add customers at a slower pace. For example, cloud communications firm Twilio reported dollar-based net expansion of 132% in Q3 2019, implying existing customer spending jumped an impressive 32% higher compared to the year prior.All of those business metrics ultimately feed into revenue, the headline figure that investors watch when it comes to the cloud. Increased revenue, however, is only good if it translates into increased profits -- or at least the promise of an eventual bottom-line payoff.Whatever your findings may be when searching for high-growth cloud companies, it's important to remember that stocks such as these tend to be very volatile -- both up and down. Therefore, diversify your holdings, keep individual positions small, and add to them periodically -- monthly, quarterly, or on the dips, perhaps whenever a stock dips by a certain percentage (like 10% from recent highs). Consistency is key, as is some patience with small companies that are in expansion mode and tend to bounce around a lot in value.Above all, remember that investing in the cloud is all about the long game, whether the companies owned are large or small. The industry has had a lot of success, and there's plenty more to come. The 2020s should provide more strong returns for the cloud, so don't get too hung up on what happens in the short term, and remember that investing results play out over years -- not days, months, and quarters.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Revenue had climbed more than 26% to $938.1 million, translating to adjusted (non-) net income of $0.53 per share. Both figures were well above expectations, and CEO Aneel Bhusri boasted that \"companies of all sizes and industries continue to select\" Workday's flagship\u00a0human capital management (HCM) and financial software solutions to meet their needs.Indeed, after adding half a dozen new Fortune 500 clients to its base, Workday now counts over 40% of that group, about 50% of the Fortune 100, and 17% of the Global 2000 among its more than 3,000 customers. What's more, its budding Workday Financial Management product by itself has grown its base to more than 800 total customers. And at the company's most recent investor day in October, Workday had only just informed investors that upselling its new Workday Planning product platform represents an incremental $5 billion market opportunity.Of course, tacking on an extra $5 billion to its total addressable market was nothing to scoff at. But it also paled in comparison to what management outlined as their  addressable market (TAM) of $81 billion in 2018 -- a figure some industry estimates see soaring over 40% to $115 billion by the end of 2022.Nonetheless, Workday stock fell hard in response last month after the company warned investors will need to wait until \"fiscal 2022 and beyond\" to see\u00a0meaningful incremental growth\u00a0from its newest products and impending product launches. Among those products are the Workday Cloud Platform, People Analytics, and the Workday Employee Experience solution.But while shares have largely recovered from last month's drop as the broader market climbed to all-time highs, that also raises the question: Is Workday stock worth considering today? I think so.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Even putting aside Workday's enormous TAM, rewinding back to last month's call shows Workday offered seemingly soft forward financial guidance for fiscal year 2021 subscription revenue to increase \"just\" 21% year over year to roughly $3.73 billion. Make no mistake, that was a notable deceleration from current guidance for 29% growth\u00a0in fiscal 2020 and around $80 million below most analysts' models at the time. To be clear, however, that \"light\" guidance was indicative of lost growth opportunities, but rather (according to Workday CFO Robynne Sisco during the ) \"the timing of these launches and the time it takes a new product to impact subscription revenue growth at [Workday's] scale.\"Even Workday's recent $540 million all-cash acquisition of Scout RFP, a cloud-based strategic sourcing and supplier engagement platform, is expected to contribute less than 1% to the company's consolidated subscription revenue growth this fiscal year.But let's pose another question: What happens to Workday shares at the first sign that those new products are finally yielding fruit -- or if the company extends its long-standing habit of underpromising and overdelivering with each passing quarter?As soon as those catalysts become clear, I see no reason the stock can't extend its recent gains and power above even its calendar 2019 highs (shares currently trade about 20% below those levels).

Its sales of $254 million in 2018 were nearly triple its 2016 revenue of $86 million.\u00a0In its most recent quarter, its top line increased a whopping 65% to $103 million from $63 million in the prior-year quarter.Unfortunately, Alteryx, too, has struggled with profitability -- it's only been in the black for two of the past five quarters. Its trailing-12-month net income of $13 million was just 3.7% of the company's $351 million in sales.\u00a0With its\u00a0share price up more than 80% this year, it now has a P/E of more than 500. Its P/S of 20 is higher than ServiceNow's, while its P/B of 18 is about half. Although its rapid growth has been impressive, that's not enough to justify its $7 billion market cap. Ultimately, though, those are still astronomical valuations. also provides software solutions to businesses, but it specifically caters to insurance companies -- offering InsuranceNow and InsuranceSuite to help with the underwriting and claims process for customers that may not have the IT capabilities to create their own tools in house.The company has carved out a healthy segment of the market, and in fiscal 2019, its revenue totaled $720 million, which was good for a modest 10% increase from the prior fiscal year.\u00a0In three years, Guidewire's revenue has increased by 70%. But it too has struggled on the bottom line, with its profit margin this past fiscal year coming in at just 2.9%.  With a net loss over the past four quarters, the company doesn't have a P/E ratio that we can evaluate today.\u00a0And its forward P/E, based on expected profits, comes in at more than 70, which is still very high. The P/S of 13 and P/B of around 6 are still high multiples, but they're at least somewhat more modest than the ratios of Alteryx and ServiceNow.Guidewire's share price is up over 33% year to date, even after its recently reported fiscal Q1 2020 results sent the stock lower. Prior to the Dec. 5 release, the stock was up more than 50% since the start of the year.The  on this list are expensive, and investors should be wary about investing in them today.

The software-as-a-service company has benefited from massive profit and stock price growth since its IPO in 2014. As a result, the question for investors is not if they should buy PAYC stock, but when they should do so.\tPaycom provides value by automating internal activities within companies. It does that by increasing the efficiency of training, benefits, payroll, and other HR-related activities. Moreover, unlike (NASDAQ:) products, Paycom\u2019s solutions also work well for small businesses. So with no other company offering a comparable product, Paycom can continue to grow rapidly while maintaining high gross margins.Paycom stock has soared by nearly 18 fold since its 2014 IPO at $15 per share. Since its IPO, it has risen steadily.\u00a0 Any interruptions in the company\u2019s growth resulted in modest pullbacks and quick recoveries by Paycom stock. Now, with the PAYC stock price exceeding $255 per share, it seems to defy gravity.I often talk about stocks that are cheap for a reason. PAYC stock is pricey for a reason, and the rapid growth of its profit helps explain why. Analysts, on average,\u00a0 forecast earnings increases of 28.1% this year and 25.4% in 2020. Most analysts expect similar levels of growth to continue well into the 2020s. Consequently, traders have bid the forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of PAYC stock to 89.The valuation of PAYC stock is cheap compared to other cloud equities.  (NYSE:) sells for more than 383 times its forward earnings. (NYSE:) trades at 400 times its forward earnings. Unlike Paycom stock, both trade well below their highs and have become further removed from fundamentals than Paycom. Meanwhile,\u00a0 Paycom\u2019s balance sheet and competitive position are stronger than those of its rivals.As I mentioned before, the hardest thing about PAYC stock is knowing when to buy its shares. Put simply, I see PAYC as an equity that traders should buy during its sharp pullbacks. The current price places it nearly 10% below its all-time high, which PAYC reached late in November. At that level, we do not know yet whether this drop is a breather or the beginning of another steep retreat.As recently as this fall, PAYC stock corrected by about 25% before fully recovering that loss and rebounding an additional 11% in November. In the last three months of 2018, it lost close to one-third of its value before staging a quick recovery.With PAYC stock, I think traders will profit most by buying the shares on pullbacks of 20% or more. Not only will they benefit from the longer term gains of Paycom stock, but its quick recoveries\u00a0 in the past indicate that it\u2019s more likely to rise quickly after sinking 20%.Paycom has proven itself to be a stable company whose shares will climb over the long-term. Through the cloud, Paycom has increased the efficiency of HR-related functions. Best of all, it has brought this benefit to small businesses, which make up the overwhelming majority of firms in the U.S. As a result, PAYC stock has produced massive returns for investorsHowever, that does not mean investors should buy PAYC stock at the moment. Though it may seem to rise endlessly, PAYC has has some notable corrections.But Paycom stock has shown that it can recover quickly from large declines. Analysts, on average, forecast annual earnings growth of 25% per year for the foreseeable future. So Paycom stock will likely keep climbing for years.\u00a0As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

If it can close above $48, it puts $50-plus on the table. Remember, for being a \u201cboring\u201d stock, this name has moved quite well this year.Below $48, and the 20-day and 50-day moving averages are on the table.

Unlike Campbell Soup though, Zscaler isn\u2019t trading near its 52-week highs.In any regard, it\u2019s holding up over the 50-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). It\u2019s a risky long position to take, but so long as ZS is over $46, bulls can stick with it.Over $53 and the declining 100-day moving average is a possible upside target. Below $46, and $40 to $42.50 is possible.\n\t\n\t\tSource: Chart courtesy of \n\tA few days ago,  (NASDAQ:) was rejected from the 100-day moving average at $180.

Bulls who want to go long may want to wait for the stock to reclaim the 50-day moving average and take out Wednesday\u2019s high.Moving above those marks puts the 100-day moving average back on the table.

The quarter was solid, but it wouldn\u2019t appear that way when glancing at WDAY stock.\tShares ended lower by 4.7% in the first trading session after the report. That\u2019s despite a top- and bottom-line beat and solid guidance. So what could have possibly dinged the stock, and more importantly, is the selloff a buying opportunity for investors?Earnings of 53 cents per share  by 16 cents. Revenue grew 26.2% year-over-year to $938.1 million and beat estimates by roughly $17.5 million.For guidance, the company expects fourth-quarter subscription revenue of $828 million to $830 million. That\u2019s ahead of consensus expectations, which stand at $826.8 million. After third-quarter results that beat expectations and estimates for a solid fourth quarter, management raised its full-year 2020 outlook. They now expect subscription revenue in the range of $3.085 billion to $3.087 billion, up from $3.06 to $3.07 billion.A beat-and-raise quarter followed by a near-5% correction \u2014 what gives?Management\u2019s outlook for 2021 is the culprit. They expect subscription revenue growth of roughly 21%, which is short of consensus expectations for 23.6%.It may seem silly to sell a stock in the face of mostly good news. Remember though, the stock market is a forward-looking mechanism. It doesn\u2019t care about third-quarter earnings all that much. It wants to know what to expect going forward. While management\u2019s Q4 and full-year outlook were solid, realize that this is basically one quarter of better-than-expected growth, while their 2021 forecast is four quarters of worse-than-expected growth.Source: Chart courtesy of <a href=\"stockcharts.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StockCharts.com</a>The mild post-earnings correction didn\u2019t deal a devastating blow to the charts, but it certainly didn\u2019t do WDAY stock any favors.Before Workday reported earnings, shares were rejected from the declining 100-day moving average. That fall sent shares down to the 50-day moving average, where they rallied ahead of earnings. The rebound looked encouraging, as it came at a critical moving average, as well as uptrend support (blue line).However, once earnings were out, WDAY stock took a tumble \u2014 blowing right through the 50-day moving average and uptrend support. The reaction wasn\u2019t favorable for bulls, but at least the stock now has a well-defined post-earnings range.A move below Wednesday\u2019s low (Dec. 4) and the 23.6% retracement near $162, and a drop down to $155 may be in the cards. Above Wednesday\u2019s high would be a sign that investors can go long. Not only would that put the stock over its post-earnings high, but it would also allow WDAY stock to reclaim the 50-day moving average and uptrend support.From there, a rebound up to the 100-day moving average is technically possible. So keep it simple: Below the 23.6% retracement is more bearish and could send shares to $155. A close above $168.50 is more bullish and could send shares higher.So where does all of this leave Workday stock? It\u2019s certainly a mixed picture.The last quarter was great and the next quarter should be solid. Management\u2019s view for the next fiscal year is okay, but below expectations. That discount is working through the stock price, which again, leaves the charts for WDAY stock in a mixed position.They\u2019re not great, but the stock isn\u2019t horrendously bearish, either.At the end of the day, WDAY stock may be too expensive for some investors \u2014 particularly given the mixed situation it\u2019s in. Near $166 per share, Workday trades at roughly 93 times this year\u2019s expected earnings. Analysts expect 30% earnings growth this year and 24% growth next year.If that growth comes to fruition, it still leaves Workday stock trading at 75 times fiscal 2021 earnings. Admittedly, it\u2019s not all about earnings \u2014 otherwise a massive number of stocks would not command the types of valuations that they do. It helps that WDAY stock is profitable and has positive cash flows that are accelerating at an impressive pace.But it seems as if maturing cloud companies \u2014 and I say that with a grain of salt, because it\u2019s hard to consider companies with 20%-plus revenue growth as \u201cold\u201d \u2014 are going through some growing pains.

GAAP = generally accepted accounting principles.\u00a0Workday's top-line growth was driven by a 27.9% increase in subscription revenue to $798.5 million, and 17.5% growth in professional services revenue to $139.6 million. Each of these figures arrived well above Workday's , which called for lower total revenue of $918 million to $920 million, subscription revenue of $783 million to $785 million, and professional services revenue of $135 million.On the bottom line, note that Workday's  earnings include the impact of items like acquisition costs and stock-based compensation. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, Workday generated net income of $126.1 million, or $0.53 per share, up from $0.31 per share and also well above analysts' consensus estimates for $0.37.During the , CEO Aneel Bhusri confirmed that the company added six new Fortune 500 customers and 11 Forbes Global 2000 customers for its core HCM product during the quarter, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Magna International, Royal Bank of Canada, and Sutter Health. Workday continued to effectively build on its momentum from fiscal Q2, when management revealed it counted over 40% of the Fortune 500, half the Fortune 100, and 17% of the Global 2000 as HCM customers.Meanwhile, Workday now boasts roughly 800 total customers for its financial management product, with notable new customers including the Asian-themed restaurant chain P.F. Chang's, the State of Iowa, advertising agency WPP Group, and an unnamed large \"natural and organic grocery store chain with over 85,000 employees.\"Finally, just subsequent to the end of the quarter, Workday announced a $540 million all-cash deal to acquire Scout RFP, a leading cloud-based strategic sourcing and supplier engagement platform.Bhusri stated:Companies of all sizes and industries continue to select Workday, and we're thrilled that as of the end of Q3, we have more than 3,000 customers and 42 million users. As our community grows, so do our applications. We recently announced plans to deepen our offering for the office of finance with the intended acquisition of Scout RFP. We also unveiled several ways our customers can leverage leading machine-learning capabilities that are powering our applications -- helping them to make more-informed decisions as they navigate this changing world of work.CFO Robynne Sisco added that the company \"executed well,\" noting that it is \"well positioned as we enter our seasonally strongest quarter.\"More specifically for the (current) fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Workday sees revenue ranging from $962 million to $964 million, including subscription revenue of $828 million to $830 million, and professional services revenue of $134 million. Most analysts were expecting lower fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $958 million.Looking ahead to fiscal-year 2021, however -- and with the caveat that the company is still early in its planning cycle -- Sisco told investors that Workday is expecting full-year subscription revenue to increase roughly 21% year over year, to $3.73 billion. That figure was well below Wall Street's models for fiscal 2021 subscription revenue closer to $3.81 billion.Sisco elaborated during the call that while Workday has \"a lot of new products coming to market\" next fiscal year, including Workday Cloud Platform, People Analytics, and its new Employee Experience product, those offerings \"won't start to have any notable impact on [Workday's] revenue growth until fiscal 2022 and beyond.\" And the Scout RFP acquisition won't be much help in the near term, either, adding less than 1% to consolidated subscription revenue growth next year.In the end, these might well be the right moves for Workday to continue  from its ever-larger base.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of the call. [Operator Instructions]And with that, I will hand it over to Justin Furby, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. -- Welcome to Workday's third quarter fiscal '20 . On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri, our CEO; Robynne Sisco our Co-President and CFO; Chano Fernandez, our Co-President; and Tom Bogan, our Executive Vice President of the Business Planning Unit.Following Aneel and Robynne's prepared remarks, we will take questions.

Also, the customer's page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.Our third quarter [Phonetic] quiet period begins on January 15, 2020. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2019. With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. -- Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter .As we highlighted at our Rising user conference in October, we are firmly established as a leader in cloud HCM applications, and increasingly strengthening our leadership position in the broader cloud financial management market. We're very proud of the company we've built with now over 3,000 customers globally, over 70% of which are live and in production. These customers have deployed Workday to help transform both the way they engage their employees and operate their business. We're excited by these success stories, as well as the thousands of other companies, we have the opportunity to help along their transformation journeys.With that, let's quickly review our third quarter results. Starting with HCM, we continue to gain market share with an industry-leading true cloud platform, which we believe has the deepest product capabilities, and unparalleled user experience and the highest levels of customer success. In Q3, we added six more Fortune 500 customers and 11 in the Global 2000. A few of the new HCM customers include Anheuser-Busch InBev, Magna International, Royal Bank of Canada and Sutter Health. Some notable go-lives in the quarter included Glencore International AG, The Dow Chemical Company and Telstra Corporation.Turning to Workday Financial Management, we saw continued momentum for our suite of applications in Q3 with new customers including Consumer Direct Care, P.F. Chang's, the State of Iowa, and WPP Group USA. We also had a natural inorganics grocery store chain with over 85,000 employees add financial management to its existing use of HCM.We now have approximately 800 total financial management customers, which include notable go-lives in Q3 of Rivera [Phonetic] and American Family Insurance. In addition to core financial management, Adaptive Insights Business Planning Cloud and Workday Prism Analytics continue to be a strong up-sell and add-ons to our core applications. In Q3 alone, Adaptive Insights added approximately 200 new planning first customers and approximately 50 new platform and upsell deals to new and existing Workday customers. Our momentum in customer success was best captured at our annual user conference, Workday Rising. Between our US conference in Orlando in October and our European conference in Milan last month, we welcomed more than 15,000 attendees, including more than 9,700 customer participants representing 2,250 organizations. At Workday Rising, we once again revealed our annual customer satisfaction rating, which was 97%. We are very proud of our customer success and the confidence they have in Workday as they embark on their digital transformations for finance and HR globally.Innovation has always been at the forefront at Workday and it continues to be a key to our success. As I highlighted at Rising, spend management is one of the areas where we are putting more focus on investment. We have designed Workday Procurement and Workday Inventory as part of our single system to streamline the procure-to-pay process and improve operational efficiency, driving down costs while enhancing supplier collaboration and engagement. We expect to accelerate our efforts in this area with the proposed acquisition of Scout RFP, a leading cloud-based platform for strategic sourcing and supplier engagement.With Scout, which has been a Workday Ventures portfolio company since 2018, Workday provide organizations a comprehensive source to pay solution with best-in-class strategic sourcing to help transform the procurement organization and deliver better business outcomes, including reduction in spend, greater policy compliance, and maximized engagement across key stakeholders.We're also thrilled to welcome Scout's employees, who share our passion for customer service and fund to Workday. We look forward to expanding our efforts in this area and we'll share more information as the deal closes, which we expect to occur in our fourth quarter. As we continue to focus on long-term growth, there are few leadership changes, I'd like to highlight. First, the appointment of Rich Sauer as our new Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Rich brings with him over 20 years of experience at Microsoft and we are excited to have him on board.I'm also pleased to share that Leighanne Levensaler has taken on a new role as our Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy. Leighanne is a 10-year [Phonetic] Workday veteran and one of our strongest voices of our products, values and vision. Moving forward, she will ensure our corporate strategy is in lockstep with our go-to-market strategy.And I'm also excited to share the appointment of Emily McEvilly into the role of our first Chief Customer Officer, overseeing the newly created customer experience organization. We are bringing together professional services, education services, customer success and customer support under one leader to continue our relentless focus on the customer and to drive new innovations that would deliver even more value to our existing and future customer base.We are in a great position heading into Q4 and we look to finish the year strong and now over to you Robynne. -- Thanks, Aneel and good afternoon everyone.On today's call, I'll provide highlights of our third quarter results, update our guidance for the fourth quarter and then provide a preliminary and high level view of fiscal 2021. We delivered another solid quarter in Q3 with total revenue of $938 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 26%. Our subscription revenue was $799 million, up 28% and professional services revenue came in at $140 million, up 18%. Revenue outside the US increased 38% year-over-year to $234 million, representing 25% of total revenue. Subscription revenue backlog was $7.19 billion at the end of the third quarter, growth of 22% year-over-year. Backlog growth was driven by solid results across net new bookings, add-on business and net retention, which was once again over 100%.Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months also grew 22% to $4.91 billion. Current unearned revenue was $1.8 billion in Q3, up 23% year-over-year, while total unearned revenue grew 20% to $1.88 billion. As a reminder, the Adaptive Insights acquisition closed in the comparison period a year ago, adding $140 million to the subscription backlog, $90 million of which was recorded on the balance sheet as unearned revenue. This one-time benefit created a very tough comp for Q3 for both backlog and unearned revenue.Our non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $143 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 15.2%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of top line over performance and favorable expense variance. Strong sales execution and a significant improvement in linearity within the quarter resulted in our strong top line beat.Additionally, we saw some marketing spend and hiring, originally anticipated in Q3 move into the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow in Q3 was $258 million, more than double our operating cash flow from Q3 FY '19.We continue to invest in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q3, we successfully added and integrated over 400 net new employees, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to more than 11,800. We are focused on maintaining operational efficiencies that will allow us to drive long-term enduring growth. Q3 was a solid quarter that positions us well as we head into our seasonally strongest and most important quarter of the year. Before providing updated guidance, I want to briefly touch on the Scout RFP acquisition, which we expect to close later this quarter. We're excited about the opportunity we see ahead in the broader spend management category and believe Scout's best-of-breed technology will accelerate our positioning in the market. It is important to note however that Scout's revenue base is still relatively small and when combined with the timing of the transaction and the required purchase accounting adjustments, it has a negligible impact on our fourth quarter revenue outlook.With that, I will now turn to guidance. Our focus remains centered on investing to support our long-term growth opportunity. Based on our over performance in Q3, but keeping in mind we face another very difficult comparison in the fourth quarter, we are providing guidance as follows.For subscription revenue, we're raising our FY '20 estimate to be in the range of $3.085 billion to $3.087 billion or 29% growth. We expect our Q4 subscription revenue to be $828 million to $830 million, representing 23% growth. We are raising our professional services revenue guidance to $529 million for fiscal '20, as we continue to focus on driving the highest levels of customer success. For Q4, we expect professional services revenue of $134 million. We now expect FY '20 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 13%, up from our prior guidance of 12.3%. This guidance incorporates estimated expenses related to the pending Scout RFP acquisition.The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margins by approximately 27 percentage points [Phonetic] in Q4 and for the full year. We still expect subscription revenue backlog growth in the low-20s in the fourth quarter and there is no change to our FY '20 operating cash flow guidance of $790 million. We have slightly lowered our FY '20 capital expense forecast for both owned real estate and all other capital expenditures, driven largely by the push-outs of certain projects into FY '21. We now expect the FY '20 capital outlay for our owned real estate projects to be $110 million and our outlay for all other capital expenditures to be $250 million.While we are early in our FY '21 planning cycle and still have an important Q4 to close, we'd like to provide a preliminary and high level view of FY '21. As a reminder, and as we discussed in detail at our recent Analyst Day, we have a lot of new products coming to market in FY '21, including Workday Cloud Platform, People Analytics and our employee experience solution. Given the timing of these launches and the time it takes a new product to impact subscription revenue growth at our scale, these emerging products won't start to have any notable impact on our revenue growth until fiscal 2022 and beyond. In addition, while we are very excited by the pending Scout RFP acquisition and the long-term opportunity that we see ahead of us in the spend management category, Scout is expected to contribute less than 1% to our subscription revenue growth in FY '21.With that context, we are currently planning for FY '21 subscription revenue of approximately $3.73 billion, growth of approximately 21% year-over-year. We continue to expect pronounced and compounding seasonality toward Q4, with our Q1 being the seasonally slowest in terms of net new bookings. We currently expect subscription revenue in Q1 of FY '21 to grow approximately 4% sequentially from Q4 FY '20. We remain focused on investing to drive long-term durable growth, while progressing toward our 25% plus non-GAAP operating margin goal.While we are still in our FY '21 planning process, our early view of FY '21 non-GAAP operating margin is approximately 14%, which includes roughly 1.5 points of expected dilution from the Scout RFP acquisition. Thought another way, without the Scout acquisition, we would have expected a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 15.5%.I'll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners and employees for their continued support and hard work, which allowed us to deliver great results in the third quarter and have set us up for a strong finish to the year.With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. -- Yes, thank you very much and congrats on the results. Aneel, I'm curious if you're seeing any material difference in the volume of HCM projects that are presenting themselves. If you were to look within the Fortune 500 or the Global 2000 today versus say 12 months or 18 months ago, whether there's a natural cycle there that kind of ebbs and flows over time. And then also, looking way out into the future, is there a timeframe where you think that that volume would converge in financials perhaps 5 years to 10 years down the road. -- So, I think our growth in the pipeline and I'll ask Chano to weigh-in in a second. For HR, it's actually been fairly steady over the last, not just 12 months to 18 months, but last 3 years or 4 years. This was another strong quarter in terms of Fortune 500 wins and Fortune 2000 wins. As we get to -- as we begin to close in on over 50% of the Fortune 500 running Workday, we're on that path to get there. We do look at the broader Fortune 2000 marketplace for HR and we look at -- and we look at more of the international opportunities in front of us, still a lot of healthy growth in front of us.For finance, and I'll just bucket everything else because in many ways the rest, finance planning, now procurement and Prism are really about the office of the CFO. That business continues to grow at a rate north of 50% as we see with 20% of the business and I think there is durable growth in that business for many years to come. I would hope in five years that that business is on par within five years, that business is on par or bigger than the HR business. It just takes time. And I would point you to the transition that Salesforce went through. They are six years older than us. One of our best partners, they went from being a sales -- a sales company to a sales and services company, to a sales and service and marketing company adding platform, now they've got analytics.We're going through that same journey and growth rates kind of ebb and flow as the different pillars take off. So, very optimistic on what we continue to see as continuing growth in HR, but healthy growth rates in the office of the CFO. Anything you want to add Chano? -- Mark, hello. To give you an idea, a data point, this Q3 we closed six Fortune 500 HCM financial customers, a year ago, it was four. To give you another data point, the pipeline on the Fortune 500 or large customers, more than Fortune 500, large HCM customers for the next 12 months is better or stronger than it was 12 months ago. That's another data point. So, it's not a direct correlation that some of those pending customers 175 give or take Fortune 500 customers are still coming to market and is not exactly basically, directly linear every single quarter as they come . -- Thank you very much.Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. -- Yes, thanks very much. I was wondering maybe if can just follow-up on Chano's comment around the pipeline and just sort of what's in the expectations. I guess, I realize this is a preliminary for '21, but is there anything -- I guess, do you expect that the financials demand will remain kind of the way we've seen it or is there opportunities for that to sort of take up? I'm just trying to get a sense on, I guess, what's embedded in that number, especially around the sort of the financials business, because I think we understand that HR business is -- where that's trending these days. Thanks. -- So we've got -- we've got another quarter to get through, but I think as we think about fiscal year '21, cautiously optimistic that all the pieces are coming into place. Planning and by the way I should mention, we're actually hosting the meeting from Adaptive's headquarters in Palo Alto today which is a nice thing and a fun thing, but planning and analytics and now with procurement, all the pieces are coming together to I think drive really exciting story. And so, nothing else -- I don't expect the momentum to slow down, maybe there is a chance it picks up, time will tell. It's a good question to ask us in the quarter. -- Okay. And maybe if I can just ask a quick follow-up on that point then. Coming away from Rising, it seemed that the combination obviously of having analytics and planning and financials together makes that entire decision more strategic for CFOs and I was wondering if you could just add some color, Aneel, on whether or not that actually is what you're seeing in your conversations, meaning it's getting beyond just sort of moving your financial system, the cloud is becoming much more of a strategic imperative and is that kind of why you feel still very confident about where this is going? Thanks. -- Absolutely. I would say before planning analytics, really, took off for Workday, we had a very competitive financial offering, and I think two things were at play. One, the CFO market in general wasn't ready to move into the cloud, and number two, just having a next-generation accounting platform or financial platform was necessary, but insufficient. The areas of planning and analytics, that's really what drives CFO decisions today, but they also realize that they do need to modernize their accounting system from a financial transformation perspective. So, all of a sudden now, it is not just, hey, we have to modernize it from a technology platform perspective, but look at all the benefits we get from a planning perspective, from an analytics perspective. And yes, even from a core accounting perspective, what we can do in terms of machine learning, what we can do in terms of tagging, so that you can create richer analytics, all those come to play. The story is just much stronger going into this year than it ever has been, and I think that the last piece that was -- that has come up more and more recently has been the area of procurement and the Chief Procurement Officer and with the acquisition or the pending acquisition of Scout, we feel on that one hole where we can be best-in-class and that pillar, which is increasingly important to the office of finance. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, thank you very much. Aneel, it looks like the trends in the quarter were certainly very encouraging. Linearity improved, your backlog growth was pretty solid and the market certainly seems to be wide open for financials whatnot. So, I'm just curious, what are the factors that could cause you to take up an even more positive view of the Company's growth expectation in fiscal '21, say, certain things happen in Q4 that materialize, what could cause you to taken an even more positive view, as positive as it is.And secondly, as the Company becomes multi-product company, how is the go-to-market strategy of the Company going to change? Thank you so much. -- I'll take the first part and then ask Chano to weigh in on the second part. What can we see in Q4 and going into next year, I'd say an increasingly -- an increasing percentage of Fortune 500 accounts coming to market for financials. We've --after waiting for a long time, they are now coming at a steady pace. What we saw in HR, there was a period of time where it accelerated. If that happen with finance, then I could see us -- then I could see us being more optimistic. When I look at our win rates, they are very high. When I look at the pipeline growth, it's very healthy. The ones that move the needles and are unpredictable are the large Fortune 500 transactions. And if those started coming in in bigger numbers, that would improve our opportunity for upside. Is there anything you want to add Chano on go-to-market and any other comments on that? -- Hey, Kash. And on go-to-market, I think, we highlighted data at our Financial Analyst Day. I think you should expect kind of three big focus. One around more dedicated vertical focus in the coming years. A second one, continue the global expansion and the opportunity we highlighted there with only around 11% penetration on the Global 2000. And the third one on increased focus on our selling to back to the customer base, especially with a broader portfolio of solutions that we have today. -- And if I could add one more piece of potential upside, when we acquired Adaptive, a little over a year ago, we were very focused on financial planning, but as they move into workforce planning, sales planning, operational planning, there's upside there in terms of providing a broader planning footprint, which we frankly hadn't really thought about a year ago. -- Thank you so much.Your next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. -- One question just on Prism, and then one on the macro. In regards to Prism, can you provide an update at all in terms of the cadence that the business is starting to experience in new use cases around Prism Analytics, and then maybe any feedback you can share with us in terms of the growth rate or maybe the shape of that overall size of the business today?And then, the macro question I wanted to give you, Aneel, just kind of, when you're thinking about the puts and takes of all of next year's guidance that Robynne guided to in the commentary, do you think that the overall environment, are you expecting the environment to be stronger, to be weaker or similar to what the business experienced this year? Thanks. -- So, that's a lot of questions in there. On the first one, Prism started out as a very powerful analytic platform that came pre-populated with effectively the Workday data model and the Workday data, and then we'd bring in other types of data and customers would write their queries and analytics against that. What we saw were a series of trends that pointed us in terms of building out use cases and the first one was People Analytics. And People Analytics is being received extraordinarily well by our customers. They view us as, hey, that's a great platform in terms of Prism Analytics, but you are an applications company, give us some applications capability and with People Analytics we've delivered on that.You can expect the same over time on financial analytics, spend analytics, additional pre-packaged set of analytics that are being informed by watching our customers and working with our customers to see what use cases they deliver. Robynne, do you want to comment on growth on Prism? That was another part of the question. And then I'll come back to the macro. -- Yeah, we're still seeing healthy growth on Prism. The numbers are still fairly small relative to core fins and HCM. So, it's not hugely moving the needle on our growth, but we expect that with the high growth rates in Prism, it will start contributing more and more to the overall growth next year. -- On your macro question, just looking at each other here, I think we're kind of expecting it to be the way it is. There has been, for a period of time --there's just been uncertainty in the air. It's hard to say it's going to get worse or going to get better. It's not easy to predict. We have the election next year, but I think what we look at --what we see in the pipeline, even with the uncertainty, our ability to close business, Q3 was a really important data point. We had some concerns there might be some slowdown, but we had a really good quarter and the business that we wanted to close, closed. So, I go into Q4 optimistic and into next year, I would say next year cautiously optimistic that it's going to be the same. And I think that's probably -- I think the world's just getting immune to uncertainty and people are just going about their business as if it's going to continue in the right direction and ignore the headlines in the press that would generally get us scared 5 years or 6 years ago. -- Thank you for answering all those questions. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. -- Thank you and congratulations on the quarter also. Can you give us some more color on the types of companies that are selecting Workday Financials at this point? The markets with a single country versus global financial implementations and how that is changing? And also a quick follow-up, can you give us a sense of how the back-end technology integration of Adaptive is going? Thanks. -- So, Chano will take the first one and maybe Tom Bogan can take on the second part. -- On the companies selecting financials are mostly global companies, mainly on the sectors we are more focused on and those are financial services, healthcare, professional and business services, among others. Clearly, US and Western Europe are most advanced in terms of financials cloud customers are the ones where you see more of that predominantly, but I would say it's mainly with a global focus seeing, I don't know, I would say 80% of the deals that we do are basically with a global footprint taking advantage as well of our localizations and the strength of the solution as a whole. -- Yeah, on the technology integration, we're making very good progress. At the time of the acquisition, we indicated that it would be a journey that would take us roughly 24 months to complete the full integration. Our design focus is to have an experience where customers have a seamless experience whether they are starting inside the core Workday applications or they're starting inside the planning experience. We have a design group of a set of customers who have worked very closely with us helping to guide our development efforts and initiatives. We still have some work to do, but we're really pleased with the progress thus far. -- Excellent. Thank you, Tom. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. -- Yes. Can you guys hear me? -- Yes, we can. -- Great. Thanks for taking the call and great to see the pyramid here, exiting the quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about the strategy with professional services into FY '21 and should we expect a change in the mix of the business contribution over time there? Thank you. -- I think our strategy has been the same for the last four years or five years. Once the large integrators embraced Workday, we tended to take a backseat to them running the projects. That's the Accentures, the KPMGs, PwCs, the Lloyds, IBMs of the world, Deloittes of the world. We have -- those are probably the big six. So anybody I missed in trouble [Phonetic]. Now, those are the big six. They have become very good partners over the period of time. And so, our professional services is very focused on being the product experts that basically supplement those large firms on the large-scale projects. In a handful of cases, there will be a customer that just wants to deal with one vendor and Workday will do the prime work on the implementation side as well, but that is not our core strategy. Our core strategy is to leverage the great partnerships we have. There's just a huge demand for Workday skills right now and in particular as financials and planning and Prism have taken off, we've had to supplement the market as they're ramping up their skills in those areas, but no change to strategy or to model. -- Got it. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. And I jumped on late, so I apologize if my two questions have been asked, but first of all, for either Aneel or Chano, with the Scout acquisition, can you help us understand maybe, is this a product that helps you may be change the trajectory or the adoption of financials ultimately? Or is this just another way to get a a footprint like Adaptive was within these customers to when they are ready to make these -- the changes to a cloud-based ERP that you're in a prime position to potentially win that business? -- So, I think actually Adaptive was slightly different than that. I think in some cases, Adaptive, as they are before us and a lot of other cases, Adaptive was the reason why we were chosen for the broader financials footprint. As the office of the CFO or the office of financials really turn their attention to moving into the cloud, it's become clear that part of the way they see the financials solution definitely includes best-in-class procurement and that's why we've seen companies like Cooper continue to do very well. I have a lot of respect for them. So for us, in order to -- I think, it does two things. It creates a new revenue opportunity. And down the road, it could even be a stand-alone revenue opportunity for spend management, but in the short term, it makes our financial products that much more competitive and there's new revenue, specifically, for the Scout product that we believe it's a -- it's an amazing product and an amazing team and now we get to leverage our sales force and our customer base to see how much more Scout we can sell. So, I think there is multiple dimensions to it, one of which is included -- increasing our competitiveness in core financials, but two, also adding some new revenue opportunity for us. -- Very helpful, thank you. And then from a follow-up perspective, Robynne, you've made a couple of at least for Workday, larger acquisitions over the last 18 months between Adaptive and Scout now going forward, but as you look at these acquisitions, is -- I guess, help us get a sense of maybe what the gross margin or operating margin contribution of these acquired assets with longer time. Will they be dilutive to the core Workday financial profile or is there a way that maybe they're additive in terms of raising margin profile longer term? Thank you. -- Yeah. So, I think longer term, they're definitely additive because we can operate at a larger scale and so get better economies of scale as we run the larger combined entity that we are. In the shorter term, obviously they're dilutive, Adaptive was dilutive, Scout will be dilutive as I discussed next year, but the goal is that they would actually be additive to our margins longer term. -- Yeah, I would just add there was nothing in their gross margin profiles that were that different from Workday. It's much more about where they were in their stage of growth. And then, we have the ability to leverage our sales channel, but from a gross margin perspective, that was not -- not impactful. -- That's correct.Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. -- Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I wanted to drill down a little bit into the progress you guys are making in sort of improving and expanding the capability to do off-selling into the existing customer base, particularly around ATM. I was just hoping for an update on kind of how that's progressing number one. And number two, for Robynne, really, sort of nice upside on margins this quarter. It sounds like a decent part of it was from sort of the pull forward of or sort of the push out of marketing expenses. I just wanted to sort of double check, just to make sure. Is there any kind of fundamental change in how you guys are thinking about the margin profile and sort of the speed with which you get to that 25% or is this just really sort of timing impacts in terms of margins? -- So, I'll start with the margin question. Really, no change in how we think about margin expansion going forward. We certainly expect to continue to march toward the 25% goal that we've set for us. This was really about a couple of things this quarter. One, the top line over performance, which was driven largely by better linearity, frankly, in month one than we have seen in over five years of the company. So, we certainly don't expect that that's going to keep repeating itself, but it was a big win for us this quarter and then the push out of expenses, like I said, into Q4 really is just the timing issue. So, we will continue to get margin expansion and see efficiency gains across all areas of the organization going forward, including R&D. -- Excellent.Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please proceed with your question. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, Aneel, with regards to the financials pipeline, it sounds like it's growing steadily. I'm wondering what do you think it would -- what would need to occur in order for the trajectory, the slope of the growth in terms of that pipeline to really increase what sort of feedback would we need to get from existing clients in order to get an even higher level of interest. That's the first part of the question.And then the second part of the question is, you made a comment with regards to maybe within five years financials could get to the same level of revenue as HCM. Would that require a slope change or how are you thinking about that? Thank you. -- Well, on the second part, just say when we're talking about financials, I am talking about the broader -- the broader officer of the finance solutions. So that does include analytics and that does include planning and Prism. And that's the way we think about it internally, not just the core accounting products. It is -- that full suite is really what is enticing these CFOs to move their finance applications into the cloud, and they're moving all of those collectively into the cloud.In terms of what would change the slope, I mean, I think we see the pipeline as being very, very healthy and I'll come back to what I said earlier, it would be a growing percentage of the deals coming from Fortune 500 accounts, and that's the -- that's what propelled Workday on the HCM side when we really went through, sort of the hyper growth era was when the Fortune 500 market almost in mass decided to go to the cloud. That's -- it's happening now, but it's not happening at the pace that we saw in HR that the market came at once. So, that would be one thing. I don't know if Chano you want to add anything else. -- I think Mark, what we shared on a couple of our Financial Analyst Days is where with this [Indecipherable] between HCM adoption and financials adoption and I'm talking now core financials over general ledger, was very similar. The difference is that HCM was -- it started more with large customers and the financials adoption is started more with medium enterprise customers. What we are seeing more lately, maybe because of the maturity of the solution, maturity of the market and confidence into that this brings a good value proposition to the office of the CFO, is that some more large customers are starting to move, right. We mentioned today, customers like WPP or an Asian customer, 80,000 [Phonetic] grocery customer that just became general ledger customer as well for us on some of the last ones, right. So, we are expecting from what the pipeline is reflecting that clearly it is moving up care, right.What we're seeing as well when we evaluate that we're average selling value in terms of customers in finance just is that, that is increasing nicely representing, of course, larger customers adopting financials and that's what we see represented on the pipeline, then we know it will remain a little bit of variance quarter per quarter. -- I'd end with one area that we're not necessarily counting on for growth, but we're seeing signs of interest and excitement is the state and local market. We've experienced great traction of our financial products and HR products and higher education. The state and local market has been much slower for both areas and with the State of Iowa turning to our products for financial management, that is a nice data point. There's -- the states are a huge market, it was a hugely successful market for us and PeopleSoft and we've been waiting for that market to start moving into the cloud, and hopefully the couple of data points we have suggest that that might be happening, and that's not something we're really planning on right now. -- That's great to hear. Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for two more questions. The first question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. -- Thanks for taking my question. I just want to drill a little bit into Internet on market. Could you give us some color, the progress on the Internet side and channel. You talked about 40% sales [Phonetic] growth outside North America. So, just wondering in your fiscal '21 guidance, what are your assumption back into the growth outside of North America. -- Yeah, I think that was more Robynne providing basically the growth of the international market, right. We are pretty pleased with the opportunity in the rest of the world. We're pretty pleased how those markets are growing. I mean, I don't want to set a proxy for every single quarter, but at least usually twice the speed that which we are seeing the growth in our North America markets, which is natural due to the lower penetration there that we commented on that 11% of the Global 2000 companies, in those market. We had great performance contributions in Q3 in places like that, the Germany, Austria, Switzerland, in places like Canada, some good growth in some of the continental markets in Europe. So, we're pretty pleased how internationally it's basically performing these days. We did a couple of leadership changes that they were required and we're much more excited for the potential and the opportunity and growth that we also see representing on the pipeline going forward. -- Thank you.We will take our final question from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. -- Great, thanks very much. Robynne, if I look at the 20% organic guide for fiscal '21, it would seem to imply a mid-teens HCM growth rate. So I'm trying to figure out how much of that natural decel in the business versus conservatism? Thank you. -- Yeah. So, a couple of things there. As I talked about during Analyst Day, right, our exit rate for the HCM growth is 20%. That certainly will fluctuate throughout next year given the large deal activities as Aneel talked about. So, that's one thing. Also, we have a really big Q4 ahead of us to close and that Q4 business will have an impact on next year. So, it's still very early days. So, we look forward to getting back to you with an update on next year and the next earnings call. -- Perfect, thank you very much.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Over the same period,\u00a0 Intel stock has an annualized total return of 12.94%.\u00a0Serving on the board of a Fortune 500 company takes time and energy.

The company forecasted $181 million in revenue and earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.42 for Q4.

Both are minor, known issues that the company is addressing. Even the disappointing Q4 forecast is only modestly lower than analysts' expectations, and it represents the shortest possible time frame for forecast results.\u00a0Image Source: HubspotIt's easy to label the stock's slide as an overreaction that departs from its past performance. But it could very well be a predictable, deeper issue that's inherent in growth stocks \u2014 aggressive valuations and high expectations are more sensitive to bad news and market downturns.\u00a0Hubspot carries a forward price-to-adjusted-earnings ratio of 88.5, which is exceptionally high.\u00a0Even adjusting for bullish growth outlooks, the stock still has a 2.05\u00a0\u00a0ratio. It also trades at more than 80 times its free cash flow\u00a0and nearly ten times its book value. The company has operating losses, negative\u00a0, and does not pay a dividend, so it can't even be evaluated on metrics related to those fundamentals.\u00a0These figures are noteworthy compared to other large application software companies, such as\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0, that have much more modest growth outlooks and correspondingly modest P/E and PEG ratios.\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0may be noteworthy examples of comparable enterprises with similar growth trajectories and cheaper valuations, but these companies also have different capital structures and solve different problems than CRM and marketing software firms.\u00a0However, Hubspot's valuation seems more reasonable when it's compared directly to competitors with similar growth outlooks, such as  and\u00a0\u00a0, which have forward P/E ratios of 52.6 and 131.5, respectively. Along with those two,\u00a0\u00a0 has a PEG ratio above 2.5. To gain exposure to enterprise software companies with Hubspot's growth outlook, investors should generally expect to pay a premium that's at least as high as Hubspot's.On a growth adjusted basis, Hubspot might very well be the most attractive valuation in its niche. However, this valuation assumes continued exceptional growth for the CRM and marketing software industry as a whole, with Hubspot maintaining or even growing its share. It's a crowded marketplace with dozens of formidable smaller niche players, as well as giants like\u00a0,\u00a0,\u00a0, and\u00a0. All of these companies offer solutions that compete directly with Hubspot's\u00a0.It is hard to claim that salesforce.com and Zendesk are clear, superior substitutes, but there are cheaper, broader application software names at both the high and low end of the growth spectrum. Hubspot bulls are betting on the company's outperformance in a very competitive landscape, as well as the sustained explosion of marketing software.

Revenues, at $887.8 million, beat the forecast by 1.8%. Shares gained almost 3% after the Q2 report, and are up 8.24% year-to-date. While underperforming the broader market, the stock\u2019s gains are real and stand on a solid foundation.Schwartz sees the company\u2019s solid base as a net asset, and key to its continued success. He writes, \u201cWorkday is a well-established franchise, industry leader, and one of a few software vendors that provides a single-system, end-to-end, enterprise-scale HCM, financials, and analytics software suite. Because all elements of Workday\u2019s application suite are fully integrated, customers can better manage their HR and financial management tasks in a single turnkey SaaS solution and without burdensome integration tasks.\u201d Schwartz goes on to add that Workday\u2019s product offers a solution for companies using obsolete legacy systems. His $225 price target suggests that WDAY has room for a 30% upside.All in all, the analyst community is mixed on Workday. TipRanks analysis of 22 analyst ratings shows a Moderate Buy consensus, but an even split recommending Buy or Hold. The $208.19 average stock-price  implies about 20% from current levels.

But today we\u2019re taking the road less traveled and spotlighting three software stocks to sell. Or at least stay away from. Their charts are deteriorating and have the bears\u2019 paw prints all over them.Three months ago, software stocks were the belle of the bull market ball. Their fundamentals flashed high growth rates and their charts showed massive momentum. But the tides have turned, the red-hot enthusiasm has cooled. What\u2019s particularly unnerving is their inability to recover amid a backdrop that has become increasingly favorable toward stocks. The past month has seen the  power through resistance with a consistent run of record-high closes.Meanwhile, software stocks are languishing near support, vulnerable for another round of breakdowns. Here are three of the weakest-looking components.Since peaking at $409.61,  (NYSE:) has fallen 37%. The reversal has carried SHOP stock below its 50-day and 20-day moving averages, both of which are now pointing lower. We\u2019ve seen multiple recovery attempts, but sellers sit heavy overhead and have squashed each one. With this week\u2019s drop, SHOP is now testing support near $290 for the third time.A breach of the floor could signal the next leg of the stock\u2019s descent has begun. You have two choices: First, steer clear of bullish trades until SHOP can climb back above the 50-day at $330. Or, second, enter bearish trades to capitalize on additional weakness.The high price per share and lower implied volatility make bear put spreads an intriguing idea. Buy the January $290/$280 put spread for around $4.The rollover in  (NYSE:) has mirrored Shopify with is glorious gains of the first half of 2019 being dismantled day-by-day. Fortunately, the magnitude of its losses hasn\u2019t been as significant as its predecessors. Thus far, VEEV stock is 20% off its highs.The posture of its moving averages looks worse, though. Unlike SHOP, VEEV has already fallen below its 200-day. Over the past few months, a descending triangle pattern has formed that is now on the verge of completion. A break of $138 will complete and confirm the bearish setup.If support gives way, then buy the January $140/$130 put spread for around $4. Your risk is limited to the initial cost, and the reward is $6 \u2014 which gives you the potential for a 150% return.The downtrend in  (NASDAQ:) is arguably the most established of the three. WDAY stock shattered its 200-day moving average in late August and hasn\u2019t looked back since. While the previous two candidates were sporting breakdown setups, Workday is offering a bear retracement pattern with clean entry, stop, and target levels.To confirm the rollover, wait for a break of Tuesday\u2019s low at $159.47. The first downside target is $150. If WDAY breaks back above the 50-day moving average at $169, consider stopping out.Bear puts are once again my strategy of choice here. Buy the January $160/$150 put spread for around $4 if the stock triggers. The risk and reward will be similar to the VEEV trade idea.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn\u2019t hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

But ahead of an expected September IPO, diligent investors and members of the media scrutinized the company's financials, revealing corporate governance issues and massive, growing losses that forced WeWork to shelve its offering. The company's valuation plummeted, CEO Adam Neumann was forced to step down and Japanese multinational SoftBank (), which heavily invested in WeWork ahead of the offering, recently gave the company a $9.5 billion \"rescue\" package that valued it at less than $8 billion.Before the anticipated offering, New Constructs  analyst Sam McBride called WeWork the \"most ridiculous IPO of 2019.\" Technically, he was wrong - the IPO never happened. Spiritually, he was right on the mark.WeWork's fall from grace has sent numerous recent IPOs and other net-income-deficient stocks lower. But don't give them up for dead. Unprofitable companies, once they reach a certain scale and their businesses evolve, can end up creating profits and rewarding shareholders with red-hot gains. Just ask longtime Amazon.com () shareholders.Here are 10 stock picks that might be losing money today, but shouldn't be forever. It could be a bumpy ride until they get over that hump, but once they do, watch out.\nMarket value: $36.3 billionIt's no coincidence that many cloud-based technology startups typically are losing money when they go public. That's because in many cases, they have  that require economies of scale to be reached before making a profit.Little by little, inch by inch, stock picks such as Workday (, $159.40) - which provides enterprise applications for human resources, financial management and business analytics functions - should secure enough customers paying for cloud-based services monthly to cover their expenses and deliver a profit.Workday is hardly a recent IPO - it went public in October 2012 at $28 per share, and it's worth 470% more than that today. However, while the company regularly announces profits, those are on a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis that includes other factors. On a GAAP basis, its losses have widened from $80 million in fiscal 2012 to $418.3 million in fiscal 2019.But that doesn't tell the whole story. That $80 million loss came on $134.4 million in revenue - about 60 cents of losses for every dollar in revenue. In fiscal 2019, Workday had narrowed that to 19 cents of losses for every dollar in sales - a reduction of 70%. At that pace, it should be profitable within the next few years.Workday's most recent quarterly report (Q2 of fiscal 2020) was so positive that the company raised its subscription revenue outlook for the full year. It now anticipates a year-over-year increase of about 28%.\nMarket value: $14.2 billionPinterest (, $26.25), the social media app for visually sharing ideas and interests, went public on April 17, 2019, at $19 per share. It didn't have nearly the buzz as the 2017 IPO for Snapchat parent Snap Inc. (), another image-based social media company.But long term, it does seem to have a better pathway to profitability.On Aug. 1, Pinterest announced second-quarter results that were off-the-charts good. Revenues exploded by 62% year-over-year to $261.2 million. Its adjusted (non-GAAP) losses were $24.5 million, or 6 cents per share - 28% narrower than the year-ago quarter's losses, and 2 cents per share better than what analysts were expecting.Pinterest also hit 300 million monthly active users (MAUs) during the second quarter, 30% higher than a year earlier. Of its 300 million MAUs, 28% were in the U.S., where average revenue per user (ARPU) is $2.80.Its opportunity outside the U.S. is tremendous. While ARPU is just 11 cents, that's still 123% better than it was a year ago. Meanwhile, international revenues nearly tripled, while its monthly active user count outside the U.S. jumped by 38% year-over-year.\"We also continued to grow and diversify our advertiser base and improve advertisers' ability to measure the effectiveness of their ad spend,\" CEO Ben Silbermann said in the Q2 press release. \"This is part of our larger and ongoing effort to create value for businesses on Pinterest.\"Revenues could top $1.1 billion this year. And the company expects annual profitability by 2021.\nMarket value: $14.5 billionTwilio (, $106.40) is a cloud communications company whose platform allows its customers to embed voice, messaging, video and email into their software applications so they can communicate more effectively with their customers. It's a leader in CPaaS (communications platform as a service), and Gartner projects that between 2016 and 2021, end-use spending on CpaaS infrastructure will grow by 50% annually, putting TWLO in the driver's seat for growth.Twilio is one of the best-performing public offerings in recent memory. It priced at $15 per share in June 2016 and has soared nearly 610% since then.But the company loses money. In fact, it loses a lot.In the first six months of fiscal 2019, Twilio shed $129.1 million in red ink, which was 171% more than the $47.7 million it lost in the year-ago period. That's despite revenues that jumped 84% year-over-year to $508.2 million.You can choose to see the glass as half-full. The company expects to earn a non-GAAP profit (after adding back stock-based compensation and other one-time items) of 17 to 18 cents per share this year. That follows an 11-cent non-GAAP profit in 2018, which flipped from a 19-cent loss in 2017. While the goal should be to invest in stocks that ultimately generate significant GAAP profits, the fact that Twilio has turned the corner and is making a growing non-GAAP profit is a big step in the right direction.Twilio finished the second quarter with 161,869 active customer accounts compared to 57,350 a year earlier. Part of the increase includes customers acquired from its $3 billion acquisition of SendGrid in February 2019. SendGrid specializes in helping software developers with email communications.And in August, Twilio launched Verified by Twilio, which allows companies to make phone calls that identify who's calling and the purpose of the call. The initiative is intended to improve the rate at which consumers answer calls. Approximately 70% of consumers won't answer a phone call from an unknown number.\nMarket value: $17.1 billionNetflix () CEO Reed Hastings recruited Anthony Wood to build him a streaming player in 2007. Hastings decided to cancel the project - but not before giving Wood $6 million to create the first Roku (, $146.88) streaming player a few months later in 2008.Wood has been Roku's CEO ever since.In addition to the sale of streaming players, Roku generates revenue by licensing its Roku TV operating system to manufacturers of Smart TVs and by selling advertising on the Roku platform, which includes the Roku Channel that it launched in September 2017.Recently, William Blair analysts suggested that Roku could be growing at a faster pace than Netflix at the same stage in its development.\"In our view, Roku will experience similar phased stages of international growth as Netflix did during its international expansion,\" analyst Ralph Schackart said in a note to clients Aug. 27. \"Looking at Roku's most recent nine quarters against those of Netflix in the beginning stages of Phase II, Roku, on average, achieved 9% quarter-over-quarter growth, compared with Netflix's average of 8%.\"Roku currently has 30.5 million active users. Schackart believes the platform will hit 80 million active accounts and $4.5 billion in revenue by 2025. The same analyst estimates that its ARPU will grow from $21.06 as of the second quarter of this year to $58 by 2025.Roku itself expects annual revenue to hit at least $1.1 billion this year. It will lose money this year, though it expects adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to be positive, in the realm of $30 million and $40 million. When you consider that Needham analysts expect Roku expected to capture a large piece of the $70 billion ad market in the U.S., the company is at least positioned to flip to a GAAP profit within the next few years.Just be careful. Kiplinger recently cited Roku among , and for good reason. The sellers knocked Roku down by as much as 44% in September amid streaming offerings by Apple () and Comcast (), though it has recovered much of that lost ground ever since, in part because Apple announced its new Apple TV+ streaming service would be available on Roku devices. Still, it's among the highest-priced of these stock picks at nearly 19 times sales, so it could face heavy downside pressure in a broader market dropoff.\nMarket value: $6.3 billionBeyond Meat (, $105.41), the manufacturer of plant-based meat alternatives, has helped spark a monumental change in the way people think about protein.Five years ago, few had heard about the term \"flexitarian\" - people who normally go meatless, but occasionally will eat meat or fish. Now, people who practice this diet represent Beyond Meat's most important customers.When Beyond Meat founder Ethan Brown started the company in 2009, his vision was to build meat products from plants to meet the global challenges of health, climate change, natural resource use and conservation, and animal welfare. While Brown was trying to save the planet, it would be hard to sustainably do so while targeting vegetarians and vegans, who account for 5% and 3% of America's population, respectively, according to a 2018 Gallup poll. But a 2018 OnePoll study shows that 38% of Americans consider themselves flexitarian.So, Brown created plant-based products such as the Beyond Burger that are indistinguishable from their animal-based counterparts. Beyond Meat's sales have grown impressively, from $16.2 million in 2016 to $87.9 million in 2018. But most important is its most recent achievement. Late Oct. 28, BYND reported its first quarter of GAAP profitability - 6 cents per share worth of earnings, compared to a $1.45-per-share loss in the year-ago quarter - on revenues that shot 250% higher to $92 million.BYND shares responded Oct. 29 by dropping as much as 24% in midday trading, which goes to show you there's more to stock performance than just profitability. In Beyond Meat's case, its lockup period - an amount of time after an IPO during which employees and certain pre-IPO investors can't sell their shares - expired, allowing these people to finally cash in their stock.Like Roku, Beyond Meat is among the more vulnerable stock picks out there because of its still-lofty valuation. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether this quarterly profit is just a one-off blip. But clearly, its operations are pointed in the right direction.\nMarket value: $8.3 billionCloud-based file-storage company Dropbox (, $20.07) reported Q2 2019 results on Aug. 8. Unimpressed investors sent the stock down by 13% in response, but Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis had a hard time understanding the reaction.\"All relevant forward-looking metrics for Dropbox were favorable this quarter, highlighting a revenue beat, upside to margins and operating cash flow, better-than-expected ARPU and a raised revenue forecast,\" Davis wrote in a note to clients. \"Ah, but the cup is 1/8th empty, and yes indeed Dropbox sinned against the Excel orthodoxy of unguided expectations.\"Davis is referring to the company's second-quarter ARPU of $120.48, which was just 3.3% higher than the year-ago period's $116.66 ARPU and slightly off last quarter's $121.04.However, Dropbox CFO Ajay Vashee attributed the decline to currency movements and said it should recover during the second half of the year. As the company continues to roll out the Dropbox app, which will completely change the user experience for the better, Dropbox's ARPU should rise.\"With the new Dropbox, you have a dedicated app. It's much more of a workspace instead of just a static list of files,\" CEO Drew Houston said during the earnings call. \"You see people and you see comments, and you see activity and all the things you'd expect in a real-time collaborative app. We think it is a generationally different experience from what other folks have.\"Dropbox's redesigned product will continue to make its way into the hands of clients over the remainder of 2019. You can expect there to be a few bumps in the road. But the company has produced positive quarterly net income, and long term, it should become consistently GAAP-profitable for years to come.\nMarket value: $3.6 billionSan Francisco-based Medallia (, $28.20) is a leader in experience management (XM) software - a  that helps companies interpret data signals from its customers to improve the overall customer experience.Medallia went public on July 18 at $21 a share, but while its current price is 34% higher than that, you can thank a massive first-day pop. Shares have lost a third of their value since peaking on July 26.While it's early in the development of experience management, Medallia's SaaS (software-as-a-service) platform uses deep learning-based artificial intelligence technology to help its customers understand the end buyer. In the process of capturing experience data, Medallia analyzes more than 4.9 billion experiences annually while performing more than 8 trillion calculations daily to help its customers make better business decisions.Wells Fargo's Philip Winslow was among the analysts to weigh in on Medallia early after the offering. He initiated the stock at Outperform (equivalent of Buy) and a $45 target price.\"The XM market remains early in its adoption lifecycle, as enterprises are only beginning to value the importance of ... incorporating experience data ('X-data') with operational data ('Odata') to improve their businesses,\" Winslow wrote in a note to clients. \"We believe Medallia is well positioned to capture the growing interest in XM with its holistic enterprise-grade solution.\"Medallia's prospectus says that the total addressable market of its experience management platform is $68 billion. That means its $246.8 million in revenues for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2019, were roughly three-tenths of a percent of its addressable market. If that's not potentially lucrative enough, Medallia recently broadened its focus from large enterprises to also solicit business from midsize companies.Thus, the fact that MDLA lost $82.2 million in that same fiscal year shouldn't be a concern for a business that's on the ground floor of a burgeoning opportunity.\nMarket value: $1.8 billionSome stock picks, such as Freshpet (, $50.50), offer products that are so good, it seems impossible for them to remain in a sea of red ink on a permanent basis.Freshpet got its start in Secaucus, N.J., in 2006. Its mission was to deliver real, fresh food to dog and cat owners. A note from the author: I'm a cat owner who has experienced firsthand how Freshpet's products kept my skinny, geriatric cat from starving to death. She wouldn't eat anything. Then Freshpet came along, and she couldn't stop eating. She's gone now, but the product extended her quality of life for at least two years.Pets are a massive market, and it's only getting bigger. The global pet-care market reached $125 billion in 2018 and is expected to expand to $203 billion by 2025. It has grown every year since 2001, including during the Great Recession. These are all reasons that even the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry has gotten involved, with the ProShares Pet Care ETF () launching in late 2018.Freshpet's revenues for the second quarter increased 26.1% year-over-year to $60.1 million. The company expects revenues to exceed $244 million for the full year, which would be an increase of more than 26%. The company hasn't provided net income guidance for the full year, but it does expect adjusted EBITDA to exceed $29 million, for 43% year-over-year growth. The analyst community sees the company flipping from a non-GAAP loss of 15 cents per share last year to a 5-cent profit in 2019.As it continues to execute its Feed the Growth strategy, Freshpet will continue to expand its distribution in the U.S., Canada and U.K. Slow and steady wins the race.\nMarket value: $810.6 millionTrupanion (, $23.30) is another  on the pet economy. It has been providing monthly medical plans for cats and dogs in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico since 2000.The knock against stock picks such as Trupanion is that the payouts for insurance claims often end up being much higher than the subscription revenues received by the company. Thus, the business model is inherently flawed.\"What's really, really problematic for them is that it's a grand exercise in adverse selection,\" PAA Research founder Bradley Safalow said back in August. \"They are acquiring their pets at the vet. So you're already acquiring pets that in a lot of cases already have health problems.\"However, the argument does fail to recognize that many pet owners take their animals to the vet to ensure they remain in perfect health. Much like humans go to the doctor for an annual physical or the dentist for routine cleanings.Also, the company's business model is extremely close to making money. The analyst community sees Trupanion slipping from a 3-cent-per-share loss in 2018 to a 13-cent deficit this year, but they project a 2-cent profit in 2020.Trupanion's total subscription pets enrolled during the second quarter (461,314) has climbed by 60,281 pets over the past 12 months. That's an additional $41.3 million in annual sales based on the monthly average revenue per pet of $57.11. If it continues to grow total subscription pets enrolled by 15% a quarter, Trupanion's scale will eventually work for it, not against it.\nMarket value: $1.2 billionLendingClub (, $13.23) got its start in 2006 as an online lending marketplace that brings borrowers and investors together to facilitate affordable credit. Today, it originates $1 billion in loans each month and has become a leader in the $130 billion personal loans industry.It has been frustrating, from a profitability standpoint. After 13 years in business, including five as a publicly traded company, it's still not generating positive earnings. But in the three years since Scott Sanborn has become CEO, the company's losses have dropped dramatically as it achieves scale and finds ways to operate more efficiently.LendingClub receives anywhere from 0% to 6% of the initial principal amount of a loan it originates for participating banks. In the second quarter, it originated $3.13 billion in loans, up from $2.73 billion in the first quarter and $2.87 billion in the fourth quarter. It also purchases some of the loans.LendingClub expects to generate between $765 million and $795 million in net revenues this year, after $694.8 million in 2018 and $574.5 million in 2017. Meanwhile, it expects an adjusted loss of between $20 million and $5 million, down significantly from an adjusted loss of $32.4 million in 2018 and $73.6 million in 2017.\"Since I took over as CEO three years ago, we have increased originations by 60% while tripling contribution dollars,\" Sanborn told investors during its August conference call about earnings. \"We are leveraging our data, scale and marketplace model to execute with discipline and compound our competitive advantages.\"Should it continue on this improvement, LendingClub could be making money by sometime in 2021.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors in Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY) saw new options become available today, for the December 6th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new December 6th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $155.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $155.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $147.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $156.14/share today.\n\nBecause the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.84% return on the cash commitment, or 41.03% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, and highlighting in green where the $155.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $157.50 strike price has a current bid of $6.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of WDAY stock at the current price level of $156.14/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $157.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.29% if the stock gets called away at the December 6th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if WDAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing WDAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $157.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $157.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.42% boost of extra return to the investor, or 37.47% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 44%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 46%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $156.14) to be 41%.

It\u2019s a sophisticated system that makes it easier for merchants to deliver their products in the US. It is based on advanced inventory technologies and backed by machine learning that helps with predictions.To bolster the network, Shopify spent $450 million to acquire 6 River Systems. The company is a leader in automation and robot systems for fulfillment.According to 6 River Systems co-CEO : \u201cBy joining Shopify, we\u2019re changing the game of fulfillment. Together, we will help thousands of businesses improve their fulfillment operations, with an easy-to-learn solution that can more than double productivity and improve accuracy.\u201dYet the fulfillment strategy will take time to have an impact on SHOP\u2019s financial results. But according to the , the early indications are that merchants are showing strong adoption.In the quarter, SHOP did post an unexpected loss of 29 cents a share, while the consensus estimate was for a profit of 11 cents a share. Although the company is investing heavily in research, development, marketing and global expansion, it is concerning that \u2014 despite the scale of revenues \u2014 there remain losses. This could be a problem going forward, as investors are getting more focused on profitability for tech companies.Next, competition is becoming a factor. Just some of the rivals include \u00a0(NYSE:),  (NASDAQ:) and  (NYSE:). There is even buzz that \u00a0(NASDAQ:) will make a play for the market.In the meantime, SHOP stock is already factoring in much of the good news anyway. Unless the company sees a big growth on the top line \u2014 with profits \u2014 it could be tough for the shares to post market-beating gains.Tom Taulli is the author of the book,\u00a0.\u00a0Follow him on Twitter at\u00a0.\u00a0As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["orkday (NASDAQ:WDAY), a provider of cloud-based human capital management and financial management software applications, saw its stock decline by ~14% over the last week, posting a drop of 12% in Wednesday\u2019s trading alone.\u00a0The sell-off came following the company\u2019s analyst day event, with indications that its bread-and-butter Human Capital Management (HCM) software business could see slower growth this year.\u00a0Separately, investors have been more circumspect about high-growth/ high P/E companies in the cloud software space, amid macroeconomic uncertainty with the ongoing trade war and concerns that a recession could be lurking around the corner.

It has got some investors wondering if now may be the time to snap up shares of Splunk. That\u2019s even if the chart suggests that now may not be the best time to do so.High-growth names like  (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:) and others have taken a big hit. Amid that mess,  (NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:), and  (NYSE:) have come under pressure, too. The .So what does that make Splunk stock?While Splunk stock is getting caught up in the selloff, it\u2019s worth noting that its  as other tech stocks. While many of the names getting hit have price-to-sales (P/S) ratios north of 20, SPLK stock does not. Shares trade at roughly 7.9 times this year\u2019s revenue estimates.Analysts expect sales to grow 28.3% this year to $2.31 billion. In calendar year 2020, estimates call for the growth rate to slow to about 22%, but that still equates to more than $2.8 billion in revenue.On the earnings front, analysts expect 43.5% growth this year to $1.91 per share. Admittedly, estimates for fiscal year 2021 do call for a slowing growth rate. However, they still expect earnings to grow 24.5% to $2.38 per share.Estimates are just that \u2014 estimates. They can be wrong. They can be adjusted higher or lower depending on how the company does. For Splunk stock, 7.9 times this year\u2019s sales and 58 times this year\u2019s earnings may not be cheap compared to  (NYSE:) or  (NYSE:). That said, these companies are not growing revenue at more than 25% or earnings at more than 40%.SPLK stock does have about $1.67 billion in long-term debt that it added to its balance sheet this year. That\u2019s roughly in-line with its cash holdings and about 65% of its cash and short-term investments.While Splunk does have positive FCF (and had decent growth), it will actually generate a FCF deficit this year due to a change in its billing process. Because of the way SPLK is now invoicing, the cash isn\u2019t received in the same manner as before. That\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s not the same as being FCF negative as a business.Splunk stock has been under constant pressure since topping out in late July. Since then, it has put in a series of lower highs, highlighted by purple arrows on the chart. It also has very well-defined support and resistance.Range resistance has come into play near $140, which has been in place for months. Range support is down near $107. The way I see the charts, Splunk stock has a few major downside zones.The first is range support near $107 and the 38.2% retracement at $106.61. Below that zone and the 2019 low of $99.49 is on the table. Just below that mark is the 23.6% retracement at $97.95. The fear is that, should range support fail to hold, SPLK stock will go on to make new 2019 lows.Should both zones give way \u2014 the $107 and $99 areas \u2014 then the last zone of support is near $90. This is where SPLK stock put in a triple bottom in Q4 2018.Just because we\u2019re mapping out these potential downside targets, doesn\u2019t mean Splunk stock will fall that far. But it\u2019s something investors should consider being a possibility.On the upside, I would love to see Splunk stock start to put in a series of higher lows off of this range support area. Back over the 200-day would be ideal, although that\u2019s a fair bit further from here. If range support holds, aggressive investors interested in the stock can start to get long.Otherwise, some investors will feel more comfortable either waiting for lower prices or for cleaner price action. Given the FCF change and the fact that it\u2019s caught up in a cloud selloff, it\u2019s hard to disagree with those that prefer to wait.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of  and is on Twitter .

It doesn't show any sign of letting up. Revenue grew from $8.4 billion in fiscal 2017 to $13.3 billion in fiscal 2019 (ended Jan. 31, 2019) and is expected to keep up the 20%+ pace in coming years.On its own, Salesforce should grow to $22.4 billion revenue by fiscal 2022. Adding revenue from Tableau, the data visualization company Salesforce acquired for $15.7 billion in stock, sales could rise to $24.5 billion by that date.All this has made founder and co-CEO Marc Benioff something of a tech guru, championing progressive social causes like climate change and homelessness. Most recently, he has pledged to close the gender gap in pay, saying the company has spent $10 million to make salaries more equal.The rap against Benioff is that he is pursuing growth at any cost. Sales Cloud growth is slowing so he is goosing the top line with acquisitions, according to this school of thought. The Tableau buy, in this view, is just a bigger version of the earlier $6.5 billion acquisition of MuleSoft, a company that added an API integration system to the mix.That may be selling Benioff short. The Tableau acquisition, completed in August, significantly expands Salesforce's total accessible market at a time when its dominance in the sales cloud world results in slower growth. Digital transformation -- the buzz word for reimagining sales, marketing, and customer service into something different -- is a market estimated to reach $1.8 trillion by 2022.Salesforce can leverage its broad customer base into this new dimension. Co-CEO Keith Block said in August that customers are turning to Salesforce precisely for this digital transformation, citing , ,\u00a0and \u00a0as examples.Joining Salesforce's AI-powered Einstein to the data analytics and visualization capabilities of Tableau is supposed to be the world-beating combination that propels Salesforce to further growth.

To justify his relative bearishness, Reback similarly expressed worries in part that HCM segment sales growth is slowing as Workday grows from a larger base.Finally, Deutsche Bank's Karl Keirstead echoed the sentiment for slowing HCM growth, adding that some new deals could be delayed given today's uncertain macroeconomic environment. Keirstead also took issue with Workday management's \"noncommittal\" approach to achieving improved margins next fiscal year.It should come as little surprise that Workday's growth might slow with larger clients, considering it already  of the Fortune 500 as customers as of last quarter.

Now investors want to know, can ADBE reclaim the 200-day and downtrend resistance or are lower prices in store?If it\u2019s the latter, look for a decline down into the $258 to $260 area. There it will find a notable level of support as well as the 50% retracement. If that fails to hold, ADBE stock may be in trouble. On the upside, the charts are pretty cluttered until Adobe can clear the 50-day moving average. (NASDAQ:) is very much a mixed picture ahead of the company\u2019s earnings report on Wednesday after the close.On the plus side, shares have broken out over downtrend resistance (blue line) and are maintaining above the 20-day moving average. On the downside, they are stuck below the 50-day moving average and the 38.2% retracement.So what now?Should shares decline, look to see if the 23.6% retracement at $267.75 can support the name. If not, $260 could be on deck, with the September low of $252.28 below that. Below the September low and the December low is possible.On the upside, see that NFLX reclaims and holds the 50-day moving average and 38.2% retracement. Above that opens the door to the 50% and 61.8% retracements at $308.61 and $326.81, respectively. (NYSE:) was mixed on Wednesday after it reported earnings. However, with clear-cut support nearby and breakout potential, it\u2019s worth watching.Look at the past year of action. Shares have a consolidation period, then tend to break out to new highs and consolidate again. The old highs also tend to become support.Luckily, the prior highs near $79 to $80 also intersect with the 200-day moving average and 61.8% retracement. That makes it a pretty solid risk/reward area for investors. Below $79 and traders may consider stopping out.On the upside, see if ABT stock can break out over downtrend resistance and the 50-day moving average.

On the surface, Workday's revenue growth looks rock solid.YOY = Year-over-year Source: Workday quarterly reports.However, there's a growing concern that Workday is running out of room to grow in the HCM market. In response, it's expanding its ecosystem by cross-selling new services tools for ERP (enterprise resource planning), financial tools, analytics, and credential management.Unfortunately, tech giants like , , , and \u00a0are all bundling similar tools into their cloud-based services. Workday is also courting smaller companies and overseas customers, which are more exposed to macro headwinds than big Fortune 500 companies. These moves indicate that it's expanding into less reliable markets to offset the slowdown of its core HCM business.Several analysts immediately expressed their concerns after Workday's analyst day presentation. RBC Capital, which maintained an \"outperform\" rating on the stock, cut Workday's price target from $225 to $212 and warned that its growth was slowing due to a high \"penetration of large accounts.\" Analysts at Stifel and Deutsche Bank echoed\u00a0 about its HCM business.Macquarie, which maintained a \"neutral\" rating with a $196 price target, warned that several of Workday's new products (like ERP, analytics, and blockchain-enabled credential tools) would be \"difficult to monetize.\" Citi, which rates the stock as \"neutral\" with a $192 price target, dubbed its shift toward international and mid-market customers as \"lower-confidence sources of growth.\"Image source: Getty Images.Jefferies, which maintained a \"hold\" rating with\u00a0a $188 target, also noted that similar  (SaaS) companies are growing at comparable rates with higher margins and cheaper valuations.Analysts currently expect Workday's revenue to rise just 27% this year and decelerate to 23% next year.

It's also one of the few cloud companies to remain profitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP measures.

That performance, combined with the company\u2019s revenue and profit growth, has caused the multiples of Splunk stock to fall. And bulls would argue that some of the relative weakness has come from a misunderstanding surrounding the company\u2019s cash flow guidance.After all, Splunk stock fell after its Q2 results partly because of its cash flow guidance. Splunk\u2019s guidance went from $250 million to -$300 million, a seemingly huge change. But bulls would argue that the shift was caused by the company\u2019s transition to a subscription model. That transition creates uneven sales growth, meaning the guidance change indicates little, if any, alteration of Splunk\u2019s long-term cash flow.That guidance overshadowed a strong report, as SPLK\u2019s software revenue jumped 46% year-over-year. The bull case is that the company\u2019s growth outlook remains intact, while short-term concerns have moved SPLK stock to a lower and more attractive valuation.Wall Street analysts seem to agree; their average price target on SPLK stock is about 25% above its current price. Last month, Raymond James said the company\u2019s could boost Splunk stock in the near-term.The bull case on SPLK is intriguing, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see SPLK stock break out at some point. But the shares pose some risks as well.For one, SPLK might well be cheap on a relative basis,\u00a0 but that doesn\u2019t guarantee that the shares will rise. Eight times revenue, even with Splunk\u2019s attractive gross margins, still prices in quite a bit of growth. Moreover,\u00a0 Splunk stock lost about a third of its value during last year\u2019s Q4 stock-market selloff. If the stock market tumbles again, SPLK stock will fall further.The other considerable risk is on the competitive front. Splunk is the leader in log management,\u00a0 but it has some tough competitors.  (NYSE:), for example, offers an open-source ELK Stack which allows customers to build their own log management systems, as opposed to buying them from Splunk. (NASDAQ:), which recently launched its IPO, is another competitor. Datadog offers a unified platform that includes log management, but also infrastructure, cloud, and application-performance monitoring. DDOG is trading at roughly 20 times its revenue, suggesting that investors are bullish on its outlook.Both Datadog and Elastic have posted stronger revenue growth than Splunk of late, although both are doing so from lower revenue bases than SPLK.For software-as-a-service (SaaS) investors, then, SPLK probably is at the top of the list. Its valuation might be questionable, but it is quite attractive relative to what investors have been willing to pay for growth stocks in recent years.But I\u2019m not sure Splunk stock quite gets to the point of being compelling for those investors who aren\u2019t focused on growth stocks.SPLK is facing risks. The shares probably can grow into their forward price-earnings multiple of 40+. But it only takes one earnings miss for competitive risks to move to the forefront of investors\u2019 minds.Given the performance of Splunk stock over the past 12+ months, it does seem worth staying on the sidelines and hoping for a better entry point. SPLK probably is cheap, but it\u2019s a little too cheap. And there are reasons why it could get even cheaper.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["U.S. equities still are trying to find their footing.

And that might well create an opportunity.After all, this has been a market where growth stocks have outperformed value stocks for years.

That return dwarfed the 117% gain in the .Those returns have come down of late, however. The index has pulled back 16% from July highs. Some components \u2014 most notably  (NYSE:), whose  \u2014 have fallen even further.Admittedly, to some investors, the pullback seems like a long-awaited and much-needed correction. Revenue multiples of 10x and even 20x are not uncommon among cloud growth stocks. The opportunity in software-as-a-service is enormous. The valuations remain equally so.But for those who favor growth stocks, the pullback might well seem like an opportunity. Cloud stocks aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 but they shouldn\u2019t be. Growth should continue for years, if not decades. The operating model depresses near-term profits as new customers are acquired, but it results in predictable, \u201csticky,\u201d high-margin revenue for years to come.These 10 cloud growth stocks all are components of the Emerging Cloud Index. And all 10 look at least more attractive after the sector-wide weakness. Admittedly, none seem notably cheap \u2014 and there\u2019s no reason selling pressure can\u2019t continue in the near term. Still, for those who have missed out on the gains so far, the new lower prices do create more attractive entry points to finally hop on board.\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\t (NYSE:) admittedly is a somewhat odd choice for this list. SQ stock isn\u2019t quite the pure-play SaaS stock that many others in the index are. Its payment processing revenues are more cyclical and lower margin.SQ stock also saw its selloff first. Cloud stocks on the whole fell during the market-wide selloff in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Square stock wasn\u2019t immune: It fell by roughly half over that stretch. But unlike other cloud growth stocks, it hasn\u2019t recovered. SQ stock still sits 40% below last year\u2019s highs.All that said, I wrote a month ago that Square stock was  among growth stocks. I still believe that\u2019s the case. Investors repeatedly have punished SQ for supposedly disappointing guidance \u2014 and failed to reward the company for beating that guidance each time.Here, too, valuation isn\u2019t necessarily cheap. But there\u2019s an obviously enormous opportunity. Square can grow into a current roughly 50x forward multiple (backing out cash). SQ still trades at a substantial discount to SHOP, its fellow small-business-focused play. I\u2019d be surprised to see the stock re-test December lows of $50 \u2014 but if it does, I\u2019d see that as a potentially compelling opportunity.\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\tI\u2019ve recommended  (NASDAQ:)  and I don\u2019t see any reason to stop now.

It trades at just 28x forward earnings \u2014 only a few turns higher than MSFT, whose growth is far lower. A return to May levels, at which the stock , seems like a gift.Like so many stocks on this list, ADBE already has soared, which might suggest the gains should be coming to an end.

It touched a seven-month low in August, and is threatening to re-test those levels.

Salesforce has grown revenue at a 20%+ clip like clockwork. It was the  to reach $13 billion in revenue.

The only stocks in the index remotely comparable are  (NYSE:),  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:). Those three companies all have seen a dramatic deceleration in growth already \u2014 yet all three trade at a premium to TWOU on an EV/revenue basis.Of course, the reason for TWOU\u2019s low revenue multiple is a disastrous second-quarter report at the end of July. The stock fell a shocking 65% in a single session the following day.As I noted in calling out 2U as one of the , there are risks in trying to time the bottom. There\u2019s a real question as to whether the online education space will be as profitable as hoped. 2U is throttling back its growth to get spending in check. The issue with Q2 is not that the company\u2019s results \u201cmissed\u201d estimates. The concern is that the very business model is threatened.But in a space with few, if any, true value plays, TWOU stock is an intriguing and high-risk play. It\u2019s still the leader in its industry. An acquisition by a publisher like  (NYSE:, NYSE:) wouldn\u2019t be a shock, given Wiley\u2019s so-far-unsuccessful efforts to enter the space at scale.

The opportunity for the company\u2019s connected planning platform seems enormous.

PLAN stock still is up almost 188% in less than a year from its .At the moment, the long-term rewards seem to outweigh the risks. But further near-term weakness would hardly be a surprise. At 22 times revenue, PLAN isn\u2019t cheap.

At $19, that case still holds.Dropbox has an enormous base of users \u2014 well over 500 million at the end of the second quarter. The number of paying users continues to grow, as does average revenue per user.That growth should get DBX stock to a reasonable valuation relatively soon. At 34 times forward earnings, it\u2019s not like the stock is shockingly expensive. And that user base and the obvious utility of its service makes Dropbox an intriguing acquisition target, with Microsoft and Salesforce .Of course, that opportunity is a bit of a double-edged sword at the moment. The long-running fear for Dropbox \u2014 and a key reason why the stock trades well below its post-IPO highs from last year \u2014 is that ostensible acquirers could choose simply to outcompete Dropbox.Microsoft,  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) and (NASDAQ:), in particular, can go after the company\u2019s market share simply by marketing existing products to their own massive user bases. Indeed, InvestorPlace\u2019s\u00a0Will Healy made that case last year in  to America Online, which is now part of (NYSE:).That said, that competition already exists and Dropbox still is growing nicely. Demand for its services isn\u2019t going to wane.

The human capital management software developer went public in 2014 at $15 per share. By late August, the stock was at $259.It\u2019s not hard to see why. Growth has been fantastic. The company has been an earnings report juggernaut: It hasn\u2019t missed Street expectations once, on either the top or bottom line, since going public. It\u2019s provided everything investors want from growth stocks \u2014 including enormous upside.That hasn\u2019t been enough to insulate the stock from selling pressure in recent weeks, however. PAYC has pulled back some 21%. That\u2019s enough to make the stock look at least interesting.Admittedly, PAYC still looks hugely expensive on a revenue basis, at over 18 times trailing twelve-month revenue. But its margins already are enormous, bringing profit-based valuations in. PAYC trades at less than 50 times 2020 earnings per share estimates. And that consensus suggests 25%+ year-over-year growth. Assuming the recent trend of earnings beats continues, those multiples will come down.And Paycom is , with  (NYSE:) and  (NYSE:) among the logical buyers. For growth stock investors who see the category weakness as an opportunity, PAYC stock would be an attractive way to take advantage.\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\t (NASDAQ:) is yet another attractive \u201cbuy the dip\u201d candidate. PYPL has dropped 19% since late July \u2014 on really very little in the way of news.The revenue outlook given with second-quarter earnings was cut, but only modestly. Adjusted EPS guidance actually came up. PYPL now trades at about 31 times the midpoint of that guidance \u2014 hardly an onerous multiple given valuations in the payment space.That sector still has years, and maybe decades, of growth ahead \u2014 and PayPal should be able to capitalize. The  of  (NASDAQ:) will hurt, but this looks like a short-term pullback before the long-term rally resumes.\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\tAnother strong secular trend is the growing need for cybersecurity solutions. One  to play that growth is  (NASDAQ:).Interestingly, PFPT stock has dodged the general weakness afflicting SaaS stocks. It actually briefly touched an all-time high last week. Resistance has held repeatedly around current levels, but a strong Q3 report this month could lead to a breakout\u00a0 \u2014 and more upside.Like most cloud growth stocks, Proofpoint stock isn\u2019t cheap. But a 60 times forward price-to-earnings multiple, against a nearly 30% EPS growth rate, means the company can grow into that valuation. Strength in both Proofpoint products and the industry as a whole suggest Proofpoint should easily be able to do so.\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\tInvestors might do well to put enterprise software developer  (NASDAQ:) on their watch lists for the time being. WDAY stock looks like a classic falling knife, with a 27% decline in less than three months and no sign, yet, of a bottom.Meanwhile, as InvestorPlace\u2019s Luke Lango pointed out last month, Workday posted  report \u2014 and still sold off in response. That reaction from the market suggested, Lango wrote, that WDAY was overvalued heading into the release.Of course, WDAY was threatening $200 before the Q2 report and hit $225 in July. It\u2019s now at $170 and falling. The company still receives an 12x multiple to 2019 sales even after the decline, but valuation at the least is more reasonable.If that valuation continues to come in, WDAY looks like a strong play. The company is one of the largest SaaS plays out there, with revenue clearing $3 billion. Its diversified reach should keep it a behemoth for years to come. And Workday could be an acquisition target down the line, even at a current market cap of $39 billion.Again, WDAY looks like a falling knife and that\u2019s always dangerous from a trading standpoint.

Ju also sees strong advertising growth pushing up free cash flow more than expected, along with strong growth in the cloud computing segment. Ju reiterated his outperform rating on the stock Wednesday morning.This price target boost comes soon after Amazon began to reduce the number of low-priced items subject to its \"add-on\" program. Previously, many cheap items would only ship with orders of $25 or more, regardless of whether the customer was a Prime member. Amazon is  for Prime members.This move will certainly help Amazon gain market share, but it's unlikely the company can turn a profit by shipping low-priced items individually, even with its own logistics infrastructure. This will make it difficult for Amazon to expand its e-commerce operating margin, and it's a questionable strategy given the pressure  are already putting on the company.Amazon's management will likely provide more details on its low-priced-item strategy during the  later this month.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new November 22nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $170.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.80.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $170.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $162.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $171.12/share today.\n\nBecause the $170.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.59% return on the cash commitment, or 37.18% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, and highlighting in green where the $170.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $172.50 strike price has a current bid of $7.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of WDAY stock at the current price level of $171.12/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $172.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.42% if the stock gets called away at the November 22nd expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if WDAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing WDAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $172.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $172.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.62% boost of extra return to the investor, or 37.41% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 43%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 44%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $171.12) to be 41%.

Until buyers can muster the strength to vault back above it, the technical picture will remain bearish.Source: Shutterstock\n\tAhead of the bell, futures on the are down 0.76%, and  futures are lower by 0.62%.  futures have lost 0.60%.In the options pits, Friday\u2019s slide propelled put volume ahead of calls on the session, while overall volume settled near average levels. Approximately 16.1 million calls and 16.5 million puts changed hands.The pop in put demand spilled over to the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio jumped to 0.68 \u2014 a one-week high. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average slipped to 0.67.Options traders zeroed in on earnings reports Friday.  (NASDAQ:) shares plunged 30% after the company slashed forward guidance.  (NASDAQ:) slipped below support despite beating earnings estimates. Finally,  (NYSE:) saw its third down day in a row, offering an attractive buy-the-dip opportunity.Let\u2019s take a closer look:Ulta Beauty rose from obscurity over the past decade to become one of the biggest gainers of the bull market. But Friday\u2019s 30% plunge revealed all is not well with the American chain of beauty stores. As with many high-flying momentum stocks that fail to live up to lofty expectations, ULTA stock was beaten mercilessly after reporting worse-than-expected second-quarter earnings and lowering full-year guidance.Ulta\u2019s earnings-per-share grew to $2.76 on $1.67 billion in revenue. While both metrics marked modest growth, the uptick wasn\u2019t good enough. Analyst estimates were looking for $2.80 in EPS on $1.75 billion in sales. Citing \u201cheadwinds\u201d in the cosmetics market, the company lowered its full-year EPS forecast by almost a buck, from $12.83-$13.03 to $11.86-$12.06.Time will tell if Friday\u2019s 30% haircut was sufficient to price in the earnings downshift. The next major support zones to watch are $220, then $200.Options trading exploded with calls outpacing puts on the day. Total activity rocketed to 17x the average daily volume, with 128,030 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 59% of the take.Premiums were pricing in a gap of just under 7%, so the 30% slashing was a monster move. Traders harnessing long volatility plays like straddles or strangles came out massive winners for the event.The trend of selling earnings results continued with Workday ahead of the weekend. The provider of human resources software slipped 5.5% despite reporting better-than-expected numbers.For the quarter, Workday posted earnings of 44 cents per share on revenue of $887.75 million. Both measures bested estimates, but investors wanted even more. With Friday\u2019s beatdown, WDAY stock has now fallen 22% off its highs. It now rests below all major moving averages with the 50-day and 20-day both trending lower. Volume patterns aren\u2019t helping the bull case either, with multiple distribution days cropping up over the past six weeks.On the options trading front, calls slightly edged out puts in popularity. Activity swelled to 629% of the average daily volume, with 80,254 total contracts traded; 52% of the total came from calls.With the uncertainty of earnings in the rearview mirror, implied volatility plunged to 36% or the 25th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of $3.97 or 2.2%.Shopify shares suffered their third straight down day ahead of the weekend amid well-deserved profit-taking. Chart watchers shouldn\u2019t be concerned one bit over the bout of selling. It was perfectly benign and was likely due to garden variety register ringing after a substantial $100 rise in SHOP stock.After rallying almost $14 off the lows, SHOP only ended the day down 1.6%. Volume was slightly above average, but nothing high enough to scare the children. All-in-all, I\u2019m taking Shopify\u2019s appearance atop the most-active options leaderboard as an excuse to highlight its beautiful uptrend and rock star 2019 performance. The shares are up 178% year-to-date.The cloud-based commerce company saw a sharp uptick in options trading.

All three stocks to trade report later in the week and there are opportunities to discuss.But first we have to place these stocks to trade within the proper framework on Wall Street. The last few days have been violent in the markets. This is due to a whirlwind of headlines.As a result, equities faltered as the rush for safety trades have taken center stage. Bond yields are still falling into an abyss, which is an unknown that makes most investors nervous.So in addition to evaluating the validity of the trade setups themselves for ULTA, WDAY, and BBY, we have to also consider the overall moves in the stock market. Nevertheless, there are clues within the individual charts themselves.In the realm of retail stocks, there aren\u2019t many clear winners. ULTA is one of the few exceptions as they have been able to perform better than  (NASDAQ:). Year-to-date ULTA stock is up 36% which is double that of Amazon and the . Clearly the company is doing something right for investors to give it that much credit in uncertain times.Similar to  (NYSE:), they control their inventory and they have a loyal following. Rarely do they give Wall Street a real reason to sell the stock from internal operation flubs. ULTA stock is not cheap on the face of it. It sports a high-ticket price tag at $330 but that doesn\u2019t mean it is expensive. In fact, it sells at 28 price-earnings ratio and that is modest for how well it is performing.In short, ULTA stock is worthy of holding for the long-term for as long as this expansion in the U.S. continues. The consumers are employed and they are spending with vigor. And that spells great opportunity for ULTA stock.The options markets expect a +/- $26 move this week so betting on binary outcome for the short term is not easy to stomach. If I\u2019m long the stock with conviction then the reaction to the earnings report shouldn\u2019t matter all that much. There are some tricks in the options market to protect for free.For those who are looking to own ULTA stock for the long term, taking a starter position ahead of the earnings is reasonable. If the whole market holds up this week, then ULTA could even rally ahead of the event itself.I have been a critic of BBY stock. I\u2019ve disagreed with Wall Street experts who tout that they have solved the AMZN riddle. The stock action itself reflects the disagreement as it falls in and out of favor among investors.Best Buy is the only game in town so they should be thriving yet their success is debatable. So there could be something wrong with the setup of BBY business model. This is not to discount the efforts of the company itself, but they are up against some tremendous headwinds.What works for BBY stock here is that it\u2019s fundamentally cheap. It sells at only 12 price-to-earnings ratio and less than half times its sales. So clearly investors are not giving it a lot of slack. With this little fat built into the stock, the earnings reaction should not be extremely negative.So if I\u2019m holding the stock, I would be nervous but not enough to panic out of it. The caveat is that BBY management doesn\u2019t deliver a surprise debacle. In that case, if BBY stock loses $62 per share it can trigger a bearish pattern that would target $56 per share. This is not a forecast, but it is a scenario that exists.Conversely, if the bulls are able to break above $69 per share, Best Buy stock could retest $74, which was the most recent failure level. The problem with this setup is that BBY stock price is stuck between two pivot zones where there is congestion so it\u2019s hard to rally up or down from it. That\u2019s why between this or ULTA, the first would be my favorite bullish trade this week.The new world order of business is to use the cloud.  (NYSE:) set the standard and since then all companies are striving for it. Amazon built AWS to make that possible. And companies like WDAY are building the applications that implement the transitions.So these stocks are popular on Wall Street. In fact WDAY stock is outperforming AMZN and CRM this year. So clearly WDAY is in favor even in the face of such market-wide uncertainty.This is a growth stock so it is not cheap. Buying it here is a bet on its future successes. The company still loses money and WDAY stock sells at 15 times sales. This is a momentum stock so it will run fast in either direction. Overall it has held a nice uptrend.Workday stock is 14% off of its highs. It also just finished a two-week long consolidation period. This could pose a technical threat in the chart. It is possible that the bears establish a resistance at $200 per share. So sellers could renew another leg lower to push WDAY stock down to $170 which is closer to its point of control.But the same $200 line could serve as an opportunity for a bullish setup. These are pivotal zones so they can break in either direction, and then they carry momentum through it. Add to that the fact that there is an earnings report coming, and the bet on WDAY stock for this week is completely binary.But over the long term, the stock is a decent hold because of the potential upside in the space. Short term, I have to accept the risk of short term disappointment over the interpretation of the earnings report. We never know how investors are going to react regardless of the quality of the results.Although I like the stock here, there is no rush for owning the shares ahead of the earnings. If compelled, I would have a partial position in it. And I would be a buyer on the dips especially near $180 per share.Since the geopolitical headlines are still flying fast, I don\u2019t take any position in full size. Add to this the fact that ULTA, BBY and WDAY stocks have earnings events this week their short term outcomes are more bets than investing. So I never risk more than I can afford to lose on them.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of\u00a0. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

And as we continue to expand our efforts globally, 17% of the Global 2000 have also selected Workday for their core HR system of record. In the second quarter, some of the new customers we added included the Gap, Stanley Black & Decker and Rockwell Automation in North America, Aldi Stores Limited in Europe, and Bunnings Group Limited in our Asia-Pacific, Japan region. Our continued success globally is a direct reflection of the value we place on live, happy, and referenceable customers. Notable go-lives in Q2 included, Deutsche Bank, Home Depot and PNC Bank. Our customer satisfaction rate remains among the highest in the enterprise cloud software industry and the success of our customers an incredibly important part of our enduring business longer term.Shifting to cloud financial management. We had another strong quarter with approximately 50% revenue growth. In Q2, we added a Fortune 100 insurance company which was another in a growing trend of financials first customers. In addition to this large new customer, we also added the City of Baltimore, Veolia, UK, and the Government of Singapore. These are just a few of the many new customers which selected Workday for their core financial management applications in Q2, bringing our total customer base for this product line to over 725. Also and equally importantly, we had several customers go-live on financial management in Q2, including H&R Block, Loews Corporation and Shake Shack.In addition to the strong performance from our core financial application, we continue to see great opportunities with Adaptive Insights Business Planning Cloud, as we officially lapped the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. In Q2, Adaptive Insights added over 200 new planning first customers and over 45 new platform and upsell deals to new and existing Workday customers. We believe that with the depth and breadth of our cloud-based finance products, in combination with our industry-leading HCM suite, Workday Prism Analytics and the Adaptive Insights Business Planning Cloud, we are delivering a global solution as highly differentiated and critical for empowering business leaders to plan execute analyze and extend all in one system and powered by machine learning, and we continue to invest in areas that leverage our strengths and open up new market opportunities.I now like to spend a few minutes talking about innovation. As you know, innovation is a core value and part of our DNA at Workday. First of all, I'm pleased to share that Fast Company recently named Workday as one of the 50 Best Workplaces For Innovators. We are very proud of that distinction that even as we maintain our very fast pace of employee growth around the world, our Company culture around innovation remains strong. We have a lot of product innovation as we look ahead to our upcoming Workday 33 release and I'd like to mention just a few.First for HR, we continue to hear from our customers that addressing today's skills gap is critical as they look to better develop and reskill their workers and prepare their workforce for the future. We continue to leverage machine learning built into the core of Workday to broaden our skills cloud offering with two new features: skills minor and skills insights to help customers better understand and manage skills across their organizations.In financial management, we're using machine learning to detect anomalies. Anomalies will be flagged as they occur affording users an opportunity to detect and correct potential reconciliation issues when they happen rather than during the high pressure month-end close. And on the analytics front, we are making data insights available to all, for both finance and HR, with data discovery boards for Workday Financial Management and Workday HCM, allowing users to quickly visualize data, detect patterns and discover insights all within Workday. We look forward to sharing more about our product innovation, customer success and market opportunity in October at Workday Rising, our annual customer conference. The Financial Analyst Day takes place on October 15th in Orlando, and we look forward to seeing many of you there.And now over to you, Robynne. -- Thanks, Aneel, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered solid second quarter results, with total revenue of $888 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 32%. Our subscription revenue was $757 million, up 34%. Our professional services revenue came in at $131 million, up 23%. Revenue outside the US was up 35% year-over-year to $211 million, representing 24% of total revenue.Subscription revenue backlog was $7.03 billion, growth of 27% year-over-year. Growth was driven by solid results across net new bookings, add-on business and net retention, which was once again over 100%. Also impacting Q2 backlog growth was a duration headwind of approximately 1%. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $4.77 billion, growth of 28%. Current unearned revenue was $1.80 billion in Q2, up 29% year-over-year, while total unearned revenue grew 27% to $1.89 billion.Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $118 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 13.2%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of top line over performance and the shifting of certain expenses from Q2 to the back half of the year. Operating cash flow in Q2 was $100 million. We continue to invest in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q2, we successfully added and integrated approximately 470 net new employees, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to over 11,400. We continue to execute very well operationally and are pleased with our solid first half results.I'll now turn to guidance. Our focus remains centered on investing in our products and other areas of the business to support our long-term growth aspirations. Based on our over performance in Q2, but keeping in mind we face very difficult second half comps from last year, we are providing Q3 and full-year guidance as follows. For subscription revenue, we're raising our FY '20 estimate to be in the range of $3.06 billion to $3.07 billion, 29% growth at the high end. We expect our Q3 subscription revenue to be $783 million to $785 million, 26% growth at the high end. We are raising our professional services revenue guidance to $520 million for fiscal 2020, as we continue to focus on driving the highest levels of customer success. For Q3, we expect professional services revenue of $135 million.For non-GAAP operating margins, we estimate Q3 to be approximately 10.5% and we still anticipate 12.3% margins for the full year. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 28 percentage points in Q3 and for the full year. We still expect subscription revenue backlog growth in the low 20s in the second half, and there is no change to our FY '20 operating cash flow guidance of $790 million.We continue to expect the full-year capital outlay for our owned real estate projects to be approximately $130 million, of which $95 million relates to the development center in Pleasanton. There is no change to our fiscal 2020 plan of $280 million for other capital investments to support our customer growth and continued business expansion.I'll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners and employees for their continued support and hard work. We had a solid first half of the year and we'll continue to focus on our customer success. We look forward to seeing many of you at Workday Rising in October, as we share more insights on our strategic product initiatives and long-term market opportunity.Operator, let's begin the Q&A process.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Richard Davis from Canaccord Genuity. -- Hey, thanks very much. So I talked with a early user of your Platform as a Service and they like it, and they said there's obviously a few little mix that's they're working on and stuff like that. But the thing they really like the best was, you're not kind of pigeonholing them into a specific database and things like that. But I guess, the main question is, what point does this kind of become widely available or what are the gating issues that we need to address to kind of make this thing running full speed and fully available? Thanks. -- Thanks for the question Richard. It's available today in what we call limited GA, which means it is actually widely available, but it's around a set of well-defined APIs and particular areas of the product. And going into next year 2020, calendar year 2020, we expect to have the broader set of APIs available where we will be in through general availability across all aspects of the product line. -- Got it. And then a quick follow-up on technology. You know one of the things that I was talking to someone at WakeMed, and they just said one of the big problems they had is all but credentialing that they do is on a paper. And you guys already -- I don't know what you -- it's a system of record for people. Is there a way that you could digitize that stuff in a safe way, so it's not -- so it's private and stuff like that, because it's not just driver license, but it's records and all this other stuff and all that and you -- are you guys working on that direction? -- We actually introduced Workday Credentials, which is exactly what you described at our Altitude conference just a month back, which is our professional services conference for both our professional services and our partners' professional services people. Jon Ruggiero actually wrote a blog which you can see in our website about Workday Credentials and you learn -- you'll see a lot more about it at Workday Rising. It's a very exciting new area for us. It's been under development for 18 months and it accomplishes exactly what you described Richard. -- Perfect. Thank you so much.Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. -- Good afternoon. One for Aneel and one for Robynne if I could. Aneel, if you look at the international expansion strategy, you talked about, I think, having only what 17% penetration in the Global 2000. It looks like international revenue was less than 25% of the business. Can you just remind us where you're at relative to international expansion? What are your efforts there to kind of really accelerate the footprint internationally? Thanks. -- So I'll take a crack at it, then I'll ask our President, Chano Fernandez, to weigh in as well. We're very focused on selling to large multinationals, and so as a result, we're focused on the large national -- multinational markets, UK, France, Germany, in Europe, Japan, Korea, those really have been the big markets outside the US moving into Mexico, but it really has followed sort of the G8, G10 countries. And I would say at this point, we're pleased with the results. We've actually done quite well on the Asia-Pac region and Australia-New Zealand as well. It's still early on and it's a combination, both of us going into those markets and those markets just coming online into moving into the cloud for HR and finance more aggressively. I'd say the market is -- outside the US is three or four years behind where we are in the US today.Anything you want to add Chano? -- I would like to highlight that as Aneel is commenting, we are pleased with the progress and results in our international markets. We remain very focused there. I think on top of our traditional large enterprise focus, we are really having and seeing great results and success in the medium enterprise, since we took to the same implementation and project methodology from the US into markets like Germany, Nordics, France and some others, and we're seeing great traction. So you know early days and a lot of opportunity still to be captured from us in the international markets, but great customer satisfaction so far and great progress. -- Helpful. And one quick follow-up for Robynne. Just looking at calculated billings growth, it looked like that peaked last year during Q3 at 48% year-over-year. How should we think about that compare -- you're talking about I think 20% plus growth in the second half, but should we put consideration around our calculated billings growth assumptions for Q3 given that tough compare a year ago? -- Yeah, I mean, we've got tough compares across all of our metrics in the back half of the year. So definitely keep that in mind. I would expect that our earn -- unearned growth rates would be largely in line with the subscription revenue backlog numbers that we gave you. So you can infer from that what billings would be. -- Okay, great. Thank you. Helpful color.Your next question comes from Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. -- Yes. Thank you, Aneel. Just given all the headlines and cross-currents that are out there. We have had a few software companies start to encounter some problems driven by Brexit or the trade situation. You know looking at this in contrast, your results and guidance are showing real health, real consistency. So just curious if there is anything worth mentioning on the macro side in terms of business confidence or what you're hearing from other CEOs, whether they have any incremental concerns or not? -- So when I look at our pipeline across all the product lines, they are very healthy. So we're not seeing any impact on our pipelines. But there is no question, there is uncertainty in the air. And I think the CEOs, you talk to the closer they are to doing business in China, the more uncertainty they feel. So I just think we're taking a wait and see and listen to our customers mode. We haven't seen any issues in the pipeline, but the way that it would materialize, I think for most tech companies would be seeing things slow down here, which we haven't. But I know there's a lot of uncertainty in the air and we are trying to -- we're trying to read tea leaves the same way you are. -- Okay. That makes sense. As well Robynne I wanted to -- just mentioned, it's great to hear you're adding a Fortune 100 company as a financial customer, and I'm just curious, what are you inferring from having an enterprise of that kind of scale. You're moving forward with financials first, I think, is how you described it, because that's been so rare in the past. So I'm just kind of wondering is it a reflection of product maturity or enterprise readiness or something else. -- Yeah, Mark, I think it's actually both of those things. We had mentioned a couple of quarters ago that we were starting to see financial's first -- large financial's first deals in our pipeline, which had been a change. We still see those. I would expect that those wins will be lumpy as with all of our large deals and that they will kind of ebb and flow, but I do think we're at a convergence point now where our product is ready and has been for a while and now the market is ready up in that large enterprise space as well. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. -- Thank you very much. I appreciate. Congrats on the quarter. Two separate questions. First one is, are you seeing any change in the number of opportunities or the size of the opportunities entering the pipeline for financials. I'm trying to get a sense of how the early stage of that pipeline is starting to mature? And then a follow-up question. -- I think, Mark, as we've been commenting, we -- I mean, when I look at the pipelines for financials second half and beyond, we are pleased with what we have and what we would be building both in the US and the rest of the world. We are seeing more traction in a couple of verticals, very consistent with what we commented before. Those are mainly financial services and healthcare in the large opportunities, but yes, we see that is moving up market and yes it is growing our financial pipeline faster clearly than our -- than being on our core business lately. -- Perfect. Excellent. Very helpful. I'm going to ask, given how good the quarter and clean the quarter was, I'm going to turn to something investors don't generally hasn't talked about and that's the GAAP margins. Pro forma margin is improving, how should we think about, when the GAAP margins will start to improve return positive. What are the factors that can drive? And any color would be interesting. -- Yeah, so as you know, stock is a very important part of our compensation philosophy here at Workday, and so we should continue to expect that we'll spend a good portion of our revenue, 20% now, but nothing declining in the near future going forward. So as we reach toward the 2020 mid-'20s non-GAAP revenue, that's when we would expect to start to look toward the GAAP profitability. -- Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.Your next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. -- Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. I guess, Aneel, I was curious just about your thoughts on the Adaptive a year after the acquisition, just maybe some thoughts on how it's done, I guess, relative to your expectations, which I know you were high going into it? And maybe anything that's been surprising to you, just on maybe a positive basis whether it's help stoke more conversations around the financial organization broadly, you know just maybe a little bit more color on kind of how that's panned out relative to what you thought a year ago would be great. -- Yeah, it's obviously been a great year. Dave -- my co-founder Dave Duffield and I were actually at in a plan for an all-hands meeting there yesterday with Tom Bogan, our -- the CEO and my good friend. And all the key people are at the company, there is a lot of momentum. We've had a great first year. What I think we expected to happen was that the product would be a great fit up market with the Workday customer base and it has played out that way, and it's actually happen probably faster than either Tom or I would have imagined, we've had some really big wins like Airbus and AstraZeneca choosing the Adaptive product line. I think the really positive pieces at the stand-alone Adaptive business has continued to be very healthy independent of being attached to Workday, and so it really has worked out extremely well and I think it all starts with the most important thing, very, very similar cultures. We both care about our employees, we both care about our customers, high integrity places and so. If there were five more Adaptive, we would probably look at making acquisitions like that, unfortunately those are -- there are few and far between, really -- really a phenomenal first year. -- That's great. Maybe just one quick one for Robynne. Robynne you mentioned more spending pushing into the second half of the year. Was that -- I mean hiring seems strong, so I guess it is just some one-off items that are maybe pushing a little bit in the second half versus expectations? -- Yeah, we were slightly behind on hiring, but nothing that was very impactful and nothing that's going to jeopardize all the good work that we have planned this year. Most of the slippage was, what I would call, program spend, things like advertising and other types of program initiatives that just moved out of the quarter and are going to start a little later in the year. -- Sounds good. Thanks very much.Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from RBC. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hey guys. I just wanted to ask on, maybe first on Adaptive. Are you starting to see or maybe can you talk about the cadence of Adaptive leading to more kind of core financials deals? And I've got a quick follow-up. -- There is no question. It's helped on the pipeline for financials. And I mean, the key is, if you were to look at the CFO priorities, planning is way at the top of the list and Adaptive has a best-in-class planning product, both for finance and increasingly for workforce planning. And so it's a great entry point and broadens the conversation. And if a customer is not quite ready for core financials, we're still OK with that, we'll get into the door with planning and can follow it up later, but I think it just -- it broadens the appeal. There's just no question, it broadens the appeal. I think Prism Analytics does that as well. So having that broader product footprint for the financials' customer base has been really important for us. -- Perfect. And then, maybe just one for Robynne. Is there any way to conceptually think about the impact of Adaptive on the subscription backlog numbers or kind of how we should think about that going forward. -- Yeah. So when we bought them in Q3, we disclosed that we had inherited a $140 million of Adaptive backlog. And so we got that benefit Q3 of last year, which obviously impacted the bookings number as well. So it's a very tough comp for us starting in Q3 and into Q4. -- Got it. Thank you.Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. -- Hi. Thank you for taking the question guys, and congratulations on a good quarter. You continue to make good progress, adding new customers into the fold and it's definitely kind of more to go, particularly in international. I wanted to take the other side of that equation in terms of the progress and upselling into existing customers, maybe get an update on how that's going with sort of the broader HCM portfolio and the ability to sort of further penetrate into some of the existing customers? -- Keith, I'm Chano speaking. We are pleased on how that business is doing. In terms of the attach ratios, I would say starting with selling, financials, back into our HR installed base and then clearly planning, prism, recruitment, learning, I think most of our attach rates and our products are doing very well, which is great, because as we said before, it is taking off pressure from a growth perspective from the core HCM. We usually have disclosed some of those attach rates number on the Analyst Day around Workday Rising. I'm sure we will do this year. But stay tuned, but good progress. -- I would just add, I think it's been really good progress since China put a more dedicated focus on customer base, but we could also still do better as we've embarked on a pricing study with one of the top consulting firms. It's very clear that we are still more geared toward net new from new logos then from our customer base and that's probably different than the other cloud peers out there. So it's an area of high interest for us. -- Got it. That makes sense. And then a follow-up for Robynne. Given the like -- the uncertainty that Aneel was speaking to within the customer base. I understand, it's not in your pipeline, but does that impact your kind of forecasting methodology at all, like in terms of the guidance you gave -- did any more conservative on any of kind of the inputs that you guys use and putting up at the back half of the year? -- So, as you know, we've said all along that we're more back-end loaded this year than we have been in other years. So we've definitely taken that into account in our guide and we've got a large pipeline and we're focused on executing against that and we're looking forward to updating you more next quarter. -- Got it. Thank you.Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Hi, thank you very much. Congratulations team on a fantastic quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit about the core HCM product. Aneel, you mentioned that personal 40% of Fortune 500 have standardized on Workday and you also mentioned 17 -- only 17% penetration of the Global 2000. In markets like this where the number one player generally tends to get dominant market share. Are we still targeting that kind of market share that you have with the Fortune 500 on a global scale, and so therefore, not to put words in your mouth, but how do you think or how sustainable do you think is the growth rate for the core HCM product line, especially given this difference between penetration levels of the Global 2000 versus Fortune 500. What does the Company need to do in order to get to that equally dominant position on the Global scale as you have with the Fortune 500? Thank you. -- So I'm not going to sign probabilities, but obviously aspirationally we'd like to have the same market share in the Fortune 2000 that we do in the Fortune 500. And by the way, we're at 40% of the Fortune 500. I expect that to continue to rise. There is still -- there is still probably 200 accounts that have not made decisions yet. The Fortune 100 was the first group to make decisions and there we know we have -- we're also around around 50% of the Fortune 100. For the rest, as long as we can continue to execute and take care of customers, I don't see why we can't have high penetration rates of the Global Fortune 2000.It's incumbent on two things. Number one, continuing to expand globally and reaching those opportunities and they're not all in the countries we're in. There are probably some opportunities that are in places that were not yet selling to. So we have to factor that in. And number two, some of those markets as we talked about earlier are still very early on in their cloud migration and so that's probably the most important focus for us as to be there as these companies begin to migrate of with their legacy systems. But it's opportunities out there and it gives me confidence that the HR opportunities continue to be a long-term opportunity and there are so many modules that we can go back into these customers with, even modules we haven't even brought to market yet. So very confident. It's a big enough market to continue to support our growth. -- Wonderful. And if you have a couple of words on replacement of legacy SaaS installations. Is that still a tailwind for you guys as it was the case a couple of quarters back? That's it from me. Thank you. -- Legacy SaaS meeting failed, meaning either bolt-ons that we're replacing or core systems of record that failed in the cloud from... -- Exactly. -- From one of our competitors that -- I think that will continue to be a trend for us and an opportunity for us. When you get to -- when you look at the Fortune 500, candidly neither of our large competitors have real proof points over 100,000 employees or even over 50,000 employees that are in production and a huge part of our success has been not just winning the customer by giving them into production and having them be happy, I think the stats are, we have of the approximately 50% of the Fortune 100 that are using Workday, 35% or 35 of that 50 is already live, right. So that's a huge advantage. And when people have a failed project, the next thing they wanted to is, get the sure thing and make sure that it works, and that's where we hopefully come into play. -- Wonderful. Thank you so much.Your next question comes from Derrick Wood from Cowen & Company. -- Thanks. First one Aneel, you changed up some leadership and leadership structure in your international regions during the quarter. Could you just talk about the reasons for the changes or maybe just comment with the new leadership and structure kind of what you're hoping to sharpen your focus on? -- I'm going to turn over that to Chano. -- Yeah, international remains -- Derrick, international remains a very big focus for us within the sales organization. And as we said, we are happy with the progress. We also said that there were a couple of countries where we had opportunities for better performance and to improve. So that's part of that process. We promoted someone within the company that has been with us for quite a few years and we are very -- and really, really excited about the opportunity ahead. Personally, I am. -- Okay. And Robynne, you mentioned last quarter, I guess this quarter, again, it's more of a back-end loaded quarter or back-end loaded year. You maintained the low 20% backlog growth for the second half. Can you just give us some color as to what you think around, you know kind of Q3 versus Q4 and whether it's more weighted toward higher growth in Q4? Any color there would be helpful. -- Yeah, Derek, it is more weighted toward Q4 than last year. So we had a more even distribution particularly when it comes to the large deals last year than we have this year and we're seeing really back-end loaded into not just the second half but into the second quarter. And then -- I mean sorry, the fourth quarter. And then on top of that, we're facing really difficult comps from lapping the Adaptive acquisition. -- Okay. Thanks.Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. -- Hey, two quick questions. Congrats from me as well. Can I go back to Adaptive, like when you got it, Aneel, like it was more focused on SMB and -- but you kind of were convinced that the core technology was really good to just scale it up. Can you talk a little bit about the progress you've made there. And then, like just one word also then on the partner -- evolution of the partner channel? Thank you. -- So at the time of the acquisition of Adaptive, they had already been working on scaling the products and rewritting their modeling engine for the biggest companies in the world. It was not well known to the marketplace. They were not yet public, but the work was well under way. And we're very pleased with how that work has gone, a big chunk of it got delivered in the earlier part of this year, it continues. But we now have the confidence to sell the companies like AstraZeneca and Airbus, you know two very, very large companies. So the scaling efforts that was already under way has gone really well. They have a world-class, I just say we because -- we now -- we've got a world-class development team on the Adaptive front and they continue to scale the system to the largest companies in the world and that really was -- that was really it. I think it's -- it was also the -- the other part of it was an investment in the sales side for large enterprise. That's a big -- it's a big cost. I think if Adaptive had gone public that would have been a big investment for them. By becoming part of Workday, they were able to leverage our high-end enterprise sales organization immediately and that's paid big dividends as well.On the evolution of the partner channel, we continue to have a broad base of strong partners. Of course, we've got all the big -- the big SIs. I think the two big trends in this last 12 months has been they're embracing of the financial product line and they're embracing of Adaptive. Adaptive was historically not as close to some of the big SIs and as the big SIs have learned more about the products. They've got very excited and we expect that that sort of partners are going to be very helpful to us in some of the larger situations that we're in competing for right now. -- All right. Excellent. Thank you.Your next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. -- Good afternoon. Let me add my congratulations. I was wondering, Aneel, if you could elaborate a little bit more with regards to the heightened focus in terms of driving attachment within the existing client base. Could you dimensionalize that in terms of the opportunity and how long would that take to scale up and how quickly do you think that would be visible from the outside? -- I think we'll do that for you at the user conference at Rising. We typically update that kind of thinking. It's hard to do in a short call, but we'll have that for you at the next analyst meeting. And there is, we're at -- and we've always been in the high 90s of customer satisfaction. When we come out with new modules, our customers on the margin tend to want to buy from us. There is more opportunity there, but rightfully so the last three or four years have been focused on getting new accounts. But now we have a base that's closing in on 3,000 customers for HR and 700 for Financials and over 4,000 for Adaptive. So we now have a big installed base, and we probably need to adjust our thinking a little bit about how to go back to that base more systematically or not more systematically, probably with a bigger footprint on the sales side. -- Great. And then with regards to the guidance, typically the subscription revenue guidance has been conservative. I understand the year-over-year compare. You know looking at it from a seasonal sequential perspective, it seems conservative. Is there anything that would drive that this from a seasonal sequential perspective? -- Well, we do have some seasonality in our subscription revenue, mostly between Q1 -- Q4 and Q1, and Q1 and Q2. -- Sure. -- Based on the number of days. So we do get a tailwind in Q2 which then we don't get in Q3 and Q4 from that. Obviously, we take a lot of things into account when we guide. We take into account, overall sentiment. Aneel talked a little bit about what he was saying. The fact that this is a more back-end loaded year than we've had in the past, obviously, is weighing on our guidance as well in terms of us having more to close now in this back half than we generally do halfway through the year. So we're focused on execution. And as I said before, we'll update you as we get through the back half of the year. -- Great. Congratulations again.We will now take two more questions. Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. -- Hi, thanks. Robynne, simple one for you. You had mentioned three months ago that on the cash flow side, 2Q would be quite limited. $100 million is a little bit more than limited. I trust what happened here is, maybe some of the margin outperformance worked its way down to the cash flow line or were there one or two other things that might have contributed to that over performance? Thank you. -- Yeah, Karl, that was definitely part of it. We also came out of the quarter with a stronger collections number than we had gone into the quarter thinking we would have. Obviously, Q2 the seasonal low for us and so it's a little hard to predict where we're going to land quarter by quarter given we do a lot of our business at the end of the quarters and invoices are due in the back half. So whether they pull-in or slide out is really a bit of an unknown. So we were pleased with our performance on the cash flow. -- Got it. Okay. That was it from me. Thanks a lot.We will take our final question from Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. -- Oh, great. Thank you. Aneel, when I checked this quarter, we actually heard good things about Prism. And so I was wondering if you could tell us how that's going and then maybe that would be an opportunity, your long time partner spent $16 billion to buy Tableau, so they clearly see some opportunity. So maybe that's -- maybe you could work in your perspective just for the analytic space in general for companies like you and Salesforce? -- Yeah, you know Prism has been a strong performer, continues to be a strong performer. So we had another very good quarter with Prism. I think we're going to see it go. It's more and more in the way of dashboards and usability that we highlighted in the prepared comments and a set of applications that sit on top of Prism, people analytics being the first, but you can see financial analytics, spend analytics and this idea of package analytics is really resonating with our customers. So it's a big part of what we're doing in many ways. It's the culmination of a lot of work to show when you have a strong transactional engine, the kind of deep analysis you can do with that data. So it continues to chug along and we only didn't mention it just because it's Q2. When we get to the Analyst Meeting in a few months, we will show you more detail about what's happening with Prism, it's very exciting. -- All right, great. Thank you. -- I'm very happy for Mark and Tableau. It's not competitive with Workday. We actually used Tableau in some situations internally, like a lot of companies do. At the end of the day, people are using our analytics to really focus in on the data types that we drive HR and financial data types and vice versa. So it's probably a very good move for Mark and it's a very good company that he acquired. -- Great. Thank you for that perspective.That concludes the Q2 Workday Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today.

Total revenue in its second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 32.2% year over year, and non-GAAP earnings per share jumped from $0.31 in the year-ago period to $0.44. In addition, operating cash flow soared from $57.7 million to $100.3 million.\"It was a strong quarter, with continued global customer momentum across the Fortune 500 and Global 2,000, as more organizations look to Workday for the ability to plan, execute, and analyze in one system powered by machine learning,\" said Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri in the company's second-quarter earnings release.For investors looking for even better insight into the 's performance, here are some key quotes from the  that followed Workday's quarterly report.Image source: Workday.While Workday's core offering is its cloud-based human capital management software, the company has been seeing strong traction with its financial management offering as well -- so much so that Workday is starting to see  of a growing number of new customers coming to the company through its financial management software.Momentum in financial management continued in Q2.\"We had another strong quarter [for financial management] with approximately 50% revenue growth,\" explained Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri. \"In Q2, we added a Fortune 100 insurance company which was another in a growing trend of financials first customers.\" Of course, there were more wins beyond this notable new client. Workday's total base of financial management customers is now greater than 725.After closing its  on Aug. 1 of last year, the company has had more than a year to integrate the business and observe its impact on the rest of Workday's operation. Fortunately, Adaptive is playing a key role in helping Workday land new customers and upsell them to other products, particularly the company's financial management offering.When asked whether Adaptive customers are signing up for the company's financial management cloud, Bhusri responded:There is no question. It's helped on the pipeline for financials. And I mean, the key is, if you were to look at the CFO priorities, planning is way at the top of the list and Adaptive has a best-in-class planning product, both for finance and increasingly for workforce planning. And so it's a great entry point and broadens the conversation.Bhusri added that its data and analytics cloud, Prism Analytics, leads to a similar cadence of broadening the appeal of Workday's other solutions.Workday's guidance for fiscal third-quarter subscription revenue between $783 million and $785 million -- representing 26% year-over-year growth at the high end of this range -- might have sounded conservative to some investors. After all, subscription revenue increased $33.9% year over year in the company's fiscal second quarter.But investors should keep in mind the tough comparisons Workday is facing.\"So when we bought [Adaptive Insights] in Q3, we disclosed that we had inherited $140 million of Adaptive backlog,\" explained Workday CFO Robynne Sisco. \"And so we got that benefit Q3 of last year, which obviously impacted the bookings number as well. So it's a very tough comp for us starting in Q3 and into Q4.\"For the full year, Workday guided for fiscal 2020 subscription revenue between $3.06 billion and $3.07 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth at the high end of this range.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It was neither a big earnings miss nor a piece of company-specific news that initially spooked investors; rather, the sell-off looks to have begun with just a  in the markets during which a lot of selling took place. Days later, tech stocks came under fire again as President Trump announced new tariffs on\u00a0Chinese imports. While Workday doesn't have operations in China and shouldn't have much direct exposure to the trade war, its customers could be adversely impacted, so there's potential for the company to be affected indirectly, especially if customers reduce their spending.\u00a0IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.However, since those declines in late July and early August, Workday's share price has continued to fall. One possible explanation may be that investors have scaled back what they are willing to pay for tech companies -- especially ones like Workday that are generating losses -- amid concerns that a recession is on the way.\u00a0The problem is that knowing exactly when Workday will be profitable is difficult to gauge at this point, with the company accumulating $495 million in losses over the trailing twelve months. Even as sales have been rising, that hasn't translated into profits for the company as operating expenses have continued to increase right along with revenues.Workday is coming off a  in which sales rose by 32% year over year, from $671.7 million to $887.8 million.\u00a0Meanwhile, its bottom line has become worse, growing from a loss of $86.2 million a year ago to $120.7 million.\u00a0The good news is that there's definitely a lot of excitement around the business, especially given the significant number of Fortune 500 companies that use Workday's software. It's seeing heavy demand for its services, and its top-line growth is expected to continue apace. Workday's focus on automation and improving business operations could be more important than ever, especially if a recession were to hit. By increasing efficiency and reducing overhead, companies can become more competitive, and that's where Workday can add a lot of value.\u00a0And with the company consistently generating positive cash flow from its operations, those net losses shouldn't weigh too heavily on the minds of investors. With $674 million of cash generated over the past four quarters from its day-to-day operations, Workday still looks to be in a strong financial position. In each of the past four straight quarters, Workday's cash flow from operating activities has been at least $100 million. If it can continue that trend, the company will have a lot of flexibility moving forward.\u00a0\u00a0Lately, the share prices of \u00a0have been falling, and Workday has taken part in that decline. Although the company has been doing all the right things and its business is expanding, there is, unfortunately, still plenty of room for its share price to slide further, especially if negativity\u00a0continues to pervade the broader market.When in doubt about the outlook for a stock, it can be useful to look at its valuation ratios to see whether more of a correction could reasonably take place. In the case of Workday, its price-to-sales ratio of over 11 and price-to-book multiple of 17 reveal ample room for the stock to drop to more conventional valuations. Even its price-earnings-to-growth ratio, which factors in its expected growth rate, sits at well over 3.0. A PEG ratio higher than 1 suggests a stock is overvalued -- a 3 indicates that Workday's growth outlook is insufficient to justify its share price.Workday is a promising software company, and the stock could be a good addition to many investors' watch lists, but until there's evidence to suggest that it has reached a bottom, it could be too risky to buy at present.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Read on to find out why these companies are the ones to ring in the autumn investing season.Image source: Getty Images.Novavax, a pre-revenue vaccine company, has been one seriously hot stock this month. Since Aug. 1, the biotech's shares have gained 44% at the time of writing, and this upward trend could very well continue for the remainder of the year.What's behind Novavax shares' strong showing this month? Three key issues. Last June, the company cut a deal with Catalent Biologics to assume the leases for two of its product development and manufacturing facilities. This transaction should help to significantly lower the company's cash burn rate from here on out.Secondly, Novavax recently announced that the Food and Drug Administration has signed off on the design of the company's late-stage trial for the experimental flu vaccine NanoFlu. If all goes according to plan, the biotech said it expects to have top-line data from this trial by the first quarter of 2020.Lastly, the biotech unveiled a promising  for the experimental respiratory syncytial virus vaccine ResVax earlier this month. These more mature outcome data may be able to open the door for a surprise regulatory approval in one or more international territories. That's certainly not a guarantee, as the vaccine did miss the primary endpoint of its maternal immunization study earlier this year. But these longer-term data do at least provide a solid rationale for another late-stage trial.Unfortunately, Novavax ended the most recent quarter with less than  in cash and cash equivalents. The biotech therefore appears ripe for a substantial capital raise, especially with NanoFlu's late-stage trial set to get underway soon. Investors, in kind, should expect the biotech's shares to remain on the volatile side during the month of September and beyond.  With cloud-based solutions that are relatively versatile compared to on-premise alternatives, Workday has scaled its position in employee and project management software and now counts roughly 40% of Fortune 500 companies among its customer base. The enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) company currently has a market capitalization of roughly $42.5 billion and is scheduled to report its second-quarter results on Aug. 29.The company managed to grow revenue roughly 33% year over year in the first quarter, and  thanks to the better-than-expected performance in the quarter and other positive indicators. Workday expects to post second-quarter subscription revenue of $747 million, which would represent roughly 32% growth year over year. It also expects $124 million in services revenue (a projected increase of 17% year over over), bringing its projected midpoint sales tally for the quarter to a $971 million figure that would represent 30% growth year over year.Workday stock hasn't been gaining ground rapidly in 2019, with shares up roughly 18% year to date compared to gains of 17% for the  index, so it probably faces less pressure to deliver big sales and earnings beats in the second quarter compared to other growth-dependent cloud stocks. However, the stock has managed to climb roughly 130% over the last three years thanks to impressive sales and client growth, and investors will be looking for more information on new customer additions and a more in-depth view of what to expect in the second half of the year. The leading deep-discount retailer Dollar General is ready to report earnings this Thursday, and investors should be prepared for another strong result. Although the on-again, off-again nature of trade talks between the U.S. and China adds a level of uncertainty and volatility to this stock, which imports a large quantity of goods from China -- meaning the tariff blasts the two leveled at each other last week could roil future results -- both sides have said they're ready to come back to the negotiation table.That's good news for Dollar General, which is rolling out 1,000 new stores this year and driving both sales and profits with the addition of more fresh goods and produce. The value proposition of dollar stores will actually only improve going forward, even if a trade war knocks the country back into a recession, because the breadth of selection at these stores, and at Dollar General in particular, means consumers will continue trying to stretch their wallets.The chain also just partnered with  to make Dollar General stores a  for packages, which could introduce a new type of customer to the company's stores, further expanding its opportunity.While ill winds of a trade war are blowing, dampening some enthusiasm and muting expectations a bit, Dollar General remains a stock to watch this coming month and beyond.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2021 put at the $115 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $6.60.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.7% return against the $115 commitment, or a 4.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to WDAY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $115 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Workday Inc sees its shares decline 38.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $108.40 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $6.60 from $115), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.1% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, and highlighting in green where the $115 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2021 put at the $115 strike for the 4.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

In addition, we celebrated one year with Adaptive Insights and continue to make great progress on our integration vision. As we move into the second half of the year, we are continuing to invest in areas that leverage our strengths and open new opportunities.During the subsequent conference call, CFO Robynne Sisco also told investors that Workday sees third-quarter revenue of $918 million to $920 million -- good for 27% growth at the midpoint and well above the $912 million most analysts were modeling -- including professional services revenue of $135 million and subscription revenue ranging from $783 million to $785 million.As such, Workday now expects full fiscal-year 2020 revenue of $3.58 billion to $3.59 billion, an increase from $3.545 billion to $3.56 billion previously. This assumes subscription revenue of $3.06 billion to $3.07 billion (raised from $3.045 billion to $3.06 billion before), and $520 million in professional services revenue (an increase of $20 million from its old target).All told, you'll be hard pressed to find any rational investor who isn't pleased with the momentum of Workday's underlying business and, consequently, both its resulting quarterly performance and freshly raised full-year outlook.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With the mass movement away from old license-based software models (remember paying a once-off fee for Microsoft Office?) and the rapid rise of the cloud, dozens of exciting new companies are now changing the way the world does business with these high-margin platforms.   Image Source: MyWallStHere are five SaaS companies out there at the moment that are favorites of the MyWallSt analyst team:While most people will never have heard of Jira, Confluence, or Bitbucket, you can be sure that many of the applications you use on your phone every day (including\u00a0) were built with a heavy reliance on them.Atlassian  is an Australian-based company that excels in stickiness. Pat Dorsey of Dorsey Asset Management once argued that to have a strong brand, you must do one of two things: have pricing power or lower your customer's search costs. When we asked our head of development about Atlassian's products, he signified that they have both.Nearly all (98%) customers who spent more than $50K with Atlassian in fiscal 2017 remained on as customers for 2018. Furthermore, over 90% who spent at that level purchased three or more products, implying that their tools are extremely complementary and, after a while, difficult to move away from.That's an incredibly strong economic moat to have.Throughout your life, you'll put your signature at the end of thousands of documents. Every shade of legal contract imaginable has required manual preparation, printing, postage, and stroke of the pen\u200a\u2014\u200afollowed by a return journey by emailed PDF or courier. Whether you're a first-time home-buyer or a president signing a bill into law, the humble pen and paper have always been the moment of truth and final step.DocuSign  is transforming this cornerstone of business by unblocking the signing bottleneck. They have opened the entire agreement process to automation and, in doing so, have become a clear leader in an area with room for massive growth.Today, DocuSign has over 508,000 paying customers within which are 18 of the top 20 global pharmaceuticals, 7 of the top 10 tech companies and 10 of the top 15 global financial service companies.Throw 44% compounded revenue growth over three years and we've all the signs of a business that's rapidly addressing an under-penetrated market opportunity that's estimated by the company to sit at $25 billion.The perfect stock would be attached to the perfect company, and the perfect company has to be engaged in a perfectly simple business, and the perfectly simple business ought to have a perfectly boring name.There are few companies in the MyWallSt app more boring than Paycom , the producers of \"one HR and payroll solution for managing employees from recruitment to retirement\". Paycom's fundamentals are anything but boring though, with over 90% retention year after year, revenue growing by 32%, and high margins\u200a\u2014\u200aall the while expanding their sales force to new markets.Paycom boasts happy employees, very high insider ownership, and a founder/CEO who has been ahead of the curve time and time again, building his company from nothing into a $12.8 billion business.In 2004, David Duffield watched as the company he had founded 17 years earlier was swallowed up in a hostile takeover by tech giant Oracle.

Workday's solutions allow enterprises to better manage their employees and finances, with the company taking in over $2.8 billion in sales for fiscal 2019.What really strikes me about Workday is their commitment to providing the best possible solution to their clients though, spending over 40% of their revenue on research and development and updates coming out consistently every 6 months.

MSFT stock, like the the , presently trades about 4% off of its all time highs.Source: Shutterstock\n\tThe reality of Microsoft stock is that, if the market keeps dropping on trade and interest-rate concerns, so will MSFT stock.MSFT is not immune to these market headwinds. The company\u2019s double-digit-percentage revenue growth rate is somewhat reliant upon healthy macro economic conditions, and those\u00a0 conditions are deteriorating because of rising geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainty.Meanwhile, MSFT stock is also somewhat reliant upon rates staying lower for longer in order to support its rich valuation, and investors are unsure as to whether or not rates will stay lower for longer.Thus, if the market keeps dropping on interest rate and trade concerns, MSFT stock will keep dropping, too, no matter what Microsoft news is reported.But it will drop a lot less than other tech and growth stocks because. relative to other tech and growth stocks, Microsoft stock is significantly less exposed to interest-rate and trade headwinds. That\u2019s because the valuation of MSFT stock isn\u2019t that\u00a0rich, nor is its business that\u00a0dependent on favorable economic conditions.Consequently, for investors who are looking for safety amid the recent market turmoil but also want growth, MSFT seems like the perfect stock to buy.Microsoft stock is not immune to interest rate and trade headwinds. But it is partially shielded, and this partial protection makes MSFT stock an attractive, \u201csafe tech stock\u201d to buy in turbulent times.On the trade front, MSFT is partially shielded from trade headwinds because its core business is supported by non-cyclical\u00a0 adoption tailwinds.Specifically, Microsoft\u2019s business is all about the cloud today. The company is capitalizing on the non-cyclical pivot from on-premise solutions to cloud solutions.This pivot may slow somewhat as global economic conditions deteriorate and as enterprises pull back on IT spending and investment.But the pivot won\u2019t stop. Instead, enterprises will continue to shift to the cloud.The pace of the transition could even increase if the economy slows because cloud solutions provide significant cost savings relative to on-premise solutions.As a result, Microsoft\u2019s business won\u2019t materially slow as a result of escalating trade headwinds. Instead, its business should remain largely steady and stable.On the interest rate front, MSFT stock is partially shielded because its valuation isn\u2019t that rich relative to other tech/growth stocks. MSFT stock trades at 25 times analysts\u2019\u00a0 average forward earnings estimate.That\u2019s rich. But it\u2019s not that\u00a0rich. Other big cloud stocks \u2013 like  (NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:),  (NASDAQ:), and  (NASDAQ:) \u2013 all trade at over 35 times analysts\u2019 average forward earnings estimate.Thus, if rates do creep higher, Microsoft stock won\u2019t be pressured as much as other big-name tech stocks.For these two reasons, MSFT stock is a relatively good buy in turbulent times. Indeed,\u00a0 this scenario is already playing out. MSFT stock is presently only 5% off its recent highs. By contrast, every FANG stock is in correction territory. This relative outperformance of MSFT stock will persist.The long-term bull thesis on Microsoft stock remains compelling, even amid recent market headwinds.As stated earlier, Microsoft\u2019s core cloud businesses are supported by non-cyclical cloud adoption tailwinds. These tailwinds may slow somewhat in the face of global economic uncertainty. Or they may accelerate, as enterprises\u00a0 look to cut costs as times get tough. But these tailwinds won\u2019t die. Only  are in the cloud today. Over time, that number will rise towards 100%. Thus, MSFT can easily sustain double-digit-percentage revenue growth for the next several years.MSFT\u2019s gross margins will continue to rise as its cloud businesses, particularly Azure, grow. Double-digit-percentage revenue growth should also be enough to increase its profitability.\u00a0 Share buybacks will also be in play.That combination should produce roughly 15% EPS growth. Reasonably speaking, then, Microsoft\u2019s EPS could reach $12 by fiscal 2026. Based on a\u00a0 forward PE multiple of 20, which is average for growth stocks, that equates to a fiscal 2025 price target of $240. Discounted back by 10% per year, we arrive at\u00a0 a fiscal 2020 price target of roughly $150.Thus,MSFT stock can rise meaningfully both over the next 12 months and the next five years.Things are getting choppy in the stock market right now, and as they do get choppy, tech and growth stocks will get hit extra hard because they have ample exposure to trade and interest-rate headwinds.But, relative to that tech and growth group, Microsoft stock will outperform in turbulent times because it has less-than-average exposure to the aforementioned headwinds. As a result, for investors looking to stick with growth\u00a0 but also seeking some stability amid the recent volatility, MSFT stock looks like a good choice.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MSFT and ADBE.\u00a0The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he trade dispute with China continued to weigh on investor sentiment Wednesday, with the   and the   losing close to 1%.

There is no denying that cloud computing has taken both the enterprise and consumer world by storm. If you\u2019ve ever used an app on your phone or worked remotely, you\u2019ve experienced the power of the trend. And as a result, many cloud stocks like  (NASDAQ:) or  (NASDAQ:) have seen their fortunes rise over the last few years.However, the big cloud stocks aren\u2019t the only fish in the sea. There are plenty of other smaller players ready to take a piece of the cloud computing pie.It\u2019s here, that many of the big gains in the cloud stocks can be had. These small- and mid-cap stocks have plenty of growth and rising sales as well as buyout potential from the larger, more-established players. These smaller cloud stocks are where the long-term gains can be had. For investors, betting here could make the most sense as the trend continues to unfold.With that, here are five cloud stocks to buy today.   Organizations are complex beasts these days. And in that, not all employees need to or can have access to every one of a firm\u2019s portals. Managing who can see and access what is now a big problem. That\u2019s where identity cloud specialist  (NASDAQ:) comes in.OKTA is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud stock that offers a variety of products that help . This includes everything from passwords and two-factor authentications to customer loyalty programs and data collection. The idea is that Okta\u2019s products keep the right people in the right areas and they never mix.And it looks like the corporate, education and even government are buying the idea in spades. , OKTA\u2019s total number of customers surged to more than 6100 and the number of $100K in annual contract customers has doubled year-over-year to 1038. Total revenues for the year surged 56%, while both operational and free cash flows produced record amounts. Perhaps the best part of OKTA is that unlike many tech stocks, the firm features no long-term debt and hefty half billion in cash on its balance sheet. That provides an amazing amount of flexibility.With OKTA rolling out even more products across its business lines and plenty of customers \u2014 in small, medium and large enterprises \u2014 to court, the potential is vast for the firm. Identity and data security is a top priority and Okta is the cloud stock getting it done.Source: Shutterstock\n\tThe cool thing about technology is that it\u2019s always changing and advancing. However, because of that, it can create a huge skills gap among workers \u2014 even those in the technology sector. Companies function better when everyone continues to improve their skills set. (NASDAQ:) is a cloud stock that offers online skills training and courses among a variety of tech needs. This includes everything from programming languages like Java and Python, cybersecurity training, big data applications, and various certification programs. Basically, it automates much of the training and eliminates the need for lengthy and wasteful meetings.This cost and time savings have plenty of appeal for firms and as a result, more than half of the Fortune 500 have signed on as customers. The best part is that PS uses a \u201cland and expand\u201d sales strategy. Here, Pluralsight gets the firm\u2019s hooked and then is able to offer additional training services with ease.Revenues grew by 39% to $232 million in 2018, while the  saw revenues expand by 40%. Perhaps the best part is that the firm\u2019s business model features amazing gross margins of 70%. While PS is operating at a loss right now, those margins have quickly reduced losses-per-share and Pluralsight is moving towards profitability.With technology advancing and the skills gap growing, Pluralsight is in a unique position to profit over the long-haul.

And in fact, we\u2019re right back to where its IPO launched in terms of DBX stock price. But that could make it a big bargain among the cloud stocks.DBX started by providing an easy way for individuals to back up their photos and videos in the cloud. This made it one of the largest file-sharing platforms in the world. Since then,  into more subscription and collaborative document operations for businesses. The key is that DBX can be accessed via a variety of means- from desktop applications, mobile computing and is able to connect with over 300,000 third-party apps for editing, communicating, processing and more. Recent deals have added big data and video capabilities to its platform.Small and medium-sized enterprises seem to like the features. Like many of the cloud stocks on this list, revenues continue to grow like weeds at Dropbox.  the firm managed to see a big 22% jump in revenues, while subscription growth continues to be robust. Meanwhile, net losses have shrunk considerably year-over-year. DBX is on the cusp of profitability.And yet, shares are basically right where they were at its IPO. For investors, this could mean a big opportunity to load up on one of the more promising cloud stocks on the cheap.Source: Shutterstock\n\tSome of the best cloud stocks are those that perform and automate boring tasks. And you can\u2019t get more boring than human resources functions like payroll, taxes and accounts payable. Luckily for  (NASDAQ:) this is just where it operates.PAYC offers a suite of applications that allows HR departments to hire, develop, pay and managing benefits for employees. If that sounds like another well-known cloud stock, you\u2019d be right.  (NASDAQ:) has long been a leader among the cloud stocks. However, PAYC and WDAY aren\u2019t competitors, they compliment each other. That\u2019s because Workday focuses its attention on large-sized firms, while Paycom has moved downstream into smaller businesses.Turns out this was a great move, retention rates for PAYC are high and have resulted in plenty of reoccurring revenue streams. , the HR cloud stock saw its revenues jump by 30% year-over-year. Better still is that PAYC is profitable and saw a big 15% jump to its EPS.

I'd first like to thank everyone for joining our Q1 2020 . I'm pleased to report that our first quarter fiscal year 2020 got us off to a great start for the year. We continue to attract new customers and many of our current customers are growing their investments with us. Our customer satisfaction rating remains among the highest in enterprise software and the success of our customers is a cornerstone of our long-term business strategy.Let's start with some of the highlights from Q1 beginning with Workday HCM. Momentum for this application suite remains strong as organizations continue their transitions to the cloud. In Q1 we added Carl Zeiss AG, Cisco Systems, Daimler Trucks North America, Old Mutual Limited and Procter & Gamble, among the many new HCM customers in the quarter. Our proven ability to support our customers' large volumes of data and transactions continues to be a big differentiator in our success. Notable go-lives in Q1, included Enterprise Holdings and Tyson Shared Services.Turning to Workday Financial Management, we saw continued momentum in Q1 with over 50% customer and net new ACV growth. New customers included Advocate Aurora Health Systems and E*Trade Financial Corporation. In addition, during the quarter many existing customers expanded their relationship with Workday. Like Mason for example, a leading investment management firm expanding their use of Workday Financial Management to include all of their affiliates.Lastly, we also had a large Fortune 500 scale insurance company at financial management to become a full platform customer. As always getting customers live and on budget is core to our business. Amongst the many go-lives of Q1 for financials, I would like to highlight Sprouts Farmers Market and NASDAQ.Q1 results for our third quarter with the Adaptive Insights business planning cloud and customer demand continues to reinforce our confidence in the long-term opportunity. We added approximately 150 stand-alone Adaptive deals, and once again saw success selling into the large enterprise market with approximately 50 deals representing both platform sales and planning add-ons.New customers selecting Adaptive Insights' business planning cloud in Q1 included, Advocate Aurora Health Systems, Airbus, AstraZeneca, AutoZone Parts, H&R block and the Ohio State University.We are pleased that our customer and product momentum continues to get recognised by leading industry analysts. This month, Gartner published its 2019 Magic Quadrant for cloud core financial management suites for midsize, large, and global enterprises, and Gartner named Workday as a leader for the third year in a row.Also in Q1, I'm pleased to announce we moved all customers to Workday 32. With this update, we delivered more than 500 new features, including deeper investments in Workday Learning and Workday Recruiting, finance-focused machine learning capabilities to help resource managers align skills resources to projects, and deeper integration between Workday and Adaptive Insights. Indeed, we are well on our way for a goal of bringing Adaptive Insights fully into the power of one.And last but not least for Q1, we're pleased to share that we're once again ranked number one on San Francisco Business Times' Best Places to Work in the Bay Area list. This is the seventh time Workday has been ranked number one on the list. Workday also ranked number one on the UK's best large workplaces list by Great Place to Work Institute. All-in-all this quarter was a strong start to our fiscal year.I'll now turn over to our Co-President and CFO, Robynne Sisco. Over to you, Robynne. -- Thanks, Aneel, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel mentioned we continue to execute well against our long-term market opportunity, differentiating ourselves through our technology and our uniquely purposed customer success model.We are very pleased with our first quarter results, delivering total revenue of $825 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 33%. Our subscription revenue was $701 million, up 34% and professional services revenue came in at $124 million, up 29%. We continue to see our long-term opportunity expanding outside of the U.S., with revenue up 42% to $197 million. Our non-U.S. revenue now represents a record 24% of total revenue.Subscription revenue backlog was $6.8 billion, growth of 30% year-over-year, driven by strong performance across net new bookings, add-on business and renewals, with net retention once again over 100%. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $4.56 billion, growth of 29%.Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $108 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 13.1%. Operating cash flow in Q1 was $209 million. Current unearned revenue was $1.73 billion in Q1, up 31% year-over-year, while total unearned revenue grew 29% to $1.83 billion. We continue to invest in our people, and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q1, we successfully added and integrated approximately 400 net new employees, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to almost 11,000.Operationally, it was another strong quarter of execution in Q1. We're extremely pleased with our results and have gotten off to a great start for fiscal 2020.I'll now turn to guidance. Our focus remains centered on driving strong, durable growth, and we will continue to invest in our products and other areas of the business, to support our long-term growth aspirations. Based on our over performance in Q1, but keeping in mind, we face a very difficult second half comps from last year, we are raising our fiscal 2020 outlook and providing Q2 guidance as follows.For subscription revenue, raising our full year estimate to be in the range of $3.045 billion to $3.06 billion. We expect our Q2 subscription revenue to be $746 million to $748 million or 32% growth, with sequential improvement in Q3 and Q4 of approximately 4.7% and 5.7% respectively. Similar to last year, this pattern reflects our increasing seasonal trends toward larger Q4. We still expect professional services revenue to be $500 million in fiscal 2020, as we continue to prioritize driving the highest levels of customer success. For Q2, we expect services revenue of $124 million.For non-cash operating margins, we estimate Q2 to be 10% and we still anticipate 12.3% margins for the full year as we remain committed to 200 basis points of margin expansion even as we continue to aggressively invest for continued growth. The sequential decline in the non-GAAP operating margin from Q1 reflects typical seasonality and is primarily a result of our annual employee compensation cycle which took effect at the beginning of Q2. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 27 percentage points in each remaining quarter and for the full year.We still expect subscription revenue backlog to follow the pattern we laid out in our Q4 call with high 20s growth in the first half and low 20s growth in the second half. We continue to see a healthy pace of cloud migrations across HR and Finance, but as we look at the full year, we're seeing more opportunities move into the back part of the year, specifically shifting into Q4. There is no change to our operating cash flow guidance in FY '20 of approximately $790 million or 30% growth.As a reminder, Q2 traditionally generates limited operating cash flows. This is due to the combination of seasonally low collections and the seasonally high sequential increase in expenses resulting from our annual employee compensation cycle.We are excited to have recently begun occupying our new Pleasanton development center which will house more than 2,200 employees and also be home to our new customer center. We continue to expect the FY '20 capital outlay for our owned real estate projects will be approximately $130 million, of which $94 million relates specifically to the development center. There is no change to our fiscal '20 plans of $280 million for other capital investments to support customer growth and continued business expansion.And finally, I'll close by thinking our amazing customers, partners and employees for their continued support and hard work. We are still in the early stages of executing against our long-term vision as a company, but our progress wouldn't be possible without a shared goal. We're off to a great start for our FY '20 and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.Operator, let's begin the Q&A process.(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Please ask your question. -- Hi, congratulations on a spectacular start to the fiscal year. One question for Robynne, if you look at the deferred revenues, I know that you don't try to deferred revenues in billings they're not exactly representative of the strength of the business. But nonetheless, I just wanted to understand if there were certain factors that might have driven better, much better than the typical seasonality we have seen in deferred revenues.And one for you, Aneel, you mentioned 50 platform deals with Adaptive. Are these fairly large corporations? Or as the next few years unfold for the company, how do you see planning, playing out alongside financials, just one synergize the other. And just want to get your broader thoughts on the adoption of planning and financials. Thank you. Congratulations. -- Well I'll take that. Thanks, Kash. I'll take the second part first. One of the attraction we saw with Adaptive in the suite market was in large companies, and I mentioned several of them that were either add-ons or part of platform deals AstraZeneca, Airbus and H&R Block, I mean these are big organizations that are embracing the Adaptive Business Planning Cloud. And if Tom, you want to add anything? -- Yes, I think that's right, Aneel. And from our perspective we've seen a lot more traction with the larger companies working with the broader Workday sales team. And it's -- as we know those are longer sales cycles, but the early traction with those customers is very encouraging. -- Kash, on your deferred revenue question, nothing particular to call out in Q1 outside of just the strong performance that we had overall, and as you know just a reminder that unearned balance can vary with contract terms and renewal timing as well. -- And if I could sneak one, Aneel, any broad comment on the replacement cycle you're seeing in core HCM, whether it's legacy SaaS or legacy on-prem, it looks like there is a bit of an acceleration, another inflection point in that journey, and maybe I'm wrong about it but just want to get your comment on that. Thank you. -- Yes. I don't think we're seeing an inflection point reacceleration. I think the HR product line continues to do very well. And, you know, we're now on Main Street in terms of the types of customers that are looking to move to the cloud, and with the high level of customer satisfaction and the proven -- the proven points of customers being live, I think we just -- it just bodes well for Workday. I think if there's anything that I would say about this quarter is that, all the product lines are beginning to kick in and take some of the pressure off HCM, and I hope that continues. -- Operator, can we have the next question please.And we have a question from the line of Brent Bracelin from Keybanc. Please ask your question. -- Thank you for taking the question here. One for Aneel and a follow up for Rob. And Aneel, my question is on the demand drivers for cloud financials in the Fortune 50. Given the increasing number of proof points of the last year within the Fortune 500, what are the remaining objections you're fielding from the larger enterprises and when would you expect to see some of the larger Fortune 50s begin to go down a path to embrace cloud financials? -- Well, I'd separate out. You said Fortune 500, Fortune 50s in there. Fortune 50s are really hard to predict. And -- we have a few of them, I will keep my comments to the broader Fortune 500. I believe we're seeing a very similar adoption pattern for Fortune 500 as we did in HR, five or six years ago. The more reference customers we have, the more that customers are facing painful upgrades of legacy systems, the more that the regulations change with things like 606, those are all catalysts.And I do think that the cloud is now viewed as the preferred deployment option versus on-premise even for CFOs and whether that's through planning or through core accounting I think that is happening as well, and that's been the case in HR and CRM for a while. It's beginning to happen in finance now. So a lot of things, no one thing to point out. -- Certainly good to hear. And then as a follow up for Robynne, you talked about -- more opportunities shifting into kind of Q4. My question here is just -- is this tied to a handful of larger lands that are shifting because of complexity? Is it more geo-specific? What are the factors there that you should point us to as you think about some opportunities shifting in the quarters there in the second half? -- Brent, this is Chano speaking. I don't think there is one single factor. I would just say that particularly large deals at that time in move quarter to quarter, and as we are becoming a larger companies those tend to navigate more and move more toward the back end part of the deal -- of the year, sorry. But overall the pipeline is healthy and the quality of the global opportunities remain strong. -- Okay. So it's not geo-specific then? -- Nothing to highlight really specific then. -- Great. Thank you.And we have a question from the line of Mark Murphy from J.P. Morgan. Please ask your question. -- Yes. Thank you, and I'll add my congrats. Robynne, just following up on the prior question about more opportunities moving into Q4. At the same time, you're raising guidance, and I think you're reaffirming the subscription backlog guidance. So, I just wanted to clarify, are you highlighting the same trend that's been there, I think for many years of the business, just becoming a little more Q4 seasonal? Or were you intending to call out some type of, maybe more meaningful change in this fiscal year? -- No, nothing more meaningful, Mark. I mean as you know in the past there have been times when we've called out specific trends that we're seeing, just to help our analysts and investors understand the dynamics that impact some of the metrics that you track. For example, last year we talked about the difficult first half comps what we're seeing in terms of larger deals flowing into the second half of the year. We're actually seeing a similar dynamic this year, but they're just flowing into Q4 instead of more evenly spread across Q3 and Q4. So we thought it might be helpful for you to just highlight that. As you look at how to model our business, but it's nothing really unusual it's just the continuation of the trend that we've been seeing. -- Okay, great. And then as a quick follow up Aneel, when you secure a planning win with a large organization like an Airbus or an AstraZeneca, do you see that as a precursor to a core financials win in the future? Or do you have enough data to know whether that increases the odds that you'd be able to win core financials from that organization in the future? -- I think it's still early. But if you look at -- if they have HR and planning, so they're more than just one work day product in the customer account, then I think it bodes well for finance. Then the account as it has a chance as to default to a Workday platform. If it's just stand-alone planning, I think it's probably harder to predict at this point. And Tom, if you want to add anything. -- No, I agree. I think all those accounts are opportunities to engage with the customer and develop a more holistic relationship. But I think it's more likely to advance, if it's an HCM and planning deal. -- Thank you very much.And we have a question from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your questions. -- Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss, and congrats on a swell and a strong start to the year. Robynne maybe kick off with the cash flow related question. We looked at the billings performance this quarter and the deferred revenue performance all very strong at 30% plus, and the -- it seems -- on the cash flow side though it seems to under pace the growth in billings, as well as in the overall cash flow. Can you give us a sense of why cash flow grew 14% year-over-year versus the 30% type of growth we saw in deferred revenue? -- Yes. So because Q4 is such a high volume collections quarter. It's not easy to predict how much we're going to get in Q4 versus Q1. And so we found over performance in cash collections in Q4, which took some cash out of Q1. So we still feel really good about our guide for the year, but Q1 was a little bit of a lower cash flow quarter for us than usual. But you should expect that to pick up later in the year. -- Great. That's very helpful. And maybe Aneel for you, as we think more broadly about the platform, it seems like each of the various HCM financial plannings seems to be performing well. If I look back to PeopleSoft all those years ago, you guys I think brought on supply chain at the later stages of the PeopleSoft story. Is that an area where the platform can move next in sort of serving more of the sort of manufacturing type vertical, any thoughts on that? -- I'd say it's on the radar, but I wouldn't say that we're going to announce anything imminently. There's -- that's a big undertaking. We sort of have more work to do to really establish ourselves as leaders outside of HR. We want that same leadership position for financials for planning. I think we're planning with Adaptive, we're one in the two.And then with Prism Analytics, we saw 70% or almost 70% growth this past quarter. So I don't feel the need for another growth engine at this point. Frankly, I think it would be a distraction. We have a lot of work to do on the product side especially as we take all the products into the world of machine learning. But, you know, I'd ask that question every year and somewhere you might get a different answer. -- Appreciate that, Aneel. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby from William Blair & Company. Please ask your question. -- Thanks, guys, and congrats. And Chano, I wanted to ask about just your efforts selling back to the base. I think there's been a bit more of a focus around that over the last several quarters. I'm wondering if you're seeing any sort of measurable impact whether retention rates or bookings mix or if it's more incremental? And then I've got a quick follow up for Aneel. -- Thanks, Justin. That customer base efforts or add-ons is tracking well. We see increased adoption around many different product signs, recruiting, learning, clearly present planning expenses and some others. We are very happy as well with the retention rates. We have commented again over 100% on a net bases. So, those efforts we feel that they're paying off, they're still early days, but clearly as the opportunities increase, not only domestic here in the U.S., but also internationally with a larger customer base, we see a huge opportunity there, based on our great customer satisfaction and proven solution adoption. That's a great opportunity for us going forward. -- Okay, great. And then Aneel, I think you mentioned Legg Mason, which if I remember right was an Oracle win and it sounds like a win back for you guys. I'm just wondering if you could speak more broadly on whether you're seeing more of those types of opportunities in your pipeline from Oracle, SAP. And if so, what you think is driving that? Thanks. -- You know, I'd probably rather not comment on that one. Legg Mason for the full organization not going at all the competitive dynamics. They were happy with what they had rolled out initially and decided to broaden their use of Workday, and that's probably best to leave it there. There are failed cloud implementations. There are also cloud implementations of best-of-breed products tied back to legacy core H.R. and finance that are on premise. All those create opportunities for us. So, it all comes back to having happy customers and having projects that are successful and as we stay focused on that, and other people don't have successful outcomes, hopefully do look to Workday. -- Okay, great. Thanks, guys.And we have Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Please ask your question. -- Thank you, and again as you've heard, congrats on the quarter. I got two questions. The first is can you give us a bit more color on Services specifically how have you seen the Workday delivered services shifting from HCM to financials. What I'm really trying to understand is how your -- how the process is moving in terms of getting the partners to deliver not just on the HCM side but on the full financial side themselves? Are you seeing the clients able to -- the partners be able to build and implement better and bigger implementations of financials. So, where are you on both of those journeys? And then a follow up question. -- I have to get back to you with some of the specific data, but finance is definitely now more than half of the ecosystem, well more than half of the ecosystem is the partner ecosystem that was the case of H.R. many years ago. And I'm going to guess it's better than 80/20 for H.R. I'm not quite sure where it is for finance. Probably tracking close to that, but the partners of all -- two large partner have all embraced financials and in some cases some of the firms that were late to embracing H.R. have made up by embracing finance early, and then we've got the boost from these partners embracing Adaptive. So feel very good about the partner engagement on financials, and our stated goal is that our services is there to support our customers, and therefore customer satisfaction, but we really count on our partners to take on the bulk of the implementation work. -- That makes sense, and that's very helpful. And as a follow up, where are you on moving the existing planning customers over to Adaptive? -- Yes, we've made -- this is Tom. We've made excellent progress, and I think at this point, we have had conversations with probably 75% of the customers. Some of the customers who had implemented the Workday planning product, it's operating successfully for them. So they'll be a little bit slower in their migration, but we have several successful customers. For example, Bucknell University is up, is live, running on Adaptive, and we have five or six other customers who have already converted and gone live. -- Very helpful. Thank you. I appreciate it.And we have a question from John DiFucci from Jefferies. Please ask your question. -- Hi. This is Samad Samana on for John. Couple of questions. One, for Aneel, the 50% net new ACV growth for financials is really impressive. I was curious if we were to stratify that for mid-market customers versus large enterprise, how would that growth rate look? And then I have maybe a follow up question for Robynne. -- Chano, on that first one? -- I wouldn't have know exactly, I will need to come back to you on day one. What I can tell you is that the momentum continues in terms of seeing financials moving more upmarket. And there is a good strength there. We had a great quarter in terms of large financials customers particularly in healthcare and financial services to mention sun.We saw a good momentum continue in terms of financial first move that we highlighted in Q4. And as well some good progress in terms of our HCM customer base, coming out of -- again being very happy with the product kind of partnership, considering us full financials and the pipeline is around those opportunities since they're pretty healthy going forward. -- Great. And then, Robynne, I guess from a bit of a CFO perspective, if you think about the adoption for financials, how do you think in terms of all of the changes we've seen here. If I think about even ASC 606, as some of that lessons. Do you think that adoption for financials should continue to increase as a result of that as well and CFOs, maybe I have less to deal with from a regulatory standpoint, maybe just help us understand from your perspective on financials adoptions as well. Thank you. -- Yes, that's a great question, Samad. I do think there has been some distraction around some of these big accounting changes including 606 and then more recently the lease accounting changes, which was I know a lot of work for public companies, finance organizations. It will be interesting to see as the companies get beyond that, if that frees them up to make system changes.I do believe that one of the things that these accounting changes really highlight is how difficult it is to implement these changes if you're on a legacy on premise financial system, where customers who are in the cloud, and even more specifically on Workday Financials, we've built in all the functionality that they needed to adopt and account properly under the standard going forward, and we did that internally ourselves as well, we're using all of the lease accounting functionality to adopt that at the beginning of our Q1.So I do think that it will highlight the need for a CFOs and businesses to move to the cloud. So I do expect some positive momentum coming out of that. But the timing of that is unclear as a lot of companies will move along their own timelines. -- Great. Appreciate you taking our questions, and congrats on the quarter.We have a question from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Please ask your question. -- Hey, guys, two quick ones from me. Robynne maybe just one more time on the linearity of the pipeline through the year. If you could talk to -- are you saying that this is a question of the comps being just more difficult in the 3Q period versus last year or is it something about the size of some very large and pace of some very large transactions that could make 4Q more or could make the year more back and loaded and which where would that show up is that -- should we look at two years ago from a billings linearity or deferred linearity to get a better sense than in the year ago period. And I've got a quick follow up. -- Yes, Alex. So really two different things. One, wanted to highlight the difficult comps from last year for the back half, right, just overall. But my comment specifically about Q4 and then I'll turn it over to Chano to add what he wants is when we look at our net new ACV for the year, a higher percentage of it is landing in Q4 than what we've seen in the last few years. Now this is just a continuation of a trend that we've been saying. But I did want it to call it out because it will impact your backlog, it will impact unearned, which will impact other metrics that you derive from those. So just wanted to make sure that you had the visibility that we were seeing with that dynamic. Chano anything you want to add? -- Thank you, Robynne, not much. I would say Alex that as you know we come off of a very strong FY '19, particularly strong Q4, and some of the large transactions that will be severally larger cycles in terms of how long it take us to get there? Will also on -- and will happen more materially around the Q4 time frame again this year. So that potentially has an impact of what we're commenting here, on the yearly linearity. Nothing else to highlight, but I think that's a normal cycle and trend as we are becoming a larger company, I would say. -- Got it. And then maybe just Aneel, a quick one for you. Now you're seeing the strong, really strong continued traction with Adaptive, in your first much larger acquisition. As you think about the broader aperture of your financial suite, and you think about organic versus inorganic innovation around that suite, how do you -- do you feel even better now about your ability to add functionality there through M&A to accelerate your vision? Or just maybe any comments about how you think about that for the future? -- I think, my personal view is that large acquisitions are really difficult. And frankly, a lot of things fell in place with Adaptive. Number one, we knew the team really well. Tom and I are close friends going back 15 years. We had very similar corporate cultures, very similar focus on customers. And then the products and technology were very complementary. We knew the space, we were pretty far behind where Adaptive was. So, there was a lot of things that fell into place to make that work.I just don't think there's a lot more targets out there like that. So, you could see us continue to do smaller M&A. But the big ones will have to be -- will have to pass through a very tight filter on cultural fit, on technology compatibility, on limited overlap in terms of both revenue and technology. So, I wouldn't see that as a precursor for us doing a whole bunch more large acquisitions. -- Perfect. Thanks, Aneel.And we have a question from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. -- Great, thank you. I just wanted to follow up on planning, it seems like you guys are having a lot of really good success there. And I know you've only owned the asset for a little less than a year. But, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the selling motion has changed since you've owned it. If it's a shorter sales cycle for you given how well you know these customers are ready when you're going into your installed base with it. And maybe any comment on you know your ability to sell this -- it like as an add on to what you know is a sweet sale versus stand-alone traction? Thank you. -- Yes. Thanks, Heather. This is Tom. So there are two fundamental selling motions. The first is a stand where we're selling -- planning on a stand-alone basis, and that's analogous to the way we sold the product prior to the acquisition by Workday. We continue to have a lot of success with that selling motion a lot of interest from customers and the business there. We continue to be very pleased with the business there.I think in the nine months since the acquisition, the biggest change has been in Adaptive's ability to penetrate larger customers and have meaningful conversations. These are often platform deals, and I'll let Chano comment on that as well, or their planning upsells to existing customers. And, I believe the credibility that we have being part of Workday has really accelerated our ability to have meaningful conversations with those customers. -- Yes, completely agree, Tom. I think, yes, the decision planning cycles are shorter than a normal financial cycles. So you see a couple of motions there. One is those customers that will be going with Adaptive on a stand-alone basis, even some of our ACA or financial customer base is starting with. And you see those where basically they see Adaptive as critical solution for them to make a decision to move forward with us, either on a financial transformation or an HR transformation, and that is certainly an asset that we didn't have a significant strength before, and that was, I would say, a gap, and it is much more complementary now. So, clearly it's great, the power that it is giving us in terms of not just the Adaptive planning stand-alone business but obviously for customers making broader decisions with Workday. -- Well, I would just add that the three we highlighted in the press release were all existing Workday customers, and they bought it as an add on, Airbus, AstraZeneca and H&R Block, all were already existing Workday customers so that was even part of a platform deal. So that's also a very exciting new development for us. -- Great. Thank you so much.And we have Derrick Wood from Cowen & Co. Please ask your question. -- Great. Thanks, Aneel. You mentioned trying to get new machine learning capabilities woven into the platform, where are you guys in this journey and how should we think about the modernization, how you get modernization out of it? Does it give you pricing leverage? What the revenue capture is? -- Well, we are -- we have been for the last three years, basically sowing in the machine learning capabilities into the platform rather than making it a feature app by app, right. You could add machine learning to one specific app, but it's not leveraged by the rest of the application. So, we're taking the longer term approach of building it into the fabric, and today we've got several examples of where it's shown up. In the career planning world, the system can make recommendations for the next move you should take or the next course you should take on the learning side.In the finance world, a lot of automation around the audit process. So it's coming to life really rapidly and we're going to unveil a whole more-whole wave of more capabilities at our next user conference. I don't see it as a pricing, we're not going to charge extra for it. It's hard to say -- it's hard to see charging one price for the products with machine learning and then charging less, if they don't have machine learning. I think it's going to be a core capability that is just required -- just to be competitive. And so maybe it gives us pricing leverage because we'll be ahead of our competition. I think it's very likely that we are already ahead and we'll just extend that GAAP, and we'll see if that gives us some pricing leverage. -- Okay. And I guess just staying on a product question, do you have any update on your platform efforts. I know it's a long build out cycle, but are there certain milestones we should be looking at as you roll this out to the market? -- Well, so we now are up to almost 100 customers that have signed on for being either a pilot customer or actually using the platform in production. Very simply the path to being in full GA, right now we're in limited GA is just opening up the full platform from an API perspective. Right now we're building out the APIs for very specific use cases making sure those first wave of customers are successful, and then adding a new set of APIs to open up additional use cases. And you'll just see over time that -- I think of it maybe won't take us long, but gmail was in beta forever even though it was a great product.I think we're going to be in some form of limited GA for some time just as the breadth of APIs increases. But if the APIs that are there meet your needs, then it's full GA. So I think that's the -- maybe that's not a clear way to describe it, but we have work to do on the APIs, the rest of the platform looks very strong. -- Okay. That's good color. Thank you.And we have a question from Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer. Please ask your question. -- Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question here this afternoon. Either for Chano or Aneel, I was wondering if you can share with us, it's an industry question, on what you're seeing on demand trends and the pipeline momentum in the federal government. And then as we think about financial management in the federal government, it's possible to either compare or contrast the adoption trends that you're seeing for that industry versus what you're seeing in the commercial area? Thanks. -- Yes, this will be really simple and really short. We don't sell to the federal government. There's a whole set of unique accounting requirements and even HR requirements that almost make it a completely different product line. Now, if the federal government continues down the path to acting more like commercial organizations that would open up a brand new market for us and we do have some quasi federal agencies that are Workday customers because they actually tend to operate more like a commercial entity. But right now it's not a focal point for us.And we have Scott Berg from Needham. Please ask your question. -- Hi, everyone. Congrats on a good quarter. Just one question for me, and I don't know who wants to take it. But we heard in the quarter that I assume it was Workday ventures who made an investment in one of the large RPA robotic process automation vendors that's out there. That company subsequently bought both your financials and HR platform is using it to reduce the implementation times by 50% or better. I just wanted to know is this the technology you guys are looking to bring into your own implementation cycles? Because I know that it has been a large focus reduced implementation time frames in costs over the last two years. Thank you. -- Yes. I would say that's in the TBD category. We make investment in a lot of interesting technologies. This new world of automation is definitely interesting to us, but we haven't made any decision yet to bring it into our own platform. And some of the estimates in terms of reduced time, we haven't been able to validate those ourselves. So, we continue to invest heavily in our technologies to reduce the cost of implementation, and if some of this RPA stuff can reduce the cost of implementation or reduce the time, we definitely would embrace it. But unclear at this point. It's an exciting new area, but unclear that this is something that we're going to bring in closer to Workday.We have time for two more questions. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please ask your question. -- Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Quick question for Aneel. If you look at the competitive landscape, one of your competitors -- large competitors is trying to force their client base over to kind of non-value add upgrade. Do you see anything of that showing up in your kind of conversations already? Or is that something that's still going to come? Thank you. -- Anytime a customer is facing an upgrade from the legacy platform, they tend to look around and all we want to do is just to be in the mix of conversations. They're definitely customers that probably don't come to market, but Increasingly customers are smart about their choices and so I do think that those kinds of tactics just drive customers into a decision making process, and they look at alternatives and hope we do well as part of those evaluations. Customers don't like that. They don't want to be forced to do it, to do anything. But I think if they're being pushed to move into the cloud, if I were them, I'd say, hey take a look at all the alternatives that are out there before you make a decision. -- Yes, OK. Bye-bye. It makes sense. Thank you. Well done.We will take our final question from Brad Reback from Stifel. Please ask your question. -- Great. Thanks very much. Can you give us a sense of how the renewal pipeline looks for the remainder of the year? And the opportunity that can afford you to sustain the strong upsell you saw in the current quarter? Thanks. -- Yes. This is Chano, and the renewal pipeline is looking very strong for the remainder of the year. We at this point have no reason to fear other than confident with the same kind of renewal ratios, in terms of the net basis that we've been sharing with you. -- And Chano on that point, how is your confidence on the ability to upsell with this much broader products set than these customers saw when they first signed their deals? -- As I commented before, having a broader customer base with a broader set of products, when you have the customer satisfaction ratios that we're enjoying is just a blessing, right. Because clearly allows us to have conversations with customers that are raising value in some of the products and investments they've done with Workday. And we have to trust to prove basically the opportunity for them to get value of the additional solutions that we bring to market.So, we feel very confident, and we've been sharing with you some of the attached ratios on very high rates that we've been experiencing on the sale of your products. So around 70% or 70% plus on products like time tracking, recruiting, payroll, and others that have been longer in the market. We have no reason to believe that some of the other products that are just newer will not get to the same ratios over time. -- Great. Thank you very much.We now conclude the call.

In what may feel like an old-hat move for investors who've watched Workday , the company followed by boosting its full-year outlook for subscription-revenue growth.With shares down modestly in after-hours trading as of this writing as the market absorbs the news, let's examine how Workday started its new fiscal year.IMAGE SOURCE: WORKDAY.DATA SOURCE: WORKDAY. *FOR THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 30, 2019. GAAP = GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.Workday co-founder and CEO Aneel Bhusri stated:Coming off the heels of an excellent fiscal year 2019, our momentum continued with a strong first quarter. We added many new customers across the globe -- increasing our footprint across the Fortune 50 and 500 -- and saw more existing customers expand their investment in Workday. Looking ahead, we believe our ability to enable more organizations to plan, execute, and analyze in one system powered by machine learning, coupled with our commitment to employee and customer success, will further solidify our foundation for enduring growth.During the subsequent conference call, management told investors to expect fiscal second-quarter 2020 revenue of roughly $870 million to $872 million, including a roughly 32% increase in subscription revenue to a range of $746 million to $748 million and services revenue of $124 million.As such,\u00a0Workday once again increased its full-year guidance, calling for fiscal 2020 revenue of $3.545 billion to $3.56 billion, up from $3.53 billion to $3.545 billion previously. This new range assumes a slightly raised subscription-revenue range of $3.045 billion to $3.06 billion (up 28% year over year), and continues to model $500 million in professional-services revenue.It remains to be seen how the market will react to this modestly stronger-than-expected showing, particularly with Workday shares already up more than 60% over the past year. But there's little not to like about Workday's latest beat-and-raise performance. As the company's industry-leading portfolio of products grow ever more pervasive in the enterprise world, patient investors should be more than happy with where it stands today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new June 14th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $197.50 strike price has a current bid of $8.30.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $197.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $189.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $201.48/share today.\n\nBecause the $197.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.20% return on the cash commitment, or 35.67% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, and highlighting in green where the $197.50 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $202.50 strike price has a current bid of $9.50.  If an investor was to purchase shares of WDAY stock at the current price level of $201.48/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $202.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.22% if the stock gets called away at the June 14th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if WDAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing WDAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $202.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $202.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.72% boost of extra return to the investor, or 40.02% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 46%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 43%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $201.48) to be 39%.

They were the leaders going into the fourth-quarter correction and they were one of the first groups to bottom.  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and others bottomed in November and have been climbing ever since. However, Workday stock has been under pressure since reporting earnings, causing investors to ask if now's the time to buy. Source: WorkdayTo determine that, we need to comb through the company's earnings results. Last week, Workday  on its fourth-quarter results.Non-GAAP earnings of 41 cents per share beat consensus expectations by 9 cents. On a GAAP basis, WDAY turned in a 47 cent per share loss, although that was 8 cents better than expected. On the revenue front, sales of $788.6 million beat analysts' expectations by almost $12 million and grew 35.4% year-over-year (YoY).Both subscription and services revenue came in ahead of expectations, as did billings and operating margins. All while management raised its subscription revenue for this year. The company now expects $3.03 billion to $3.045 billion in subscription sales vs. a prior outlook of $2.375 billion to $2.377 billion.At this point, you're probably wondering why Workday stock isn't rally  . Further, why is the stock action  10% after the fact?We need to keep a few things in mind. First, the stock clearly ran too much ahead of the print. Up more than 66% from its November lows, and anything short of a mega-blowout quarter was a sell-the-news event. Second, WDAY stock is already quite expensive and even with better-than-expected results, it needs some time to let the fundamentals catch up to its price.I love Workday's products and it's clear that its customers do too. That's said, the valuation is rich - and that's putting it mildly. Investors who are going to get involved in cloud and enterprise software stocks need to swallow their traditional valuation metrics. These names typically trade at insane multiples, but it's hard to deny their long-term performance. That's why it's best to buy on big dips - like we saw in Q4 - rather than at or near all-time highs.With Workday, we can see why. While current expectations call for great growth - 26% and 23% revenue growth this year and next, and 21% and 33% earnings growth this year and next - 110 times this year's non-GAAP earnings is very high. Operating cash flow increased about 30% in the last fiscal year and management expects similar growth this year. Free cash flow also continues to increase, eclipsing $600 million over the trailing 12 months.When we dig a little further past the headline results, we see that the booking growth outlook for this year lags management's revenue growth outlook. That suggests slowing organic growth. Currently trading at 11 times this year's sales, WDAY stock isn't cheap. But given its growth and solid business, I think that's why we're only ~10% off the highs. All things considered, Workday's pullback seems justified and doesn't mean the bull run is over.In short, I think we have a valuation issue with Workday stock. These forms of consolidation can either happen through time or through price (or both). So far, WDAY stock is correcting through price, down 10% in just a few days. We'll see if further consolidation happens through time or in the form of more declines.If it's the latter, here are the levels to keep in mind. Knifing through the 21-day moving average, WDAY stock is currently using the 50-day moving average as support. I like the work it is putting in above the 50-day, consolidating that decline. But I wouldn't hate a move down to $170-ish.Why? Because this was an important level on the way up and I would like to see it now act as resistance. Further, it would flush out the stop-loss orders that are no doubt piling up near the 50-day as we speak. Finally, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement for the 52-week range comes into play just over $169, while the 61.8% retracement for the year-to-date range is up near $170.48.At this point, let's see if the 50-day acts as support. Above and we'll need to see how Workday stock does with the 21-day.

As of mid-day Monday, a basket of SaaS stocks had declined by more than 4%. (NASDAQ:  ), an SaaS provider, wasn't immune to the selling, as SPLK stock fell 5% on the day. Another leading cloud-computing company,  (NASDAQ:  ),fell 5% as well, while SaaS company  (NYSE:  ) retreated 2.7%.This turn in sector sentiment came at a terrible time for SPLK stock. Just last week, SPLK beat analysts' earnings expectations and raised its guidance for the full year. Its numbers looked amazing. And yet, Splunk stock traded essentially flat following its earnings and fell sharply to start the week. Is it time to buy the dip in Splunk stock yet, or would it be prudent to let SPLK stock continue to correct?Splunk has been one of the most consistent and impressive large-cap tech growth companies in recent memory. Its numbers are truly mind-blowing. Over the past five years, SPLK's average compounded annual revenue growth rate was 45%. In 2014, the company produced just $451 million of revenue. For the most recent 12 months, that figure quadrupled to more than $1.8 billion of sales.Additionally, while SPLK has not been very profitable yet, analysts see the tipping point coming soon. On average, analysts forecast that the company's earnings per share will reach $1.62 over the next year, and its earnings are expected to grow at an average annual rate of more than 30% over the next five years.Perhaps most incredibly, even as Splunk's revenues have gone through the roof, its growth rate hasn't slowed down. Normally, companies decelerate as they get bigger, but Splunk is still finding plenty of opportunities to grow. It's far more impressive when a company with $1.8 billion of revenue is growing its top line 40% each year than when a firm with a few hundred million dollars of annual revenue is accomplishing the same feat.Splunk's earnings report drew nearly universal praise from analysts.  , which has long been a Splunk bull, raised its price target on SPLK stock from $137 to $157 following the earnings release. The firm suggested that Splunk is even stronger than it may seem.  , not to be outdone, lifted its price target on SPLK by $20 to $165 per share.Mark Moerdler of  raised his price target from $119 to $131. He left a \"neutral\" rating on the shares. In a moment of humility, he noted that \"we obviously got off the bus too early on this one.\" Even  , which is sticking with its \"sell\" call on SPLK stock, had to give credit where it was due. Citi recommended selling Splunk stock last year as it felt that the company probably wouldn't grow much more. After Splunk's recent results, however, Citigroup raised its price target on SPLK stock from $98 to $112.The key issue facing SPLK stock is that Wall Street is fully aware of its great growth outlook. As a result, SPLK stock was trading around 13 times its sales following its most recent earnings report. That's really pricey, even for a company with phenomenal sales growth. Traditionally, as a rule of thumb, investors need to be careful about paying more than ten times sales for even the fastest-growing tech companies.Often, when a company reports stellar earnings results and the stock doesn't move, it is simply because the Street's expectations were high before the results were released.If SPLK's earnings had come in below expectations, it probably would have plunged 10% or more, as investors were really confident that Splunk would continue to grow rapidly. With the market already pricing in greatness, it is hard for Splunk to surprise to the upside, even with outstanding results.If SPLK stock trades at ten times its sales, and its 2019 sales meet expectations, SPLK stock will rise to nearly $150, considerably higher than today's price.Thus, for a patient investor, the selloff of Splunk stock following its great earnings could be a golden opportunity. As long as the company maintains its stunning sales growth, SPLK stock will rise much higher over time. SPLK stock may not rally in the short-term, given macro headwinds, but the value of SPLK will keep increasing, along with the company's booming revenue forecasts.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["owered by strong growth in subscription revenue and momentum with financial customers,  (NASDAQ: WDAY) , a human capital management software company, reported a strong fourth quarter last week.The results were solid all around. \"We were pleased to close Q4 with strong momentum across our key subscription revenue drivers, while delivering solid operating margins and record cash flows,\" CFO Robynne Sisco said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings release.While  are notable -- particularly its 35.4% year-over-year rise in revenue and its 46% jump in non-  earnings per share -- there was more information worth investors' attention in the company's  . Here are three quotes from the call.Image source: Workday.One common theme in Workday's recent  s has been the success of the company's applications for financial companies. This continued in Q4, with the company adding 79 core financial management customers, four of which were  500 companies.But Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri went further during the , highlighting how the company's financial management product is morphing into a key tool for customer acquisition: \"One interesting new trend is that we are beginning to see large enterprise companies now starting their finance and HR journeys with Workday Financial Management. This is a new development, and something we view as a positive indication of the growing awareness of our Financial Management applications and the high levels of satisfaction our finance customers have experienced in the past several years.\"When asked about how management thinks its operating margin will develop over time, Sisco said the company still has a long-term target of a non-GAAP operating margin of 25%. But she also noted that the company continues to invest aggressively: \"[W]e are still heavily investing, not only in Financials but in some of our other products such as  and bringing them into the Workday fold, Prism Analytics, Workday Cloud Platform, and building out a lot of our industry modules as well, such as inventory for healthcare and supply chain. So we're very much in investment mode...\"Sisco pointed to Workday's mature human capital management business, which already has a 25% non-GAAP operating margin, as evidence of where management believes it can take its consolidated business over the long haul. \"[B]ut the proof of the HR business right now really gives us a lot of confidence that as we move toward those long-term targets,\" she said, \"they are very achievable in the long run.\"Workday's momentum is supported by a broad base of growth drivers. The company's 30% year-over-year increase in revenue backlog during the quarter, for instance, was \"driven by strong net new bookings, success with add-on sales into our customer base, and strong renewals, with net retention once again over 100%,\" Sisco said. In addition, she noted that the company continued to view its ongoing global expansion as a key growth lever, \"with total revenue outside the U.S. up 41% to $184 million in Q4, representing 23% of total revenue.\"When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Some investors might be wary about buying Twilio after that massive rally, but Goldman Sachs recently gave it a buy rating with a Street-high price target of $150 -- which is roughly 15% above its price as of this writing.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley rated Twilio as equal weight with a price target of $130, noting that while it could \"disrupt an industry ripe for disruption,\" its potential gains were already baked into the stock. Wall Street analysts currently have an average price target of $123 on the stock.Image source: Getty Images.Investors should always be skeptical of analysts' ratings and do their own research. However, we should still take a moment to see if Twilio's stock has gotten ahead of itself, and whether Wall Street is too bullish on its growth prospects.Twilio's cloud-based service handles text messages, emails, calls, videos, and other content for mobile apps. In the past, developers needed to create those features from scratch, which was buggy, time consuming, and tough to scale. With Twilio, developers simply add a few lines of code to outsource those features to Twilio's cloud platform -- which can be easily scaled as an app attracts more users.Twilio enjoys a first mover's advantage in this market, and it's generating accelerating sales growth over the past year. Its base revenue (from customers who signed 12-month minimum contracts) and its dollar-based net expansion rate (its sales growth per customer) also remained robust:\n  \nData source: Twilio quarterly reports. YOY = year over year.However, investors should note that Twilio's fourth-quarter revenue was significantly boosted by its  , which closed in February. Nonetheless, Wall Street still loves Twilio's accelerating sales growth, and its three consecutive quarters of non-GAAP profitability indicate that its growth is sustainable.Analysts expect Twilio's revenue to rise 66% this year, and its non-GAAP earnings to dip 9% to $0.10 per share. In 2020, they expect its revenue and earnings to rise 32% and 160%, respectively, after it laps the SendGrid acquisition. Over the next five years, they expect Twilio's non-GAAP earnings to grow at an average rate of 37% per year.Image source: Getty Images.Twilio's growth looks impressive, but its valuation is high. At $130, it trades at 1,300 times this year's earnings and about 500 times next year's earnings. That forward P/E is lofty relative to the forward valuations of comparable high-growth cloud service companies like  (NYSE: CRM) and  (NASDAQ: WDAY) :\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance, March 19. EPS = earnings per share.However, five-year forecasts for tech companies can be inaccurate due to disruption and competition, and the bulls will argue that sales growth matters much more than earnings growth for younger tech companies like Twilio. In that regard, Twilio's stock doesn't look that pricey relative to its projected sales growth:\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance, March 19.Twilio is hard to value because it's tough to gauge how much growth is baked in. I think it will be tough for Twilio to deliver multibagger returns again from these levels, especially as competitors like  's Nexmo and  ramp up their  . Twilio's GAAP losses are also still widening and its free cash flow remains negative.I admire Twilio's business model, but I think Goldman's $150 price target is too bullish. This stock needs to cool off before it moves forward again, and I agree with Morgan Stanley's assessment that much of its potential growth is already priced in.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

The human capital management software specialist detailed its continued success in winning the business of an ever-growing number of enormous enterprise customers, boosting its subscription revenue guidance for the coming year in the process.With Workday stock up modestly in  as of this writing, let's clock in for a closer look at how the company ended the year, as well as what shareholders can expect looking forward.IMAGE SOURCE: WORKDAY.DATA SOURCE: WORKDAY. *FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JAN. 31, 2019. GAAP = GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.Workday co-founder and CEO Aneel Bhusri stated:During the  , CFO Robynne Sisco told investors the company expects fiscal first-quarter 2020 revenue of between $812 million and $814 million, including 33% growth in subscription revenue to between $692 million and $694 million.In that vein, Workday increased its previous full fiscal-year 2020 guidance to call for revenue of $3.53 billion to $3.545 billion, including a 27% to 28% boost in subscription revenue to a range of $3.093 billion to $3.045 billion (up from $3 billion to $3.01 billion before).It's hard to argue with this beat-and-raise performance as Workday's solid product portfolio and loyal, steadily increasing customer base continues to drive sustained growth. Assuming Workday can maintain its focus and industry leadership, I suspect the stock will inevitably continue to respond in kind.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. -- Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth-quarter . I'm pleased to report that Workday had another strong quarter, capping off a great year. We continue to attract new customers, and many of our current customers are growing their investments with us.We now have over 2,600 customers, and our commitment to their success is demonstrated by our 98% customer satisfaction rate and broad referenceability. In Q4, we saw healthy demand across all product areas. Starting out with Workday HCM, we had another strong quarter as we continue to lead the market with our differentiated suite of products. In total, we added 10 new Fortune 500 customers and now have approximately 40% of the Fortune 500 using our HCM product line, including half of the Fortune 50.New customers include A.P. Moller-Maersk, Caterpillar, Sumitomo Chemical and Wyndham Worldwide Operations. We continue landing these large marquee accounts in no small part due to our proven ability to uniquely support our customers' high volumes of data and transactions. Notable go-lives in Q4 include Lloyds Bank plc, McKesson and Siemens AG.Switching over to the world of finance. Q4 was our best quarter ever for our Financial Management product line. In the fourth quarter, we added 79 core Financial Management customers, including four new Fortune 500 customers, two of which were net new customers and two of which who were existing customers that added on Financials. A few of the notable new Financial Management customers include Ryder Truck, Ameriprise and Banner Health.One interesting new trend is that we are beginning to see large enterprise companies now starting their finance and HR journeys with Workday Financial Management. This is a new development and something we view as a positive indication of the growing awareness of our Financial Management applications and the high levels of satisfaction our finance customers have experienced in the past several years. In addition to the strong growth from our core Financial Management Suite, we saw strong momentum in our second full-quarter selling the Adaptive Insights Business Planning Cloud. Indeed, it was an excellent quarter of execution within the core Adaptive Insights business, with over 200 new Planning customers for its stand-alone offering.We also achieved great success bringing Adaptive Insights into new large enterprise opportunities as addon sales into the existing Workday customer base, adding Planning in more than 50 new Workday platform deals and 30 existing Workday accounts. With Workday Prism Analytics, we had a record quarter in terms of number of new customers and again had triple-digit ACV growth, giving us strong momentum heading into fiscal-year '20. Indeed, our customers seem to be resonating with the idea of bringing any type of operational data securely into Workday in order to deliver better business insights and outcomes. Switching to the people front.A key part of our success continues to be our vibrant company culture, which allows us to maintain high levels of employee satisfaction and greatly helps us attract and retain talent across all levels of the company. To that end, I'd like to thank our entire team for making Workday No. 4 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For list in the U.S. Being a great place to work is something that Dave and I have cared about since day one, and it's an honor for the Workday team to be recognized on this prestigious list.As we look forward to fiscal year '20 and beyond, we will continue our relentless focus on innovation and expect to see continued momentum from our growing family of applications. We're confident in the pipeline we have built and the sales execution model we have in place. As such, we expect fiscal-year '20 to be another strong year of growth. I will now turn it to our CFO and Co-President Robynne Sisco.Over to you, Robynne. -- Thanks, Aneel, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter capped a very strong year as we continue to demonstrate momentum across our subscription revenue growth drivers. We not only added a record number of net new customers in Q4, we also closed a record number of core Financials deals. Our high levels of customer satisfaction continued to drive strong renewal rates and add-on sales, supporting our thesis that satisfied customers not only become long-term customers but grow their relationships with us over time, both of which drive long-term shareholder value.Our subscription revenue grew 37% to $674 million for the fourth quarter and was up 33% to $2.386 billion for the full year. Total revenue was $789 million in Q4, reflecting growth of 35% from last year and $2.822 billion or growth of 32% for the full year. We continue to see global expansion as one of our growth levers, with total revenue outside the U.S. up 41% to $184 million in Q4, representing 23% of total revenue.Subscription revenue backlog was $6.74 billion, growth of 30% year over year, driven by strong net new bookings, success with add-on sales into our customer base and strong renewals, with net retention once again over 100%. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $4.47 billion or growth of 29%. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter was $93 million or 11.8%. For the year, non-GAAP operating profit grew 35% to $291 million or 10.3% of total revenue.Benefiting from strong collections in Q4, operating cash flow for fiscal '19 was $607 million, representing 30% growth from last year. The integration of Adaptive Insights have gone extremely well. And the headwind to cash flow from the transaction and integration costs we incurred in the second half of FY '19 is now largely behind us. Current unearned revenue was $1.84 billion in Q4, up 29% year over year while, total unearned revenue grew 27% year over year to $1.95 billion.We successfully added and integrated more than 2,300 net new employees to Workday this year, which include approximately 500 from the Adaptive Insights acquisition, bringing our total employee count at year end to over 10,500. Operationally, we continue to execute well against our long-term vision, and our great second-half performance capped a very strong year. Now let me turn to guidance for fiscal 2020. As we enter the year, we see strong growth levers across all our products and geographies.We remain early in addressing our long-term opportunity, with most of our products still in the beginning stages of their growth curves. And you should continue to expect that we will reinvest any incremental top-line overperformance this year. For the first quarter, we expect subscription revenue to be between $692 million and $694 million, representing 33% year-over-year growth. For the full year, we are raising our subscription revenue guidance to a range of $3.03 billion to $3.045 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 27% to 28%.Sequentially, we expect subscription revenue to increase from the previous quarter by approximately 7% in Q2 and approximately 5.5% in Q3 and four. On the professional services front, we continue to value and support a growing SI ecosystem. Our partners are seeing robust growth in their Workday practices, and we will continue our tight alignment with them to ensure customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value. We are expecting professional services revenue to be approximately $120 million in Q1 and $500 million for fiscal 2020, growth of 24% and 15%, respectively.Professional services margins will be slightly lower than last year as we continue to invest in programs to support customer deployments and to sustain our high levels of customer satisfaction. As we enter FY '20, I want to reiterate that we don't run the business to maximize either unearned revenue or calculated billings. As we discussed throughout this past fiscal year, our focus continues to be on new customer acquisition and long-term customer economics, which means that we will likely continue to see variability in unearned revenue throughout the year. We believe that our subscription revenue backlog is a much better gauge of the health of our business over the long term.And even though backlog will have some variability quarter to quarter based on contract duration and the timing of renewals, including early renewals associated with add-on business, unlike billings and unearned, it filters out the noise caused by varying invoicing terms. Based on our current outlook, we expect total subscription revenue backlog to have year-over-year growth in the high 20% range in the first half of the year. Given the accelerated growth we experienced in the back half of FY '19, the comps get more difficult in the second half of FY '20. So we are currently expecting year-over-year growth in the second half to be in the low 20s.Consistent with the preliminary outlook we gave last quarter, we expect a 200 basis point improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year, bringing our margin to approximately 12.3% for FY '20. The margin improvement reflects leverage as we scale, with continued investment in products and other areas of business to support our long-term growth aspirations. We estimate non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 13% in Q1 and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2 as we invest in our people through our annual compensation process. The GAAP margins for the first quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 27 to 28 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins.We expect operating cash flow in FY '20 to be approximately $790 million or 30% growth. The non-GAAP tax rate remains 17% for FY '20. Our Pleasanton development center construction project will be completed this year, and we plan to begin occupying the building in Q2. The FY '20 capital outlay for this project will be approximately $130 million and be front-loaded toward the first half of the year.We expect to spend an additional $280 million in FY '20 to support our other capital needs, primarily related to investments in data centers to support our customer growth, leased facilities and corporate IT infrastructure to support our continued business expansion and large furniture purchases in Q1 as we prepare the development center for occupation. And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners and employees for their continued support and hard work, which allowed us to deliver great results this past year. We are still in the early stages of executing against our long-term vision as a company, but our progress wouldn't be possible without shared goals. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.With that, let's begin the Q&A process.[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. -- I wanted to ask about the four Fortune 500 wins in Financials in a single quarter. It seems impressive. And just to clarify, I think two were HCM customers, which added Financials. Two, I believe you said, were net new.Does that mean that they were platform wins or Financials only? And then could you just comment in general on which incumbent systems are being replaced more commonly? -- Thank you, Mark, for the question. You got that right, two were existing HCM customers. Chano can answer the question about the other two being Financials only, and we can come back to that. I would say, of the 79 new financial customers, we saw for the first time a pattern of financial only or financial first, frankly, was enough of group of companies to actually think of it as a pattern.It's the typical systems you'd expect to be replaced, the legacy ERP systems, including the one we know best, PeopleSoft, but the others as well, of basically, the large company incumbents. -- OK, that's helpful. And then, Aneel, just as a follow-up, we noticed a recent article alluding to the possibility of Workday reaching $10 billion in revenue in six years. And I guess I'm not sure if you plan to comment or address that, but I think the last multiyear target we heard from Mark Peek was $4 billion. And so I'm just curious if you're sensing some incremental confidence in starting to think about a much higher number and maybe just what mix of business would Financials contribute as the company becomes multiples of its current size? -- Well, that number was really -- first of all, it's aspirational and was internal to our employees to get them excited about our future. We definitely feel like we have the market opportunity to get there. And it's all about the persistent growth rate over the next number of years in terms of how long we could get there. I have a ton of admiration for what Marc Benioff and Salesforce has done in getting to that and now passing that number, and we'd like to be the same.And we're not at a place yet to talk about the relative splits. All we can say is that our market opportunity across all of our different products is definitely sizable enough to get us there. And the reason we updated the goal is given guidance, we're going to be close to the $4 billion target. Well, I mean, we'll be in the north of $3 billion this year.So kind of keep people focused on the future, and we needed to think about the next targets to get people thinking about the long term internally. -- Mark, this is Chano speaking on the two net new core Fortune 500 Financials. They were platform deals. -- Chano, do you want to comment on what you're seeing in terms of Financials only as well? -- Yes. As Aneel mentioned in his script, we are seeing a new trend where large enterprise companies now are leading their transformations with Workday Financials. And that's the key compelling discussion before we're discussing the HCM opportunity. So we see this as a new development, and we believe it's a positive indication of the reputation we have built with our product and customers in the marketplace within Financials.Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby from William Blair. -- I guess for either Aneel or Chano, I wanted to ask about the medium enterprise because I guess the tone from partners in that space has picked up quite a bit over the last six or nine months. I wanted to see if you're seeing that in your results as well. And if you could give a sense for sort of what percentage or some sense of the mix of your overall business today is medium enterprise, and when you look out longer term, you think that mix will go up, down, stay constant? Any sort of thoughts there would be helpful. -- I think you are accurate in that we had a great quarter for medium enterprise. And we had a great quarter across all the parts of the business, but medium enterprise in particular grew faster than large enterprise, just given the number of accounts. And I think it's a testament to our lower-cost deployment model in that segment of the market really taking hold. Chano, do you want to add anything to that? -- No. I think you're right, Justin. We've seen strong growth. As we've said in all the calls, they usually are generally biased to the full platform, and it is clearly a testament of the go-lives, the value and clearly the lower implementation costs.And we're now more focused on driving the same basic implementation method already outside of the U.S. internationally as we go into FY '20 and beyond. -- OK. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask on M&A because it seems like the early results on Adaptive have been really positive. And Aneel, I'm wondering if that changes your view at all on M&A.When you look out over the medium term, do you think you could do another deal of that sort of size or even bigger? And what sorts of things are interesting to you from an M&A standpoint? -- I don't know if that changes our perspective. We have a very narrow filter, and Adaptive fits that on so many fronts. Number one, we have very similar value systems. Adaptive is focused on their employees, on their customers and on innovation.Tom Bogan is a close friend for 15 years, and so integrations go well based on trust and cultural fit. And if you apply that filter, it narrows the group to a pretty short list of companies that fit. And I'm not going to comment on what industries or what spaces, but I think the Adaptive experience has been a great experience. I think a huge part of it is the cultural alignment.And where we've had misses in the past on much smaller opportunities, it's been also around cultural alignment. So that is the key factor for us. And I don't know, Tom, if you want to add anything to that. -- No. I agree, Aneel. And I do think the cultural alignment is really important. And what I might add to that was the opportunity for Adaptive to leverage the core Workday sales force, particularly around large enterprise and international opportunities.Now I think that's one of the elements that's made this acquisition so successful in the early days.Next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC. -- I'm just curious, as you start to see this pattern change on Financials, either Aneel or Chano, do you feel you need to change anything in the sales org? And maybe specifically, is there an opportunity to create a sort of new motion -- stand-alone Financials motion? And then just as a follow-up, Robynne or Aneel, do you have the new ACV growth for Financials this quarter? -- I'll let Robynne answer the second part. I think we have the right set of motions. I don't really think it requires a change in motions. I think it just means that as we engage with the customer, we should make sure we ask the question, \"What is the scope of the project?\" and not just default to, \"Hey, they're going to lead with HR because that's been the pattern we've known for the last, let's say, five years but probably for the last decade.\" If that's changing, we just have to really listen to our customers and our prospects as to where they want to go first.I think overall, we're in a world of digital transformation. Those are the buzzwords that get used quite often, but it's true. And as the finance organization gets more comfortable with the cloud, and frankly, as our products mature and we continue to have success with deployments, it's very similar to what happened in the client/server wave as well. Client/server started out with products like HR and then got more into mission-critical applications like finance as of the technology matured.I think we're actually seeing a very similar pattern this time around. I'd also add that one of the reasons, I think, we're getting Financials-first conversations is that the Adaptive products are opening the door to the CFO earlier or in some cases, they're opening the door for the first time, and then we can have that broader conversation. So I wouldn't underestimate the power of now having a conversation, not just around core Financials but also around the Planning products from Adaptive and also the Prism Analytics on the analysis side. We can tell a full story around planning, execution and analysis.And that's key for the CFO community and the finance organizations. Robynne, do you want to comment on growth rates? -- Yes, absolutely. So our net new ACV Financials, Financial Management growth rate was still very, very strong. Keep in mind we had a tough compare from Q4 last year where we had some very large Financials wins as well, but it continues to be very strong and outpaced the HCM ACV growth. And that is driving revenue growth, over 50% still on the Financial Management side.Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. -- Two questions. The first one is, can you give us some sense for these platform sales in terms of the revenue mix between HCM and Financials? And then I have a follow-up. -- Chano, do you want to take that one on? -- Yes. I would say that you could tell approx a one is to one ratio, depends, of course, on additional SKUs in terms of the full scope that the customers may be buying. -- Perfect. And then as a follow-up, you're discussing how you're seeing not just the customer growth, but you're getting more revenue per customer. Can you give us a sense of what the drivers are that's allowing you to sell up? Is that selling new products since they're new customers? Is it sales of incremental usage? I know obviously, it changes all the time. But again, anything that can give us some color on what's driving the incremental revenue growth per customer. -- It's generally the sale of additional modules. And I think I'd point to a couple of trends along that line. When you have happy customers, they definitely look to buy from vendors that they've had a good experience with. And once they're live with -- typically, a customer will start with core HR, maybe core HR and Payroll on the HR side, core accounting on the accounting side.Once they're live, they'll look to extend the footprint. So getting customers into production as quickly as possible and using our core capabilities then opens up the door for Learning, for Recruiting, for Prism Analytics, for Planning, for Time Tracking for those that didn't pick upfront Payroll. And so now that we have over 2,600 customers and 70% are in production, we have a big base of customers that are already up and running in our products. And it's just created a big base of opportunity to go back in and see what else would be useful to them.Next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. -- Very nice and strong close to FY '19. Two questions sort of looking forward into sort of the FY '20 guide. I hate to be kind of Debbie Downer, but what's the macro environment that you're thinking about in the forward year? And is there any indications that -- because I mean, there's definitely some macro indicators that are starting to cool and then slow down. Any indication that that's impacting your pipelines that are sort of getting you concerned as of yet? Or is just sort of the strategic focus on digitalization and financials just outweighing any macro concerns that guys have? And then maybe a follow-up question for Robynne on the margin side of the equation.I understand that sort of the focus of the company is still very much on sort of the growth side of the equation. Can you help us better understand kind of the puts and takes between sort of the more mature HCM business and the types of margins you're seeing there versus the Financials side of the equation where you're still putting a lot of investment in and how that kind of dynamic is impacting margins in the near term? -- On the first question, I was at a conference and saw one of our large financial services customers talk about their view of the global economy. And I tend to really resonate with his point of view. He broke it into three buckets: businesses, consumers and then government. Generally, businesses and CEOs have a positive outlook on their businesses and on the environment.The global economy continues to move forward at a nice pace. The general global consumer is spending money and generally in a positive frame of mind. The wild card is government, and I don't think this is an environment that many of us really know how to predict. Government has become unpredictable across many parts of the world, and we don't yet know how that's going to impact business or maybe it fades away.But that's the way -- we're, I think, in wait-and-see mode to see, will any of the government -- the government question marks out there actually have an impact on the pipeline? But businesses are still focused on digitization. Consumers are still spending money. It's really the question now, are these trade wars, some of the other macro environmental things coming out of government going to impact our pipeline? And I think we're in wait and-see mode view rather than having any view right now. Right now, I would say we probably haven't seen it yet, but we're watching it very carefully. -- And Keith, to your questions on margin, so we've talked in the past about long-term margin targets, non-GAAP operating margin targets of 25%. And we're really pleased to see that our HCM business is already there on a fully loaded basis. And so that really gives us confidence that we've got a very strong long-term operating margin, and we can continue to expand toward that long-term goal over time. But as you know, we are still heavily investing, not only in Financials but in some of our other products such as Adaptive and bringing them into the Workday fold, Prism Analytics, Workday Cloud Platform, and building out a lot of our industry modules as well, such as inventory for healthcare and supply chain.So we're very much in investment mode, but the proof of the HR business right now really gives us a lot of confidence that as we move toward those long-term targets, they are very achievable in the long run.Next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. -- I actually had two for you. First, I was wondering, Aneel, if you could talk a little bit on SAP's decision to force migration to HANA. And I'm wondering if you see this as starting to help the pipeline of financial conversions. Are you starting to have conversations with customers about that even though it's obviously many years out? And then the other question was on Adaptive.You guys obviously sound like you've seen really good initial traction. I'm just wondering if you could highlight a little bit of the competitive environment here and what features are resonating the most with clients versus what you had before. -- On the first question, Heather, I don't think there's any one factor we look at to increasing the pipeline. And a lot of the HANA customers that they're pushing toward are using Financials as part of distribution and manufacturing, and that's not really part of the sector we're targeting. I think overall, the cloud momentum that started with Salesforce in the world of CRM then moved to HR with Workday and ServiceNow with IT, is now coming to finance. And so when you look at the viable finance products in the cloud, it's actually a pretty short list.And so as people are looking to transform their finance operations and as part of that move to the cloud, it, frankly, tends to be much more about us and Oracle. And SAP doesn't really have a native cloud story, and so they really don't factor into the conversation as much. And I think what they're doing with HANA is kind of orthogonal to where we are since it's really affecting their manufacturing base on the finance side, and we're not really targeting that sector. Tom, do you want to comment on what's happening in the world of Planning? -- Yes. Aneel, thank you. So I think, Heather, it's fairly similar to what we saw before the acquisition with a couple of important changes. So the environment for Planning continues to be competitive.It's a large and attractive market space right now. As Aneel said in the prepared remarks, we had over 200 stand-alone Planning wins this quarter. We had over 50 platform wins and 30 upsells within the Workday base. So I think the attractiveness of the Adaptive platform in large enterprise customers, that's one of the areas that we're seeing a lot of resonance.From a competitive standpoint, we continue to see HANA Plan. We continue to see Oracle and others from a competitive standpoint. But I would say one of the positive signs has been our traction with large enterprise customers, and those are more than FP&A use cases. That's holistic business planning across the organization where organizations are modeling all parts of their business and using Adaptive as a platform to model and plan all aspects of their business.Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. -- Aneel, I'm curious, when we hear a lot about digital business transformation, I'm curious how you would describe the journey for your customers. Is it like a multipart, multiphase journey? And as that journey progresses and you choose to characterize it that way, how do the parts of the Workday product portfolio align with the journey toward digital business transformation? -- It's a great question. And honestly, it changes every day. At the highest level, used to be 20 years ago, when you talked about HR, you would talk about HR with the HR leader and maybe IT. Today, you always still talk with the HR leader, but you also talk with the CEO, and that is a market change 20 years ago.And every company is trying to figure out or I would say every company that sees the world through the lens of employee engagement and how important is trying to engage their employees get better information on their hands, create great employee experiences. And so part of the transformation is, from an HR perspective, looking at HR as people engagement and employee engagement and, in some cases, partner engagement as opposed to traditional administrative applications the way they were thought of 20 years ago. And that is a big transformation, and it's a big change management project. And I think it's the same for finance.HR and finance together are going from being viewed as back-office operations in the world of client/server to front-office business partners to the CEO today. And finance is very focused on helping the business make the right decisions along the way to grow the business and make the business more profitable. And it's just a different mindset than the way client/server systems were implemented 20 years ago where it was just about automating business processes and making sure you could generate the right statutory reports. It's pretty massive.It's happening in every part of the business, not just HR and finance. And what we ask our customers to do is to really think about how they want to transform their business, not just move to a new platform because if they just move to a new platform, they miss the big opportunity, and the vast majority get that. And that was the reason why they switched.Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. -- Maybe just to start. Actually, I had one for Tom just around Adaptive. Tom, I think Aneel that mentioned having you all there is actually opening the door to talk to more CFOs directly as they think about Planning and connected planning as sort of a strategic imperative. When you look at your customer base, how many of those customers have actually made a decision from a cloud financials perspective? Meaning, how much uplift -- obviously, there's a lot of uplift of you being pulled into the Workday customer base.But actually, how many of those Adaptive customers have yet to actually make a financial planning decision? -- Yes. I think it's early days, but we're seeing a lot of interest. I can think of three specific customers that started with Adaptive, and that was the early part of the conversation, so that quickly led to financials decisions. Obviously, the planning decision cycle, it tends to be shorter than a financials decision cycle.And so that's what we'd expect. But I can let Chano comment on this as well. But I think we're seeing a lot of interest from financial organizations in Workday that the conversation is often starting with Financials, but we expect it's leading to discussions around Financials as well. -- And maybe, I don't know if Aneel or Chano wants to take this. But when we think about the shift to more Financials first, is there any commonality from a -- are you seeing it start in one particular vertical or one particular region, meaning it's the U.S. in front of the international market? I'd sort of expect that to be the case. But I was just kind of curious if you could address it from maybe a vertical perspective and sort of a geographic perspective if you're seeing anything that stands out in particular on that front. -- Chano, your thoughts on that? -- Yes, I can. Kirk, well, as you know, we'd mentioned before always that there are verticals where we see that is more a platform mode clearly and clearly would mention verticals like healthcare verticals, like education and some others, that it is more platform. I would say that outside of those, it is more where is the compelling event and the reason for change in terms of order of priority, right? So the change is that there is much more confidence as Aneel was mentioning, now better understanding on the benefits of moving toward the cloud and transforming. So if that company is seeing that they're burning platform or their opportunity for growth and their need for visibility or agility or the way that they're engaging with their customers or geographies or business areas, I think, having more impact starting with Financials, then they do start there.I wouldn't like to really finger-point to a particular vertical to be more prominent than other, other than the ones I mentioned. I think that's more the reason where they can capture more opportunity or really they have fall a little bit more behind the investments that are required to compete and to have the visibility they need on today's business landscape.Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. -- So I'll try to ask about pipeline both for HCM and Fins, if you could compare it to this time last year in terms of size and mix. And then maybe just for Robynne, what are you seeing on renewals at this point with respect to pricing uplift and expansion? -- Chano, I think that first question is for you. -- Thank you, Aneel. Alex, thanks for the question. We have strong or solid pipeline that we can create to start it at the beginning of the year and clearly to the end of first month of our first quarter. So it's going to be a question more of the execution, which is I think a good place to be.In terms of the percentage of pipeline, clearly, Fins needs to keep it growing faster as a total of the mix. Obviously, as the mix is still higher, that is not a massive movement in terms of percentage of points, but it is a significant movement. So clearly, the Financials one is growing faster as a percentage of the mix, as you would be expecting. So that's good. -- And Alex, on your renewals question, so we continue to see very, very strong renewals. With net retention rates over 100%, growth over 95%, we continually hit those marks quarter after quarter and did so again this time. We've got really strong add-on history as well and had great add-ons in Q4. And I think that the dedicated customer base sales team that Chano put in place at the beginning of last year has really, really paid off, and we're seeing very strong add-on sales.Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. -- I guess for Aneel or Chano, you guys are clearly putting up strong growth in Prism Analytics, but I think penetration rates are still fairly low. So do you think we could see much greater adoption in the installed base this year? And what would be the key reasons for that? -- We'd hope so. It's a great product that's still relatively young, and so it continues to gain capabilities. And I think the big part is bringing out very specific use cases like People Analytics, so we would expect that the Prism Analytics momentum continues. And I would hope -- well, I'm not going to give a time frame, but I would hope that over half of our customers will be using Prism over the next several years, and we're not anywhere near that level of penetration yet.I don't even think we're at 10% penetration yet. So there's a tremendous opportunity. And a big part of it is Prism is metadataware of Workday HR and finance. And if your analytics are HR finance based, it's a phenomenal platform to bring other operational data into to do deep analysis.And that's what our customers are experiencing, and I think that trend's only going to continue. I think one of the things the team did a really nice job with is making the ability to bring in third-party data much simpler than what systems have been like in the past, and then the visualization is much better than what systems have been like in the past. And so we continue to invest in those areas, but it's a very exciting product, and I expect it to continue to gain adoption rapidly. -- And just a couple of quick ones for you, Robynne. Anything unusual with invoicing timing this quarter? And then in terms of the 30% growth in backlog, was there any impact from a duration standpoint there? -- Yes. Nothing to call out on the invoicing front. I mean, we will still continue to see some fluctuation based on that, but nothing I would call out in Q4. And on the subscription revenue growth, we did see a slight uptick in duration, which is not unusual when we have a lot of large deals as we did this quarter.So that was a small piece of it.Next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord. -- Two quick tactical questions. So one, since you're keeping Adaptive independent -- I think the answer is yes, but anyway, can an Adaptive rep cross-sell an HR deal and vice versa? And then the second question is, you've done a good job bringing down the implementation costs, and I know that's not easy. Is there still material room for improvement? -- On the second piece, there's always room for improvement, but we've taken it down in the medium enterprise from $3 spent on integration to $1 software to closer to one is to one. And so that is pretty much best in class. And I think that's why our win rates in the medium enterprise have gone up so significantly. As it relates to the first question, we definitely believe in the stand-alone business of Adaptive.And so the Adaptive team will continue to sell the Business Planning Cloud into Workday accounts and non-Workday accounts. But at this point, we're not leveraging the Adaptive team to sell the Workday products. They'll obviously send over the leads, but we're not doing that. There is definitely an opportunity down the road.Right now, we just want to be very focused on continuing the momentum that the Adaptive Planning team have built around the Planning products, Adaptive Insights built around the Planning products. Tom, anything you want to add to that? -- No. That's right. I mean, we've set the incentives in place, as Aneel said, to make sure that the Adaptive team is incentived to work very closely with the Workday team. And so far, we're really pleased with what we've seen so far.We will take our final question from Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. -- One question, just on the topic and the message about seeing the new pattern in the core financials platform demand in the large enterprise market. Is it possible to stack-rank the drivers of what's causing that between, say, market maturation, the enterprise SaaS versus, say, competitor challenges or, say, something specific with your go-to-market strategy? -- I personally think it's just the maturation of the market. And so if customers believe that they're equally OK to go down the path of starting with HR or starting to finance, they'll focus on whatever platform is burning at a higher level. And if they view the finance platform, legacy platform, being the one that's on fire, they're going to replace that one first. So I think the biggest driver is the companies now view finance as becoming more mainstream for the cloud and therefore are prioritizing which of their platforms is the one that needs to be replaced the soonest.I wouldn't really tie it to competitors or to a different sales strategy. Our sales strategy has been pretty much the same, and I think it's been the right one the last several years. I think it's the maturity of both the view of financials in the cloud and our products.This concludes the Workday Q4 Call.

Bulls are trying to limit the damage, while the whole stock universe seems to be debating whether a potential trade deal between the U.S. and China will fuel the market to new all-time highs or become a sell-the-news event. In that respect, let's start with the  first on our must-see stock charts list.The  (NYSEARCA:  ) looked like it was ready to rip over $280 and keep its rally going. Instead, the ETF (and subsequently the market as a whole) topped out and fell abruptly in midday trading.While it has recovered some of its intraday losses, this bearish engulfing candle - where today's price action takes out the high and closes below the low - is surely getting investors' attention. Whether it develops into something more remains to be seen.Still in its trending range and above the 21-day moving average, bulls feeling mostly okay about the action - for now. Below these two marks and concerns will increase. It will almost surely mark a test of the 200-day at that point. Back over $280 and $285+ is possible.Thanks to some restructuring news over the past few days,  (NYSE:  ) stock has been under pressure. This gives bulls at least one more opportunity to get long this dividend stud, a consistency we  .However, we liked the name closer to the $29 level and with the action over the past few days, we're getting there. Shares are clinging to the 50-day moving average now, but below that and $29 to $29.50 should come soon. However, those who want to buy now can justify their decision to lock in that yield.Realize though that AT&T stock is an income play and that the charts look far from pretty. The stock is below most of its major moving averages and is trapped in a tough downtrend (blue line). (NYSE:  ) will  and its ~4% fall in Monday's session helps bulls, oddly enough. Coming into the report red-hot is tough to digest, even on good results. If we get a positive reaction, look to see that CRM can get above and close over its prior highs near $165.On a pullback, I would love to see the stock hold up near $147 to $149. Even if it breaks this mark initially, it would be bullish to get a close over this area, that being the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and the 50-day moving average. Below and we open up the possibility of testing the 200-day and the 50% retracement near $143 and $140, respectively.Unlike some its cloud-based peers,  (NASDAQ:  ) is not feeling the post-earnings love. Down about 6% on the day, the fall adds salt to the wound after Friday's fall.So far, the 50-day is holding as support, giving the bulls a level to shoot against. However, a washout down to $170 wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. It gets WDAY down to a key level, which is also conveniently right near the 38.2% retracement mark.Further, a drop below the 50-day will wash out a lot of short-term bulls who have been long this name since its Q4 lows, and thus, flush out some stop-loss orders. See how it trades over the next few sessions and whether the 50-day holds. If not, $170 is key.The  (NYSE:  ) is falling more than 11% and hitting new 52-week lows after a  and coming up short on revenue, the latter of which contracted almost 7% year-over-year. I don't know what's worse, the chart or the quarter.In either case, it doesn't have me itching to pull the buy trigger. PLCE blew right through the $85 to $86 level, and a drop into the upper $70s is certainly possible. I'm not sure when buyers will step in, but I'm not one of them. Not without a level to measure against and while PLCE is in no man's land.Watch for an eventual retest of this $85 level. If it acts as resistance, bears have a level to short against.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he earnings focus lately has been on the Retail sector and this week's reporting docket keeps the spotlight firmly on the space. Wal-Mart's strong earnings reports reconfirms that consumers are in good shape, but you wouldn't reach that conclusion if you just looked at the stock market performance of the major department stores.The department store stocks enjoyed plenty of sunshine in 2018, but the mood shifted in a major way in November. While the rest of the market, including several other Retail sector industries, rebounded strongly after Christmas, the department store stocks never got a break.The chart below shows the one-year stock market performance of the Zacks Department Store industry relative to the S&P 500 index.The group's earlier momentum in 2018 wasn't a reflection on improving underlying fundamentals, but rather a combination of over-sold conditions and easier comparisons. The fundamental back drop for the group - characterized by imbalance between falling foot traffic, excess capacity and secular shift towards digital sales - still remains challenging.Earnings estimates for department store operators have been steadily down, as you can see in the chart below (green line represents forward 12-month EPS estimate for the group).Given the group's recent stock market performance, coupled with the steadily lowered earnings estimates, it will likely not take much for Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and others to regain some affection from the market.We have more than 650 companies coming out with quarterly reports this week, including 39 S&P 500 members. The Retail and Utilities sectors are the only ones that have a sizable number o  s still to come and this week brings in plenty of reports from these sectors.We have a number of restaurant operators reporting results this week, including Shake Shack (SHAK), Potbelly (PBPB), Red Robin Gourmet (RRGB), Cracker Barrel (CBRL) and others. Importantly, the traditional department stores and home improvement operators are reporting results this week. : Potbelly and Shake Shack are reporting after the market's close on Monday. The government shutdown likely had a material impact on both of these operators as they have material DC footprint. In addition to the shutdown effect, trends in labor inflation, unit growth and outlook for the current period will be the key issues for both of these operators. : Macy's and Home Depot (HD) are notable earnings releases in the morning session, while Planet Fitness (PLNT) and Weight Watchers (WTW) will be the interesting plays after the market's close.Macy's and the broader department store space has been struggling lately all over again, with the stock totally sitting out the post-Christmas market rally. Macy's shares are down -18.8% this year, lagging the Zacks Department Store industry's -7.3% decline and +10.6% gain for the S&P 500 index since the start of the year. Given the steady negative revisions to estimates, it wouldn't take much for the company come out with a positive surprise. The stock has been down big after each of the last two quarterly releases.Weight Watchers shares have been struggling lately, with the stock down -22% this year and almost -60% in the past year. But with analysts still cutting their estimates, the worst may not be over for the company. : We have Best Buy (BBY), TJX Cos. (TJX) and Lowe's (LOW) reporting before the market's open while Bookings Holdings (BKNG) and Square (SQ) are the notable reports after the market's close on Wednesday.Best Buy shares have done better than the market this year, with the stock up +14.2% this year, but it has lagged the market over the past year. Estimates have been stable ahead of this release, with the electronics retailer expected to earn $2.57 per share on $14.7 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year change of +6.2% and -4.2%, respectively.Lowe's shares have done better than rival Home Depot this year as well as the past year, with the stock up +14.9% this year vs. +11.9% for Home Depot. Few surprises are expected from Lowe's in this release as management had provided full-year outlook at the time of the analyst meeting back in December. But overall sentiment on Lowe's as well as Home Depot appears have improved lately, following a very difficult second half of 2018 when macro worries about housing, mortgage rates and the economy weighed on the group.Square shares still remain below the September 2018 high, but they have made impressive gains lately, up +35.1% this year and +69% over the past year. The company has been very successful in providing ancillary services to its customers, with continued growth in transaction-based revenues key to how the market receives this earnings release, more than actual revenue and EPS numbers. Modestly weaker growth on this count was the major reason for the market's relative disappointment with the last quarterly release. But with the stock this up, it will be hard to satisfy expectations. : Gap (GPS) and Nordstrom will be the notable reports coming out after the market's close on Thursday. As has been the case with Macy's, Nordstrom and Gap shares have been under pressure as well, though both of these retailers have done better than Macy's this year.VMWare (VMW), Work day (WDAY), and 3D Systems (DDD) are some of the other notable reports coming out after the close on Thursday. ( as of Feb 22nd, 2019 )We now have Q4 results from 445 S&P 500 members or 89% of the index's total membership. With another 39 index members on the docket to report results this week, we will have seen Q4 results from almost 97% of all companies.Total earnings for these index members that have reported already are up +12.7% from the same period last year on +7.2% higher revenues, with 67.4% beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates.The table below shows the current scorecard.As we have been pointing since the start of this earnings season, the picture that emerged from the Q4 earnings season is not great, but it is not as bad either.Here are the key trends that we have seen this earnings season , growth is decelerating. This isn't a surprise, as we knew already that Q4 growth would be materially below the pace set in the first three quarters of the year.The comparison chart below puts this Q4 growth deceleration in a historical context for these index members.The growth pace is on track to decelerate even further in the current and coming quarters, as we will show a little later. , companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus EPS estimates.The revenue beats percentage is on the weak side relative to historical periods as well, but the lag on the EPS beats percentage side is particularly noteworthy. The fact is that the Q4 EPS beats percentage is the lowest in more than 5 years.The comparison chart below puts the Q4 blended beats percentage in a historical context.With Q4 positive surprises this hard to come by, one would reasonably assume that perhaps estimates had been too high. We know that wasn't the case as estimates for the quarter had fallen the most of any other recent periods. , estimates for 2019 Q1 and full-year 2019 are coming down in a major way, with the Q1 growth rate now in negative territory and Q2 barely positive.The chart below shows how estimates for 2019 Q1 have evolved since late-November 2018.Negative revisions to 2019 Q1 estimates are along the same lines that we saw ahead of the start of the Q4 earnings season as well. Estimates for full-year 2019 have been coming down as well, as the chart below shows.This chart is tracking consensus earnings growth expectations since the second half of 2018 got underway. As you can see, estimates were effectively unchanged during the September quarter, but they have been on a consistent downtrend since early October. Many in the market suspect that estimates have further to drop before stabilizing.For Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 445 index members that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +13.5% from the same period last year on +6.8% higher revenues, which would follow the +25.7% earnings growth on +8.4% higher revenues in 2018 Q3.The table below shows the summary picture for Q4, contrasted with what was achieved in the preceding earnings season.The chart below shows Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 4 quarters.As you can see in the chart below, the growth pace is expected to decelerate materially from what we saw in the first three quarters of the year.The chart below shows the same data on a rolling 4-quarter basis.Whether we look at the growth picture on a quarterly basis or on a rolling quarter basis, there is no doubt that growth peak is now behind us. The question now is how much estimates for the coming quarters have still to come down. And the answer to that question will depend on the evolving economic backdrop that we discussed at the start.For more details about the overall earnings picture, the Q4 earnings season and expectations for the coming periods, please check our weekly  report.

Creating products that help usher in entirely new categories is rare. The most innovative companies combine both qualities to disrupt incumbents and unleash massive wealth for early investors.Is  (NASDAQ: WDAY) , which helped bring the cloud revolution to large-scale enterprise resource planning (ERP) and human resources (HR) software, that sort of multibagger in the making?  : Revenue rose 36% in fiscal 2017 and 2018, and it's up another 30.8% over the trailing 12 months, according to S&P  Intelligence.Continued improvements in the underlying platform have contributed to those gains. For example, in August 2007, Workday unveiled the beta release of its financial management platform. Today, the company is signing big names every quarter and reports over 60% growth in annual contract value (ACV) for its financial management suite of products. Recent wins include FOX,  , and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.Ambitious, effective innovation will be required to make continued gains in a tough category, so it's worth understanding how effective Workday's R&D efforts have been to date, and whether investors have reason to expect even better results in the future. Let's go under the hood and apply my four-question test.Innovation isn't just about bright ideas. Image source: Getty Images.I created an \"innovation test\" as a way to understand the quality of engineering efforts when making a complex product with rule-breaking potential. Here are the four core categories and the questions I put in each: Does the company have internally developed products? What are they, and when were they released? Is overall revenue growing faster than R&D investment over the period when these products were released? By how much? Is gross margin expanding? Can you point to evidence of new products being developed? How soon will they be released?Version 1.0 of the test was serviceable enough, featuring just yes or no answers. However, a closer look at some other companies revealed a flaw: What if some attributes are more valuable than others? CEO Tom Gardner put that question to me and now version 2.0 of the innovation test includes a sliding-scale scoring system -- here's how it works:\n  \nIn tweaking this test, I'm placing a bit more emphasis on organic growth and penalizing \"one-hit wonders\" that have a great product, but nothing in the pipeline.Workday headquarters in Pleasanton, Calif. Image source: Workday.Now, on to the quiz. Here's how Workday rates as an innovator:Does Workday have internally developed products? What are they? When were they released? Workday has made nine acquisitions since 2014, so clearly, a portion of its growth is inorganic. Yet the company is also 14 years old this month and generates $2.6 billion in annual sales. You can't simply acquire that much growth over that long a period of time. Taking back the ERP market that Workday co-founders Dave Duffield and Aneel Bhusri lost when  has been a long road, and they're still working at it.Is revenue growing faster than investment in R&D over the period when these products were released? By how much? R&D spend is up 519% since the end of the 2014 fiscal year while revenue is up 458% over the same period. That's not necessarily a bad thing in that it means Workday is still putting considerable resources into serving its customers in hopes of writing long, multiyear contracts. R&D spend will start to come down as that happens more and more.Is gross margin expanding? After spending most of the past five years with gross margins in the 60s, Workday reached over 70% in fiscal 2018 and has remained above that plateau over the trailing 12 months, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Can you point to evidence of new products being developed? How soon will they be released? In October, Workday unveiled machine-learning methods for tracking job skills to help customers do a better job of identifying and plugging gaps. A month later, the company announced plans to give more customers around the globe the option of running their Workday environment in AWS. In each case, the company has shown both a desire and an ability to give customers what they want in a package that best fits their needs.With three out of the maximum five points, Workday is a committed innovator with potential to improve. Meaningful gains in turning R&D into productive outcomes for customers seem likely, which would increase the odds of the stock beating the market by a wide margin in the years to come.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Workday wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he market expects Workday (WDAY) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when i  s results for the quarter ended January 2019. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of human resources software is expected to pos  of $0.32 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.3%.Revenues are expected to be $776.84 million, up 33.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.52% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Workday, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.80%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Workday will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Workday would pos  of $0.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.31, delivering a surprise of +106.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Workday doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The figure also improved 29.2% year over year.Strong growth can primarily be attributed to a surge of 33.8% in revenues, which totaled $743.2 million. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $723 million.The robust top-line performance was driven by solid growth in subscription and professional revenues.For the fourth quarter, management anticipates revenues to come in the range of $775 million to $777 million. Specifically, for fourth-quarter fiscal 2019, Workday expects subscription revenues in the range of $663-$665 million (up 35% to 36%). Professional services revenues are projected at $112 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $776.8 million, indicating year-over-year growth of approximately 33.4%.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 32 cents, indicating growth of 14.3% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Workday is leaving no stone unturned to enhance customer experience by adding extended capabilities and tools in Workday HCM and Workday Financial Management with an aim to bolster adoption.The incremental adoption of the offerings is expected to favor top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. We believe improving customer satisfaction rate is another positive.In fact, the company ended the last reported quarter with more than 8,500 customers. During the third quarter, the company added Bank of Montreal, Glencore International, and Piedmont Airlines, a subsidiary of American Airlines as its new HCM customers. The clientele includes more Fortune 500 customers driven by higher adoption of Workday Financial Management.Additionally, the growing clout of Workday Cloud Platform, Workday Prism Analytics and Workday Marketplace bode well.Recently, Genpact  inked partnership deal with the company as a Workday Advisory Services Partner. Per the terms of the alliance, Genpact will assist customers to deploy Workday Financial Management and the existing customers of the offering will be able to leverage Genpact Cora AI-based solution.Partnerships with Duo Security and SkipFlag are also anticipated to aid Workday in expanding business in the to-be-reported quarter.The company is also projected to benefit from the synergies of Adaptive Insights acquisition. The purchase is likely to aid Workday to evolve as a provider of enterprise-level software solutions for financial management and human resource domains.In the recent past, the company also acquired Stories.bi and Rallyteam with an aim to enhance and expand machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics capabilities to drive customer satisfaction.Workday's fourth-quarter results are expected to benefit from the aforementioned factors. However, intensifying competition from peers and higher marketing expenditure are major headwinds at least in the near term.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

Softness of revenues was primarily due to lower uptick of the metric from the Legacy TiVo Time Warp IP deals and a strategic decline in sales of hardware and analog products.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings and revenues is pegged at 28 cents and $173.7 million, respectively. The estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter's reported figures, indicate a decline of 12.5% for earnings and 18.9% for revenues.Let's see, how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.TiVo is hurt by the loss of four settlement contracts for the company's Legacy TiVo Time Warp IP, which ended in June 2018. The third quarter of 2018 marked the last period to realize solid revenues from this deal. Therefore, its loss is inducing a massive amount of revenue deficit for the company.Besides, a severe competition from Google TV, Roku and Apple TV is eroding its subscriber base. Further, the company anticipates an additional increase in IP litigation spends on account of investment in the ongoing Comcast  litigation.However, the company estimates new customer licensing and renewals to aid sequential growth in revenues.

Growing revenues from Marketplace and Services categories drove the top line.Further, introduction of new pricing structure and increasing product investments were major positives.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues is pegged at 31 cents per share and $194.9 million, respectively.Coming to the price performance, shares of Etsy have returned 157.9% over a year against the  's decline of 19.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.The company's solid holiday performance and continued focus toward proper execution of its key initiatives - search and discovery, customer liability, marketing, seller tools and services, is likely to continue driving its top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, Etsy's strong efforts toward enhancing product offerings are major positives. Increasing product investments of the company aimed at enhancing shopping experience and personalization and customization of purchases continue to strengthen buyer activities on Etsy marketplace.Additionally, expanding active seller base due to the company's strategy of using better merchandising techniques is a tailwind. Moreover, subscription packages for sellers on Etsy Plus are aiding growth to the seller base.Further, Etsy offers notification feature and tools to the sellers with high shipping charges to help them adjust their shipping prices. This is not only benefiting the customers but also the sellers in bolstering their sales.Consequently, strengthening active buyer and seller base of the company are expected to continue driving its gross merchandise sale (GMS) in the quarter under review.Moreover, Etsy's increasing strategic investments, seller shipping promotions, performance marketing budget and strengthening customer services are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.However, mounting investments and rising marketing spending on TV advertisements are likely to hurt the company's profitability. Further, cloud integration costs do not bode well for margin expansion.Also, intensifying market competition remains a headwind. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential.Qualities of growth stocks include faster growth rates compared to the broader market, as well as higher valuations and higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. When you consider growth versus value, growth stocks are usually the clear winner in strong bull markets but tend to fall flat in nearly all other environments.When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.30%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.31%.While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise.

Or should we say, when the opportunity presented itself, such as with  (NASDAQ:  ), not enough investors took their chance. So are investors out of luck with ADBE stock?I wouldn't say investors are out of luck, but they've likely missed their best buying chance of the recent correction. The one thing we can all hope for is a retrace of some or almost all of this rally from the Christmas Eve lows. The market does one thing really well, and that's cause as much chaos as possible at certain times.Our first reason for buying Adobe stock comes from the charts.Markets barreled lower into Christmas, capitulating on the eve of the holiday. However, investors couldn't decipher if the next week of trading was simply a dead-cat bounce happening amid low volume during the typical Santa Claus rallying period. A few days into January and stocks were still climbing, causing many to wait on the sidelines for the inevitable pullback. Here are we in the beginning of February and many are  waiting.Adobe stock is one that investors wish they bought when they had the chance. Just don't make the same mistake twice if the opportunity presents itself.ADBE stock price is still $20 below its highs. While  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  , so has Adobe. ADBE is now $50 up from its lows. Investors could justify buying ADBE stock another $10 lower, near the conflux of its 100-day and 200-day moving averages. I would love a \"real\" correction back down to $235 or so though before really getting long this name.Adobe stock is great thanks to one thing: subscriptions. Virtually every freelancer and every business in online marketing utilizes Adobe to some capacity. Whether it's to tidy up in Photoshop or make elaborate designs, ADBE carries the load. That's why it has such a good pulse on the e-commerce market as well. Customers have a few options when it comes to subscribing to Adobe, but for simplicity, let's look at the main one. A subscriber can gain access to just about all of Adobe's products by either paying month-to-month at a higher rate or paying at a lower monthly rate but signing up for a 12-month agreement.Once the refund period has passed, Adobe will be able to collect revenue from its users month after month after month. This leads to a more stable business with more predictable cash flows and it's exactly why its stock gets a premium in the market.Because of this subscription base and its leverage of the cloud, Adobe stock has exploded in recent years, as has its business. Revenue has doubled over the last five years while free cash flow () and cash flow from operations continue to coast from the lower left to the upper right. Over the last 12 months, Adobe has generated more than $4 billion in FCF. While Adobe does carry $4.1 billion in long-term debt, its total assets are double its total liabilities.Before Adobe reported Q4 earnings in December, it issued its 2019 outlook in mid-October. Management reiterated that it was on track to hit its fourth-quarter numbers and it's looking for 20% revenue growth in fiscal 2019. When it reported earnings in mid-December -  - Adobe updated its 2019 outlook to include its recent acquisitions.Despite all this, Wall Street didn't care, tossing the cloud juggernaut aside with the rest of the market into the Christmas Eve doldrums. Coal for everyone, they said, no matter how well the company is doing.After a quick retest of the lows, investors who stayed the course are the ones laughing now. Estimates call for full-year revenue of 28% and for earnings to swell 41.5% to $7.78 per share. Adobe isn't just growing, it's accelerating and that's why it's going to make investors even more money this year.Timing an entry has been important, but it can (and should) be done in ADBE stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["orkday (WDAY) closed the most recent trading day at $189.47, moving +0.43% from the previous trading session.

And for good reason. Leaders like  (NYSE:  ) or  (NASDAQ:  ) have been dominant forces in the sector and have shaken-up their respective technology subsectors since the end of the great recession. The problem is, has we continue to focus on the FAANGs, plenty of other tech stocks have gone unnoticed. After all, there's more to the technology sector than just  (NASDAQ:  ).In fact, there's a lot more.Some of the best tech stocks continue to fly under the radar as the focus continues to be on FANG stocks. For investors, looking here could provide some of the best long-term growth potential around. but which firms have the goods to help you forget about the FANGs like  (NASDAQ:  ) and NFLX?Here are five tech stocks worth a look.Advertising today is nothing like an episode of  As various digital platforms have exploded in use, marketers and advertisers have been forced to adapt to the shifting landscape. Helping them adapt to that shift and target the right customer at the right time is  (NYSE:  ).The idea behind TTD is simple enough. Dubbed \"  ,\" Trade Desk will use high-speed computers and various algorithms to automate the process of ad buying in real time. By searching the nearly 20 digital-ad exchanges, TTD allows advertisers to instantly find exactly who they want to target their ad to - whether that's on their computer, smartphone or other devices. Trade Desk's programs are so fast and successful, they are able to place roughly 9 million ads per second through their online auctions.In the end, it creates a much more efficient and cost-effective way for companies to reach consumers.For TTD, this creates plenty of revenues and growth. As Trade Desk has been able to score more customers, the Trade desk saw its revenue jump by 50% year-over-year during the  . The best part of that jump was that two of firm's main growth engines - video and connected TV advertising - are just really getting started. That leaves plenty of room for TTD to continue its pace of huge revenue jumps. Even better, TTD stock is profitable.All in all, the Trade Desk has what it takes to be one of the best tech stocks outside the FANGs.Cloud-computing has really changed the way we function these days. So, naturally, tech stocks leading the way into the cloud are worthy FANG replacements. And  (NASDAQ:  ) maybe one of the best.Human Resources is full of tedious tasks such as changing ACH payroll information, filling out expense reports or signing up for a retirement/401k plan. Often these things get in the way of allowing the HR staff to do meaningful work. WDAY makes a variety of applications for small or large businesses to cover these tasks. The best part is, like many cloud computing firms, a business can add as little or as much as they like. And rather than purchasing the service, they pay a reoccurring fee.For Workday, this has all added up to some great growth.  , WDAY saw a huge 33.8% jump to its total revenues, while subscriptions revenues came in at $624.4 million - a 34.7% year-over-year jump. The best part is that its subscription revenue backlog - that is, sales that are not officially booked, but will be as because companies have signed up for multi-term products - came in at over $5.9 billion.With key high-margined products - such as WDAY's business intelligence offering, Prism Analytics - growing like weeds, the pace of revenues should continue. Moreover, it should allow Workday to finally move into the black when it comes to GAAP accounting standards.All in all, Workday is quickly becoming a go-to name in HR management. For investors, that makes one serious tech stock to have your portfolio.Want to forget the FANGs? A 278% return will help you do it. And that's just what investors in  (NASDAQ:  ) were treated to last year. That return was one of the best among all tech stocks - FANG's included. There's plenty of reasons why TWLO could see more gains ahead.Twilio designs cloud-based communications platforms that allow developers to send automated phone calls, text messages, and other communication functions. For example, when you're doing a bit of online shopping or banking and you see one of those chat boxes that allows you ask questions or find out more about a product or account, Twilio made that happen. The awesome part is that developers can simply take TWLO's APIs and apps, chuck them into their code and instantly get the ability to add these functions. TWLO  when consumers use the functions.And collect fees it does.As of the end of the third quarter, TWLO had roughly 61,000 different customers using their apps. Those customers have channeled revenue growth of 230% since Twilio when public back in 2016. Last quarter alone,  as both organic and new customer growth surged. And there's still plenty of room to grow across a variety of customers.Given the ease of TWLO's products and the continued growth potential, it's easy to see how the tech stock will a giant over the long haul. That's assuming it doesn't get bought out first.As technology has invaded our lives, we create a lot of data. In fact, we make so much of it, a new term \"Big Data\" was invented to describe the billions of gigabytes of info we generate. The problem for businesses is how to comprehend that data and dig into it to gain actual knowledge. Software firm  (NASDAQ:  ) hopes to provide the answers.At its core, Splunk provides a variety of tools and businesses intelligence software to collect, manage and analyze all the data various organizations make. This includes everything from machine learning and application analysis to cybersecurity and business analytics. The win is that SPLK's applications are set-up to use a simple website-style interface. You don't need to be a developer to use or understand the software.This ease of use and ability to comb through all the data has a lot of fans. Some of SPLK's customers include  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and AAA.Naturally, all of this love for Big Data has created some big revenues for the tech stock. Over the last quarter, revenues jumped  . This was now the 27th consecutive quarter of beating estimates. Moreover, the firm's loss per share has narrowed.When it comes to tech stocks, Splunk is the reigning big data king.Not to be confused with the popular video game Fortnite,  (NASDAQ:  ) could be one of the best tech stocks out there. And that's because of what it targets: cybersecurity.With hacks, data breaches and other cyber threats on the rise, protecting a network is of utmost importance. And it's only getting much more important as we move into the cloud, conduct more banking online and live more complicated digital lives. It's FTNT's job to make sure a company's or your data doesn't fall into the hands of hackers. It develops and markets various cybersecurity software as well as devices such as firewalls, anti-virus, intrusion prevention, VPNs and endpoint security products. Basically, all the stuff you'd need to build a secure network.And given the high-profile nature of several recent data breaches, FTNT is supplying a lot of stuff.  , non-GAAP revenue surged 71%, while revenues grew at 21%. More importantly, the pace of growth is accelerating. According to Fortinet's sales breakdown, $250,000-plus deals jumped more than 27%, while the number of $1 million-plus transactions surged 32%. Even better is that average contract lengths have increased more than two years. All of this will continue to bring in more revenues for the cyber-security firm.With digital threats continuing to grow, Fortinet is poised to be one of the biggest winners among tech stocks.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shares of  (NYSE:  ) are being hammered after the company released its fiscal third-quarter earnings results. With its low valuation and SNE stock almost 25% off of 52-week highs, some are wondering if now is an opportune time to scoop up the shares while they're under pressure. Source: At $65 billion, Sony's not a small niche player. In fact, it has a number of businesses, ranging from music, video games, pictures, imaging, semiconductors and more. Still, Sony came up short for the quarter. Sales of 2.4 trillion yen ($21.84 billion) badly missed expectations of 2.67 trillion yen. Not only did revenue miss estimates by about 10%, they also declined 10% year-over-year. Profits also surprised, with the 377 billion yen result missing estimates of 384 billion yen.That said, Sony  to its full-year guidance. The company now expects fiscal year profits of 835 billion yen vs. 705 billion yen offered up in management's October outlook. That's good for an 18% increase.For the year, analysts are looking for Sony to generate about $79.5 billion in sales - leaving the stock to trade at less than 1x revenue. That's not all that surprising, given how much hardware Sony produces. At the same time though, it's quite profitable and as a result, reminds me of a company like  (NASDAQ:  ) or other low-valuation tech companies. Albeit, SNE stock has a higher valuation than Micron, - a 9.64x price-earnings multiple compared to MU's 3.24x - but it certainly is not commanding the type of premium that comes with a stock like  (NYSE:  ) or  (NASDAQ:  ).Full-year estimates call for earnings per share of $5.01, a massive 43% increase from last year's $3.50 a share. Based on 2019 numbers, that leaves SNE stock trading at just 9.2x this year's earnings estimates. That's a pretty low number, given the solid earnings growth. Further, revenue expectations call for 3.2% growth in 2019.However, some of the investor hesitation may come from 2020 forecasts. Fiscal 2020 is just one quarter away from now and estimates aren't calling for robust growth. Currently, sales are forecast to climb just 30 basis points while earnings are actually expected to fall 14.5% to $4.29 per share. Based on 2020, Sony stock actually trades at 10.7x earnings estimates.While both valuations are admittedly quite low, investors don't want to be in a company that's not growing its bottom line. SNE stock is a tough one though. Revenue estimates just came up very short in the quarter, meaning that perhaps full-year 2019 and 2020 revenue estimates are too aggressive. That Sony boosted profit guidance for the year, though, suggests that maybe 2020 estimates are too conservative.This is what we call a very mixed bag and when there's a lack of clarity, stocks tend to decline.Click to EnlargeThat uncertainty is exactly what we have with Sony stock, along with a lack of catalysts. I would say by a sum-of-the-parts valuation that SNE stock is undervalued. It's likely that many people agree with that thinking, but rarely does the market suddenly wake up and decide to put a market multiple on a stock based on a sum-of-the-parts thesis. That's up to investors who want to hold for the long term.For the short term, there are the traders. I don't like seeing Sony stock being squeezed against downtrend support (blue line). It's clear that the $45 to $46 area is support, but how long can it hold up? As the trading wisdom goes, the more times a level is tested, the more likely it is to give way. While we could get a rally from $46 to $49 - good for more than 6% - I need to see SNE stock move through resistance to believe the rebound will stick.If it doesn't, look for resistance to push Sony stock back down to support. Those trading SNE stock right now can use Monday's low at their st0p-loss.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n the latest trading session, Workday (WDAY) closed at $189.29, marking a +1.34% move from the previous day.

He stepped down as eBay's (ticker: EBAY)  as the PayPal Holdings () unit became a separate, publicly traded entity.Removed from the day-to-day hustle of Silicon Valley (he remained chairman of PayPal), he focused on self-discovery before taking the helm of one of tech's best-performing stocks in April 2017. Now CEO of cloud-company ServiceNow (), he's overseeing a meteoric ride comparable with eBay's ascent.\"I did a lot of reflection\" prior to taking the ServiceNow post, Donahoe told  in a one-on-one interview from the company's San Francisco office that overlooks downtown from the 14th floor. During his self-imposed time out, Donahoe shadowed Van Morrison across the U.S. and Europe as a \"glorified groupie,\" and took a life-altering 10-day silent meditation retreat in Marin, Calif.\"We're at a stage in our life where shame on us for not focusing on important things,\" says Donahoe, 58, a self-described extrovert who has grown more introspective with meditation. \"The path to happiness is inner health.\"ServiceNow is on a path to fulfill its investors. ServiceNow stock has tripled since January 2016 to nearly $200, and one analyst predicts it's on the fast track to $10 billion in revenue in several years.ServiceNow is soaring on the \"massive tailwind\" of the cloud, Donahoe says. With Salesforce.com (), Workday (), and other software vendors it is leading a digital revolution across businesses that is \"hiding all the complexity of work,\" Donahoe says.The laid-back Donahoe may have taken a circuitous route along the way, but his  reads like something straight out of CEO central casting: Ivy League- and Stanford University Graduate School of Business grad who cut his teeth at Bain & Co. for 23 years, rising to CEO in 1999. A little over a decade at eBay, most of it as CEO, where he succeeded Meg Whitman and doubled the company's revenue to $18 billion.

Analysts expec  of 63 cents per share on revenue of $718 million, according to a consensus of analysts polled by FactSet. For the year, they anticipate about $2.6 billion in revenue.Of 35 analysts who cover the company, 29 have Buy ratings, five are at Hold, and one stands at Sell. Their mean target price of $212.84 implies 12% upside to ServiceNow's Wednesday closing price of $189.59.Donahoe has \"done a really nice job helping position ServiceNow as an enterprise workflow platform in the eyes of executives and partners, and broadening the message beyond just the IT department,\" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne told  in an email. He has an Outperform rating and target price of $230 for ServiceNow.Materne believes ServiceNow isn't merely in position to reach its publicly stated goal of $4 billion in revenue by the end of 2020, but could soar to more than $10 billion by 2025. The market is clearly for the picking, says Materne, who estimates 30% of ServiceNow's new business is replacing spreadsheets and other manual processes.Donahoe, who has parlayed his C-suite experience at Bain and eBay into 600 to 700 meetings with customers in the last two years, says the message he gets from major corporations is always the same. \"No one said they could afford to skip the digital transformation.\"Some of the country's largest companies- FedEx (), Walmart (WMT), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), to name a few-are relying heavily on ServiceNow to make that change.Companies are mixing and matching complementary products from ServiceNow, Salesforce, Workday, and others to ramp up their shift to the cloud, Andrew Wilson, chief information officer of Accenture (ACN), told  over the phone.\"They are a cloud accelerator,\" says Wilson, who oversees 500,000 users worldwide, a vast majority of which use the cloud.Donahoe says, \"Technology is complicated and frustrating, and it shouldn't be. Let me show you something.\"He interrupts the interview to pop out of his seat, comes from around his desk, and runs a quick demo of a ServiceNow app on his phone that accommodates new employees. The app is sleek and easy to use. These are the types of tasks ServiceNow can handle, he says. An estimated 30% to 40% of the workday is squandered on administrative, redundant, and low-value tasks, according to an internal ServiceNow survey.Donahoe has \"accelerated diversification\" of  from a single-product company for IT services to a true services platform across an enterprise's global operations, Sarah Hindlian, head of software research at Macquarie Securities, tells  in a phone interview. ServiceNow is Hindlian's top pick, with an Outperform rating and a target price of $215, raised from $210 in September.ServiceNow's success isn't surprising to Donahoe's eBay successor, Meg Whitman, who sees the same transformative qualities that propelled the online marketplace.\"John is a tremendous leader who understands the value of culture and the importance of having the right people, in the right jobs, at the right time,\" Whitman tells  in an email. \"He took eBay to new heights after he took the reins and has continued that success at ServiceNow.\" Jon Swartz at The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors interested in Internet - Software stocks are likely familiar with MiX Telematics Limited (MIXT) and Workday (WDAY).

In 2012, the year it went public, it had annual revenue of $134.4 million , a yearly growth rate of 54%.Workday estimates the  $18 billion market, expected to grow to $24 billion by 2022. More important, the company believes that the company's total addressable market is five times the HCM market if you include payroll, financial, analytics, and planning opportunities in a calculation of its growth potential. That could be huge for Workday stock.As for Microsoft, it has Dynamics, a customer relationship management () software business that generates approximately  annually. Buying Workday would make it a more formidable competitor in the CRM field while also giving it access to one of the hottest segments of the software industry. with an annual run rate of $21.2 billion , approximately $800 million ahead of second place  (NASDAQ:  ) and double  (NYSE:  ) in a distant third position.There's no question Microsoft's dominant position in the cloud would provide Workday with the resources it needs to keep growing at 50% or more each year.\"Microsoft has talked about its large ambitions in business apps, but we note that Dynamics has around $2.5 billion run-rate revenue vs. applications product revenue of $20 billion at  (NYSE:  ), $13 billion at  (NYSE:  ), and $11 billion at  (NYSE:  ),\"  said in a recent report. \"Furthermore, by acquiring Workday, Microsoft would add another asset that can heavily leverage the Azure cloud infrastructure.\"Microsoft has $32 billion in free cash flow to make this deal happen.Certainly, there are other cheaper alternatives to WDAY stock such as  (NYSE:  ), a company whose stock I  in May, in large part because of its CEO, David Ossip, who's done a masterful job growing its business.However, Ceridian HCM's annual revenue is one-third Workday's; it wouldn't deliver as much of a boost to Microsoft's top- and bottom line, not to mention its trajectory of growth.Were Microsoft to gobble up Workday, it would become the largest acquisition in the company's storied history.Acquisitions of any size are tough to make work because the synergies and savings projected often don't materialize. In addition, the merging of cultures fails to click, creating a situation where 1 + 1 = 1.5 rather than 3. The larger the acquisition, the more likely these two conditions come into play.In other words, every deal's odds of going south is higher than you might think. Investors felt that way about LinkedIn back in 2016.Here's just one example:\"Let's put aside the fact that this is almost four times as much as the company paid for its dismal Nokia deal,\" wrote VentureBeat contributor Chris O'Brien in June 2016. \"Microsoft bought Yammer in 2012 for $1.2 billion and Skype before that for $8.5 billion. How many enterprise-type communication platforms does one company need?\"Plenty.In December, InvestorPlace's James Brumley discussed  , providing insight into the many ways Microsoft is adding value for its users.\"Office 365 subscribers and LinkedIn users are likely to be well-aware of the fact that the two platforms now work as one,\" Brumley wrote Dec. 17. \"The company's Outlook e-mail software seamlessly connects with LinkedIn's data, giving LinkedIn's users quick and easy access to their Outlook contacts. The connection even allows LinkedIn users to collaborate on Office 365 documents .\"Microsoft's figured out how to integrate apps and platforms into its existing business.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new March 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $167.50 strike price has a current bid of $9.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $167.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $157.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $168.89/share today.Because the $167.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of WDAY stock at the current price level of $168.89/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $170.00.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if WDAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing WDAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $170.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $170.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.98% boost of extra return to the investor, or 44.55% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 51%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 46%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $168.89) to be 40%.

In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Workday has an Earnings ESP of +0.64% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 35 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Workday Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $106.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $190.00. The standard deviation is $19.449.But the whole reason to look at the  WDAY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

Besides, as volatile and unpredictable as the sector can be, technology still is technology - it remains the best growth opportunity that investors will find for the indefinite future.With that as the backdrop, here are a dozen of the best tech stocks to buy for 2019. These companies all should perform better in the new year than they did in 2018. And in a few cases, a solid dividend and strong track record of payout increases bolsters the bullish case.Market value: $70.4 billionDividend yield: 0.5%Nvidia (  , $115.40) has taken investors on a roughly three-year roller coaster ride. After gaining nearly 800% between the beginning of 2016 and the high hit in October 2018, NVDA shares have been cut nearly in half.The meltdown of the cryptocurrency market was a contributing factor, sure. But investors likely also realized the stock had gotten more than a little ahead of the company's profits.That said, the selloff from the early October peak is just as overdone as the preceding runup was. That translates into opportunity.The average investor largely misunderstands Nvidia's product mix, and therefore its revenue mix. As frenzied as crypto-mania was at its pinnacle, it was never a breadwinner for the organization. For example, during the first quarter of 2018 - shortly after  reached record highs - Nvidia sold only $289 million worth of graphics processors to crypto-miners. That was less than a tenth of Nvidia's revenue for the quarter, when sales of GPUs to miners were apt to be their strongest.Most of Nvidia's business comes from video gamers looking to upgrade their experiences; they accounted for more than half of the company's third-quarter top line. Its next-best market is datacenters, which includes artificial intelligence applications; that makes up about one-fourth of Nvidia's business. Those two markets aren't going to fade away like cryptocurrency mining did, and both are much bigger.Market value: $35.1 billionDividend yield: N/AWorkday (  , $159.56) is anything but a household name, though odds are good that at least one person in most U.S. households is impacted by Workday. The software company has developed cloud-based apps for a variety of human resources and financial industry needs.The organization isn't yet profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but it does operate in the black. More important, it's growing its top and non-GAAP bottom lines at an impressive clip. Revenue is on pace to improve more than 30% in the current fiscal year, and Wall Street analysts expect 25% sales growth next year. Per-share operating profits, which rolled in at $1.03 last year, are projected to reach $1.27 this year and rise to $1.61 in the coming fiscal year. That's also a reasonably dependable outcome; you can't say that of all technology companies.The key to Workday's consistency is how its software is sold. Its customers subscribe to its cloud-based platform rather than make a one-time purchase of it. This drives reliable recurring revenue, and Workday's customers love the financially flexible arrangement.The previous quarter's subscription revenue of $324 million was nearly a 35% year-over-year improvement, and the subscription revenue backlog now stands at a whopping $5.9 billion. That's 31% better than where it was at this time a year ago.Market value: $770.6 billionDividend yield: 1.8%Workday is hardly the only outfit getting on the recurring revenue bandwagon. Even prolific names such as Microsoft (  , $100.39) are now hyper-focused on selling cloud-based access to applications such as its Office productivity suite and Azure cloud-management platform.And the iconic company has only scratched the surface of the cloud opportunity ahead.Joel Kulina, Wedbush Securities Senior Vice President of Tech, Media and Telecom, says he's \"bullish into 2019 as Azure's cloud momentum is still in its early days of playing out with the company's massive installed base.\" The analyst also feels that Office 365, the cloud-based version of Office, will experience growth tailwinds for the next 12 to 18 months at least. Kulina adds that Microsoft's \"unparalleled enterprise customer base\" leaves the organization \"very well positioned to the transformational cloud trend set to play out over the coming years\" in what he refers to as a \"cloud arms race.\"His only concern is a faster-than-expected deceleration in Azure's revenue for fiscal 2019. But this tech stock's lethargy seen during the final quarter of calendar 2018 may have been the market's adjustment for that information.Market value: $3.3 billionDividend yield: N/AMost newly public stocks hand out lots of volatility, and Roku (  , $30.16) has been no exception since its September 2017 IPO. While the big swings have been more up than down, they've nonetheless made some shareholders nauseous and frightened other investors away altogether.The dust is starting to settle, however. And while Roku hasn't yet reached its full potential, it appears to be on its way.Roku is the name behind the popular internet-television tuner of the same name. It stood up against titans such as Apple, Google and Amazon, and beat them all to become the market-share leader within the standalone digital TV-tuner market.That's not the key to its future, however, nor its projected swing to a 2020 profit. Roku has figured out there's also money to be made in licensing its name to television manufacturers who want to build the company's technology into TV sets. Roku also has embraced the idea of selling ads on the main screens seen by users as they navigate their device's menu. This so-called \"platform revenue\" increased by 74% year-over-year in the company's most recently reported quarter, which, as impressive as the growth rate was, still fell short of analyst estimates.The relative disappointment was the basis for much of Roku's recent weakness. But the formulation of more reasonable expectations in 2019 should make Roku one of the best tech stocks to buy for 2019.Market value: $68.9 billionDividend yield: 4.4%As incredible is it may sound, shares of Qualcomm (  , $56.81) haven't made any net progress since mid-2012. Between ongoing legal battles with Apple and revenue that's been waning since 2014, shareholders have simply had little to celebrate.But 2019 could be a turnaround year for this telecom technology maker.Wireless service Verizon will roll out its first 5G service in early 2019, and Samsung will make the industry's first smartphones capable of using this ultra-high-speed connectivity, which is up to 20 times as fast as 4G connections in use now. That device's 5G modem will be made by none other than Qualcomm.Qualcomm has more growth opportunities than 5G modems, however. The company's newest microprocessor, the Snapdragon 855, has been designed from the ground up to make the most of the massive amounts of data 5G connections will be able to handle. The Snapdragon 855 will offer up to three times as much artificial intelligence power as anything available now, and is expected to handle augmented reality and other data-intensive applications with ease. This catalyst might just shake QCOM shares out of their multiyear rut.Market value: $15.2 billionDividend yield: N/AThe term \"big data\" didn't really seem to be in existence until 2005, when O'Reilly Media's Roger Mougalas is credited with its first use. Corporations have been looking for ways to gather massive amounts of data for decades, of course, but it has only been a relatively efficient endeavor since the 1990s, when personal computers became a common business that could manage all that information.But even if an organization has lots of data, that doesn't mean that organization can do something constructive with it. Tools that turn data into actionable information has only recently become an industry in and of itself.Cornelio Ash, Equity Analyst with William O'Neil + Co., believes a company called Splunk (  , $102.79) is one of the best picks within the business.\"Splunk is a primary beneficiary of the artificial intelligence tailwind, which is impacting and changing virtually every industry,\" Ash says. \"Over the next two years SPLK's revenue and (earnings per share) is expected to increase at a compound average growth rate of 25% and 53%, respectively.\"The analyst highlights the fact that Splunk is widening its market to serve not just artificial intelligence outfits, but to meet the needs of cybersecurity, Internet of Things and IT operations organizations.Market value: $3.2 billionDividend yield: N/AJust when it looks like computer hacking and cyber-sabotage are under control, another bigger and more damaging data breach surfaces. The problem is never going to go away. Indeed, Gartner estimates that information-security spending will grow 9% in 2019, to $124 billion.Enter FireEye (  , $16.09).FireEye is a relatively young company, founded in 2004 - a time during which cyberthreats were starting to become an inevitable, permanent part of the future. The company didn't go public until 2013, however, and though investors' hopes were high at the time, FireEye wasn't quite the performer early shareholders expected. The cybersecurity outfit spent heavily on acquisitions, leading to increasingly large losses. The stock currently is well below its post-IPO peak.FEYE stock still is trending higher from its early 2017 low, however, as its revenue grows and its losses start to shrink, with profits finally in sight. The company will see its first full-year operating profit with 2018's results, and should be GAAP-profitable sometime around 2021 or 2022.The turning point was the launch of a cloud-based product called Helix, which offers customers subscription-based access to a suite of cybersecurity tools. Morningstar analyst Mark Cash writes, \"As FireEye embraces a subscription-based business model, we expect the product subscription business to grow the fastest, more than offsetting long-term declines in the legacy products and support and maintenance divisions. We believe this shift, coupled with new product launches, will allow for material top-line and margin expansion.\"Market value: $21.6 billionDividend yield: N/AIt only has a fraction of the size and reach of competing social media site Facebook, and is not nearly as exciting as newcomer Snap (  ). But in some regards, being a bit smaller and more off-the-radar than its rivals has quietly let Twitter (  , $28.43) finds its groove and become the growth machine it should have become long ago.Better late than never.Twitter isn't bulletproof, to be clear. One valid criticism is its waning headcount. \"The knock on Twitter is that the daily average user growth has been slowing for the last few quarters,\" says Strategic Wealth Partners president and founder Mark Tepper. He counters, however, by pointing out \"that they're really focused on shutting down fake accounts, so I think a number like that is really important for Facebook where people might only log in once a day, but with Twitter it's more about the user engagement.\"Proof of better user engagement is in the numbers. While the number of active monthly users actually fell by 9 million during Q3, its third-quarter top line was up 29% year-over-year. More of the same is projected for 2019.More important, Twitter has already proven it can turn a profit doing what it's now doing. By providing specific reasons for users to plug into the microblogging platform and giving them specific topics to discuss, the organization has booked a little more than $1 billion worth of net income over the past four quarters.Market value: $11.3 billionDividend yield: N/AAlthough Verizon (  ) will be the first wireless telecom name to commercialize 5G connectivity, and Samsung - with the help of Qualcomm - will be the first manufacturer to mainstream 5G smartphones, those organizations wouldn't be able to do what they're about to do had a relatively small company called Keysight Technologies (  , $60.13) not helped pave the way.Keysight makes and markets technological testing equipment. Specifically, it offers solutions for network security developers, connected car designers, cloud-computing solutions providers and more. Most recently it has been leaned on to provide 5G engineers with testing equipment that ensures all the complexity of 5G connections is properly addressed. In fact, both Qualcomm and Samsung have acknowledged they relied on Keysight Technologies in helping make 5G a reality. The company's 5G toolset was even the first to be approved for 5G device-certification purposes. In other words, its wares will serve as the yardstick used to test other 5G technologies.The advent of 5G has already proven to be a boon for Keysight, though the best may be yet to come. Moderate but reliable sales growth is expected to drive per-share profits of $3.78 for all of 2018, up from 2017's $3.24, then lead to income of $4.25 per share in 2019. That's 12% earnings growth for a stock priced at less than 15 times 2019's projected earnings, and from a company that has gotten in the habit of topping earnings estimates.Market value: $192.3 billionDividend yield: 3.1%In the late 1990s, when the internet was new and changing the way the world worked, Cisco Systems (  , $42.77) was unstoppable. Organizations and even individuals were thrilled with the advantages of networked computers, and Cisco was the go-to name for routers and switches. Few could compete with the king of the networking world.Much has changed in the meantime. Namely, newcomers like Juniper Networks (  ), Arista Networks (  ) and Aruba are supplying real competition, while more established names such as HP (  ) and Dell have quietly tiptoed onto some of Cisco's turf.The pros aren't exactly stoked. Nomura recently downgraded CSCO from a \"Buy\" to \"Neutral,\" suggesting the stock already is overvalued at a time IT spending may well slow down.Cisco has a couple of aces up its sleeve, however, that the pros and amateurs alike are underestimating. One of them is the company's $42.6 billion worth of cash and near-cash assets - versus a market cap of $206 billion - which allows the organization lots of flexibility. What Cisco can't develop to be competitive, it can acquire.The other matter working in Cisco's favor is the relatively recent realization that recurring revenue is the ticket to thriving in the future. Subscription revenue now makes up roughly a third of the company's sales, and a little more than half of its software revenue. That figure is growing, and has plenty more room to grow while Cisco gears up for the coming explosion of 5G.Market value: $103.0 billionDividend yield: N/ASalesforce.com (  , $134.68) won't win any value awards based on backwards-looking or forward-looking results. The stock is priced at nearly 50 times 2019's expected earnings - a hefty cost. But Wedbush Securities' Joel Kulina believes Salesforce.com is \"well-positioned to benefit from the continuing secular shift to the cloud\" and a worldwide \"increased focus on digital transformation.\"Salesforce provides a suite of cloud-based customer relationship management tools. Although the barriers to entry within the market are low, CRM is able to leverage its well-established name, and enjoys a wide lead on those would-be competitors.Its edge lies in its ability to remain at the forefront of new applications of new technologies. For instance, the company has designed a way to use data created by IoT platforms by automating its delivery to employees that may be working in the field rather than at a centralized data hub. And what it can't develop, it can buy. It acquired MuleSoft in March, giving the company the ability to meld older and newer databases that would otherwise be tough to merge.Kulina adds that with a potential market size in excess of more than $200 billion, Salesforce.com as a \"long runway ahead\" that could extend well beyond 2019.Market value: $108.9 billionDividend yield: N/AContrary to what many investors might believe, Adobe (  , $223.13) is so much more than PDFs and Photoshop. The software giant has built an entire suite of business-building applications, and organizations are falling in love with them.It's called Experience Cloud, and it can do just about anything a company needs to do with digital data. From advertising to customer profiling to content management, Adobe's Experience Cloud empowers its users to do things with data, online and offline, that were inconceivable just a few years ago. The company's Creative Cloud gives users online access to tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator and more. Subscribers enjoy that software updates are automatically applied, fuss-free.Arguably the most compelling aspect of these cloud-based platforms is, however, the recurring revenue they generate. As of the end of the third quarter, Adobe was producing annualized subscription-based revenue of $6.83 billion, and the company is looking for steady growth of that figure. For perspective, the company's trailing 12-month revenue totals $9.06 billion.The stock plunged following its recent fourth-quarter earnings miss, for the record. Profit projections of $1.88 per share were better than the $1.83 the company managed to produce. But with revenue of $2.46 billion topping estimates of $2.43 billion and a revenue outlook of $11.1 billion for the coming year thanks to the impending purchase of B2B marketing outfit Marketo, that post-earnings weakness may be a buying opportunity.James Brumley was long CSCO and FEYE as of this writing.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors looking for stocks in the Internet - Software sector might want to consider either MiX Telematics Limited (MIXT) or Workday (WDAY). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.MiX Telematics Limited and Workday are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that MIXT has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.MIXT currently has a forward P/E ratio of 23.86, while WDAY has a forward P/E of 124.94. We also note that MIXT has a PEG ratio of 0.95. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. WDAY currently has a PEG ratio of 4.Another notable valuation metric for MIXT is its P/B ratio of 2.82. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, WDAY has a P/B of 18.76.Based on these metrics and many more, MIXT holds a Value grade of A, while WDAY has a Value grade of F.MIXT has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than WDAY, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MIXT is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.EUSA is managed by Blackrock, and this fund has amassed over $206.46 M, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Blend. Before fees and expenses, EUSA seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Equal Weighted Index.The MSCI USA Equal Weighted Index represents the MSCI USA Index, measures the performance of equity securities in the top 85% by market capitalization of equity securities listed on stock exchanges in the United States.Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.EUSA's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.92%.ETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 15.10% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector; Financials and Industrials round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Cigna Corp (CI) accounts for about 0.24% of the fund's total assets, followed by Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) and Workday Inc Class A (WDAY).EUSA's top 10 holdings account for about 1.97% of its total assets under management.The ETF return is roughly 4.88% and is down about -6.47% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 01/10/2019), respectively. EUSA has traded between $47.02 and $59.92 during this last 52-week period.EUSA has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 12.95% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 624 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.IShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT) tracks S&P Total Market Index and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) tracks CRSP US Total Market Index. IShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF has $15.67 B in assets, Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF has $97.91 B.

Some software stocks remain resilient in the face of mass distribution.Resilience, relative strength, muscle-flexing - call it what you want.

The beauty of the digestion is it allows the 20-day moving average to catch up and for a base to form that may well spell an attractive breakout trade.The key resistance zone to watch is $170. That marks the record high for WDAY, and a break above it should bring all the buyers to the yard.

The late-November announcement breathed new life into the ailing shares lifting CRM back above all major moving averages. While CRM stock remains well off its peak, the behavior post-earnings looks promising.First, the few dips that we've seen have been shallow and short lived. The gap area at $133 has been tested and held twice now. Second, volume patterns have shown zero signs of distribution with multiple accumulation days cropping up. This suggests institutions are in a buying, not selling mood.Once resistance at $145 is finally felled, look for further upside.

A brief review of its history reveals the ultimate driver of the ascent is earnings. Earnings growth, in particular. TWLO stock has scored four consecutive price jumps on its quarterly reports.Compared to the carnage elsewhere, Twilio's clear uptrend stands supreme.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 34 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Workday Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $94.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $185.00. The standard deviation is $19.763.But the whole reason to look at the  WDAY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

A close below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages and investors may want to reassess the setup.

Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2018.And with that, let me hand it over to Aneel. -- Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining our Q3 . I'm pleased to report that in our third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we experienced an acceleration in net new ACV growth. Our human capital management business remained strong and we had a great quarter for our financial management suite of applications.Importantly, the business acceleration we enjoyed took place independent of the impact of the Adaptive Insights acquisition. Starting with HCM, we had another strong quarter as we continue to gain share in the market with an industry-leading True cloud platform, the deepest product capabilities and unparalleled user experience and the highest levels of customer success.In Q3, (Technical Difficulty) some of the new HCM customers we added include Bank of Montreal, Glencore International and Piedmont Airlines, a subsidiary of American Airlines. We continue to land marquee accounts in part (ph) due to our proven ability to support our customer's large volumes of data and transactions, a capability that neither of our legacy competitors has been able to consistently demonstrate in cloud.In Q3, we also saw accelerated growth for the Workday financial management suite of applications. Subscription revenue once again grew over 50% with net new ACV for core financials growing over 60%. We believe that a combination of our expanded set of offerings, the increasing acceptance of the cloud by the (Technical Difficulty) office (ph) of the CFO and our ever increasing cohort of financial customers and production are collectively driving broader adoption of our financial management applications.New (ph) Workday financial management customers in Q3 included Atlanta Braves baseball, Spectrum Health, H&R blogs, Fox and a large US based financial services organization. In addition to the strong growth from our core (Technical Difficulty) finance suite of applications, Q3 was our first quarter with Adaptive Insights as part of Workday. I'm pleased to report we got off to a great start together accelerating the pace of adoption of cloud planning with early success (Technical Difficulty) Adaptive Insights product to large enterprise customers.Indeed, the early feedback on the Adaptive business planning cloud offerings from customers and prospects alike has been very positive with high interest and enthusiasm for the Adaptive offerings. And we are actively working in migrating many of our Workday planning customers to Adaptive. We're committed to unifying Adaptive Insights (Technical Difficulty) Workday (Technical Difficulty) while we will continue to support Adaptive integrations with all ERP systems we are on track for a 12 months to 15 months delivery of the Power of One, which will benefit our customers with access to one source for data, one security model, one user experience and of course, one Workday community that enables us them to plan, execute and analyze on one platform.And lastly, in Q3, we also experienced strong growth in our medium enterprise segment of our business. As many of you know, we announced the Workday launch program last year which introduced fixed fee reconfigured application packages for US based medium enterprises.Our ability to offer a full platform solution across HR payroll and finance with lowered implementation costs have enhanced our already strong competitive position and accelerated our growth in that segment of the market.With the success of Workday launch in the US, we are now planning to take that program overseas in fiscal year '20 to target medium enterprise businesses outside the US. Our momentum and customer success was best captured at our annual user conferences, Workday Rising in US and in Europe. Between our US Conference in Las Vegas last month and our European conference in Vienna 2 weeks ago, we welcomed more than 13,000 attendees including almost 8,500 (ph) customer attendees representing approximately 1,700 organizations.At Workday Rising, we once again revealed our annual customer satisfaction rating which came in at 98%. As you hopefully know by now, customer success, core value (Technical Difficulty) and the Workday team works hard every day to help our customers to run their business more efficiently and make better decisions along the way.On the product front, we continue to push technology in patients with our most recent focus on embedding AI and machine learning -- (Technical Difficulty) fabric of the Workday platform. With Workday Prism Analytics, Data hub, finance and HR systems, (Technical Difficulty) we're leveraging the acquisition of (Technical Difficulty) to offer Workday People Analytics, a new application that will give executives, organization leaders and HR business partners a view into the most critical trends (ph) in their workforce, and an understanding of the most likely drivers of those trends. It will leverage powerful artificial intelligence, machine learning and augmented analytics technologies to provide dynamically credit metrics accompanied by explanatory narratives, what we call stories.Our customers continue to benefit from our continuous innovation cycle. During the quarter, we announced the availability of Workday 31 which among the many new features included skills cloud, a university skills ontology that helps organizations cleanse, understand and relate job skills data.We believe our investment in innovation and our people (ph) continue to pay off. In the quarter, we were ranked number one on Fortune's Future 50 list, which recognizes the world's most forward-looking, innovative companies that are best (Technical Difficulty) future.From day one innovation has been in our (Technical Difficulty) the products built also we (Technical Difficulty) the launch our company, our customers, our industry into future, and employees will always be our number one core value, happy employees, (Technical Difficulty) the best product to make customer happy. On that note I'm also pleased to share that Fortune and Great Place to Work announced this month that Workday is number three on the list of 100 Best workplaces for women.As we look to the future, we have firmly established our leadership in HCM, where we differentiate ourselves through innovation, scalability and consumer (ph) referenceability and expect to continue to gain market share globally. And we are an early leader in cloud financial management, with a strong set of offerings for CFOs who are looking to modernize our financial analysis and planning systems.Both HCM and financial management will continue to be the primary drivers of growth in near-term with a strong foundation for future growth drivers in Workday Prism analytics, Adaptive Insights, business planning cloud and the Workday cloud platform.All in all a great quarter with strong momentum heading into Q4 and the year-end. And now over to you, Robynne. -- Thanks, Aneel and good afternoon everyone. As Aneel discussed, we delivered strong performance in Q3, resulting in accelerated growth across our core business metrics and giving us great momentum heading into year-end. On today's call, I'll touch on the highlights from our third quarter, update our guidance for Q4 and provide a preliminary high level view of FY '20.Given this is our first quarter with Adaptive Insight, we are providing an additional level of transparency during this call to assist in your understanding of how Adaptive Insights impacted our Q3 results, across certain key metrics.Internally however, we are not tracking Adaptive Insights differently from any other products, so you should not expect us to guide or report any (ph) metric separately going forward. Instead, as with all key products, we will give you milestones updates as and when it makes sense to do so.For Q3, we delivered total revenue of $743 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 34%. Our Q3 subscription revenue was under $24 million, up 35% year-over-year. Approximately $4 million of the over performance is attributable to the finalization of the deferred revenue haircut related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition. The remaining upside was driven by very strong performance across our product suite.Revenue outside the US was up 47% to $170 million, representing 23% of total revenue. Subscription revenue backlog was $5.9 billion growth of 31% year-over-year. Approximately, $140 million of this increase or 3 percentage point growth relates to the inclusion of the Adaptive Insights backlog balance.The remaining growth was driven by an acceleration of net new bookings growth, including a few deals that pulled (ph) in (Technical Difficulty) from Q4 and very strong renewals, with net retention once again over 100%.Our 24-month subscription backlog was $4.02 billion, a growth of 31%. Approximately $125 million or 4 points of growth relates to the inclusion of Adaptive Insights. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the third quarter was $49.7 million, an operating margin of 6.7% (ph). The margin upside from our guidance was primarily a result of the strong revenue performance.Third quarter cash flow from operations was $114 million. As we noted in our guidance last quarter, cash flow in the second half of this year is impacted by one-time acquisition-related payments with the majority of the impact occurring in Q3.Total unearned revenue at the end of Q3 grew 28% year-over-year to $1.57 billion. Current unearned revenue was $1.46 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Our biggest investment continues to be in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q3, we successfully added and integrated over 1,000 net new employees, including over 500 from Adaptive Insights bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to over 10,200.We are very pleased with our operational execution in Q3 and feel well positioned going into our historically strongest quarter. Now, let's turn to guidance. The continued strength in our business is allowing us to raise our Q4 and fiscal 2019 outlook as follows. For subscription revenue, we're raising our full-year estimate to be in the range of $2.375 billion to $2.377 billion or a growth of 33%. We expect our Q4 subscription revenue to be $663 million to $665 million or 35% to 36% growth.We expect professional services revenue to be approximately $433 million in fiscal 2019 and $112 million in Q4. We therefore estimate that total revenue for fiscal 2019 will be $2.808 billion to $2.810 billion or a growth of 31% with Q4 total revenue in the range of $775 million to $777 million or a growth of 33%. We are expecting non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 10% for both Q4 and the full year.The GAAP operating margins are expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margins by approximately 27 percentage points in both Q4 and fiscal 2019. Given the strength in the business, we now forecast short term unearned revenue to grow approximately 26% in Q4. We are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance of $550 million for the full year, but believe there may be some upside to that number depending on Q4 linearity and timing of collections.We are also maintaining our capital expenditure guidance for the year of $200 million for our owned real estate projects and another $200 million for all other CapEx.Please note that next year we will no longer be providing color around short term unearned revenue growth rates. We did this in fiscal 2019 as a bridge until our peers transition to the new reporting requirements around remaining performance obligations, what we call subscription revenue backlog. While this new metric is not perfect, we believe it's a better gauge of the health of our business over the long term, primarily because unlike unearned revenue and billings, it's not impacted by varying contractual invoicing (ph) terms.While we are early in our FY 2020 planning cycle, and still have an important Q4 to close, we'd like to provide a preliminary and high level view of FY 2020. We remain confident in our ability to sustain strong long-term revenue growth given the secular market trends toward the cloud adoption and our established leadership position.We are currently planning for FY'20 subscription revenue of approximately $3.0 billion to $3.01 billion. We continue to expect a pronounced and compounding seasonality toward Q4 with our Q1 being the seasonally slowest in terms of net new bookings. We'd expect subscription revenue in Q1 of FY 2020 to grow approximately 4% sequentially from Q4.We continue to prioritize growth over margin expansion and have made and will continue to make significant product and other investments next year and beyond. While FY 2020 still faces some margin headwinds from the Adaptive acquisition, we do expect to return to more normal levels of operating margin expansion. We are currently planning for FY '20 non-GAAP operating margins of 12% which represents an estimated 200 basis point improvement year-over-year.With that, I'll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners and employees for their continued support and hard work, which allowed us to deliver great results in the third quarter and have set us up for a strong finish to the year. Operator, let's now begin the Q&A process.(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Thank you. This is Kevin Ma on for Brad Zelnick. Congrats on the quarter, guys. I just want to ask on pro services that we accelerated pretty substantially this quarter, even taking out what you originally guided for the Adaptive contribution. Can you give any color on how much of that was from incremental synergies and uptake in financials or any other drivers? -- Yes. So what you see in the Proserv (ph) growth is kind of seasonal patterns that are pretty normal for us, that number can ebb-and-flow based on the number of implementations going on at any given time, how many of those were priming, and so really just normal -- normal levels of growth there. -- Got it. Okay, that's it from me. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. -- Mark, you there? -- I'm here. -- Okay. -- Go ahead, Mark. -- Yeah. I was trying to ask you on the platform deals that -- our field work has been showing a real increase there on the deals that include both HR and Financials and it's been not only in the mid-market, but also in the portion of enterprise that kind of gets up toward 10,000 or 20,000 employees. So just curious from what you're seeing, how tangible is that trend toward the platform purchases, if you look at the bookings mix and then when you -- when you take a look at the pipeline for next year, do you see that accelerating in terms of the platform consideration? -- Well, there's no question that for medium enterprise buyers, really for the last several years that the platform solution is a really popular solution. They need to move HR and finance to the cloud. They prefer not to have two different systems and rather have one unified system.And now, what we're seeing is that trend began to move up market, probably more driven by financials moving up market. And so I would expect that to continue and become a bigger part of our business. Chano, anything to add? -- No, I think that's correct. Hi, Mark. From a pipeline perspective, the financials management continues to grow as a percentage of the mix, although given of course the sustained solid growth in HCM, the mix shift is moving slowly. -- Okay. And Chano, if I may, just a quick follow-up, I think at Rising, you commented that the pipeline was particularly strong for Q4. So I think it's a little surprising to see the kind of the blowout results in Q3. Is the confidence in Q4 equally high or were the deals that pulled in to Q3 material enough to kind of change that Q4 set up at all? -- Thank you, Mark. I think we commented, we're pulling some business forward from our Q4 quarter, but we have similar levels of pipeline coverage as of last year. So I think it's going to be a question of execution, we're still early in the quarter, but we're positive about the outlook. -- Thank you very much.Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Hi, this is Sanjit Singh for Keith. Congrats on a really strong quarter. I had two questions. First, on the international, on the 47% growth there, it seems like that's getting a lot of momentum. Aneel, you mentioned about the opportunity to further penetrate the mid market, but any sort of color you can provide on what's driving the strength in the international side of the house, whether it's new ACV (ph) wins or further extension of the base. Any details there would be appreciated. -- I'd turn that question over to Chano. -- Thanks for the question. We are happy with the momentum in the international business, the foundation that we have created and, via strong customer referenceability and we had a hugely successful Rising Europe, in Vienna. Our footprint across Europe and Asia is really still expanding and is early days as those markets are behind the US in terms of cloud's adoption, which is clearly a great opportunity over time.I believe there are a couple of emerging geographies where we still have work ahead of us in terms of establishing consistency, but we are very focused on improving the great opportunity ahead of us in International. -- I appreciate the comments Aneel. And then maybe as my follow up, Aneel, you mentioned that net new ACV growth of 60% plus in financial management, that's sort of ahead of revenue growth and can (inaudible) I know we've been hesitant to call it out before, but it feels like a bit of an inflection and I was wondering how you are sort of interpreting the strong financial management performance this quarter, does this feel like a different type of environment for financial management versus some of the previous times where we have seen a bit of an uptick and then maybe a little bit of a leveling off, any sort of comments there? -- Well, I'm going to be careful to not draw any conclusions from one quarter. We have been growing the business at over a 50% clip on the subscription revenue side now for quite some time. The medium enterprise business continues to be very strong for financials, I think sometimes people discount how good that opportunity is for us, not just in the US, but across the globe and we are continuing to see the move among large enterprises. I won't say that all Fortune 500 accounts are showing up at once, but the rate of Fortune 500 accounts showing up to evaluate financials for the cloud is definitely picking up.So ask again after every quarter and we can start looking at patterns, but I don't want to draw any conclusions just out of one quarter, but very pleased. I do think that one of the things that the CFOs are paying attention to, by nature are fairly risk averse crowd. We're now over 500 customers who are using Workday Financials and I think 70% of them are live and in production.And so now there is a cohort of very happy customers using the system to close their books and run their business, so CFOs can ask their peers about Workday and financials in the cloud and, you know, a few years ago that was a much smaller universe of companies you could talk to. -- Thank you very much.Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Your line is open. -- Thanks guys. Can you hear me? -- Yes, we can. -- Okay, great. I guess just -- Hi, I just wanted to follow up on the financials commentary, I guess, and if you look competitively, Aneel or Chano what -- how do you feel about sort of your win rates in that -- in that market versus what you see on the HR side of things and I'm curious, I know it's pretty early with Adaptive, but what the conversations -- if those conversations have changed at all now that the business is inside of Workday, and how that changes the dynamic, particularly in the enterprise, if it's changed at all yet? -- So on the first one, our win rates are relatively similar for HR and finance and that's been the case for quite some time. In the finance market there are -- the only overlap and really main competitors in finance is Oracle. SAP doesn't have their products in the cloud. Ultimate is just an HR competitor and we see NetSuite less and less.So it's -- it is a slightly different competitive landscape, but our win rates are pretty similar. You know, in terms of Adaptive, there is a high degree of interest among the Workday enterprise customers and Adaptive Insights, not just the ones who had already signed up for planning, but ones that our HR customers maybe not quite ready to switch out core financials, but looking at planning as a first step to moving financials into the cloud, so Tom and I couldn't be more thrilled as to how the Adaptive products are being received by the historical Workday customer base.Tom, you want to add anything to that? -- Yeah, I think that's right, Aneel, I think both the receptivity on the part of the Workday customers who bought planning and the conversations we've had with them in terms of moving to the Adaptive platform, but I think from an Adaptive perspective, what we've seen is a lot of interest in the Workday large enterprise customer base and we have had a number of conversations that is certainly, in many cases in the early stages, but they've been extremely constructive and we're very optimistic about the potential to grow that business as we move forward. -- Okay, great. Super helpful. And then just as a follow-up either for Aneel or Chano, I know that you've been sort of throttling the selling effort on Prism this year, when you look out to next year, I'm just curious sort of what your expectations are there and then Student is one that, I don't know if you've talked about in some time, but it seems like that's getting closer to a market that's starting to inflect and curious, sort of those two products, Prism and Student, how you think about them for next year? Thanks. -- So I would say on Prism we're less and less throttling our willingness to sell. It's much more about making sure that the used cases fit where we are with the products, but the product line is one of the fastest growing product lines from a net new ACV perspective we've ever seen, can I say what numbers, Robynne? I mean it's -- -- Triple digits. -- Triple digit year-over-year growth, and as we begin to mature the capabilities and grow the used cases, we honestly expect that to continue, and as we've done some analysis, we've had one of our longtime strategy folks, Derrick (ph) bought to do some real analysis on many of our new initiatives, and one of the surprises was the upside we see on the Prism business as we turn an offering into a product line and people analytics is one of those first steps into turning it into a product line. There is a clear path to building a $1 billion business there on Prism that might not have been as obvious to us a little while ago.In terms of Student systems, we are very focused on getting the first four or five large universities into production, and after that, we can think more about scaling the business, but that's where we are right now, very focused on building out the capabilities and getting those large universities live in the coming quarters. -- Super helpful. Thanks guys.Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a really strong quarter. Just two from me. So, maybe first, Aneel on financials. Can you talk about the activity around selling into the HR base versus net new logos, and then as you think about the pipeline for both 4Q and next year, how do you think about it in terms of, or how does it compare in terms of the mid-market financials versus the enterprise financial business and then I have a quick follow-up on Adaptive? -- So basically additional HR into HR. -- While financials into the HR customer base, right? -- And I think -- and additional HR into HR. -- Yeah. Hi Alex, this is Chano speaking. Regarding financials into our customer base, we are very happy with the progress there, we clearly have the mapping within our key verticals, and I would say that we have great engagement with the majority of the customers.Clearly, you know, how are those going to be falling on particular quarters is yet to be seen, but the progress is on a positive track. In terms of our HR add-on business or additional extensions of the product set into the customer base. If I understood your question correctly, I would say that since the set up of the go-to market customers based in this year, we have seen a good acceleration of business there, especially as last year (ph) our customer base is more significant, and that is growing and particularly taking advantage of being a happy customer base. -- Got it, thanks. And then maybe just on the pipeline, just finishing up on that, the second part of that question, in terms of financials on mid-market versus enterprise? -- I would say both are -- both are similarly, basically similar percentage or similar mix as we've been having before, so there is good activity in both levels, clearly, since our launch of our go-to-market into medium enterprise launch activities, the mid enterprise has been -- you know, taken significant traction in terms of the offering, and you know, not only their subscription, but basically the implementation fixed fee services and we are taking time to value there are really shortening and really good customer base, basically referenceability.So that is tracking very well. We continue to do well in terms of the large enterprise momentum activity both in the US and internationally. -- Perfect. And then, Robynne, just a quick follow-up on Adaptive, if I may. Is it possible to get the -- just the contribution to subscription revenue -- revenue and deferred revenue or unearned revenue in the quarter from Adaptive? -- Well, so if you'll recall last quarter, we did talk about what we thought the contributions from Adaptive would be in terms of subscription revenue and we were $4 million ahead of that number this quarter, because of the finalization of the deferred revenue haircut, which came in lower than we had originally anticipated. We mentioned also at that time last quarter that we expected Adaptive to contribute $22 million in Q4, that number would now be $25 million, with the change in the haircut value, but we're actually not going to be updating those numbers now or going forward, because as you can imagine, given the cross selling of the products across both companies, the lines have really already blurred in terms of what's purely Adaptive and what's organic Workday. So we don't think that makes sense to breakout anymore.In terms of unearned, we also gave color last quarter that we expected 25% short-term unearned growth for Q3 and Q4, 3 percentage points of that were attributable to Adaptive, including their balances into our balance sheet and so all of the upside from that both the 29% we delivered this quarter and the 26% we're guiding for next quarter is strength across our product suite that we're expecting. -- Understood. Okay, thank you so much. Congrats again.Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Thanks so much. Congrats from me as well on super strong numbers, Aneel, I'm just curious, your HCM momentum remains very strong and you made commentary, I think back at -- the management team made commentary at Rising about how much was still left in the Fortune 500, Global 2000 and I just wondered from your perspective, the -- how do you think about the durability of that HCM business in terms of sustaining, what you would like to see as a target rate of growth? -- Yeah, I think it's -- it continues to be a very healthy business. We're not quite yet at 200 of the Fortune 500, we're at 50% of the Fortune 50, I think we can do -- I think we can do a lot better without being negative on our competition, the reality is, they don't have proof points of large companies in production and we're beginning to -- where we continue to see the network effect of large companies, we're happy with Workday referencing to other large companies who haven't made a choice yet in the cloud.So I think there's still a lot of opportunity for us, especially as we get outside North America where, you know, depending on the geography they are 3 years to 5 years behind in cloud adoption and they're looking across the globe to see what their peers have done, and multinational, things like the multinational independent of where they're based and they want to have successful deployments and as they look at the multinationals in the other geographies and they see a lot of successful Workday deployments, it's impacting their decision.So, there is still a lot of opportunity in front of us. And I'd add the other piece, what we saw in Q3 with the success of medium enterprise, really accelerating growth as well with the Workday launch program reducing the cost of implementation, most of the world outside of the top -- the largest 10 countries, most of the world is a medium enterprise world, even in markets like Germany, the bulk of the economy is driven by a group called the Mittelstand (ph), the basically -- the bulk of the economy are medium enterprise companies and now that we've got a better cost story there on the implementation side, I think it opens up that opportunity as well. -- That's great. And then just a follow-up, Robynne, just you mentioned a few things that impacted the strength in the quarter, net new bookings, acceleration, some deal pull forward and then renewals, just on renewals were you're saying renewals that pulled forward or just renewals were at very healthy levels, maybe were larger, what was the implication you were trying to drive on renewals? Thank you. -- Yes, just renewals that came up within the quarter were very strong and we continue to meet or exceed our target of 100% net renewal and 95% gross renewal. So we are very pleased with our renewal performance in Q3. -- That's great, thanks so much and congrats again.Your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks. Yes, so we sent our guys out in the field to talk to some of the vendors and stuff and we were asking them about like digital transformation and stuff, though what was interesting was, they couldn't really -- they got different definition of it, right, so, and then the other question that we had -- we asked was when they did have troubles with that, they had the biggest hang up was when HR and finance were not like working as a team.So Aneel, you've been around long enough to see this before as a whatever-- reengineering problem, where are we in that process in the market in terms of educating people on this? I mean it's more than cloud, but where do you draw the line and where do you pull in your systems integrators and how do you see that evolving? Thanks. -- Well, I think in particular, it's a great question, Richard, in particular in companies that are not manufacturing companies, but people based industries HR and finance need to work absolutely hand in hand, because the biggest asset and the biggest expense for these companies are their people.So we definitely see that as a big advantage for us and we see companies beginning to leverage what they did in HR and say, hey, we've already got the work structures in place, we've got the security model in place, why not, why not look at Workday first for financials and we would have all the unified reporting and analytics we'd like, and then you throw in Adaptive planning and we've got our effectively our business operating system are working together.So I think it's beginning to play that way and for companies that haven't chosen to do HR until now, they are definitely looking at HR and finance together where 5 years ago people were just not doing that, they were just looking at HR.So I do think it's -- I do think that the digital digitization and reengineering as both product lines become market ready or have been market ready happening together as a real positive trend. -- Great, that's super helpful. Thanks man.Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hi, thank you very much. Congratulations on a fantastic quarter. I guess I'll ask the macro question since I assume it's not been asked. So Aneel, I think last year, or maybe two years back, you were rightly prophetic in the caution that you saw going into your Q4 results and it ended up that the business environment was largely more supportive than we all feared and we had a nice two-year run. Now we're back again at those kinds of crossroads with a similar list of topics that are not pertinent necessarily to Workday, but to investors that keep wondering if this good stretch of results can really sustain the momentum going into calendar '19. So since you have the purview of talking to decision makers, CFOs, CEOs that really and your product touches practically millions and millions of end users.What is your feel for what's on the minds of CEOs and CFOs as they prioritize Workday in their budgets for calendar '19. What are the things that you're hearing from your customers, specifically? -- You know, I generally hear that business is good and the uncertainty in the global political environment gives them pause and I just don't know how much of -- of what gives them pause is just rhetoric, some companies are worried about the aspects of a potential trade war. And so will that factor in the way they're thinking, well right now, it seems like bluster back and forth.So I would say if you just separate out the business cycles, it still seems like we're in a good part of the global growth economy cycle, I mean it seems like most economies are doing well, I think Europe is doing surprisingly well, based on what people expected it to be doing, but there is this hangover of uncertainty coming from the political environment, that's not just limited to the US, but somewhat happening everywhere, and I don't think any of us really know what, how to factor that in or predict it.So I would say, stay tuned, and right now we're just -- we're just trying to -- trying to ignore it, and the world -- the new normal in the world is political volatility and hopefully it doesn't have a huge amount of impact on our business. -- Congrats on the results, I'll ear (ph) to the next question. Thank you very much.Your next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham. Your line is open. -- Hi, everyone thanks for taking my question. I guess I just have one at the moment and I don't know if Aneel or Chano wants to take it, but can you tell us about some of the lessons you've learned with Adaptive in the portfolio today, with regards to how it can help you sell financials going forward? I know we all know it's going to help that platform generically over the next 2 years to 3 years as customers become more comfortable with the entire ecosystem, but is there maybe a direct tie that you can tie it from one to the other? -- Well, I'd say the number one takeaway so far is our companies have very, very, we had hoped that they had very similar value systems and cultures and they do and, if you were to look at the history of acquisitions in the technology field, in particular, I think that's the biggest determinant of success and failure.So from that part, the two companies are working extremely well. I think largely, the thesis that planning was going to open the doors for Workday have played out, and the other thing that we knew going in is that Adaptive planning was far ahead of Workday planning has turned out to be true, which is why we've put all of our eggs in the Adaptive planning basket and why we're moving capabilities like sales planning and workforce planning to Adaptive. It's all played out and what we were hoping to see was interest in large enterprises in the Adaptive product who had been historically Workday customers, and all those things have happened.So Tom and I were talking about it earlier today, it's really played out the way we had hoped to play out, and that's not always the case with the two companies coming together. So I feel very fortunate. You want to add anything, Tom? -- Just that there's -- we continue to have momentum, we added approximately 200 new customers, this quarter and we agree that there is a great opportunity to sell financials behind that, most of those are customer additions are stand-alone customers, but we've also seen a lot of residents, a lot of interest, as I said earlier in existing Workday customers and there are the opportunity to sell Adaptive to those customers. -- Thanks for taking my question.Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe actually for Tom, just a follow-up on that line of thinking around the 200 customers you have -- you know, it seems to us talking to a lot of the partners in the field that you're right now planning is something that CFOs are very engaged in talking about, do you, is there any way that you can sort of give -- I don't know a estimate or sort of your thoughts on, you know, after someone buys in the planning or connected planning vision, how long after that do you think they're ready to make another decision around financials because it seems like an incredible way for you guys to have just that much more dialog with CFOs and you know and ultimately -- so that when ultimately they decide to move their generalize (ph) the cloud, you're involved in that account, so I don't know, I'm just trying to get a sense on it. Is there a 6 quarter to 8 quarter lag before they're ready to make another decision in financials or can it come faster based on some of your experience or your conversations? -- Yeah, I think we do see the thesis that companies are willing to move to a cloud-based planning system earlier than perhaps they are financials. We do see that playing out. So we're very encouraged by the conversations we've had with customers and prospects around moving their planning to the cloud. I think the decisions around when they're ready to move their financials to the cloud are really dependent company to company.And while I agree that there are opportunities particularly when we have satisfied customers and we do an effective job of engaging with those customers, we believe that will result in follow-up on opportunities and financials, but Chano, I would say that the timing is probably a little bit more customer situational. -- I agree, Tom. Kirk, I think most important thing is the feedback we're getting from our prospects and customers so far regarding the capabilities and scalability of Adaptive planning cloud is super positive. That's a thing it's kind of really, really relevant.If you think that -- you know, it's early days, but we had a quarter where we were in double digits, some planning customers over 10,000 employees, clearly some of those are not yet financial customers, but we expect that some of those are going to see time to value on planning on 4-months to 6-months timeframe cycles of implementations, then I think we'll be in a great position to go back and have some -- a discussion about our point of view on why it makes sense to extent, and there is a good business volume benefits in taking on to the full financial platform, but it's early days, so we will be -- I guess we'll be learning, but we are very excited how that's looking. -- And maybe just one follow-up actually on financials which seems to be building some momentum, I guess when you look at the acceleration in that, is there any one particular vertical that seems to be sort of taking off in front of some of the others, I know you guys have nine that you focus on. You know, are you seeing a lift kind of across all nine or few kind of pulling ahead based on either your just more customer references in those? I'm just kind of curious if you have the entire sort of strategies moving ahead or there's a couple that are going to be sort of lead dogs in this movement longer term? Thanks. -- Well, financial services has definitely began to pick up. There's no question about that. Business services was already an interesting segment as was the tech segment, but financial services has been slow to move to the cloud, and not just for finance, but for HR, and I'd say that's the area that's picking up very nicely, and that's a huge market for financials. -- The other one I would say Aneel, beyond (ph) our core verticals on healthcare related (inaudible) has been clearly PSA professional services automation around more business services, that seems to be performing really well given now the strength of our solution portfolio there. -- Super. Thanks so much.We will take our final question from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is open. -- This is Samad Samana on for John, just a couple of questions. First, you mentioned the acceleration in net new ACV, I was wondering if you could maybe give us some additional color on whether it accelerated, when you look at it broken out for mid-market and enterprise and maybe by geo and then did it accelerate both for HCM and financials and then I have a follow-up question. -- All of the above. -- Okay. That's great. -- (multiple speakers) accelerated across the board. -- Okay, great, thanks for that. And then just one follow-up, I think at Rising Europe in the Q&A, I think Aneel, you mentioned that the company had 100 customers for Prism already and about half of those are in production. I'm curious if you've started to see any type of patterns emerging in terms of what type of customers adopting, are they more platform oriented on Workday already? Are they mostly HCM only, anything by vertical or by size, just something to maybe help us understand who the adopters of that is, it looks like it's up considerably year-over-year? -- Why don't we come back to you on that with some more thoughtful answer? Right now, it's -- I'd characterize it more as early innovators in a new product category, they're all HR customers, but there's quite a few finance customers as well, and what we're seeing is the opportunity to bring in third-party operational data to do analysis.So healthcare has been an interesting -- an interesting space for us that bring in patient data or procedure data to do the analysis with HR and finance data as well. So let us come back to you with some more thoughtful response. I don't think it's a big enough sample set yet to draw any big conclusions. The big conclusion I draw is that it's across industry and across product line so far.So it's -- that's what we like it to be, we are not seeing any areas where it's not interesting. -- Great. Well, I appreciate you taking my questions and congrats on an awesome quarter. -- Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Meet Group is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Workday has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that MEET has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.MEET currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.41, while WDAY has a forward P/E of 127.14. We also note that MEET has a PEG ratio of 0.57. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. WDAY currently has a PEG ratio of 4.76.Another notable valuation metric for MEET is its P/B ratio of 1.50. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, WDAY has a P/B of 16.57.These metrics, and several others, help MEET earn a Value grade of B, while WDAY has been given a Value grade of F.MEET has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than WDAY, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MEET is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 29, 2018, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of human resources software is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -37.5%.Revenues are expected to be $723.09 million, up 30.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Workday, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Workday will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Workday would post earnings of $0.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.31, delivering a surprise of +19.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Workday doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The transaction, expected to close in the second half of 2019, has been approved by the boards of directors of both IBM and Red Hat but is yet to get approval of Red Hat shareholders as well as U.S. regulators (read:  ).If approved, this would be the third-largest tech deal after Dell Technologies buyout of EMC for $67 billion in 2016 and the $41 billion acquisition of SDL by JDS Uniphase in 2000, excluding the AOL-Time Warner merger.The deal will be a big leap for IBM and is a game-changer in the fast-growing and lucrative cloud market. Per IBM Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, \"IBM will become the world's #1 hybrid cloud provider, offering companies the only open cloud solution that will unlock the full value of the cloud for their businesses.\" IBM said it remains \"committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings\" and will target a leverage profile consistent with \"a mid to high single-A\" grade.Additionally, the acquisition will reinforce IBM's high-value model.

This process greatly streamlines and simplifies the payroll process, which traditionally requires accounting software or the help of a dedicated accountant.Image source: Getty Images.Square's announcement immediately caused shares of traditional payroll companies like  and  to drop. However, Square's real target is probably  (NASDAQ: WDAY) , which offers enterprise cloud services that help companies staff, pay, and organize their workforces.To understand why Square is chasing Workday, we should realize that both companies offer \"one-stop shops\" for businesses. Square initially disrupted the traditional POS (point-of-sale) system market by converting iPhones and iPads into checkout registers. It then launched the Square Register, a stand-alone POS system that was significantly cheaper than traditional systems.Image source: Getty Images.Square then introduced and cross-sold more services to those customers -- including tools for managing business analytics, payrolls, inventories, and customer relationships, as well as delivery and logistics services, website design tools, and even financing options. Simply put, Square wants to become a one-stop shop for digitizing small- to medium-sized business.Meanwhile, Workday disrupted the traditional human resources (HR) market with its cloud-based tools for keeping track of a company's staff and payrolls. It also offers machine learning and analytics tools, which it recently expanded by acquiring Adaptive Insights' business planning and financial modeling tools.All these tools help companies make data-driven decisions about HR changes and business strategies. Workday mainly serves large enterprises  ,  , and  .Square's moves into the payroll market look similar to Workday's core HCM (Human Capital Management) platform, since both companies let employers and employees track their payments on a mobile app.Square bundles more services together for businesses, which might make it a more appealing choice for younger businesses. Workday, however, mainly provides tools for a company's HR and financial departments. Square's platform also has a higher rating than Workday HCM on software and services review site G2Crowd. Square has a 4.6 rating, compared to Workday HCM's 4.0 rating.But those reviews mostly came from different markets -- 86% of Square's reviews were from small businesses with fewer than 50 employees, while 80% of Workday's reviews were from large enterprises with over 1,000 employees. Yet there's still a slight overlap between the two companies in medium-sized businesses. Ten percent of Square's reviews and 16% of Workday's reviews came from medium-sized businesses with 50 to 1,000 employees. Workday also offers a dedicated platform for medium-sized businesses.Square also heavily targets restaurants with  , which lets restaurants manage bookings, process payments, and handle deliveries (via Caviar) on a single platform. Bundling payroll services with that platform could challenge Workday's presence in the hospitality industry -- which includes HCM contracts with restaurant chains like  , Panera Bread, and  .Square's expansion in the mobile payroll market might not directly impact Workday's growth, but it comes at a time when expectations are at  for Workday's stock -- which trades at nearly 100 times forward earnings following its 40% rally this year.Square's new mobile payroll app represents just another slice of its growing pie of subscription and services revenue, which rose  127% annually last quarter and accounted for 16% of its GAAP revenues.The unit's main pillars of growth include Instant Deposits, the Caviar food delivery service, the Square Capital lending service, the Cash App, and the Cash Card -- a physical debit card that's linked to the app. Square also  that it could expand that fintech ecosystem with savings and brokerage services.Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell believes that Square could  in subscription and services revenue in 2019, which would account for nearly half of its projected revenue for the year.Square and Workday probably won't ever become direct competitors.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 848 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new January 2021 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $23.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $140.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $116.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $141.51/share today.Because the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

The decline was surprising since Workday's numbers easily topped analyst estimates. Workday's revenue rose 28% year over year to $671.7 million, beating consensus analyst expectations by nearly $9 million.The company's core subscription service revenue grew 30% to $565.7 million, while services revenue climbed 17% to $106.1 million. For the third quarter, Workday expects its subscription revenue to rise 49% against the 2017 quarter, compared to analyst forecasts for 43% growth. However, that figure will be slightly inflated by Workday's recent acquisition of Adaptive Insights, a transaction which was completed on Aug 1st.Image source: Getty Images.On the bottom line, Workday's non-  net income grew 32% to $72.4 million, or $0.31 per share, which cleared estimates by five cents. On a GAAP basis, its net loss widened from $82.5 million to $86.2 million, but remained flat on a per share basis at $0.40 due to a higher number of outstanding shares.Workday's growth looks solid, but the stock was probably due for a breather after rallying more than 50% this year. Should investors buy Workday after its post-earnings dip, or wait for the stock to cool off some more?Workday offers enterprise cloud applications that help companies staff, pay, and organize their workforces. Its portfolio of machine learning and analytics tools, which includes Adaptive Insights' business planning and financial modeling tools, assists companies in making data-driven business decisions.Simply put, Workday offers \"all-in-one\" solutions for companies that want to digitize their HR and financial departments. Its growing list of customers includes heavyweights  ,  , and  .Workday is still a high-growth cloud services company, but its subscription and sales growth have gradually decelerated over the past year.\n  \nData Source: Workday. Columns represent year-over-year revenue growth.Workday's $1.6 billion takeover of Adaptive Insights (shortly after the company filed for an IPO) was clearly aimed at boosting its own sales growth. But the projected overall impact isn't that impressive -- Workday expects Adaptive Insights to boost total annual revenue by $51 million this year ($42 million in subscriptions and $9 million in services), which would account for just 2% of Workday's projected sales.For the full year, Workday expects its subscription revenue to rise 31% year-over-year, compared to the 39% growth rate it achieved in fiscal 2018. The company sees services revenue growing 19%, compared to 25% growth last year. This means that Workday anticipates just 29% total sales growth for the year, compared to 36% growth last year.Workday is profitable on a non-GAAP basis but unprofitable on a GAAP basis, mainly due to stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses, which are excluded from the former but included in the latter. Like many younger tech companies, Workday relies heavily on stock bonuses to retain employees and reduce its use of cash.Image source: Getty Images.Workday's SBC expenses rose 21% against the prior year quarter and gobbled up 22% of total revenue, compared to 23% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. That decision is odd, since Workday could easily pay out more cash -- its cash and equivalents rose from $1.13 billion at the beginning of the year to $1.69 billion at the end of the quarter.But if we look beyond Workday's SBC issues, its non-GAAP operating margins still look solid. The company finished 2018 with a non-GAAP operating margin of 10.1%, and it originally expected that figure to hit 12% this year. Management now expects that figure to drop to 9%, but only due to the costs related to Adaptive Insights.There's no clear path for Workday to achieve GAAP profitability yet, but investors should recall that many larger cloud service companies face similar issues.  ,  , only started generating consistent GAAP profits in 2015 -- 11 years after it went public.Workday is still a solid growth stock, but its valuations are frothy. It trades at nearly 130 times this year's non-GAAP earnings and 95 times next year's earnings. Those are nosebleed multiples in the context of its projected non-GAAP earnings growth of 21% this year and 32% next year.For comparison, Salesforce trades at just over 60 times this year's earnings and 56 times next year's earnings. Workday also trades at about 12 times this year's projected sales, while Salesforce trades at 9 times current-year projected sales.Therefore, it clearly appears that Workday's post-earnings dip was caused by overheated valuations and profit-taking instead of fundamental problems with its business. Investors should be cautious about buying this dip, since the valuations indicate that the stock is still pricey relative to its growth potential.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

This included an impressive price target for Netflix  and more craziness from Tesla  and its CEO Elon Musk. But in a week short on earnings, three companies stood out.The week of September 3 saw Nike  grab headlines for its use of the controversial Colin Kaepernick in its new ad campaign. Meanwhile, Facebook  and Twitter  both saw their stock prices sink after executives from the two social media companies spoke in front of members of Congress about what they are doing to prevent the spread of misinformation-among other things.There were also some significant earnings releases despite the fact that second-quarter earnings season is almost over. According to our  , which helps investors plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases, just 46 companies reported their quarterly financial results this week.So let's take a quick look at three of the companies that posted impressive results.AeroVironment designs, makes, and sells unmanned aircraft systems, which are better known by the more common term drone. Shares of the unmanned aircraft maker had surged about 75% in the past year before it reported its quarterly earnings results on Wednesday.AeroVironment reported fiscal Q1 2019 revenues of $78 million, which came in above our Zacks Consensus Estimate of $75.6 million. This strong top-line performance also marked a 127% surge from the $34.4 million the firm reported in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, AVAV's adjusted quarterly earnings skyrocketed to $0.59 per share, which crushed our $0.06 estimate-investors should note that this non-GAAP figures excludes 26 cents attributed to litigation settlement gains.The Monrovia, California-based company saw its stock price climb over 10% after-hours following its earing release. Shares of AVAV hit a brand new all-time high of $103.98 per share on Friday. Looking ahead, AeroVironment expects full-year earnings in the range of $1.10 to $1.40 per share, with revenue coming in between $290 million and $310 million.Workday saw its shares climb roughly 22% over the last month before it reported its second-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings results on Tuesday. WDAY's impressive performance in the lead up was likely why its stock price slipped following its Q2 release.The firm, which provides enterprise cloud solutions for human resources and finance, posted non-GAAP earnings of $0.31 per share. This topped our quarterly estimate that called for adjusted earnings of $0.26 and marked a 29% climb from the year-ago period.Workday's quarterly revenues also surged roughly 28% to $671.7 million, which topped our $663 million estimate. More specifically, the company's subscription revenues-84% of total revenues- soared 30%. Looking ahead, our current estimate is calling for Workday's fiscal year sales to surge by 27.4%, while its adjusted earnings are projected to climb by 20.4% to $1.24 per share.Shares of Broadcom, which had been one of the worst-performing stocks among major chip companies in 2018, surged over 8% Friday after the company released its quarterly financial results Thursday. Broadcom saw its adjusted earnings jump 21.5% to reach $4.98 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15 cents.The semiconductor company posted quarterly revenues of $5.06 billion. This marked a strong 13% jump from the $4.46 billion Broadcom reported in the year-ago quarter and came in line with our estimate. Looking ahead, the company's full-year earnings are projected to jump 25%, while revenues are expected to climb nearly 18% to hit $20.79 billion. Broadcom's outlook appears strong, but it will remain to be seen how soon investors can change their minds about the company's CA Technologies acquisition.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Chevron, U.S. Bancorp and Kraft Heinz. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have risen +6.3% in the past year, underperforming the Zacks Integrated Oil industry's +10.9% increase, while shares of larger rival Exxon Mobil have gained a meager +2.9% over the same time period. Shares of Chevron are up nearly 100% off its August 2015 lows and poised for further capital appreciation, riding on its healthy earnings growth prospects.The Zacks analyst thinks the 'oilier' nature of the company's volume mix positions it to benefit from strengthening  in its upstream business with fewer encumbrances from its smaller downstream unit. Chevron's existing oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry, targeting volume growth of 4-7% in 2018.Chevron also improved its cash from operations, allowing management to raise the dividend and announce a $3 billion per year share buyback program recently.

The worst losses came for the tech-heavy  , which was down largely on worries about social media companies and the potential for government regulation of their operations. Elsewhere, though, a few indexes actually managed to post gains, with investors overcoming anxiety on trade and instead focusing on favorable business fundamentals. Some troubling news affecting certain high-profile individual stocks weighed on the overall market.  (NYSE: RH) ,  (NASDAQ: WDAY) , and  (NYSE: HAL) were among the worst performers on the day. Here's why they did so poorly.Shares of RH dropped 13% after the high-end home furnishings retailer reported its second-quarter financial results. Despite extremely strong bottom-line growth that was substantially better than most investors had expected, revenue gains of just 4% fell short of what Wall Street had hoped to see. CEO Gary Friedman was unconcerned with the sales slump, arguing that  involves being willing to give up low-quality revenue in exchange for maximizing margin and profit. That strategy has worked well for other companies, but at least for today, RH shareholders weren't ready to accept it as an explanation for the shortfall in sales.Image source: RH.Workday stock fell 9% in the wake of the company's release of its second-quarter financial report. Revenue jumped 28% on a better-than-30% gain in subscription-based revenue for the HR and finance enterprise cloud computing specialist. However, adjusted net loss widened from year-earlier levels, and even though  following the acquisition of business planning specialist Adaptive Insights, shareholders seemed disappointed that the pickup in anticipated sales wasn't even greater. Those who've watched Workday in the past know that the company has a reputation for lowballing its guidance, however, and so some see today's slump as a great opportunity to consider Workday stock at a bargain price.Finally, shares of Halliburton finished lower by 6%. The oil services giant said that slowing growth in activity levels in the Permian Basin region of West Texas could contribute to a shortfall in earnings for the current quarter. In addition, Halliburton pointed to sluggishness in starting new contracts in the Middle East. All told, the company sees an $0.08- to $0.10-per-share hit to earnings for the quarter, blaming high labor costs, a lack of transportation infrastructure, and overall inflation levels. Unless higher  bring more demand for its services, Halliburton worries that the current environment could lead to another  in the near future.

Note that these revised full-year ranges include a total of $51 million in revenue from Adaptive Insights for the remainder of the year -- $42 million from subscription revenue and $9 million from professional services -- as well as a modest headwind to overall subscription revenue growth given today's currency exchange rates. In addition, Workday notes that it continues to expect organic short-term unearned revenue growth in the low-20% range for the third and fourth quarters.All things considered, Workday effectively extended its habit of under-promising and over-delivering, and its latest acquisitions should serve to solidify its industry leadership.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 58.3%.It is likely to report lower year-over-year revenues in the to-be-reported quarter owing to soft demand pattern.Finisar expects first-quarter fiscal 2019 revenues in the range of $305-$325 million, non-GAAP gross margin between 26% and 27%, non-GAAP operating margin within 4-5% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 10-16 cents.

In addition, for the uplift of building and additional equipment, Finisar expects capital expenditures of approximately $100 million in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from  , which accounts for the lion's share of total revenues, is currently pegged at $250 million, down from $258 million reported a year ago. Revenues from  are expected to be $69 million compared with $83 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Consequently, for the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $316 million, down from $342 million reported in the year-earlier quarter.

So far, the bulls have not allowed trade rhetoric to force them to relinquish control of this market. But there are several other topics to keep an eye on. Speaking of labor, the Labor Department will issue its monthly jobs report this coming week.Economists are targeting non-farm payrolls to rise to 187,000 jobs (up from last month\u2019s 157,000). While that number would keep the unemployment rate steady at 3.9%, will it be enough? The result will no doubt have a profound impact on equities, which many analysts believe are trading way overpriced. Among them is Amazon (), which \u2014 now trading north to $2,000 per share (up 72% year to date \u2014 is an eyelash away from the $1T market cap. Its cap is $981.68B, to be exact.The e-commerce giant, which is still rising since its Q2 earnings report, would join Apple () as the only publicly-traded companies to achieve the $1T status. This week, investors will also focus on the earnings calendar not only to gauge the continued strength of corporate profits, but also for continued signs that earnings multiples and equity valuations are justified. Here are four stocks to keep an eye on.Wall Street expects the company to earn 26 cents per share on revenue of $663.09 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came came to 24 cents per share on revenue of $525.32 million.What to Watch: The maker of human resources software has grown to become a top player not only in Cloud applications for financial management, but also areas such as human capital management, payroll and analytics. Despite what has become a highly competitive market, led by Salesforce (), Workday continues to find ways to grow, producing revenue of $619 million Q2, up by 29% year over year and surpassing Wall Street forecasts by $9.8 million. Notably, subscription revenue surged 31%. But with the stock trading at all-time highs, expectations also reflects this performance.Wall Street expects the company to earn 1 cent per share on revenue of $159.6 million. This will be the company\u2019s first earnings report since its IPO earlier this year.What to Watch: One of the most successful IPOs of the year, DocuSign provides individuals and businesses the ability to digitize an agreement process. DocuSign competes HelloSign and Adobe () Sign, among others. Despite the crowded market, the company\u2019s client base \u2014 which includes the likes of T-Mobile (), Salesforce, Morgan Stanley () and Bank of America () \u2014 has grown to more than 370,000 users and more than 300 of the Fortune 500 companies. With such a strong portfolio of customers, DocuSign on Thursday must now outline its path towards profitability.Wall Street expects the company to earn $4.82 per share on revenue of $5.07 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came came to $4.10 per share on revenue of $4.47 billion.What to Watch: Broadcom shares have taken a beating over the past three months, falling more than 14%, while both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have notched all-time highs. The decline was driven by the company\u2019s announcement to buy CA Inc. () for $19 billion. To the extent the management on Thursday can sell investors on the benefits of the deal, while outlining improving business conditions, the stock could rebound strongly. Combined with a strong top- and bottom-line beat, Broadcom\u2019s decline could be a thing of the past, especially with Apple\u2019s () new iPhone\u2019s \u2014 to which it provides wireless components \u2014 due to be released.Wall Street expects the company to earn $1.17 per share on revenue of $633.05 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 92 cents per share on revenue of $509.1 million.What to Watch: New product launches for both network and cloud-based applications continue to strengthened Palo Alto\u2019s revenue which impressively by 31% in the second quarter. And despite intense competition from the likes of Check Point (), Cisco () and Fortinet () in the firewall security market, the fact that Palo Alto\u2019s revenue and profits continue are accelerating each quarter underscores the strength of its best-of-class status.

The company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 195.5%. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 600%.Guidewire reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 5 cents per share, comparing favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 1 cent per share. However, it was significantly lower than the year-ago figure of 16 cents per share.The company delivered revenues of $140.5 million, which increased 14% from the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $137 million and was above the guided range. The increase can primarily be attributed to growth in Services revenues and Maintenance revenues.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to be in the range of $234-$240 million. The Zacks Consensus estimate is pegged at $239.3 million.Non-GAAP net income per share is anticipated to be between 72 cents and 77 cents. The Zacks Consensus estimate is pegged at 76 cents.Guidewire raised fiscal 2018 guidance. The company now expects total revenues to be in the range of $647-$653 million (previously $644-$650 million band), representing an increase of 26- 27% year over year. The Zacks Consensus estimate is pegged at $651.7 million.Non-GAAP net income is now projected to be between $1.05 cents and $1.11 per share (previously 98 cents and $1.04 cents per share). The Zacks Consensus estimate is pegged at $1.09 per share.Guidewire's elaborate partnership programs and strategic collaborations are major growth drivers. Its Partner Connect Program has been implemented worldwide, benefiting its customers in the property and casualty insurance industry.The company's acquisition strategies are also a major contributor to growth. The buyout of ISCS (now called InsuranceNow), FirstBest (now called Guidewire Underwriting Management) and EagleEye Analytics (now known as Guidewire Predictive Analytics) are not only aiding revenue growth but also helping the company to expand clientele.Additionally, management is optimistic about the completion of the Cyence buyout. Notably, Cyence is a company that determines the economic impact of a cybercrime via a software platform, which is built on cyber-security related data science. The integration of Cyence would enable Guidewire to provide an entire life cycle to the insurance products starting from designing to transaction management.Notably, the company is transforming to a subscription based model from a term license based one, which might hurt the top line in the near term. This is because term license revenues include advance payments while subscription-based revenues are a bit delayed.Nevertheless, management is extremely optimistic about the several cloud-based products launched recently, at a time when the P&C insurance industry is moving steadily toward adoption of cloud solutions. | The chances of Guidewirebeating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are more this time as it has the right combination of two key ingredients - positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .

Earnings season is pretty much over now that most retailers have released fiscal Q2 numbers. It would seem like there are more no key earnings reports until mid-October, when Q3 reporting begins.But even in a short week, there are some intriguing earnings releases on the earnings calendar. None of the reports are likely to move the market, particularly after a strong earnings season that helped boost the  to new all-time highs. But investors - particularly those with exposure to a few key sectors - still will have plenty to chew on.A major chipmaker will not only release numbers, but perhaps give more color on its longstanding (and highly successful) M&A strategy. Numbers and commentary from a key member of one of the market's more volatile sectors likely will reverberate across several stocks. And a high-flying SaaS play will show how much tolerance investors have for high valuations as attention moves from earnings to geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns. All told, investors returning from a three-day weekend will have to get right back to work. Tuesday, September 4, after market close (NASDAQ:  ) earnings on Tuesday may give a clue as to just how high investors are willing to go from a valuation standpoint. WDAY stock has marched pretty much straight higher for the past month, gaining over 20% on very little news.In fact, WDAY shares actually  in late May. The  of Adaptive Insights in June made some sense, but a $1.55 billion dollar buy isn't a game-changer for a company now valued at $32 billion.It's that valuation that seems to make the fiscal Q2 report potentially dicey. WDAY now trades at 13x revenue - and 93x forward EPS. It's difficult to see what kind of quarter can possibly send the stock higher, particularly after recent gains - unless investors are willing to pay up.So far - and for years now - the market has been fine with those valuations, particularly for SaaS stocks. And, admittedly, the earnings calendar in July and August featured plenty of stocks that seemed to have gone too far, too fast. The response to WDAY's earnings - particularly if they're strong - may show whether there's any multiple expansion left in the software space, and perhaps for other high flyers as well. Thursday, September 6, after market closeFiscal Q1 results from $2.4 billion market cap  (NASDAQ:  ) aren't going to move the market. But shareholders of FNSR and other optical networking stocks are likely to be watching closely.The optical group - which also includes  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ), among others - tends to trade together. Demand tends to be choppy. And a series of external events have hurt - and helped - the group at various times this year. Tariff concerns and  to China's  have added to long-running worries about Chinese demand.FNSR stock itself has had a volatile year, but sits about where it started 2018. The Q1 report on Thursday could be another inflection point in the stock's choppy trading. And it could move not only FNSR, but its peers as well. Thursday, September 6, after market closeFrom here, the fiscal Q3 report from  (NASDAQ:  ) is the most important one on the earnings calendar. AVGO stock sold off sharply back in July, when the company announced its acquisition of  (NASDAQ:  ).The market, quite simply, didn't like the deal. AVGO stock lost some $15 billion in market value over a $19 billion deal. The move from chips into software raised questions about the company's M&A strategy, and perhaps if the company was starting to reach after its attempted takeover of  (NASDAQ:  )  .Personally, I  - and still do at a cheaper price. And Thursday's release might give AVGO a chance to rebound, even with an ~8% bounce from 18-month lows reached in July. Management will have another chance to justify the CA deal. Solid results can remind investors of the strength in the legacy business. And an ~11x forward EPS multiple seems far too low in a sector that has seen a lot of optimism the last few years (albeit with some choppy trading this year).An AVGO rally would help major tech indices and could help other chip stocks. It might also give the company more ammunition to make yet another deal.

It is worth considering Workday (WDAY), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry.This maker of human resources software has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 30.13%.For the most recent quarter, Workday was expected to post earnings of $0.26 per share, but it reported $0.33 per share instead, representing a surprise of 26.92%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.21 per share, while it actually produced $0.28 per share, a surprise of 33.33%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Workday lately. In fact, the Zacks (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Workday lately. In fact, the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce  . In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Workday has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on September 4, 2018.Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Gartner published this magic quadrant for cloud HCM suites for midmarket and large enterprises on August 15, 2018 -- and once again positioned Workday as a leader.We also continue to see strong traction in cloud financial management, where we had over 60% new customer growth in Q2 and also added another new Fortune 500 customer. We now have over 530 financial management customers, including eight in the Fortune 500. In the second quarter, Lufthansa, Kemper Corporate Services, and Horizon Healthcare Services are a few of the many new customers who selected Workday for core financial management. Also, and equally important, we had several customers go live in financial management in Q2 including Continental, Casualty Company, and Advantis Healthcare.As we have continued to push into the financials marketplace over the past several years, it's become very apparent that for many companies the first push into the cloud is the in the area of financial and operational planning. This market dynamic is the main reason we accelerated our path into planning with the acquisition of Adaptive Insights, which closed August 1st. With Adaptive Insights, we now have the ability to sell best of breed planning on a stand-alone basis or as part of a broad ERP suite. Since the close, Adaptive Insights has been operating as a Workday business unit under the brand Adaptive Insights, a Workday Company. Adaptive Insights' CEO, and my good friend of 15 years, Tom Bogan is reporting directly to me and has joined the executive committee of Workday.We are thrilled about the combination of Workday and Adaptive Insights, which will enable customers to better plan, execute, and analyze across the enterprise all in one system, the leading cloud platform, to drive their financial and business transformations. The acquisition increases the power and reach of the combined companies, who share a common employee first and customer centric approach to developing enterprise software.Additionally, we have decided that our single planning solution moving forward will be the Adaptive Insights Business Planning Cloud. This represents a huge opportunity for us to increase the speed to market on our long-term vision of companywide integrated financial, workforce, and operational planning for all enterprises large and small. With an improved value proposition for the office of the CFO, we strongly believe that over time we will drive more sales for financials.We believe having Adaptive Insights as a single planning platform reduces the complexity for both customers and employees. We're committed to unifying Adaptive Insights with Workday, not bolting it on. This means the power of one will stay intact, ultimately equipping our customers with access to one source for data, once security model, one user experience, and one workday community that enables them to plan, execute, and analyze all in one system.Our investment in broadening our platform and extending our product capabilities is creating many levers to drive enduring long-term growth. While human capital management is our most mature segment and has fueled much of our growth, penetration rates for cloud HCM remain low globally. HCM only represents approximately 25% of our total addressable market long-term. We're in the early days of our journey as a company and remain focused on investing to drive customer success and to help transform the way our customers do business.We look forward to sharing more about our products and marketing opportunities next month at Workday Rising, our annual customer conference. The Financial Analysts Day takes place on October 2nd in Las Vegas, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. And now, over to you, Robynne. -- Thanks, Aneel, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel discussed, we continue to see momentum in our business, driven by our differentiated technology and unique focus on customer success.In the second quarter, we delivered total revenue of $672 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 28%. Our Q2 subscription revenue was $566 million, up 30%. Year-over-year. Our subscription revenue outperformance was driven by net new customer growth as well as a record high for renewals achievement as a percent of the original contract value, a clear benefit of our consistently high levels of customer satisfaction.Our Q2 professional services revenue grew 17% to $106 million. Total revenue outside the US was up 48% to $156 million, representing a record 23% of total revenue. Subscription revenue backlog was over $5.5 billion, growth of 26% year-over-year. Consistent with prior quarters, approximately two-thirds of the subscription revenue backlog balance will be recognized over the next two years.Non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter were down slightly to 74%, primarily as a result of a decline in our professional services margin. This normal seasonal decline was primarily due to the costs associated with our annual global partner conference as well as the impact of our annual employee compensation cycle, which went into effect at the beginning of Q2. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the second quarter was $68 million, an operating margin of 10.1%. This includes the impact of $3 million of expenses related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition, which was not contemplated in our previous guidance.Our investment philosophy remains focused on growth and ensuring we deliver the best products to enable our customers to transform the way they do business. We remain early in addressing our long-term opportunity with a majority of our products still in the beginning phases of their growth curves. You should continue to expect that we will reinvest any incremental topline overperformance this year.Cash flow from operations was $58 million in Q2, led by stronger than expected collections in our seasonally lowest cash flow quarter. Our trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $512 million, up 36% year-over-year. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $338 million, also up 36% year-over-year. Note that in calculating our 12-month free cash flow, we have excluded $161 million related to our owned real estate projects.Moving to the balance sheet, total unearned revenue at the end of Q2 grew 21% year-over-year to just under $1.5 billion. Current unearned revenue was $1.4 billion, in line with our expectations of 25% year-over-year growth. Non-current unearned revenue was down 14% year-over-year.During Q2, we completed the settlement of the convertible senior note that became due in July. The face value of the notes was settled with $350 million in cash. We also issued approximately 1.5 million shares per the terms of the conversation provisions. The shares issued were offset completely by our exercise of the related hedge and, as a result, the note settlement had no net impact on our share count. Our biggest investment continues to be in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q2, we successfully added and integrated over 500 net new employees, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to over 9,100. We continued to execute very well operationally and finished a great first half of the year despite the difficult comps.Now, let's turn to guidance. Please note that our guidance incorporates the impact of transaction and integration costs as well as the ongoing operations, net of purchase accounting adjustments related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition, which closed on August 1st. Additionally, given current FX rates, our subscription revenue guidance includes a headwind of several million dollars in the second half.For subscription revenue, we're raising our full-year estimate to be in the range of $2.341-2.348 billion, or a growth of 31%. This guidance includes an estimated contribution of $42 million from Adaptive Insights. We expect our Q3 subscription revenue to be $609-611 million, or 31-32% growth inclusive of $18 million from Adaptive Insights. We still expect professional services revenue to be approximately $424 million in Fiscal 2019, of which approximately $9 million is from Adaptive Insights. For Q3, we expect services revenue of $112 million, with $4 million coming from Adaptive Insights.We now expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 4% for Q3 and approximately 9% for the full year. This 300 basis point reduction from our previous full-year margin guidance is related solely to the Adaptive Insights acquisition. Approximately $40 million of this headwind comes from one-time transaction and integration costs with the remaining coming from ongoing operations. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 31 percentage points in Q3 and 27 percentage points for the full year.Our previous expectations of organic short-term unearned revenue growth in the low 20% for the third and fourth quarters this year is unchanged. Adding in Adaptive Insights, however, we now expect the growth in short-term unearned revenue could be up to 25% in Q3 and Q4. We expect operating cash flow to be approximately $550 million for the year, reflecting the full impact from the Adaptive Insights acquisition. We still expect FY19 capital spend to be approximately $200 million for our development center project and an additional $200 million for all other CapEx.And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners, and employees for their continued support and hard work which allowed us to deliver great results for the first half of the year. We're also thrilled to welcome the incredible Adaptive Insights team to Workday and are excited about what we will accomplish together in the second half and beyond. We look forward to seeing many of you at Workday Rising in October as we share more insights on our strategic product initiatives and long-term market opportunity....Operator, let's now begin the Q&A process.[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Sir, you may ask your question.Hi. This is Kevin Maw on for Brad. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. Can you give any update on how you're thinking about the go-to-market strategy with Adaptive and coordinating the salesforce with Workday's enterprise reps? -- Sure. We're going to continue to sell Adaptive as a stand-alone best of breed planning product through the Adaptive salesforce, which will continue to grow, both in their medium enterprise and large enterprise businesses. You'll see them continue to focus on selling planning stand-alone. If it's inclusive of a larger ERP deal, either with financials or HR, then the Workday reps will take the lead with support from Adaptive. We're figuring out the compensation model just to make sure that everyone is acting in the right mode. It's important for us to continue to leverage Adaptive's place as a best of breed solution. So, it will be sold stand-alone, whether or not the customer is a Workday customer.Got it. Thank you. Can you give any color on how much Adaptive contributed to the subscription backlog for the quarter? -- Adaptive is not in subscription backlog for the quarter since we closed that transaction the first day of Q3. -- Operator, next question, please.Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Justin Furby from William Blair. Sir, your line is open. -- Thanks, guys. Congrats. Aneel, in terms of subscription growth this quarter, it looked like it was more or less stable from Q1 at around 30%. For the last few quarters you had some pretty noticeable deceleration there. Do you feel like the business is nearing the floor in terms of organic growth over the medium term? What do you think Adaptive does -- you called out the inorganic pieces, but when you look out over the medium term, what does it do to your organic growth in terms of planning and driving that business but also driving financials deals. -- In terms of subscription growth, I would defer that question to Robynne. But, I think we've been pretty clear all along that the first half of the year had pretty challenging comps from last year. In the second half of the year, the comps are easier. In terms of Adaptive, we recognize through the past few years of selling core financials, as soon as we introduced planning we had a new entry into the sales cycle. The planning area was viewed currently as a good place to start in the transformation to the cloud and very strategic to the office of the CFO. We found that, while we were making traction with our own development efforts, we were two years or three years behind where the market needed us to be.With Adaptive, we very quickly get into the market with a leader defined by Gartner and the Magic Quadrant. Those will open more doors for us on the broader financial management suite. So, it's the double bonus of now being viewed as a leader in that space as well as opening up the doors to larger core financial management business. We're very excited about it.Also, the acceleration that we see as a big potential for us is in large enterprise. That has historically not been a focus of the Adaptive sales organization. They're going to move into large enterprise and we have hundreds of large enterprise sales reps that will be able to introduce Adaptive into the large enterprise accounts. -- Got it. On the HR service delivery market, it seems like that's an opportunity, or a market starting to really inflect. Do you guys plan to enter that market directly at some point or is it to leverage partners? It seems to me there's a pretty big opportunity, even within your install base there. Thanks. -- For the time being, it's leveraging partners. But, it's definitely one of the areas on our roadmap as we explore new areas of growth. -- Great. Thanks, guys.Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. Mr. Murphy, you may ask your question. -- Thank you. I'll add my congrats. Aneel, I was thinking back to 12-18 months ago, and you seemed to be entering a pretty unusual period where there were many large enterprise HCM deals. It ended up including Walmart, Target, Dow Chemical, BT, and many others. I think you had a single quarter where you closed 13 Fortune 500s. I think it was partly due to some of the competitors' products that were being sunsetted or end of lifed. What are you observing today in terms of the HCM replacement cycle and when do you think is the next point in time where you would expect to see an unusual cluster of the large enterprise deals coming together like that? -- The large enterprise deals are continuing to come to Workday at a -- I think we're getting far more than our fair share. I think this past quarter we had eight Fortune 500 accounts that became Workday customers. It continues to be a very strong market. It's the second quarter, which is not typically a Fortune 500 quarter. That typically is our fourth quarter. We don't really see anything changing that dramatically. If anything, we're seeing some of the multinational Fortune 500 accounts not based in the US coming to market and looking for a partner to help them move HR into the cloud and go through their HR transformation. I'd say most of the international markets are three or four years behind the US, so some of those markets are really beginning to pick up now. -- Okay. Thank you, Aneel. Robynne, what are you observing today in terms of the typical subscription fees that are being generated in financials versus HCM. If you're comparing like-for-like sized organizations, if a company has 10,000 employees and you looked at the ratio of the subscription fee for financials relative to HCM, what exactly are you observing there and what do you think it would look like in the long run? -- Mark, the way our list price works is about a 1:1 ratio. We're seeing very consistent discounting rates across both of those products. Chano, is there anything you want to add? -- That's accurate. That's what we're seeing. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Sir, you may ask your question. -- Thanks for taking the question. Nice quarter. In terms of financials, we noted in our recent CIO survey -- and a couple of the reasons for CIO surveys are ERP refreshes and ERP investment is rising up the CIO priority list. Are you seeing that in your interactions with customers? Are you seeing financials rise in priority? -- Absolutely. I think the combination of core fins -- procurement, expenses, and planning -- altogether, we can be an ERP replacement today. It definitely seems to be the next area of focus from IT. It was CRM, then HR, IT, and now finance is the next big one to tackle. One of the reasons why it hasn't taken off in the past is that the products, including ours, were just not ready to take over the operations of the truly large multinationals from a feature function perspective. And we're confident that they are today. So, when they go off and do their analysis, they're comforted with the fact that, \"I'm not actually giving up anything on the functionality side and I'm making a huge leap forward on the technology side.\" -- Got it. On the midmarket opportunity, any changes that you make with your midmarket focus with Adaptive? I know they had a really big midmarket presence within their customer base. Does that become a new distribution avenue for financials to come into the midmarket for you guy? So, the core financials. -- We've had a very strong run in medium enterprise since about a year and a half ago. Chano created hard and fast lines between large enterprise and medium enterprise all the way through the sales organization, all the way down to the rep level and all the way up to the senior sales executive level. With Adaptive, our medium enterprise business lines up very nicely with theirs. We'll be able to take their product into our existing install base medium enterprise account and sell into other accounts together.The big benefit, though, is taking their great product and moving it into the large enterprise market and our 2,200 large enterprise customers. That is the biggest opportunity. Chano, do you want to add anything? -- No, I think you're right. We had a great financials basically quarter, also in the medium enterprise. We commented on the customer growth of 60% year-on-year. That was tremendously strong on particularly that part of the market. We're very excited about, with Adaptive, extending the capabilities we have, particularly around financial planning and sales operation planning. We've not been playing that much before. It's been more workforce planning. I think that would be a great offering and we're culminating on the lining in that midmarket. We will see extended and has some opportunity there with large enterprise here in the US and particularly in the rest of the world where the Adaptive coverage is a shorter term -- basically, the footprint we have as a channel there. -- Super helpful. Thank you so much.Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. -- Hi. Congratulations on showing such strong sequential billing cycle acceleration. I think you guided to that and you delivered. I'm also curious to get your thoughts on how to think about backlog growth rate. We're seeing more seasonality on the backlog, since sequentially it did growth. But, it has grown a little bit faster. Is the business becoming more seasonal and therefore the weight of backlog performance is going to be shifted toward the second half? And, Aneel, how do you expect the Adaptive acquisition to catalyze the sales cycles of financials customers and potential prospects and how they're likely to close on the broader GL and not just the planning aspect. -- Kash, on the backlog, we are seeing multiple dynamics there, including the seasonality that you've talked about. We've also had very difficult comps the first half of last year. So, that impacted the backlog revenue growth. And, we saw some headwinds in Q2 from both duration and FX. As the renewal cycles also can move around, that'll impact as well. So, on a quarter-to-quarter basis it could vary a little, but we do expect that, on the longer term, it's going to be a good indicator of our growth long-term. -- Kash, there's no question that we believe planning will accelerate some of the core financial business as well. But, I think the most important piece is that, much like Workday, Adaptive is very focused on customer success. If they're able to get in the door and win even just the planning business, we'll get a shot at the HR business and the finance business down the road. It just gets us in the door. Once we get in the door, we're confident that we'll prove ourselves from a customer success perspective. It's one of the reasons we were so drawn to Adaptive. They have the same exact focus on employees and on customer success. I think it's going to dramatically open up the market.So, you go visit a customer and they're not ready to swap out their core accounting system, but they are ready to take on a planning system, that's fine. We'll get in the door and, when they are ready to switch to core accounting, we'll be the best positioned, both from a product integration perspective and a relationship perspective. -- Wonderful. Thank you so much. All the best.The next question comes from the line of Mr. Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital. Sir, you may ask your question. -- Great. Thanks for taking the question. Robynne, I wanted to follow-up on the subscription backlog growth metrics. If I look at our analysis over the last year, it looked like you doubled the number of Fortune 50 customers a year ago. When do those compares start to ease? Is that really the April quarter of next year? I'm just trying to understand when I think about the growth metrics on subscription backlog has decelerated. I get the tough compares. It sounds like there's FX as well. But, when are we through the bulk of the tough compares there? -- If you take out the very large deals, we're through the bulk of the tough compares right now. It was really the first half of last year where we had really strong reacceleration of net new ACV. So, we do expect net new ACV growth acceleration in the back half of this year as the comps get a little more favorable for us. I think the wildcard here is the large deals -- Fortune 500 -- and when those come to market, which can make the results lumpy. Certainly, when they do come to market, we do like our odds to win them.. We have great competitive win rates in that space, but they are a little hard to predict in terms of timing. -- Great. Aneel, as we think about eight Fortune 500 wins this quarter, one Fortune 500 cloud financial win, what's the pipeline activity? We continue to hear more around ERP refresh cycles and modernization projects. How does the pipeline on cloud financials in the Fortune 500 look for the second half? -- Chano? -- We have had solid pipeline growth for both financials in our international business in the second half. From a mix perspective, the financials continue to grow as a percentage of the mix, although clearly we have given sustained growth in AC and the mix shift is moving slowly. But, there are some large deals in the second half. It's always difficult to predict exactly the timing, if those deals are going to end up happening in Q4, as we have expectations for during Q3 and Q4, or a couple of them may slip one or two quarters, given the timing of those discussions. But, we have good coverage and healthy pipeline for that financial opportunity in the second half. -- Very helpful. That's all I had. Thanks.Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Sir, you may ask your question. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A bigger picture question -- in terms of the Fortune 500 HCM deals that you expect this year versus next year and last year -- not just for you, but for the industry as a whole -- and maybe, with the positive economic backdrop of budget cycles, are you seeing in any way an acceleration of that cycle this year? Again, how should we think about the proportion of that activity over the course of this year and next year? -- It's a good question. I'm not sure we see an acceleration of activity. I definitely think we're through the early adopters segment of companies moving to the cloud. I would hope that we have a shot at getting to 50% of the Fortune 500. We're within distance of that over the next couple of years, if you look at the number that we're signing every quarter. The bigger phenomenon is that these Fortune 500 accounts, once they're live, are coming back and taking on more modules. We've shared this at past user conferences and we'll share it again. For that first dollar spent on core HR, it can be $2.00-3.00 more in add-on products, whether it's payroll or learning or recruiting -- time and now planning.There are so many areas that, once we get that customer into production -- it's so important we get them into production -- they come back and buy more. That's probably the biggest phenomenon we've seen as these big companies have gone live, that our customer base sellbacks are much stronger than they were maybe two or three years ago. -- Got it. That's helpful. Aneel, on Adaptive, you mentioned that Adaptive will become your planning cloud solution. Can you maybe drill down into what exactly you mean about -- are you going to rewrite their product on your platform? Are you going to standardize on their platform to preserve that power of one? Maybe just drill a little bit deeper on that. Also, how long do you expect this process to take before you can start making the meaningful sales? -- I think we'll make meaningful sales immediately just selling it. It was a thriving business before Workday, and hopefully we can have it do even better. So, there are a couple of things into making it our platform. Number one, Workday had its own planning product, Workday Planning, that was primarily focused on workforce planning. Our original take was that we would continue to build workforce planning and Adaptive would focus on financial and operational planning. As we dug into it and understood the real breadth and power of the Adaptive platform, they're not that far away from workforce planning. Today, it made sense just to say, \"Let's put all of our eggs in that one planning basket.\" So, we will be, over time, sunsetting the Workday workforce Planning product and moving all of those customers to the Adaptive planning platform.In terms of the integration, I'll get in trouble with the development team, but I'll put a range on -- 12-18 months to completely have it unified. But, you'll see it in steps. The first step will be a very tight integration and making sure that the data models are in sync over time, user experience, and security. I think, within 12-18 months, you will not be able to tell the difference that one product was built separately. The beauty of it is that it's not a transactional application. Planning is built around a modeling engine. Workday did not have a modeling engine in its platform, so that's additive. Now, it's just making sure that the data models, metadata models, security models, and the user interface are all harmonized. That's something we've had good experience with in the past. -- Great. Thank you, guys.Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. -- Thanks very much. Aneel, I was wondering if you could talk about adoption of the financial management product by vertical? I know your strategy in the financial management world is a lot more industry focused. Can you comment on the industry, if you're seeing good adoption or maybe the ones that are either ahead or behind what you were thinking maybe at the start of this fiscal year? Thanks. -- Sure. We do have a much more industry focused approach to financials. Number one, because the financial products themselves require more industry capabilities than the HR products do. HR is pretty homogenous across different industries. With financials, we started out with E&G -- education and government. We continue to do very well in that space. Many of the largest universities use Workday Financials as well as Workday HR. That was followed on by healthcare and we continue to land some of the largest healthcare transformations as they move their financials into the cloud.Technology continues to be a strong area for us, largely now on the back of 606 and people having to go through the painful change of their rev rec. Within Workday, that's already built in and easy to use. Other business services -- professional services -- have all been good areas for us. Financial services has been strong in pockets. Insurance has been one of our strongest markets of moving financials to the cloud. Wall Street banks have been slower. So, if I would say where I'd hope we'd see more traction, it would be in Wall Street banks. Wall Street banks were also later on the HR side due to the heavy regulation and the amount of work they have to produce for regulators. I suspect, in the next year or two, you'll start seeing the big investment banks coming to market with financials for the cloud. Chano, have I missed any? -- I think you've covered it pretty greatly. When you look at the pipeline particularly in our core financials verticals that have been there for longer -- education, government, and healthcare -- you see that 70% of the deals are ERP deals, kind of having both HCM financials and the industry component as part of the mix of the pipeline. Clearly, win ratios are stronger today in verticals Aneel mentioned -- those services and people focused on outside of our core verticals. -- Great. Thanks very much.Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. -- Thanks so much. My congrats. Robynne, the commentary on the tough comps, from the HCM slate last year, are you explicitly saying that we should look for the backlog growth to reaccelerate in the second half? And then, FX -- you said several million, but I wondered if we're getting to a point now where the international known US dollar denominated business is getting significant enough such that we should start to think about constant currency versus reported growth? Was there any more color on that as you think about the back half? Thanks. -- Yeah, sure, Ross. With regard to the backlog growth, and the tough comps, I wouldn't expect backlog growth reacceleration because it's such a large number -- $5.5 billion. The backlog has reached the large numbers where it would be really hard to reaccelerate growth. So, we do expect to see a reacceleration of our net new ACV growth, but that likely won't lead to a reacceleration of backlog growth. We do expect the seasonal patterns of backlog growth to still hold going forward. So, relatively flat Q2 to Q3, and then our most significant uptick in Q4. We still are watching the backlog number. It's still a fairly recent metric for us. Now that our peers have started to adopt 606 and report this number, we're still beginning to evaluate the patterns and think about how we want to look at that and talk about it going forward.With regard to your question on FX, the FX doesn't always impact us as much as some of our peers because we are functional US dollar currency and most of our entities out of which we sell -- which means, once we enter into a contract, then the FX rate gets locked once it's billed and then we actually hedge it going forward. So, the real FX impact is on new deals during the quarter and the year, whereby we may have gone into the year with an assumption of a British pound deal translating into a certain amount of USD and that may fluctuate over time. So, not as big of an impact for us as some of the other companies out there, but still something we're keeping an eye on. -- Great. Thanks for the clarification.Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer. Sir, you may ask your question. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Aneel, how are you thinking about capitalizing on the opportunity in operational planning. If I recall Adaptive Insights, I think about 20% of their users are actually business users and are using it for operational planning. I think you mentioned Adaptive has a modern sales planning product that they just came to market. You're also talking a little bit more about ERP here on the call. So, how are you thinking about investing and capitalizing on the operational planning positioning that Adaptive Insights already has in the market today. Thanks. -- It was definitely one of the parts of their strategy that was very attractive to us. That was not the Workday planning strategy before Adaptive. We were pretty narrowly focused on financial planning and workforce planning. Adaptive had several years ago embarked on sales and operational planning as its next push after financial planning. We are only going to accelerate that with more development resources for them. After that, they're going to focus on workforce planning so that we can retire our product. And, who knows after that? There are lots of different directions. It's a powerful planning platform built around a very powerful modeling engine. With their new versions, they're able to scale to the largest companies in the world. So, maybe manufacturing and raw material and parts is not something that happens in the next two to three years, but there is no reason it couldn't be part of the Adaptive platform long-term.Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Todd Burke from Needham. Sir, you may ask your question. -- Hi, everyone. Congrats on a good quarter. Aneel, you'd mentioned that Target went live already, and knowing when that contract was roughly signed, it seems like your implementation cycles have actually become faster in HR. Can you talk about impacts you're seeing with getting better and improving those processes and how it might be speeding up your cell cycles and customers' willingness to dive into something like financials? -- I'm not sure if they've gotten faster. They're definitely more predictable. We've seen Fortune 500 -- even Fortune 50 -- companies go live in 12 or 13 months. Target had a great team in place. They really focused on the implementation and got it done in a very quick time. We've seen that in the past with companies like Bank of America, AstraZeneca -- it can be done in that 11- to 13- month timeframe. It's best in class for a Fortune 50 type company. What's making it more predictable are the tools we're delivering for the implementation side. We've had an ongoing development effort to streamline the inputting of data, the process configuration, where many of the functions are now automated. We actually did these things for the medium enterprise, to bring down the services cost. But, we now able to leverage some of these tools in large enterprise as well. It's definitely a big area for focus. We have some of our best people working on it in Dublin to make implementations faster and simpler. -- Got it. Very helpful. Robynne, you specifically called out improved renewals -- I think you said record high renewals. Was that on a gross basis or a net basis? If a gross basis, what is driving the improved renewals? If on a net basis, what are customer buying more of today than maybe a year ago? -- We've been reporting fairly consistently that, on a dollar value basis, we've been over 100%. Last quarter was really just a very stellar quarter for renewals. I'm going to turn it over to Chano to comment in a minute, but we actually have an increased focus on renewals and trying to sell more into that base and make sure we're maximizing the renewals. That was an organizational shift that Chano affected at the beginning of this year. Do you want to comment on that, Chano? -- Yeah. Our customer base is increasing. We made a change in the go-to-market that some of you have noticed, which is putting more focus in terms of our customers for cross selling and upselling efforts. That seems to be paying off. If you look at the data from the first half of this year, we've doubled down the efforts with engagement of those customers, making sure we plan ahead of those renewals cycles properly. So, if anything, they can have expected or better than expected. That has happened, particularly in Q2, on a very high note positively. On top of that, we take those opportunities for an increase -- basically, adoption of new products, and that has come also on board very nicely within Q2. But, it's more direct compared to the initial contract in terms of performance. -- Helpful. Thank you.We'll take our final question from Mr. Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Mr. Ravens, you may ask your question.Great. Thank you. I'll add my congratulations. Aneel, if you look at the $40 billion CRM market, under what circumstances would it make sense for Workday to offer sales marketing or customer support solutions? -- I've said this since we started the company -- Marc Benioff and Salesforce have been great partners and they've chosen not to enter our space and we've chosen not to enter their space, largely because the partnership we have together benefits both companies. If that were ever to change, then we might reconsider it. But, I don't see it changing and they continue to be one of our best partners. It's nice having partners where you're not competing. It just changes the relationship. I don't see that as one of our future growth areas.There are so many other things for us to do. When I look at the world right now, 90% of our business comes out of HCM. Financials is growing at a nice clip. Prism Analytics, relatively new, growing at a very nice clip, planning relatively new. And then, of course, the Workday cloud platform slowly coming to market. It's already in limited general availability, but we can already see a lot of demand for that. So, we have enough irons in the fire, so to speak, that will keep us busy for the next several years without even considering a different category. -- Given our edge, you mentioned that HCM only represents 25% of our total addressable market. When you look at the international markets, we're in such early stages without extending over there, that the opportunity of theirs is not super significant besides all the other areas and products you just mentioned. We have no -- we see no shortage of market opportunities right now that we need to execute on.Great. Thank you....We now conclude this call. Thank you for joining us today. Have a great day.

The week of August 27 saw the likes of Lululemon  shine, while Salesforce's  quarterly revenues surged by 27%.But there are still some important technology players left to report that investors might want to pay close attention to. Luckily, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases.With that said, let's take a look at three of the biggest tech earnings reports due out during the week of September 3.Shares of Workday have surged over 22% in the last month in a sign that investors might expect big things from the firm's Q2 financial results. Plus, the company, which provides enterprise cloud solutions for human resources and finance, has seen its stock price climb over 41% in the last 12 months on the back of solid growth.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Workday's Q2 revenues to jump by roughly 26.2% to hit $663.08 million. Meanwhile, the firm's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to hit $0.26 per share, which would mark an 8.3% jump. Better yet, Workday's fiscal year earnings are projected to soar over 23%. Investors should note that WDAY is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an \"A\" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.Workday is set to announce its Q2 financial results  on Tuesday, September 4.Broadcom designs and sells a wide range of digital and analog semiconductor connectivity solutions. Yet, while chip giants such as Nvidia  and Micron  gain momentum, shares of AVGO have sunk over 13% in the last year. Broadcom stock has also plummeted 15% in the last three months on the back of its July announcement that it is set to purchase CA Technologies for $18.9 billion in cash.The firm, which saw its most recent quarterly revenues surge 20%, is projected to see its fiscal Q3 revenues jump 13.4% to reach $5.06 billion. At the other end of the income statement, AVGO is expected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings hit $4.83 per share, which would mark a nearly 18% surge. Broadcom is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that rocks a \"B\" grade for Value in our Style Scores system.The San Jose, California-based company is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter financial results after the closing bell on Thursday, September 6.Palo Alto Networks is a global cyber security firm that is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and boasts an \"A\" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The firm has seen its stock price take off over the last 12 months, up roughly 57%. Plus, shares of PAWN have surged over 15% in the last month in the lead up to the release of Palo Alto Network's Q4 and fiscal 2018 financial results.Our current estimates are calling for Palo Alto's quarterly revenues to climb by approximately 24.4% to hit $633.19 million, with its full-year revenues expected reach $2.25 billion. The firm's adjusted EPS figure is expected to expand by just over 27% to touch $1.17 per share this quarter. Meanwhile, investors should be even more pleased to see that PAWN's full-year earnings are expected to soar over 43% to touch $3.88 per share.Palo Alto Networks is set to release its Q4 and fiscal 2018 financial results after markets close on Thursday, September 6.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on September 4, 2018, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of human resources software is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.3%.Revenues are expected to be $663.08 million, up 26.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Workday, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Workday will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Workday would post earnings of $0.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.33, delivering a surprise of +26.92%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Workday doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Keeping in mind that shares of the $1 trillion tech titan trade at around $230 as of this writing, astute investors could have purchased them for under $2.00 per share as late as 2004. And it wasn't just early investors who enjoyed the fruits of Apple's success; the stock has more than tripled over the past five years alone.That naturally raises the question: Are there any stocks on the market today that could deliver even sweeter returns?We asked that question to three top Motley Fool contributors. Read on to learn why they think  (NASDAQ: WDAY) ,  (NASDAQ: EXEL) , and  (NYSE: AOS) could possibly put Apple's returns to shame.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Shares of Workday are already up 50% so far in 2018, thanks largely to its habit of beating expectations and raising its guidance as enterprise clients continue to transition their legacy HR implementations to cloud-based software -- which means they're flocking to its core Human Capital Management and, more recently, its newer Financial Management and business analytics platforms.As it stands, Workday boasts a 98% customer satisfaction rate with more than 2,200 enterprise customers of all sizes and across various industries. Among its new customers in its  were IKEA,  ,  , and a Fortune 100 pharmaceutical client. As such, Workday's subscription revenue last quarter grew more than 30%, to just over $500 million, offering an increasingly predictable revenue stream and free cash flow to help the company invest to extend its industry leadership.All told, Workday is successfully taking market share from its larger competitors with addressable markets totaling more than $70 billion, leaving a long runway for growth considering its revenue this fiscal year is \"only\" expected to arrive at around $2.7 billion. For investors willing to buy now and watch Workday sustain its momentum, the stock could offer exceptional gains over the long term. Though Apple and its cash hoard are difficult to top, I would (and  ) put my money on cancer drug developer Exelixis to outperform a majority of high-profile names, including Apple.Back in 2014, Exelixis' future was very much in doubt after its lead drug, now known as Cabometyx, failed miserably in the Comet studies for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Since then, though, it's been off to the races.Keeping in mind that therapies can act differently depending on the cancer type, Cabometyx wound up wowing in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The drug became the first to hit the \"trifecta\" in second-line RCC of a statistically significant improvement in objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival, cementing its place as a major second-line player.Not long after, it hurdled  's (NYSE: BMY) blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Opdivo with its phase 2 Cabosun results, expanding Cabometyx's label to include first-line advanced RCC ahead of Opdivo. Taking into account Exelixis' market share in RCC, as well as its potential to partner with Bristol-Myers' Opdivo in combination therapies for RCC, the company should remain healthfully profitable on a recurring basis.But, there's more.Exelixis also appears to be  after its phase 3 Celestial trial in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) easily hit its primary endpoint.And, finally, there's Cotellic's potential (a secondary revenue generator for Exelixis) as a combination therapy with  's (NASDAQOTH: RHHBY) Zelboraf in select types of metastatic melanoma, and other possible combination studies with Roche.Add this up, and Exelixis has a real shot at averaging top-line growth of perhaps 25% a year through 2022, as well as push toward $2 in full-year earnings per share. If Exelixis doesn't get gobbled up by a growth-hungry pharmaceutical company, its fundamentals should carry it to significant gains. You wouldn't think it possible, but Apple's stock advance over the past decade is roughly the same as a company that makes water heaters. That may sound fantastical, since water heaters are among the most boring things imaginable compared to an iPhone. But I assure you that A. O. Smith Corporation's water heater business is growing rapidly in places where hot water is considered a luxury.The big growth driver over the last decade was China, where revenues advanced at around 21% a year. And as this giant nation continues to move its population up the socioeconomic scale, there's likely more growth ahead. Helping to ensure that growth is Smith's move into air and water purification, two other things we take for granted in the United States.But that's not the only growth driver. Smith is also expanding in India, another giant developing nation where residents are entering the middle class and buying the luxury of hot water as soon as they can. Like China, Smith sees India as a mega-trend, with its target market expected to grow from 3% of the population in 2018 to 24% by 2030. That's a huge growth opportunity for A. O. Smith to exploit, and one that should help  at a heady pace. data by  .There's one other thing to like about Smith, and that's dividend growth. The dividend has been increased for 25 consecutive years with a compound annual growth rate of 17% over the past decade. Believe it or not, not even Apple has kept up with that!We're certainly not guaranteeing that these companies will be the \"next\" Apple. But between Workday's industry-leading products and enormous addressable markets, Exelixis' market share in RCC and expanding pipeline, and A.O. Smith's growth potential and history of outperformance, we think chances are high that they could generate superior returns for patient shareholders over the long term.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $609 million. The robust top-line performance was driven by solid growth in subscription and professional revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 26 cents, up 8.3% year over year.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, j2 Global is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Workday has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that JCOM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than WDAY has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.JCOM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.19, while WDAY has a forward P/E of 108.57. We also note that JCOM has a PEG ratio of 1.65. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

Tableau fell a hair short of Wall Street's earnings targets in the first quarter but made up for it with fantastic revenue. Workday and HubSpot simply crushed analysts' estimates across the board in this year's first two reports.Investors and analysts embraced the cloud computing experts' total results, driving their share prices almost uniformly higher around the dates of their business reports.The one exception to this sector-spanning trend is found in Workday's chart, which dipped in May for no obvious reason. A fantastic  in early June also failed to restart the stalled stock, because of a fairly small boost to Workday's full-year guidance targets.Image source: Getty Images.In fact, Workday increased its sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 in that seemingly weak first-quarter report -- just not by quite as much as some investors might have liked.That being said, Mr. Market has been loving cloud computing stocks in recent years. Workday shares have gained a market-crushing 69% over the last 24 months, while Tableau's stock prices more than doubled and HubSpot delivered a stellar 156% return.

All of them have delivered average annual sales growth of roughly 50% over the last five years, paving the way toward strong earnings and cash flows when their growth-maximizing strategies give way to margin-focused business plans.It's no surprise to see enterprise-oriented  do well as this hyper-efficient platform type continues to make inroads in every corner of the business world.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 34 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Workday Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $94.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $158.00. The standard deviation is $14.806.But the whole reason to look at the  WDAY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with WDAY crossing above that average target price of $133.47/share, investors in WDAY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $133.47 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Although this communication infrastructure provider delivered an average positive surprise of 51.3% in the trailing four quarters, it widely missed earnings estimates in the last quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.ADTRAN is accelerating the industry's transition to open, programmable, scalable networks by leveraging its Mosaic Software-Defined Access architecture that combines modern Web-scale technologies with open-source platforms to facilitate rapid innovation in multi-technology, multi-vendor environments. This will enable operators to better face Web-scale competition by reducing time and cost to introduce new service, technologies and best-of-breed suppliers as they strive to reduce operational costs while creating and deploying differentiated product offerings.However, despite its best efforts, ADTRAN remains plagued by a merger-related review and slowdown in spending at a domestic Tier 1 customer. High operating costs and lower margins are additional concerns for the company.The success of 5G technology hinges on substantial investments to upgrade infrastructure in the core fiber backhaul network to support anticipated growth in data services. Although these investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to adequately support broadband competition, rural coverage and wireless densification, short-term profitability is likely to fall, leading to earnings dilution.Efforts to build resilient infrastructure facilities to withstand natural catastrophes further increase operating costs. Moreover, simmering tensions between the United States and China related to trade restrictions imposed on the sale of communication equipment to the Chinese firms have dented the credibility of the industry and led to loss of businesses.Our proven model does not conclusively show that ADTRAN is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% with both pegged at a loss of 23 cents.

Further, robust demand for Mellanox's InfiniBand solutions is a key catalyst.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.08 per share, reflecting year-over-year increase of 145.5%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $265.4 million, up roughly 25.2% from the year-ago quarter.Strong customer adoption of company's Gigabit EDR solutions in machine learning, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, database and storage are positives.Further, InfiBand's adoption aided the company in sustaining its leadership position in the high-performance interconnects space.Mellanox had won a contract from a Chinese weather research institute for an undisclosed amount. Per the deal, the company has been selected for its EDR 100 gigabit InfiniBand solutions which will substitute the OmniPath network in the current data center infrastructure. Institute's selection of Mellanox's InfiniBand solution will reinforce its competitive position against Intel's  Omni-Path solution.Apart from strong demand for Mellanox's InfiniBand solutions, the company has won contracts from the likes of NetApp, the University of Toronto and NASA Ames Research Center, which reflects strong demand for its solutions.The University of Toronto also selected the Mellanox InfiniBand solutions to accelerate its new leading supercomputer in Canada. Earlier, the NASA Ames Research Center selected the company's EDR InfiniBand solutions along with HPE SGI 8600 liquid cooled platform to expand its \"Electra\" supercomputing cluster.Additionally, Mellanox's collaboration with Microsemi Corporation is also expected to fortify its footprint in the high performance computing market, going forward.Further, Mellanox launched the Mellanox Hyper-scalable Enterprise Framework for enterprise and private cloud data centers. The company claims it to be industry's first scalable, open framework. The new framework will enable the organizations to develop a 25G, 50G and 100G hyperscale Ethernet driven network.

This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see earnings jump nearly 300% in 2018.Bonanza Creek is a small cap exploration and production company headquartered in Denver, Colorado. With a market cap of $720 million, it has operations in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and the Cotton Valley sands of Southern Arkansas in the Mid-Continent.On May 8, Bonanza Creek reported its first quarter results. It easily blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate, reporting $1.07 versus the consensus of $0.71 which was a beat of 50.7%.It beat its first quarter production guidance estimate, reporting 16.8 MBoe/d versus the guidance range of 16.0-16.6 MBoe/d. That was due to strong new well completions and consistently low line pressures on the company's Rocky Mountain Infrastructure system.Production, however, actually fell 5% year-over-year due to minimal drilling and completion activity throughout the first half of 2017.The product mix for the first quarter was 59% oil, 17% NGLs and 24% natural gas.Crude was 81% of total revenue.Net revenue jumped to $64.2 million from $52.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 thanks to increased commodity price and greater oil-weighted production.Oil averaged $57.89 per Bbl versus $48.59 in the year ago period.The Mid-Continent was cash flow positive in the first quarter with 3.0 Mboe/d of production.Investors need to pay attention to the balance sheets of the energy companies as it's been tough the last few years.At the end of the first quarter, Bonanza had liquidity of $182.5 million including cash on hand of $5.8 million and $176.7 million in borrowing capacity under its credit facility.As of May 8, it had no outstanding term debt and had just $15 million outstanding on its credit facility.With crude surging above $70, it's not surprising that analysts believe Bonanza is poised to cash in.1 estimate was raised in the last week for both the second quarter and 2018.The second quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate jumped to $1.26 from $0.97.For the year, the Zacks Consensus rose to $5.32 from $4.52 over the last week.

It also owns the East Dawning and Little Sheep restaurant concepts outright and acquired a controlling interest in the holding company of  in 2017.On May 1, Yum China reported its first quarter 2018 results and beat the Zacks Consensus by 4 cents. It reported $0.53 versus the consensus of $0.49.It was the third beat in the last four quarters.Revenue rose 15% to 2.2 billion from $1.9 billion.Same-store-sales, one of the most important metrics in the restaurant industry, rose 3%, with KFC seeing a 5% increase which was partially offset by weakness at Pizza Hut, which declined 5%, excluding F/X.Restaurant margins also fell to 17.9% from 20.4% in the prior year primarily due to the investment in product upgrades and promotions at Pizza Hut and its sales deleveraging.But Yum China's sheer size in China is impressive. It has 120 million loyalty program members for KFC, up 50 million year over year. Pizza Hut now has 40 million, up from 20 million a year ago.Delivery also continues to gain popularity.Online delivery jumped to 16% o company sales, up from 13% in the prior year period. It's now available in 970 cities, up from 700 cities a year ago.With the first quarter mostly being good news, at least for the KFC brand, why is Yum China a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)?One estimate for 2018 and 2019 has been cut in the last week.That has pushed the 2018 Zacks Consensus down to $1.59 from $1.60. The 2019 Zacks Consensus has also fallen to $1.70 from $1.72 in the last 7 days.It's still earnings growth of 12% and 6.7%, respectively.Investors, however, are more jittery about the trade and tariff implications on the company than they are with the estimate cuts.Shares have fallen 13% in the last month.In a matter of just a few years, \"the Cloud\" has evolved from a budding new tech feature to one of the main factors driving growth in the technology sector.

Shares have lost about 8.4% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is WDAY due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Workday delivered first-quarter fiscal 2019 non-GAAP earnings of 33 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. The figure also improved 13.8% year over year.Strong growth can primarily be attributed to 28.9% jump in revenues, which totaled $618.6 million. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $609 million. The robust top-line performance was driven by solid growth in subscription and professional revenues.Subscription revenues (84% of total revenues) surged 30.6% year over year to $522.1 million, on the back of expanding customer base and robust net new ACV growth. The figure surpassed the guidance of $514-$516.Professional services revenues (16% of total revenues) grew 20% from the year-ago quarter to $96.5 million and were better than the guidance of $93 million.Revenues outside the United States climbed 43% to $139 million, representing a record 22% of total revenues in the quarter.During the quarter, Workday extended capabilities and tools in Workday HCM with new customer experience.Workday has more than 2,200 customers. During the quarter, the company added Inter IKEA Services, Great Lakes, Tyson Shared Services and Unisys Corporation as its new HCM customers. The clientele now includes two Fortune 500 customers, one of which is a Fortune 100 company. Some other new financial management customers include Sprouts Farmers Market, Rivera and Race Truck Petroleum, one of the largest private companies in the United States.During the quarter, Aon, an HCM customer in 2013, became live on financial management in 28 countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and the United States.The company announced the availability of new data discovery capabilities in Workday Prism Analytics and Workday Cloud Platform, the first offering delivered on Workday Data-as-a-Service, during the quarter.Workday was placed in the Leaders quadrant of \"Magic Quadrant for Cloud Core Financial Management Suites for Midsize, Large, and Global Enterprises\" by Gartner.Workday announced partnership with Slack to help customers to complete tasks more efficiently and effectively by engaging with Workday from within the Slack interface. This will enhance security and improve functionality of Workday's user interface.Gross margin expanded 50 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 75.2%, primarily owing to favorable mix toward higher-margin subscription revenues.The company reported non-GAAP operating profit of $80.8 million compared with $60.9 million in the year-ago quarter.

The  (NASDAQ:  ) fell 2%, despite a late-session rally while bulls are growing tired of buying the dip amid continued trade-war rhetoric. Investors with a watchlist have likely noticed  (NASDAQ:  ), as MSFT stock has weathered the storm pretty well, but is now below $100.Is it time to bounce?One of the biggest reasons I like Microsoft so much? It's vision. By that I mean the direction that CEO Satya Nadella has taken the company.Microsoft is aimed squarely at the cloud world, with its Azure platform growing sales by more than 90% for 10 straight quarters. The segment continues to crush it and as it makes up a larger and larger piece of the overall revenue pie, it will help accelerate overall revenue growth. This  , something we've seen come to fruition over the past few quarters.The cloud industry seemed to lose some of its luster last year, in my opinion. In late 2016 and early 2017, it wasn't driving big companies as much. Now, though, we've seen a resurgence of the cloud, as big companies see ballooning revenues from this still-young industry.Microsoft is among these companies and, conveniently, has one of the lowest valuations compared to its peers. In the large-cap cloud space there are names like  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).AMZN and CRM - the latter of which provides analytics for Google and Amazon - have really high valuations. BABA has a higher, but reasonable, valuation given its high growth rate. Its growth is superior to that of MSFT and that goes for both revenue and earnings. MSFT has a similar valuation to GOOGL on an earnings basis, despite the latter having better growth.As we branch out to include smaller companies like  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and others, the same remains true. While Microsoft may have an inferior growth profile, it's got a superior valuation. Further, in most cases, MSFT has a stronger balance sheet and higher dividend yield.At this point, it's worth mentioning that MSFT stock trades at about 25 times this year's earnings. That's roughly in-line with GOOGL. While MSFT has traded much better this year, choosing between the two would likely leave me siding with Google.In any regard, we don't  to settle for one or the other. The simple truth is that we can own both (and more) and these are two of the cheapest, biggest players in the cloud industry. In fact, Microsoft and Google Cloud are No. 2 and 3, respectively, just behind Amazon. If investors want exposure to the segment, these are some of the cheapest plays out there. It helps that they're high quality, blue-chip tech stocks.Click to EnlargeOver the past 12 months, MSFT stock has been in a pretty solid uptrend. In fact, the 100-day moving average has been an excellent proxy on when investors should buy the dip. In that regard, it reminds me of Salesforce, which has been a  .So, what do we have with MSFT stock? It's pretty clear and I don't want to overcomplicate it. Microsoft is a buy on a retest of its 100-day moving average, currently near $94.What happens if that level fails? Short-term traders can cut their losses and wait for a better setup, while longer term investors can consider adding near $88. Ironically, that's where the 200-day moving average comes into play, a level that MSFT hasn't touched since January 2017.Every trend eventually ends. I don't know if the trend is still our friend or if it's about to bend. But at this point, I have no reason to bet against it.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard (MA), VMware (VMW) and Sanofi (SNY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see Strong-Buy ranked  's shares have increased 59.3% over the last year, significantly outperforming the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry's gain of 36.3% during the same period. The Zacks analyst thinks the company is well placed for growth, given its solid market position, ongoing expansion and digital initiatives plus significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments.The buyouts of VocaLink and NuData Security complement the company's efforts to participate in new payment flows and enhance its safety and security offerings. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised upward over the last 60 days. However, escalating costs continue to bother. Also, higher incentives and rewards will put pressure on its bottom line.(You can  ).Shares of Buy-ranked  have gained +17.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Software industry which is up +16.9% over the same period. VMware reported impressive first-quarter fiscal 2019 results. Both earnings and revenues increased on a year-over-year basis. Strong top-line growth was primarily driven by robust performance from NSX and vSAN product line. Management provided strong guidance for fiscal 2019.The Zacks analyst likes the fact that VMware has been consistently taking initiatives to diversify its product portfolio to include most of the IT infrastructure. The company's dominance in SDDC along with expanding customer base in cloud driven by partnerships with the likes of IBM and AWS is positive.Moreover, continuing enterprise deal wins will drive growth in the long haul. However, heavy spending on R&D may weigh on its margins. Intensifying competition is also a concern.(You can  ). 's shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry year to date, declining -10.6% vs. -4.5%. Sanofi has several new products in its portfolio and candidates in its pipeline that can contribute to long-term growth.The Zacks analyst is particularly optimistic about sales prospects of Dupixent, which could prove to be an important growth driver. The acquisitions of Ablynx and Bioverativ have strengthened Sanofi's position in the rare blood disorders market. However, Sanofi's Diabetes franchise is under significant pressure with key product, Lantus facing increasing competitive pressure at the payor level and the presence of biosimilar competition in several European markets and Japan.Other headwinds include generic competition for many drugs and slower-than-expected uptake of new products like Praluent. Meanwhile, the performance of the Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare franchises has been soft lately. Nonetheless, Sanofi expects to return to growth in the second half of 2018.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Twitter (  ), Workday (WDAY) and State Street (STT).It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.Mark VickerySenior EditorPer the Zacks analyst, Twitter's video initiatives are boosting user growth rate and engagement levels. This is helping it to attract advertisers, which is driving top-line growth.Per the Zacks analyst, Workday's revenue growth continues to be driven by high demand for its HCM and financial management solutions. Also, its diversified product portfolio is a positive.Per the Zacks analyst, new business wins, synergies from GE Asset Management (GEAM) deal and rise in interest rates will aid State Street. However, mounting expenses remain a major near-term concern.Per the Zacks analyst, CIT Group's restructuring initiatives with an aim to become a leading national middle-market bank are commendable. Yet, worsening asset quality & rising expenses are concerns.Per the Zacks analyst, while Continental is set to thrive from its oil-rich resources in Bakken Shale play, high debt burden and rising production expenses will hurt its growth.The Zacks analyst likes the company's initiatives to reward its shareholders through dividend payments. Efforts to grow its fleet are also encouraging.DENTSPLY is likely to gain from CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems and orthodontic platforms.The Zacks analyst believes Murphy Oil's ongoing investment to develop and produce oil from low cost assets will boost its production and performance.Per the Zacks analyst, Ingersoll is focusing on improving the efficiencies and capabilities of products and services within its core businesses to boost margins and drive net asset value.Per the Zacks analyst, Ralph Lauren is expanding in underpenetrated markets with its highly productive new small-format stores. It targets generating $0.5 billion of sales from China in five years.Per the Zacks analyst, Itron's margin performance will be hurt by industry supply chain headwinds and pricing issues. Elevated expense due to restructuring activities also remains a woe.Per the Zacks analyst, profitability of Winnebago's Motorized business segment is under pressure due to manufacturing investments such as facilities at Junction City and Forest City.Per the Zacks analyst, rising expenses, mainly due to higher benefits and a change in reserves for future benefits plus interest and debt expense, will continue to restrict Unum's margin expansion.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new July 27th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $122.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $122.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $118.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $125.35/share today.Because the $122.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of WDAY stock at the current price level of $125.35/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $126.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.95% if the stock gets called away at the July 27th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if WDAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing WDAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $126.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $126.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

The stock's decline could simply be because the company didn't live up to higher investor expectations in light of the stock's sharp run-up this year.

We now have over 2,200 customers and our commitment to their success is demonstrated by our industry-leading 98% customer satisfaction rate and reference ability. Notable go-lives in Q1 included 21st Century Fox, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Limited, Ingram Micro, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, to name a few.Turning to Workday Financial Management, we continued to expand the depth and breadth of our cloud-based finance system and, in combination with Workday Prism Analytics, Workday Benchmarking, and Workday Planning, we are delivering a global solution that is essential for empowering business leaders. We saw continued momentum for our suite of applications in Q1, with new Workday Financial Management customers including Sprouts Farmers Market, Rivera, and RaceTrac Petroleum, one of the largest private companies in the U.S. We believe these wins, when combined with our momentum from fiscal 2018, demonstrate the growing traction of our financial management applications across medium and large companies.In fact, Gartner published its May 2018 Magic Quadrant for cloud core financial management suites for mid-size, large, and global enterprises and, once again, Gartner acknowledged Workday as a leader for cloud core financial management applications. This year, we are proud to be recognized by Gartner and achieving the furthest overall position for completeness of vision.As always, our key focus is bringing customers' live successfully. Among the many go-lives of Q1, I would like to highlight Aon, who became an HCM customer in 2013 and since that time has added additional products, including Workday Financial Management. Aon is now live on Financial Management in 28 countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and the U.S. A special kudos to their great effort and progress with their global deployments.I'd now like to spend a few minutes talking about innovation. As you know, innovation is a core value and part of our DNA at Workday. First, I'm pleased to share that Forbes recently named Workday No. 2 on its list of the World's 100 Most Innovative Companies. It's an honor to be recognized by Forbes and a testament to our customer-driven innovation.In Q1, I'm pleased to announce that in just three hours, we move all customers to Workday 30. With this release, we expanded our global foundation and industry-specific capabilities in Workday Financial Management and delivered a set of new employee experience features in Workday HCM. We also delivered against the roadmaps for Workday Prism Analytics by introducing data discovery capabilities. In addition, we introduced first Financials benchmarks and expanded our HR benchmarks through our data-to-service offering. We continue to deliver against our unique vision of bringing planning, transactions, and analytics into one unified cloud system.As we look forward to the rest of fiscal year '19 and beyond, we will continue our relentless focus on innovation and expect to see continued momentum from our growing family of applications.Switching to the people front, as you all know, we believe a key part of our success continues to be our vibrant company culture, which allows us to maintain high levels of employee satisfaction and greatly helps us attract and retain talent across all levels of the company. And we believe this investment in our people continues to pay off. We are once again recognized globally as one of the best workplaces by Great Place to Work Institute, ranking No. 1 in the UK, No. 2 in Ireland, our largest office outside the U.S., and No. 3 in Germany. A very special thank you to our employees who make these rankings possible. We are very proud that, even as we maintain our very fast pace of employee growth around the world, our company culture remains strong.All in all, this quarter was a strong start to our fiscal year. I will now turn it over to Co-President and CFO, Robynne Sisco. Over to you, Robynne. -- Thanks, Aneel, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel mentioned, we continue to execute well against our long-term market opportunity, differentiating ourselves through our technology and uniquely purposed customer success model. We are very pleased with our first quarter results, delivering total revenue of $619 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 29%.Our subscription revenue was $522 million, up 31%. Subscription revenue outperformance was primarily driven by solid net new ACV growth against a difficult comparison a year ago. Professional services revenue came in at $96.5 million, representing growth of 20%. We continue to see strong performance outside the U.S., with total revenue up 43% to $139 million, representing 22% of total revenue.Subscription revenue backlog was $5.2 billion, growth of 31%, also against a very difficult comparison period a year ago. Consistent with prior quarters, approximately two-thirds of the subscription revenue backlog balance will be recognized over the next two years.Our non-GAAP operating profit for the first quarter was $81 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 13.1%. This strength reflects strong top-line growth, record gross margins, and the benefit of overall spend being slightly lower than expected. We did not see any material impact from FX changes within the quarter.We achieved record high cash flow from operations of $184 million in Q1. Our trailing 12 month operating cash flow was also a record high at $470 million, up 28% year-over-year. Our trailing 12 month free cash flow was $310 million, up 24% year-over-year. Note that in calculating our trailing 12 month free cash flow, we have excluded $135 million related to our own real estate projects, as we consider these investments non-recurring in nature. As always, our cash flow results can vary with the timing of customer invoicing, as well as seasonal and varying spending patterns.Moving to the balance sheet, total unearned revenue at the end of Q1 grew 18% year-over-year to over $1.4 billion. As expected, current unearned revenue grew 22% to $1.32 billion, which was in line with the low-20s growth we discussed in our Q4 call. The corresponding sequential decline in current unearned revenue from Q4 is the expected result of our compounding seasonality, as Q1 continues to represent the smallest portion of our annual net new ACV.Non-current unearned revenue was down 21% year-over-year, consistent with the trend that started last year as we continue to see fewer customers electing to pay more than one year of ACV upfront.We continue to invest in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q1, we successfully added and integrated approximately 360 net new employees to Workday, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to almost 8,600.Operationally, we executed exceptionally well in the first quarter, delivering overperformance on both the top and bottom line. We're extremely pleased with our results and have gotten off to a great start for fiscal 2019.I'll now turn to guidance. Our focus remains centered on driving strong, sustainable growth and we will continue to prioritize both new customer acquisitions and long-term contract economics, which will likely result in continued quarter to quarter variability in some of our business metrics but which will serve us well in the long run.Based on our outperformance in Q1, but keeping in mind we still have difficult first half comps from last year, we are raising our fiscal 2019 outlook and providing Q2 guidance as follows. For subscription revenue, we're raising our full-year estimate to be in the range of $2.275 billion to $2.290 billion. We expect our Q2 subscription revenue to be $557 million to $559 million or 28% to 29% growth, with sequential improvement in Q3 and Q4 of approximately 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively. Similar to last year, this pattern reflects our increasing seasonal trends toward larger Q4s.We still expect Professional Services revenue to be approximately $405 million in fiscal 2019, as we continue to prioritize driving the highest levels of customer success above Professional Services revenue expansion. For Q2, we expect services revenue of $104 million.For non-GAAP operating margin, we now estimate Q2 to be in the range of 9% to 10%, and we still anticipate 12% margins for the full year, as we prioritize continued investment in our growing business over margin outperformance. The sequential decline in non-GAAP operating margin from Q1 reflects typical seasonality and is primarily the result of our annual employee compensation cycle, which took effect at the beginning of Q2.The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 24 percentage points in each remaining quarter and for the entire fiscal year.We still expect short-term unearned to follow the patter we laid out on our Q4 call. We also still expect strong operating cash flow growth of 30% for the year. As a reminder, Q2 traditionally generates limited operating cash flows. This is due to the combination of seasonally low collections and the seasonally high sequential increase in expenses resulting from our annual employee compensation cycle mentioned earlier.There is no change to our fiscal 2019 plans for capital expense for our development center project or other CapEx provided on our last call.And, finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners, and employees for their continued support and hard work. We are still in the early stages of executing against our long-term vision as a company but our progress wouldn't be possible without a shared goal. We are off to a great start and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.Operator, let's begin the Q&A process.And at this time, if you would like to ask a question, that is \"*1\" on your telephone keypad. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.Your first question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. -- Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just two quick ones. Maybe first for Robynne. I think at the end there, you just reiterated your current deferred guidance, which I think is high 20s for Q2. Can you just remind us why that steps up so much from what you just printed in Q1? And then I've got a quick follow-up for Aneel. -- Yeah, Justin. So we actually said mid-20s for Q2. And the reason it steps up is we do get a slight tailwind in Q2 from some of the contracts that we entered into a few years ago but have step-up payments. So that's the primary driver there. -- Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then, Aneel, I guess it seems like from the guidance, you guys are sort of implying that subscription revenue growth, at least if you look at the balance of the year, is pretty stable from what you just printed in Q1. And I'm just wondering, is that a reflection of Financial and some of these emerging products are sort of at a point where they're offsetting any potential slowdown in HCM? Or what gives you confidence around that stabilizing subscription growth? Thanks. -- I think we have a lot of growth factors. Financials, percent again year-over-year. And it continues to be now fairly healthy and becoming a more sizable business. And we've seen good uptake on Prism Analytics and Planning. And I'm very optimistic, probably not for the rest of this year, but I'm very optimistic about the Workday Cloud Platform going into next year. The demand continues to grow. We're beginning to do the pricing and packaging and I suspect it has the ability to be another booster for us going forward. So just a lot of irons in the fire in terms of continued growth. And then I'd say the last piece is the HCM business continues to be healthy. And, in particular, we are doing quite well outside the U.S. where the markets are probably two or three years behind, or maybe five years behind, in clouded options. So we're seeing that first wave of big companies moving to the cloud with Workday overseas and there's a lot more opportunity there. -- Got it. Thanks very much.Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. -- Thanks. One clarification question and then one broader question for perhaps Aneel. Did I hear right on the call you said that your new ACV did grow in Q1? Because it was sort of a stepdown in terms of billings growth always on Q1 versus what we had last year. So we don't have much visibility into what new ACVs look like but our back-ending of a little math would suggest that's not the case. But you did say new ACV growth grew in Q1.And then the broader question is just on sort of how machine learning is starting to impact the product portfolio. Are you starting to see people pick up some of that functionality? Is it starting to be more of a differentiator or more in use within a product functionality? And how is that impacting, if at all yet, how people are using the solutions today? -- We've had some machine learnings capabilities for now multiple years in areas like retention risk and talent scorecard and customer collections. I'd say the uptake is I think there's a lot of hype around machine learning. We're providing the technology for our customers to use. They're still getting comfortable with it. I think the tech vendors are out selling and marketing it probably ahead of where customers are in terms of using it. But it's picking up and it's definitely a differentiator because I think many customers have plans to use it in the next 12 to 18 months, once they get their data and processes in order. And a big part of that is getting clean data going forward. And in some cases, they're coming off of systems where they don't have clean data. So it takes a while to up-ramp it. -- And, Keith, on your first question, we did see net new ACV growth over Q1 of last year. So we're really pleased with the Q1 performance, particularly on a tough comparable. If you recall, in Q1 last year, we said we had our strongest net new ACV growth in almost three years. So a really difficult comp but we were still able to beat that for this current year. It's one of the reasons, frankly, that we wanted to give you guys some color around unearned balances and what we were seeing this year. Is because we did see, just with existing contracts, a lot of variation. So we thought that it was important that we share that with you. So the results that you're seeing are really due to the variation that we knew coming into the year on existing contracts. -- Thanks. That's super helpful. Thank you so much.Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC. -- Thanks so much. Maybe one for Robynne, just to clarify. You'd helped us last quarter with the unearned balance trend through this year and I guess you gave us the view on Q2 after Justin's question. Could you just remind us what we should expect in Q3 and Q4? And then, Aneel, I just had maybe one for you on international HCM. You made some comments on that and I was just curious, from a competitive standpoint, I'd love to get your views on how the two big incumbents stack up internationally. Thanks. -- So, Ross, on your unearned question, so what we said last quarter was, for Q2, mid-20s current unearned growth, which you should take as 25%. For Q3 and Q4, we said low-20s in current unearned growth, which is about 20% to 22%. -- Great.Your next question comes from -- -- Sorry. In terms of international HCM, I think I'll offer up a point of view and then I'll ask Chano to jump in. You know, over the last several years, the competitive win rates have remained pretty consistent. And we definitely see more of Oracle in the U.S. We see Oracle pretty much -- they're the competitor we see the most. We see SAP more in Europe and other parts than we do in the U.S. And maybe Chano can talk in more detail about what we're seeing competitively. -- Yeah. I think you're right, Aneel. Basically the opportunity there is fantastic. It's absolutely amazing and we're very pleased with some of the large new customers that we've been winning into the international markets. Win rates remain very strong. A little bit behind the U.S. but it's more a question of maturity. Clearly, as Aneel said, the difference is more that the stronger competitor there is potentially the Oracle one because of the higher in-store base. And as you know, we're just trying to gain this new business. We just really have to take the incumbents on legacies in place. But in the most mature markets, we have similar win rates as the U.S. ones. And the ones that we are more starting earlier, we are starting with really fractured customers in those markets and a few points behind as part of the maturity in terms of win ratios. But very strong ones. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Robynne, first for you. When you think about your pipeline and the potential seasonality for '19, does it strike you as any more or less backend-loaded than it has been historically? And how should we think about the progression of kind of subscription backlog through the year? And then one, just a quick follow-up for Aneel on the platform opportunity. -- Yeah, Alex, so with regard to seasonality, we have seen a trend of more backend-loaded years and we don't expect that to be any different this year. It is still early in the year. So we just finished our first quarter. It's our seasonally lowest first quarter so we really need to see how the year unfolds. But we do see that trend overall continuing.And then with regard to backlog, you'll see somewhat similar trends as last year. Flat from Q4 to Q1, which is what we predicted and which did occur. A slight uptick in Q2. Q3 will be flat-ish again and then we'll get a big jump in Q4 due to the seasonal high of that quarter. So fairly consistent with what you saw last year in terms of trending. -- Great. And then, Aneel, you mentioned some ramping excitement around the platform opportunity. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing from either your partners or existing customers that's driving that enthusiasm? -- Well, as much as we're trying to keep it out of the sales cycle, customers are excited about it and they want to talk about it. So we are showing our customers and prospects the evolution of the Workday Cloud Platform, where it was a year ago and where it is today. And we've made tremendous progress. I think where it's getting more exciting for me is, as we're working through the pricing models, they're gonna be very fair to the customers. Probably some combination of access fee and then a usage model. You can see how that scales into a nice business over time.I also think that there are good partners in our ecosystem. We've got a great partnership with Salesforce. There's some companies within the broader ecosystem that frankly are burning our compute cycles and we have somewhat of a free rider problem. This is not the indirect access issue. They're burning our computer cycles, our compute cycles, that we're paying for. And with the Workday Cloud Platform, we'll rework some of the partnership dynamics so at least it's a fairer model for us. As a system of record, we have so many different systems hitting our system and we just need to make sure that it's in the best interest of Workday, our customers, and our shareholders. -- Thanks, guys.Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital. -- Thanks for taking the question here. A question really around international Financial opportunity. With Aon now being live in 28 countries, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Financials opportunity, pipeline activity internationally, given Aon is now live in those 28 countries. -- Aon was a big milestone for us, to your point, for a complex global financial services company, proving out that Workday is a strong platform. And I think if you talk to the folks at Aon, they're very pleased with both the implementation and now their experience post going live. The first wave of larger financial services opportunities I think will still be in the U.S. U.S.-based multinationals. But we are beginning to see the pipeline emerge in markets that are natural markets, like the UK, like Australia, like Canada, which are more similar to the U.S. And over time, you'll see the large multinationals in the rest of the world emerge as well. But that's the pattern that we're seeing and I very much expect to continue to see over the next 12 to 18 months. I don't know if you want to add anything, Chano? -- No, I think you commented it all. Yeah. -- Very helpful. And then one quick follow-up for Robynne. Financials business growing north of 15% year-over-year again. As you think about the pipeline for the rest of the year, do you think the mix between kind of mid-market and larger Financial customers will be similar? Or as you think about growth there, sustainability of growth in Financials, what's that mix between large and mid-market gonna look like here, based on the pipeline so far? -- Yeah. So we're really pleased with what we're seeing in the pipeline in the large enterprise for Financials. The medium enterprise continues to be a great, steady run rate business for us. I expect the mix to move around a little bit, given the number of large deals we get in any given quarter. But, in general, I think it will slowly creep up into the large enterprise over time. -- Definitely on the dollar perspective. On the customer account, that's not really what drives our model. So definitely on the dollar side, you'll see it continue to trend more toward large enterprise. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. -- Hi. Thanks very much. First a numbers question for Robynne and then I had a product question for Aneel. On the numbers question, I just wanted to dig in a little bit to the seasonality of the business. Understanding that Q1 is a small quarter, seasonally quarter, etc., you'd think some of that would get picked up year-on-year. And the billings and bookings numbers were sub-10% by our calcs. Would you expect, triangulating what you said about deferred revenue current and the backlog, that bookings will actually accelerate on a year-on-year basis through the year? It looks like they should but I want to make sure that's right. -- Yeah. I mean, definitely we have a tougher compare in the first half than in the second half so we would expect to see that later this year. Having said that, it's early days so we'll need to see how the year unfolds. But I think you're looking at it in the right way. -- Thank you. And then, Aneel, we've been hearing some good things about Financials in the market. Sorry, the Planning product in the marketplace, both with respect to pulling forward the Financials business but also as a stand-alone. Are you seeing -- can you maybe walk us through in a little bit more detail what you're seeing there? Are you seeing more of a Trojan horse strategy around Planning plus Financials? And are you actually starting to see Planning deals outside of the Workday base or are they still largely in the base? Thanks. -- Well, we won't sell Planning stand-alone, at least not at this point in time. We will sell a subset of Financials with Planning that would include consolidation and reporting. But really the predominant model is Planning, either with HR or Planning either with Financials. And frankly it's a compelling application in both cases. In the HR side, we've had very significant uptake and interest on the workforce planning side. And in Financials, I'd argue Planning is the strategic application now for the CFO's office and it drives the execution system. I'd say the two strategic pieces are Planning and the analysis piece with Prism Analytics and those two together have definitely created a lot more interest in the Workday Financial suite. -- And I think, if I may add, Aneel, in many cases, we are seeing more and more of them together, which is a great opportunity just for the interest of our customers in Planning. Basically assumptions was also bringing third party data from other systems in combination with ours. So that's basically enhancing the opportunity going forward as we increase our customer base and the opportunity for selling through within them. -- That's terrific. Thank you.And your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Nice top-line growth. Aneel, I was curious to see, as you have the cohort of customers that signed contracts two to three years back that come up for renewals, what is the prospect for attaching new modules, such as Prism Analytics, Planning, and Financials, look like? And could that have a materially positive effect on the second half of this year or is still too early to talk about attach rate of new modules on existing contracts? Thank you. That's it for me. -- Okay. I'll take a crack at it and then I'll ask Chano to pipe in as well. I think just taking a step back, the most important thing to recognize is we now have 2,200 happy customers. And for really the first time in a concerted way, we're actually looking at selling back to those customers. And the renewal is just one moment in time to sell back. It tends to be a good one to add new modules. But Chano has put in place a strong customer base sales team so that we're engaging them more on those new modules rather than just renewal time, any time that they see an opportunity within an existing customer. -- Yeah, I would add that you've see that out of that loyal customer base, we have enjoyed good attach rates on more mature products. Like it could be recruiting, payroll, and tracking. We're seeing great growth, very high double-digit growth rates in areas like learning that have been out there for quite some time now. And we're experiencing the same but it's still earlier days. In Planning, not so early, and clearly high double-digit growth as well. And as well in areas like Prism, being a more newer product. So we're very excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. And if you look a few basically quarters forward, I would expect similar attach rates that we've been enjoying on the other solutions, as far as always managing to keep the customer focus and satisfaction that we've been doing. -- Got it. I'll save the other questions for next week. See you then. Bye-bye. -- Thank you.And your next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. -- Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Quick question for Robynne. Actually two questions. One on the gross margin, which hit a record here. I'm wondering if you still have room for more efficiency gains from these levels. And then the second question, I wanted to just follow-up. I think you mentioned in your introductory commentary that you didn't spend all the budget that you were planning for in Q1. And I was wondering if you could maybe just share with us what area of the business that you didn't fully advocate the spend in the quarter. -- Yeah. Brian, so where we came up slightly short on our expenses for the quarter was really in the timing of our hiring. So we didn't quite hire to plan. We do plan on catching up. Our focus is on investing back in the business, not on margin expansion, so it is our goal to actually reinvest any of our top-line overperformance and catch up on hiring and other spend.In terms of gross margin, if you look at subscription gross margin, we think there may be some opportunity there but we're at pretty high numbers, up at 87, which was our midterm goal. It will be a little lumpy just based on timing of capital spend and other such things. But we will continue to get total gross margin expansion just as the mix continues to shift more toward subscription versus professional services. So we do expect continued efficiencies based on the mix shift, for sure. -- Thank you.And your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. -- Yeah. Thanks very much and apologies for the background noise. But, Aneel, I was curious on the financial side if there are any verticals that you guys are -- I know you guys have a targeted approach to a select number of verticals. I was wondering, when you look at your pipeline and some of the enthusiasm from customers, if there are any verticals that are standing out to you right now? And maybe just start there. -- Sure. Not really much of a change here. I think anytime we put a vertical focus on selling, we tend to do well because we always back it up with product. So healthcare continues to do well for us. Financial services continues to do well. Our first industry foray was public sector with higher ed and state and local government. We had a series of very nice higher ed wins that we weren't allowed to disclose by name but they were prominent universities choosing our Financials. And then the last area, technology, I think with changes like 606 and other accounting changes, it just creates an impetus for people to look at changing their system. So really it's the world outside of manufacturing and supply chain. The services-based economy, they're all, at some point, gonna be upgrading their finance system and I think we're a good fit for those services-based companies. -- And if I could just ask one quick follow-up. Just when you look at the macro environment right now, which seems very healthy, has that changed the thought process at all from CFOs and executives around how fast they might want to move around taking financials to the cloud? Or is it still sort of a methodical approach to it from your point of view and no real change because of how the economy is doing broadly? Thanks. -- I'd love to say that we're big enough that we can look at the data and see economic trends and frankly I just don't think we're there yet. We're still driven by some big wins in a given quarter. I think frankly what's driving CFOs is more a focus on operational efficiency first and where the legacy systems are falling down. But more importantly now, moving toward analysis and prediction as to trying to get ahead of the curve with these faster and faster business cycles. And they are a conservative bunch, to be sure. And I think they have been more cautious than the HR or the sales worlds but they are coming around.And I think what people are realizing is that, look, if you're on the legacy system, those systems are not changing. The vendors that sell those legacy systems aren't adding new capabilities there. So those systems are falling behind and at some point you don't have a choice. And I think that's really what's changed the mindset of the CFO. It's now a matter of when, not if. And so they're looking for the capabilities that would give them business advantage rather than just updating the platform technology-wise. And that's why Planning and Prism Analytics have been so powerful for us.I don't really see it as them -- that has not come up in any of the sales cycles as being tied to the economy. Frankly, we did quite well during '08-'09 because we were viewed as a way to save money. So I didn't see it -- we didn't grow as fast but we still grew healthy during that economic downturn. So I'm not sure that we're super tied to macro cycles. But that's a good question.We will now take two more questions. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with RW Baird. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I basically have two questions. One would be, with regards to Financials, just coming off of the last comment that you just made in terms of the CFO attitudes, where would you say we are with regards to kind of the trajectory of Financials relative to HCM a few years ago? Do you think we are where we were four or five years ago, as it relates to HCM, when we're just looking at the trajectory of the Financials subscriptions, particularly with Aon having good success? -- You know, it's hard to unpack it because we're a much larger company now as well. So we have a much larger sales force. But if I were to guess, looking at all the data, in terms of adoption rates, I think we're probably five years behind where HR was in terms of adoption. And maybe even a year or two later. So when I go back to five, six years ago, cloud HR among large companies was beginning to take off. We had our first big customer was Flextronics in 2008. By 2011, 2012, it was becoming more mainstream and that's the time we went public in 2012. It feels about that in terms of the number of companies coming to market and the pace of growth of the pipeline, which bodes well. I've been saying about four or five years behind the last couple years, but the data has moved around quarter to quarter. I think now we've got trend lines that say it's probably five years behind and maybe slightly further behind outside the U.S. But it's growing nicely and now it's a consistent business, which is a big change in the last couple years. -- That sounds like it bodes really well, in terms of the seriousness of some of the proposals that are out there as it relates to the fourth quarter and basically the selling cycle for this year. -- I believe so. It's still early. It's Q1. Q1 on both HCM and Financials is rarely a quarter where you see the big Fortune 500 accounts close. We always have a -- -- No, I'm not talking about closing. I'm talking about the seriousness of the discussions in advance of that. -- Yeah. No, and I totally agree with you. The thing is we won't know if they were truly serious until the fourth quarter on some of these big ones. But I think they are. And the way that the pattern of the fourth quarter last year worked, those ended up being serious discussions and we had a wave of big companies join us. And I think, if anything, it's going to be better this year. -- That's great. And then just with regards to HCM internationally, can you just talk a little bit about how you would size that relative to the U.S. and if there's anything that we should take into account with regards to differences in terms of margins that we should expect? -- You know, the only data point I have is from a previous life at People Software. People Soft was not as global as SAP in that mid- to late-'90s time frame. I think it was 60/40 U.S. versus rest of the world on the HR side. I think it's reasonable to see us at 50/50 at some point in the not so distant future on the HR side and we're not anywhere close to that right now. Chano, you want to add anything to that? -- I think you're right on that assumption. That would be my expectation a few years from now. We are still opening, as you saw, quite significant markets. Markets like Italy, we just really entered this year. I mean, we clearly have kind of in excess of 300 already multinationals present there but really going into the market and making investments we had just done a couple of months ago. So that tells you that there are still key markets where we are still early. And clearly there lies a great opportunity ahead. Where we're looking in terms of pipeline today and growth and the terms of large, basically, customers and fractured companies talking to us is quite exciting and quite engaging and support a very growth factor going forward. -- Great. Thank you.And your last question comes from the line of Brad Rebak with Stifel. -- Great. Thanks very much. I'm not sure if I missed it. Did you guys provide the Financial Management and the Planning customer adds in the quarter? -- No, we did not this time. -- Is that something you can provide? -- No. I mean, we'll announce when we have significant milestones on that front but we don't intend to provide it at this time. -- Okay. And then, Robynne, on the headcount side, I think you grew about 25%, which was a little faster than any quarter last year. Was that meaningfully below plan or just modestly below plan? -- It was modestly below plan. We actually came into Q1 with a really good pipeline of candidates and really good momentum on the growth. So it was slightly below. -- Got it. Thanks very much.We thank you for your participation in today's earnings call. You may now disconnect and have a great day. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The buyout has strengthened its writing services with new tools, features and functionality. The all-cash transaction is valued at about $15 million. Chegg will likely make an additional payment of $5 million to key employees over the next three years, either in cash or stock, provided the key employees continue their employment.Founded in 2013, WriteLab is an artificial intelligence-enabled writing platform that teaches students grammar, sentence structure and writing style. It also offers instant feedback to support students in revising, editing and enhancing their writing skills.Chegg emphasized the need to develop strong writing skills, as it believes \"Nearly 75% of high school seniors are deficient in writing competencies,\" per Nathan Schultz, Chief Learning Officer at Chegg.The company has been making strategic investments in Chegg Services that are expected to drive its profitability in the upcoming periods. The rising popularity of online and on-demand human help for different courses at high school and college levels bodes well for Chegg.

This momentum also continued in the first quarter of 2018, as it achieved 37% year-over-year Chegg Services revenue improvement, banking on 44% subscriber growth. Management expects this momentum to continue further, as students are increasingly relying on Chegg for their educational needs. The latest addition of WriteLab is a classic example of this endeavor.Late last month, Chegg reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 1 cent per share, which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, increasing substantially from the prior-year quarter's loss of 3 cents. The upside can be attributed to increased investments in new subjects, content, formats and services.Net revenues of $76.9 million surpassed the consensus estimate of $74.4 million by 3.5% and rose 23% year over year. The uptrend was primarily backed by increase in Chegg Services revenues.Shares of Chegg have climbed 55% so far this year, faring much better than the  's 8.5% gain as we can see below:Currently, Chegg has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Twitter, Inc.  , Workday, Inc.  and AppFolio, Inc.  .

Cloud computing is now an essential focus for software-related companies, and cloud stocks have piqued the interest of many tech-focused investors.New technologies and changing consumer behavior have changed the shape of the technology landscape, and an industry that was once centered on the personal computer has adapted to survive in the world of mobile computing and the Cloud. The markets have been paying attention, and some of the best tech stocks have been those that are either primarily cloud-based companies, or those that have shown growth in their cloud operations.With this in mind, we've highlighted three stocks that are not only showing strong cloud-related activity, but also strong fundamental metrics. Check out these three cloud stocks to buy right now:AppFolio offers cloud-based software solutions for the property management and legal industries. The company's AppFolio Property Manager is a leading solution for property management, while its MyCase application is ideal for practitioners and small law firms. AppFolio has found consistent profitability, and investors have rewarded the stock with 66% gains over the past year.APPF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), as well as an \"A\" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The stock will hope to maintain its momentum with continued bottom-line expansion, with current consensus estimates projecting EP growth of 66% on net sales growth of 27% this year.Workday designs enterprise cloud applications for human resources and finance. It provides its customers-which fall in the tech, financial services, business services, healthcare, retail, and other industries-with the tools to manage critical business functions using industry-leading cloud solutions.WDAY is holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is another explosive growth pick. Based on current analyst estimates, we expect Workday to report EPS growth of 17% and revenue growth of 26% this fiscal year. Its valuation is stretched, but the stock also looks interesting from a momentum perspective, having gained more than 40% in the past year-including 6% over the trailing four weeks.Cloudera develops and distributes software for business data which include storage, access, management, analysis, security, search, processing and analysis applications. The stock sold off significantly after its latest earnings report, but analyst sentiment has rebounded and investors can now buy this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at a cheaper price.CLDR bounced strongly off its post-earnings low and has surged more than 12% over the past month. Still, the stock has plenty of room to run before testing its 52-week high. Investors should also note that full-year EPS estimates have improved, and bottom-line growth is now expected to come in at more than 13% in 2018.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! Hi everyone. Motley Fool Explorer Simon Erickson here at the Collision Conference in New Orleans. I'm joined by the Chief Technology Officer at Workday, Joe Korngiebel. Joe, thank you very much for joining us this afternoon. : My pleasure to be here. : You know, as you pointed out in your keynote earlier today, 90% of the world's data has come out in the last two years. We're in a Big Data society right now, but Workday has a 98% customer satisfaction score. This is clearly important to you guys to put people in the center of enterprise software, which is a differentiating factor. How does that mantra come into play as you're developing cloud-based tools? : Yeah, our customers are everything to us. When we keep our customers' thoughts in the forefront of everything we do. We treat them as design partners. We develop our software in collaboration with our customers. And that keeps people at the center of the enterprise for us. It keeps us thinking about employees, managers, executives, and how they can do the best work.We opened up our platform for them to do more. We feel like, if we make our software more personal, more contextual to what they're doing, get increasingly clever and smarter with all the technology that's around today, we win with our customers.And so we do that in a personal way by allowing them to configure their applications to meet their needs. They can brand the software to be exactly what they need it to look like for their employees. So it's an extension of their culture, extension of their business. We drive that personalization through everything we do.We also then look to try to make it increasingly clever so that they constantly are surprised by little things: forms automatically filling in for them. Little things like knowing how to navigate because they do that in their consumer world, and it's easy to navigate, easy to use. That equals a win for us at Workday. : And how do you use design thinking? Because you're talking to people at all levels of the organization, right? When you're developing these products, how do you kind of go about the steps of coming up with something new that's useful. : Design is fundamental to us. We say technology without design is useless. If people can't use the incredible technology that's at their fingertips now, it's useless. So we sit with customers and do incredible design thinking exercises. All the way from, \"Hey, what would you not do with this software?\" And then, \"What would you do with this software?\" Marry those together with prototypes. Do rapid prototyping to say, \"Hey, okay, now we've come away with an example that I think will work for you.\" And then, we take all of that and give it back to the customers in some ways.We just announced design.workday.com which is a way for us to take our platform and give it to our customers and the community so that they can experiment on these design thinking exercises we have. On the right things to do, on the wrong things to do, to make a meaningful experience for your users. And continue to iterate and change. By giving those tools to the customers, they can make it their own. And they can make software that really works for their entire population, up and down the organization. : So user experience, very important for Workday. Maybe 20 years ago, if we were talking about enterprise software, we might be talking more about proprietary software. You guys think very opposite from that, where it's more of an open, collaborative environment. We know that you're already working with Facebook. Just announced a partnership that you have with Slack. How does this new way of thinking driving the future of the workplace? And also how has Workday been a part of that? : We think we have a foundational user experience within our products. It's available on mobile, it's available on the web. Again, foundational to what we do. But we're not naive. In this day and age, new collaborative tools are coming up all over the place to make your business more productive. Whether it's Slack, whether it's Facebook, Google,  , there's incredible tools that we call your natural workspace, where you're naturally working. We want to make sure Workday's there for you.Much like your consumer world,  . Netflix is everywhere, right? Netflix is on the web. It's on my smart TV no matter what brand I buy. It's on my phone. It's everywhere. That experience comes to me.And we really feel like your business office should do the same. Whatever tools customers are using, whether that's Slack, Facebook. Name that tool, and we'll provide a great user experience for our users. The content will already be on it. : Context. Context is very important. And you wanna go to those natural workplaces where people are already using the apps. : That's correct.If you have the context around the greatest next hire for your business. How you're gonna reorganize to meet a really important project you're trying to staff, when you have the context of the business data behind you to make those decisions no matter where you are, you win. : So Joe, let me use this open partnership example to ask an open-ended question for you as well. Where do you see Workday going? How is this influencing the future of the workplace? You talked about kind of collaboration. You talked about people being at the center of this. What's the goals that you guys have for the workplace, five, 10 years out from here? : We really feel like we're in a new generation of enterprise software. Software that knows you like never before. And it can provide recommendations, predictions with the algorithms and what we're doing around AI and machine learning. To be able to provide people with more context than ever around their business. And if we do that in an intuitive way, with design at the front of what we're doing, the sky's the limit on how we can improve business. We can run businesses more efficiently than ever before. If your business is running smooth, because your users know where their people are, know how to empower their people to be the best versions of themselves, we feel like that's the future that we can always provide great context to and make it increasingly a better workday. : Joe Korngiebel, Chief Technology Officer of Workday.

The editor decided to book the profits ahead of the weekend, selling ULTA for about 11% and DKS for approximately 10% after just eight days in the portfolio. Read the full write-up for more. The portfolio replaced its 100% winner from yesterday by adding Zendesk (ZEN) today. Earnings estimates for this quarter have moved lower, but are on the rise for next quarter and the full year. In fact, expectations for the year have soared to a 5-cent profit from a 4-cent loss in just the past 60 days, while estimates for next year are on the rise as well. Brian Bolan believes that this software development company will double this year and continue to move higher next year as well. Read the full commentary for more info on this new addition.\"Volume was right around where it was all week after taking into account quad witch. To me, traders are waiting for what the Fed has to say next week, so we could continue to see some choppy trading until the middle of next week.\"I'm looking for the market to settle in early next week ahead of the Fed. That means volumes and volatility should remain low until Wednesday. After that, anything goes. The Feds language will be more important than the action.

Revenues of $430 million also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $433 million and declined 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.For fiscal third-quarter 2018, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $380--$420 million.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synaptic is likely to benefit from its diversification strategy. In the last reported quarter, consumer IoT business, which accounted for nearly 25% of total revenues, was a breather.Notably, the acquisitions of Conexant Systems and Multimedia Solutions Business of Marvell Technology Group are helping it expand its customer base.In the IoT space, AudioSmart, ImagingSmart and VideoSmart are gaining wide scale adoption. New design wins in IoT are expected to provide further impetus.Synaptics' focus on enhancing in-display fingerprint sensing, Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) and OLED DDIC portfolio will help it counter the growing headwinds. The company expects the introduction of chip-on-film to provide new growth opportunity.However, declining revenues from mobile and PC products continue to hurt. Significant weakness in the China smartphone market coupled with loss of share in Samsung Galaxy S9 devices is an overhang. The company anticipates a 3% sequential decline in mobile revenues in the soon-to-be reported quarter. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new June 8th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $119.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $119.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $116.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $125.59/share today.Because the $119.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 73%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of WDAY stock at the current price level of $125.59/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $128.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.82% if the stock gets called away at the June 8th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if WDAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing WDAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $128.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $128.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Shares have lost about 1.4% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is WDAY due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Workday delivered fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 28 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. The figure also improved on a year-over-year basis.Strong growth can primarily be attributed to 33% jump in revenues, which totaled $582.5 million. The figure surpassed the guidance of $538-$540 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $574 million. The robust top-line performance was driven by solid growth in subscription and professional revenues.Subscription revenues (84.1% of total revenues) surged 33.7% year over year to $490 million, driven by expanding customer base. The figure surpassed the guidance of $482-$484 million. Annual customer satisfaction rating was 98%.Professional services revenues (15.9% of total revenues) grew 26.7% from the year-ago quarter to $92.5 million and were better than the guidance of $89 million.Revenues outside the United States soared 53% to $131 million, representing a record 22% of total revenues in the quarter.During the quarter, Workday extended capabilities and tools in Workday HCM with new customer experience.Workday added 58 financial management customers, up 45% from the year-ago quarter.

This will enhance security and improve functionality of Workday's user interface.Workday also acquired SkipFlag during the quarter, marking another step in its efforts to invest in areas such as machine learning, advanced search and natural language processing.Gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 70.7%, primarily owing to favorable mix toward higher-margin subscription revenues.Product development expenses jumped 32.3% to $253.5 million. Sales and marketing expenses increased 17.2% to $179.6 million. General and administrative expenses climbed 11.8% to $59.8 million.The company reported non-GAAP operating profit of $55.5 million compared with $25.3 million in the year-ago quarter.

Current unearned revenues (that will be recognized over the next 12 months) were more than $1.4 billion, representing annual growth of 31.3%.Non-current unearned revenues declined 18% year over year as fewer customers opted for paying more than one year of subscription fees upfront.Subscription revenue backlog, which represents all future revenues from existing customer subscription contracts, both on and off-balance sheet was $5.2 billion, up 34.4% year over year.For first-quarter fiscal 2019, Workday expects subscription revenues in the range of $514-$516 million (up 29%), while professional services revenue expectation is $93 million (up 16%).Workday anticipates non-GAAP operating margin of 10-11%.For fiscal 2019, Workday expects subscription revenues in the range of $2.265 billion to $2.280 billion (up 27-28%), while professional services revenue expectation is $405 million (up 14%).The company now expects non-GAAP operating margin to be almost 12%.The company expects operating cash flow growth for fiscal 2019 to be roughly 30%, resulting in an operating cash flow margin of more than 22%.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

Among the largest underlying components of QTEC, in trading today Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY) is off about 0.1%, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Symbol: MXIM) is up about 1.3%, and Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (Symbol: SWKS) is up by about 0.2%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of QTEC, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, QTEC's low point in its 52 week range is $58.67 per share, with $83.4224 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $82.07. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Like  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and others,  (NASDAQ:  ) has been on fire. While the broader market is still trying to claw back from its early February losses, these cloud stocks have been hitting new all-time highs. Should we stick with Workday stock or look to ring the register?A few weeks ago, Workday beat on earnings per share and revenue expectations. Sales grew a whopping 32% year-over-year (YOY), while subscription revenue and its backlog also tallied YOY gains north of 30% for the quarter. This rate is working well for Workday, which also grew operating cash flow ~33% for the year. Impressively though, free-cash flow exploded 41% in fiscal 2018.There's clearly momentum in Workday's business and that's translating to momentum in WDAY stock. With that in mind, how high can Workday stock go?Since the company's earnings report, there have been several analyst re-ratings. A number of targets now rest between $120 and $140, with the average analyst price sitting at $128.27. Because of the stock's 7% rally since its earnings and 33% rally so far on the year, this target is actually about 5%  Workday's current stock price.However, there is a lone target up at $150, up about 10% from current levels. Can Workday stock rally to this point?Analyst Scott Berg from Needham was  by Workday's recent quarterly results. Specifically, his note cites the company's 34% increase in backlog orders, along with the 40% rise in billings. These results came despite the difficult YOY comps. Further, he says Workday could be at an \"inflection point of modern financials platform adoption.\"This should aid in further momentum to its business.As it stands, analysts expect revenue to grow about 25% in fiscal 2019 (this year) and 23% next year. So while this is a drop from fiscal 2018's results, Workday is expected to churn out another eight quarters (at least) of strong sales growth. While gross margins seem to be plateauing, operating and net margins are still climbing. So, as long as that remains the case for the next 24 months, Workday's bottom line should continue to swell.If its cash flow situation is any indication, that very well could be the case. That's likely one reason investors have been bidding the stock higher.On a GAAP basis, Workday is not yet profitable. On a non-GAAP basis, it is. Analysts are looking for 17.5% earnings growth this year and 36% the following year. For 2018, they expect earnings of $1.21 per share, meaning Workday stock trades at more than 100 times this year's earnings.Between a high valuation and  (NASDAQ:  )  readying a corporate training product of its own, investors may become worried about WDAY's future prospects. After all, Amazon Web Services is one of the biggest players in the cloud and that could negatively impact Workday moving forward.So, what do the charts say? While Workday stock may have the wind at its back, shares seem ripe for a pullback. From May 2017 through January, WDAY stock was trading within a rising channel. However, in February, shares broke out of this range and went on a steep rally.At the end of February, Workday stock pulled back and found support along the upper edge of this channel. That was a bullish move, as confirmed by the stock's 12% rally since.Click to EnlargeThe stock's MACD indicator, which measures momentum, looks to be losing steam (green circle). The RSI measures how overbought or oversold the stock is (blue circle). While the reading no longer supports an overbought reading, it could still unwind some more while WDAY stock pulls back or consolidates.Finally, a retest of the upper channel line should be in the cards. This level could quickly turn to trend-line support, which would be very bullish for Workday stock. Particularly if the rising 50-day moving average comes into play as well.So how do we play this? Look for a pullback in WDAY stock into the $126 to $130 area.For now, the trend is definitely higher despite its rich valuation and possible AMZN threat. Should the top of this channel hold as support, shares should continue higher and it will put Berg's $150 target in play as well.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he Nasdaq Composite Index staged a stunning comeback, recouping all losses incurred early last month when the index had slipped into a correction territory. In fact, it hit a record high for the second consecutive session and has been outperforming major indices, which are yet to fully recover from February's selloff, by a wide margin from a year-to-date look.The strength in the technology sector, which accounts for nearly half of the index, helped Nasdaq surge on a gain of 8.3% this year compared with gains of 1.4% for the Dow Jones and 3.2% for the S&P 500 (read:  ).The sharp gains came from the astounding surge in FAANG stocks and other high-performance technology names. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as big data, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as key catalysts.The twin tailwinds of Trump's tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are also pushing stocks higher. This is because tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates. Additionally, most of the tech companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies do not face any financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment.Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are boosting economically-sensitive growth sectors like technology, which perform typically well in a maturing economic cycle. With the global economy gathering momentum, technology companies are likely to outperform and are less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation.If these weren't enough, waves of consolidation among semiconductor manufacturers are driving tech stocks to new highs (read:  ).As a result,  , which serves as a proxy for the index, has climbed nearly 12% so far this year.

As the second-largest payroll-processing company in the country, it stands to benefit from a growing job market. PAYX stock has steadily increased in price since 2009.Now as the economy is sustaining higher levels of employment and job growth, Paychex appears poised for double-digit profit growth. Given the profit growth and the investor benefits the company offers, Paychex stock stands as the equity of choice for payroll services industry investors.PAYX is the nation's second-largest payroll provider, serving over 600,000 payroll clients. Only its peer  (NASDAQ:  ) processes more payroll checks.Both also face competition from  (NASDAQ:  ), a human and financial capital management software provider. However, its software package, Workday HCM, primarily works with larger companies with more data-intensive needs. PAYX designed the competing Paychex Flex product for the needs of small and medium-sized businesses.Industry trends look favorable for business at all levels. The job market is seeing 2.7% wage growth, slightly below where it had been in the past. Paychex CEO Marty Mucci said in a  that the economy is in a \"steady state of business formation\" and that job growth remains \"steady and sustainable.\" This positions PAYX profit levels to continue increasing.Paychex outperforms its larger archrival in every respect. PAYX stock has maintained a long track record of revenue and earnings growth rates that stand in the high single digits.Mr. Mucci believes profit growth could exceed 10% in future years.  back up this assertion. Contrast this with ADP which averages a little over 3% growth with revenue and about 4.5% per year in net income.Moreover, PAYX stock pays a higher dividend yield. The company announced that it will maintain its 50-cent-per-share dividend for the quarter. Paychex raised the quarterly dividend from 46 cents per share last July. At current prices, this takes the yield to 3.25%.The company has announced a dividend increase every July since 2014. Given this trend, investors will likely see another increase this coming July. While ADP has a longer track record of annual dividend increases, its dividend yield stands at just over 2.1%.Despite higher dividends and profit growth, PAYX stock trades at a lower price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Paychex's current PE stands at just over 24, compared with 29 for ADP.The forward PE looks even more compelling for PAYX. Expected profit growth brings PAYX's forward PE to about 21.8. WDAY stock, which tends to behave more like a tech equity, has no PE multiple since it currently operates at a loss. The estimated forward PE for WDAY stands at over 100 times earnings.The average forward PE in business services is about 22.5. This measure makes PAYX stock fractionally under fair value. While the stock would not be considered a \"bargain,\" it would be my choice if I wanted to invest in the payroll services industry. With job growth continuing and a large, increasing dividend, investors should enjoy a safe and sustainable level of profit in PAYX stock.A fair valuation, a high dividend, and continuing profit growth increases make PAYX stock the best in the payroll industry. ADP boasts a larger client base and also shares in the benefits of employment increases. Still, it sees lower rates of profit growth than PAYX.Paychex stock investors also enjoy the highest dividend yield in the payroll services industry. Despite the higher dividend returns, investors who take a position now will buy in at a lower PE than with ADP or WDAY.No stock bargains currently exist in the payroll industry. However, for those wanting to buy a payroll services equity now, PAYX stock stands as the clear choice.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking at  activity among components of the Russell 3000 index, there is noteworthy activity today in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), where a total volume of 251,306 contracts has been traded thus far today, a contract volume which is representative of approximately 25.1 million underlying shares (given that every 1 contract represents 100 underlying shares).

In fact, it hit a record high for the second consecutive session and has been outperforming major indices, which are yet to fully recover from February's selloff, by a wide margin from a year-to-date look. Source: ShutterstockThe strength in the technology sector, which accounts for nearly half of the index, helped Nasdaq surge on a gain of 8.3% this year compared with gains of 1.4% for the Dow Jones and 3.2% for the S&P 500.The sharp gains came from the astounding surge in FAANG stocks and other high-performance technology names. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as big data, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as key catalysts.The twin tailwinds of Trump's tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are also pushing stocks higher. This is because tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates. Additionally, most of the tech companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies do not face any financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment.Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are boosting economically-sensitive growth sectors like technology, which perform typically well in a maturing economic cycle. With the global economy gathering momentum, technology companies are likely to outperform and are less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation.If these weren't enough, waves of consolidation among semiconductor manufacturers are driving tech stocks to new highs.As a result,  (NASDAQ:  ), which serves as a proxy for the index, has climbed nearly 12% so far this year. Let's take a closer look at the fundamentals of QQQ.The  (NASDAQ:  ) provides exposure to 104 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq by tracking the Nasdaq-100 Index.

When paired with the company's current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) standing, investors should consider the stock as one that could be poised to top estimates.Investors should also note that Oracle has topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 7.49%.Oracle is set to report its Q3 fiscal 2018 earnings results after market close on Monday, March 19.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The figure surpassed the guidance of $538-$540 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $540 million. The robust top-line performance was driven by solid growth in subscription and professional revenues.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Workday expects revenues in the range of $538-$540 million.

The company is likely to record high fleet costs in both its segmentsThis is likely to result in lower earnings for the quarter.Avis Budget continues to face hurdles like high fleet costs and unfavorable currency headwinds. Evidently, the company's earnings for the earlier quarters were hurt by high fleet costs in both its segments and adverse currency movements in the International segment. During third-quarter 2017, average monthly per-unit fleet costs increased to $326 from $310 in the year-ago quarter. The trend is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well, hurting its bottom line.Operating in the vehicle rental industry, Avis Budget faces intense competition from other players, mainly on grounds of pricing. The company may lose rental volumes if it is unable to match up to industry pricing standards. On the other hand, an attempt to capture volumes by reducing prices may hurt its overall performance, in case of persistently high operating costs. Apart from this, pricing also depends a lot on the size of the rental fleets and supply of vehicles in the industry. If the company fails to adjust its rental fleet size in response to demand fluctuations, it may impact pricing and lead to loss of market share to competitors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Americas segment, which accounts for the bulk of total revenues, is currently pegged at $1,360 million, up from $1,343 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the International segment are anticipated to improve to $636 million from $536 million.

The company is likely to report lower revenues in Regulated Waste and Compliance Services segment that accounts for more than half of total revenues, due to stiff industry-wide competition.Whether this will lead to lower earnings in the to-be-reported quarter remains to be seen.Stericycle operates in a highly-competitive market. The barriers to entry into the regulated waste collection and disposal business and the pharmaceutical returns business are very low. Competitors also resort to aggressive pricing to gain market share. In the past, the company was forced to reduce prices for large-quantity account (hospitals, blood banks and pharmaceutical manufacturers) customers due to competitive pressure. This trend is likely to have continued this quarter as well.Moreover, the Healthcare Reform Act might have a material adverse effect in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, customers have also joined Group Purchasing Organizations and Integrated Delivery Networks to reduce costs through economies of scale. Changing regulations further impose new compliance requirements on Stericycle, alter its current method of doing business, and ultimately increase costs and compress margins. All these are likely to reduce the profitability of the company and impact earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Regulated Waste and Compliance Services segment revenues is currently pegged at $495 million, down from $512.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Manufacturing and Industrial Services segment are anticipated to decrease to $87 million from $96 million in the year-earlier quarter. However, revenues from the Secure Information Destruction Services segment are expected to be $204 million compared with reported revenues of $185.2 million in the year-earlier quarter. Total revenues are likely to decline to $881 million from $906 million reported in the prior-year period.A significant portion of Stericycle's growth was due to the successful integration of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will grow its market share and expand geographic base. However, the acquisition binge is leading to higher overheads and integration-related expenses, which are weighing on margins. A decline in the availability of potential acquisition candidates could adversely impact the company's growth rate. Furthermore, many acquisitions have lower gross margins and higher selling, general and administrative expenses that often negate the positives.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Stericycle is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

FTI Consulting's specialized skill sets are highly suitable for such requirements which are likely to boost its revenues.Moreover, the company has made significant investments in technology and made acquisitions in many high-growth segments which are likely to fuel its growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FTI Consulting's fourth-quarter revenues is $452 million, higher than reported revenues of $442 million in the prior-year quarter.The Corporate Finance & Restructuring segment is expected to generate $131 million which is higher than the revenues of $113.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The Forensic and Litigation Consulting segment is expected to generate $120 million, higher than the year-ago figure of $105.5 million. This rise is expected to be driven by higher demand for forensic accounting and advisory services, and construction solutions offerings.The Economic Consulting segment is expected to generate $114 million, a fall from the reported figure of $129.3 million in the prior-year quarter. This decline may be caused by a decreased demand for antitrust services in North America.

Shares have lost about 4.5% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Workday reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 24 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents. The figure was also better than 5 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.The strong growth was primarily attributed to 34.3% jump in revenues, which totaled $555.4 million. The figure surpassed the guidance of $538-$540 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $540 million. The robust top-line performance was driven by solid growth in subscription and professional revenues.Subscription revenues (82.7% of total revenues) soared 37.2% year over year to $463.6 million, driven by expanding customer base. The figure surpassed the guidance of $450-$452 million. Annual customer satisfaction rating was 98%, which was better than management's target of 95%.Professional services revenues (17.3% of total revenues) grew 21.4% from the year-ago quarter to $91.8 million and were better than the guidance of $88 million.Revenues outside the United States surged 48% to $116 million, representing a record 21% of total revenues in the quarter.During the quarter, companies like Lowe's Corporation, M&T Bank Corporation, Lloyds Bank plc, Software AG and Oshkosh Corporation selected Workday's HCM solution. Moreover, Dell USA, Coca-Cola Company and Cerner Corporation went live.Workday added 37 financial management customers, up more than 60% from the year-ago quarter. The clientele now includes Sanford Health, University of Louisiana and Melco Resort Services.Further, the company won 34 planning customers. Total planning customers on Workday's platform totals more than 200.Workday announced the availability of Workday Prism Analytics and Workday Benchmarking, the first offering delivered on Workday Data-as-a-Service, during the quarter.Management stated that Hitachi, Shelter Insurance and United Technologies Corporation have already selected Workday Prism Analytics solution.The company believes that these solutions will expand Workday's total addressable market (TAM) with each having more than $1 billion opportunity in revenues.Workday was placed in the Leaders quadrant of \"Magic Quadrant for Cloud Human Capital Management Suites for Midmarket and Large Enterprises\" by Gartner.Forrester Research also placed Workday as a leader in \"The Forrester Wave: SaaS Human Resource Management Systems, Q3 2017.\"Gross margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 74.1%, primarily due to favorable mix toward higher-margin subscription revenues.Product development jumped 32.3% to $176.7 million. Sales and marketing increased 18.8% to $150 million. General and administrative climbed 7.8% to $34.5 million.The company reported non-GAAP operating profit of $50.1 million compared with $8 million in the year-ago quarter.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $3.2 billion as of Oct 31, 2017.Operating cash flows were $144.0 million and free cash flows were $107.7 million.Unearned revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 21.5% from the year-ago quarter. Current unearned revenues (that will be recognized over the next 12 months) were more than $1.1 billion, representing annual growth of 27%.Non-current unearned revenues declined 18% year over year as fewer customers opted for paying more than one year of subscription fees upfront.Subscription revenue backlog, which represents all future revenues from existing customer subscription contracts, both on and off-balance sheet was $4.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and 37% year over year.Management observed slight decline in duration of contracts signed in the quarter compared with previous quarters. In the reported quarter, almost 91% of subscription revenues came from the backlog.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Workday expects revenues in the range of $538-$540 million. Subscription revenues are anticipated in the range of $482-$484 million (up 31-32%), while professional services revenue expectation is $89 million.Management expects annual contract value (ACV) in financials to surge more than 50% in the current quarter.Workday anticipates non-GAAP operating margin of 7-8%.Buoyed by the encouraging results, Workday raised its guidance for fiscal 2018. Revenues are projected in the range of $2.132-$2.134 billion, up from the previous range of $2.093-$2.1 billion. The revised guidance reflects growth of 35-36%.The company now expects non-GAAP operating margin to be almost 9.5%, up from the previous guidance of 8%.Additionally, Workday now projects subscription revenues between $1.78 billion and $1.782 billion compared with the prior guidance of $1.750 billion and $1.757 billion. Professional services revenues are anticipated to be about $352 million, up from $343 million in fiscal 2018.The company reiterated its operating cash flow guidance of $420 million for fiscal 2018.Management also provided a glimpse of fiscal 2019 expectations. Subscription revenues are projected at roughly $2.25 billion. For first quarter of 2019, subscription revenues are expected to increase 5%.Workday projects operating margin of 10% for fiscal 2019.Analysts were quiet during the last month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions. | Currently, Workday's stock has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a B.

Additionally, management sounded particularly upbeat about the demand they're witnessing in the company's financial products.Image source: Workday.Workday sells its software products (including support and updates) via subscription, so the majority of its revenue is subscription revenue. The beauty of Workday's business model is that subscription revenue is recurring in nature -- providing a reliable indicator of future revenue given the company's high customer satisfaction ratings (98% year-to-date).While Workday tracks several different revenue metrics, when asked about the best way to gauge the strength of the business, CEO Aneel Bhusri responded:For the quarter, subscription revenue grew even faster than overall revenue -- up 37.2% from last year -- and came in well ahead of the company's guidance. For the full year, Workday raised its subscription revenue outlook to a range of $1.780 billion to $1.782 billion, implying growth of 38% at the midpoint.However, in its initial guidance for next year, the company expects subscription revenue of $2.25 billion, representing roughly 26% year-over-year growth -- which would be a notable deceleration from this year's increase. That may explain why the stock has seen a minor sell-off following otherwise strong results reported in late November.Workday isn't yet profitable on a  basis, but the company's non-GAAP operating margin rose by 7.1 percentage points to 9% as revenue growth outpaced growth in expenses.On the conference call, Workday says it expects full-year non-GAAP operating margin of 9.5%, rising to 10% next year. There should be plenty of upside remaining in the years ahead as well, as CFO Robynne Cisco explained:However, the company hasn't provided any time frame for hitting those targets -- and profits will likely remain elusive for the foreseeable future. Cisco noted:While Workday's HCM offering is its largest by far, its financial management product is No. 2, and its contribution to Workday's overall results continues to grow. The company added 37 new financial management customers, up more than 60% from last year, and the company was clearly enthused about the prospects for more robust gains in the near-future.Bhusri talked about the trends Workday is seeing in the size of its financial customers:The company should also continue to benefit from an accelerating shift to cloud-based enterprise solutions. Bhusri stated:While Workday's subscription revenue growth remains an area to monitor closely, the company's improving margins and momentum with financial customers are two big positives as it heads into next year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's quite expensive when compared to historic norms, which is making it hard for die-hard stock pickers like me to find compelling opportunities.However, even in today's pricey market, I think I've found a wonderful stock to buy:  (NASDAQ: APPF) . This software-as-a-service provider is growing fast, well managed, and still has plenty of room to run. Here's why it's a stock that I'd be happy to pull the trigger on right now.Image source: Getty Images.AppFolio is a  business that focuses on the needs of small and medium-sized businesses. The company got its start by catering to the unique needs of property managers. To this day more than 90% of total revenue is still earned from its property management business.Why would a property manager choose to do business with AppFolio? The answer lies in the company's all-in-one, cloud-based solution. Once a customer gets setup they can manage all facets of their business with AppFolio's platform. This includes scores of mission-critical tasks like contracting, billing, collections, reporting, background check, tenant screening, and more. These features make it easy for property managers to keep their assets performing at the highest level possible.Image source: AppFolio.How does AppFolio  ? In three primary ways:While the company's property management software accounts for the lion's share of revenue, AppFolio also has a growing business that caters to the needs of small law firms. Called MyCase, this solution helps lawyers with tasks like secured file sharing, time tracking, billing, and more.Are AppFolio's services catching on? Here's a look at the company's customer count over the last few years:\n  \n*As of September 30, 2017. Data source: AppFolio.The growing customer count has allowed AppFolio's revenue to soar from $47 million in 2014 to an estimated $140 million to $141 million in 2017. That's a lightning-fast pace.And yet, as great as these numbers have been, there's still reason to believe that AppFolio's growth engine is just getting started. Management estimates that its market opportunity within the property management business exceeds  in the U.S. alone. You can tack on another $2 billion when adding in the opportunity ahead of MyCase.Many high-growth software companies are happy to sacrifice near-term profits for explosive user growth. While this growth-at-any-cost strategy can work out well for investors in some cases -- just take a look at a long-term chart of  , or  for proof -- running at a loss on purpose also greatly increases a company's risk profile.Thankfully, this isn't a trade AppFolio's management team has to contemplate anymore. AppFolio has been profitable for four quarters in a row, which suggests that the company has reached enough scale that it can invest for growth and still generate profits at the same time. That's an attractive combination that I believe helps to reduce the company's risk profile substantially.What's more, AppFolio also boasts a rock-solid balance sheet that has $64 million in cash and no debt. That's a war chest that gives this company plenty of financial firepowers to keep the growth pedal to the metal.Moving forward, AppFolio's profits should expand at a faster rate than revenue thanks to favorable  . Investors should applaud that fact.Another factor that makes AppFlolio a compelling long-term investment is its vibrant and engaged workforce. The company earns a strong 4.6 out of 5 stars on  , and CEO Jason Randall boasts a 100% approval rating. Given these numbers, perhaps it isn't surprising to see that AppFolio has won numerous awards, including best places to work and highest-rated CEO.I also like that AppFolio's founders -- Dr. Klaus Schauser and Jonathan Walker -- are still heavily involved with the business. They currently occupy the roles of chief strategist and chief technology officer, respectively.Image source: Getty Images.I'm a big believer that cultivating an energized workforce can do wonders for talent and customer retention rates in the long term. That bodes well for this company's continued success.Between its rock-solid business model, strong leadership team, wonderful financial statements, and huge growth opportunity ahead, AppFolio is a company I greatly admire. In fact, the biggest knock I have against AppFolio is that Wall Street has caught on to this company's growth story. Shares are currently trading at more than 10 times sales and more than 77 times next year's earnings estimates, both of which are pricy figures. If the company fails to deliver eye-popping growth numbers, then its shareholders could be in for a world of hurt.Despite the high price tag, I'd still think AppFolio is an attractive enough business to warrant a purchase today. In case you think those are empty words, you should know that I plan on  as soon as the Fool's trading rules allow.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Non-GAAP earnings of 70 cents per share and revenues of $9.63 billion comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents and $9.555 billion, respectively.Earnings increased 14.8% from the year-ago quarter. This was primarily driven by 6% (4% in constant currency) growth in revenues that was in line with the high end of management's guidance of 4-6%.Oracle's top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (15.9% of total revenue compared with 11.9% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 44% (43% in constant currency) to $1.52 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenues increased 9% (7% in constant currency) to $7.83 billion.We believe that the company's growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Shares were down 6.6% in after-hour trading following the results. The decline can be attributed to soft cloud outlook. Cloud revenues including Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are expected to grow between 21% and 25%, much lower than 44% reported by Oracle in the last quarter.Notably, Oracle's stock has gained 26.8% year to date, underperforming the rally of 39% of the  it belongs to. We believe that a slowdown in the cloud momentum can further drag down the stock price in fiscal 2018.Cloud SaaS revenues advanced a significant 54.9% (53% in constant currency) year over year to $1.123 billion. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues surged 20.7% (19% in constant currency) to $396 million.On-premise software revenues (65.5% of total revenues compared with 67.8% in the year-ago quarter) increased 2.9% (1% at constant currency) to $6.3 billion reflecting continued higher attachment rates of software support and renewal rates.Management stated that Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM soared 65%.Software license updates and product support revenues were almost $4.953 billion, up 4% (2% in constant currency). On a combined basis, on-premise support and SaaS revenues were up 9%.Total hardware revenues slipped 7% (down 9% at constant currency) year over year to $940 million. Services revenues increased 1% (flat at constant currency) to $856 million.Cloud Software as a service margin came in at 66% as compared with 59% reported in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 160 basis points (bps) to 56.4%. The decline can primarily be attributed to lower hardware and research & development expenses, which were down 9.1% and 2.3%, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 200 bps from the year-ago quarter to 44%.As of Nov 30, 2017, Oracle had cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $71.58 billion, up $66.89 billion sequentially. Operating cash flow during the quarter was $14.58 billion, while free cash flow was $12.54 billion.Oracle increased the share repurchase authorization program by $12 billion. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share, payable on Jan 24, 2018.For the third-quarter, total revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 2-4%.Earnings are anticipated to be between 68 cents and 70 cents for the quarter, with a positive impact of couple of cents from favorable currency tailwind. The high-end of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, which was pegged at 72 cents.The company provided encouraging second-quarter results, with both the top and bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, year-over-year comparisons on both counts were favourable.Oracle is benefiting from significant momentum in its SaaS and PaaS offerings. This has also helped in improving the company's competitive position against salesforce.com and Workday  . We believe that the company's growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth. This is further evident from the expanding customer base.Going forward, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is a key catalyst. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle's competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\").However, higher investments on IaaS will affect gross margin expansion in the near term. Further, a strong U.S. dollar remains a headwind.Currently, Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked technology stocks worth considering are NVIDIA Corporation  and Intel Corporation  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .NVIDIA and Intel have a long-term EPS growth rate of 10.3% and 8.4%, respectively.A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 34 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Workday Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $70.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $134.00. The standard deviation is $14.688.But the whole reason to look at the  WDAY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with WDAY crossing above that average target price of $108.45/share, investors in WDAY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $108.45 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Workday Inc:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell. This article used  .  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NASDAQ:  ) recently suffered a big loss, falling from $117 to $95 over just a few days. Unfortunately for WDAY stock, the company reported mixed earnings in the midst of a market rotation out of tech. That added fuel to the fire in WDAY's 18% decline. Source: Workday Was the fall unwarranted or is the stock's bounce only temporary?There are a lot of good things going on with WDAY stock. For starters, the company is edging closer to profitability. Gross margins continue to head in the right direction, registering about 70%. This figure has continually been moving from the lower left to the upper right. On a trailing basis, gross margins are at their highest point ever. So, that's good.Free-cash flow () is also moving in the right direction. On a trailing basis, the $310 million in FCF is roughly quadruple where it stood two years ago. Even though WDAY is not yet profitable, it's good to see positive FCF. That tells us the business is solid.More good news? Workday put together its fifth consecutive earnings and revenue beat. Last quarter, sales climbed more than 40% year-over-year. Fourth-quarter and current full-year (fiscal 2018) guidance came in ahead of expectations too. At the midpoint, management expects revenue of $572 million and $2.133 billion, respectively. That's ahead of analysts' forecasts calling for $557 million and $2.1 billion.That's a lot of good news, so what took the stock down? Billings growth, which many use as an indicator for future revenue growth. Billings growth came in at just 25% last quarter, below Street estimates.It's not just the quarter, though. Guidance for FY 2019 (next year) pegs subscription billings at $2.25 billion. And even though it bumped its full-year subscription billings revenue to $1.781 billion for FY 2018, that represents \"just\" 26% growth YOY.While that's no small bump, we're seeing a somewhat concerning slowdown in billings. For instance, each quarter this year has a lower YOY growth rate. That wouldn't be an issue necessarily, if not for the valuation. While WDAY stock is not an earnings story (yet) it trades at 90 times forward earnings estimates. Further, Workday stock trades at 11 times sales.For that price, we can't have WDAY's growth rates deteriorating so quickly.Looking at the chart, we see that WDAY stock has quickly (and forcibly) cut through its trend-line support. This level (now near $105) had continually served as the spring that sent WDAY stock higher on each decline since its mid-May breakout. The latest decline even sent Workday stock below its 200-day moving average.Click to EnlargeIt was a damaging move, no doubt. The bounce back from $95 to $105 has been impressive, though. My concern is, can it last? While Workday initially gapped above this level on Dec. 8, it's struggling to hold on. A close back below trend-line support would be bad news. If that's the case, a retest of the 200-day MA and possibly its recent lows are certainly on the table.Workday has a threatening, but not-yet-toxic chart. Its growth is slowing, but its business is great. So, what do we make of this company?WDAY stock is not cheap, nor has it ever been. But it's FCF-positive (a huge thumbs-up in my mind) and its gross margins are trending higher. Operating margins are heading higher as well. Given that more than 80% of the company's revenue is subscription-based means that, as Workday continues to add sales, it should continue to build its list of repaying clients.That's an excellent business and it helps explain why FCF is moving higher. That said, the revenue growth engine is starting to show signs of slowing and that's not great news for a company that trades with this high of a valuation. For as great of a company as Workday is - and it's excellent one indeed - everything has a price.If Workday stock fails to get back above trend-line support, wait for further consolidation at lower prices. For those that want to take a stab at it, do so if it reclaims this level of support. A stop-loss close to this level or at the 200-day MA can be used for those who want to give it more leeway.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Pepsico Annoucement on MarketSite Tower in Times SquareAs the year draws to a close, Nasdaq has not only completed its fourth straight year of capturing the most listings transfers by market cap of any U.S. exchange, but we've also celebrated a significant milestone by surpassing over $1 trillion in total market cap that has elected to move to our market following a listings review. Global food and beverage leader PepsiCo (  ) is the most recent company to announce its plans to move to Nasdaq from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Not only are PepsiCo's products enjoyed by consumers one billion times a day in more than 200 countries worldwide, but the $166B market cap company is also truly innovating their business. They are committed to  - focusing on transforming their business toward nutritious products, limiting their environmental footprint, and empowering people and communities where they do business.Last week, Principal Financial Group (  ), a global investment management company with a $20 billion market cap, also announced its intent to transfer to Nasdaq.

Notably, many companies can benefit from our more predictable all-inclusive fee structure that aligns with the growth and success of their businesses. The single annual fee includes all the ordinary costs of listing for the calendar year, as well as events such as secondary offerings and stock splits. In contrast, listed companies on other U.S. exchanges can experience an average of $21,000 2 in fees for these events during the year.Our partnership with our listed companies extends beyond the many listings benefits we provide, as we are also a relentless advocate for all public companies and the capital markets. In May we launched our  ; and we remain laser-focused on sparking debate, dialogue and action to move the needle in addressing the challenges public companies face today.PepsiCo and Principal will join other new listings from the financial sector in the last several months, including HR and financial management software vendor Workday (  ) and commercial real estate company Brookfield Property Partners (  ).

Additionally, increased spending for the transition negatively impacts margins.Oracle stock has gained 25.9% year to date, underperforming the 31.8% rally of the  it belongs to.Oracle's next-generation autonomous database, which is supported by machine learning, is a key catalyst. Among infrastructure, DBMS is expected to record strong growth driven by Big Data and digitalization initiatives. We believe that Oracle's leading position in the DBMS software market will make it the primary beneficiary of this increased spending.Moreover, Oracle is gaining from a significant momentum of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. It is winning market share against salesforce.com  and Workday  , which is a significant growth driver. We believe the company's growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future. | Both its software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products are anticipated to witness robust growth over the next few years as enterprises increasingly transition to the cloud. According to an IDC market report, SaaS will remain the dominant cloud computing type, capturing nearly two thirds of all public cloud spending in 2017 and roughly 60% in 2020. To tap this massive opportunity, Oracle introduced a number of Cloud Platform services in the last few quarters that will not only help personalize SaaS applications, which are currently in demand but also support easy migration of on-premise applications to Oracle Cloud.However, the late revenue recognition from a SaaS based business model will be a drag on the top line. Moreover, additional spending on PaaS and IaaS will keep margins under pressure in the near term.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Monday, shares of Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.9, after changing hands as low as $97.49 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 75.1. A bullish investor could look at WDAY's 29.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

The company expects the deal to be wrapped up in the first half of 2018. The completion of the buyout offer is subject to fulfilment of customary closing conditions.Aconex is an Australia-based company which makes cloud-based software to build construction projects to collaborate and share documents. The company has more than 70,000 customers and its cloud-based software has been used in 70 countries on 16,000 projects.If completed, the deal will provide an end-to-end cloud-based project management solution that would enable customers to successfully plan, build, and operate construction projects.According to the press release of Oracle, the deal is worth A$7.80 per share, representing a 47% premium over Aconex's Friday closing price of A$5.29 per share. Moreover, Aconex shares went up 44%, yesterday, following the news.In addition to Aconex, Oracle has also acquired companies such as Texture, Opower and Primavera to increase competitiveness in the cloud market.Mike Sicilia, SVP and GM, Construction and Engineering Global Business Unit of Oracle said, \"With the addition of Aconex, we significantly advance our vision of offering the most comprehensive cloud-based project management solution for this $14 trillion industry.\"Shares of Oracle were down 3.7% yesterday, attributed mainly to soft cloud outlook. Notably, the company's stock has gained 27.6% year to date, underperforming the rally of 40% of the  it belongs to. We believe that a slowdown in the cloud momentum can further drag down the stock price in fiscal 2018.Hence, Oracle has been resorting to acquisitions in order to step up its shift to the cloud. In doing so it acquired NetSuite Inc. in a deal valued at approximately $9.3 billion, or $109 per share last year.Oracle is benefiting from significant momentum in its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings. This has also helped in improving the company's competitive position against salesforce.com and Workday  . We believe that the company's growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth. This is further evident from the expanding customer base.Going forward, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is a key catalyst. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle's competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\").However, higher investments on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) will affect gross margin expansion in the near term.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have underperformed the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry since the beginning of the year, (+9.7% vs. +13%). However, Coca-Cola enjoys solid long-term fundamentals given its worldwide reach, strong brand power, higher international presence and impressive cash position.Although the top line needs to show sustained improvement, the Zacks analyst likes the company's strategic efforts toward creating the portfolio of a total beverage company with improved marketing and innovation, focus on driving revenues by improved price/mix, digital focus, and productivity initiatives toward driving margins. Moreover, Coca-Cola's transformative global re-franchising initiatives will lead to better margins and returns as well as superior growth, despite hurting sales/profits in the near term.Also, Coca-Cola's new revenue platforms should drive growth over the long term. However, challenging  conditions, weak CSD volumes and currency and structural headwinds remain challenges.(You can  ).Shares of  have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry in the year to date period, increasing +32.3% vs. a -4.0% decline. With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell's diversified business portfolio has the potential to earn consistent above-average returns and mitigate operating risks through a balanced organic and inorganic model.The Zacks analyst likes the company's diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and conservative balance sheet. However, adverse foreign currency translations, high R&D expenses and volatility in commodity prices are likely to peg back its growth momentum to some extent.Although the company's proactive restructuring initiatives have positioned it to navigate better than many of its peers, it has yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets. A change in the U.S. government's defense and aerospace funding could also adversely impact sales of the Aerospace business.(You can  ). 's shares have gained +15.5% year to date, in line with the Zacks Property, Casualty and Title industry. The Zacks analyst thinks Chubb stands a good chance of taking leadership in the P&C space, benefiting from compelling products and services. Its inorganic growth story is impressive, helping it achieve higher long-term ROE.Investment results are exhibiting improvement owing to improving rate environment. A strong capital position helps Chubb boost in shareholders' value and invest in strategic initiatives to drive growth. Notably, it is on track to achieve annual run-rate integration-related savings of $875 million (up from $800 million guided earlier) by the end of 2018.However, exposure to cat loss and escalating expenses raise concerns for Chubb.

(NASDAQ: WDAY)Q3 2018 Nov. 29, 2017, Welcome to Workday's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 . At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question and answer session toward the end of the conference. With that, I will hand it over to Mike Magaro, Vice President of Investor Relations. -- Welcome to Workday's third quarter fiscal 2018 . On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri, our CEO; Robynne Sisco, our CFO; and Chano Fernandez, our EVP of Global Field Operations. Following Aneel and Robynne's prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after the close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast.Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements, regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations, and other matters.

Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2017.With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. -- Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter . I'm pleased to report that Workday had another strong quarter. As we highlighted at our Analyst Day in October, we believe we are still in the early stages of the transition to the cloud for HCM and financial management applications. As a company, our focus continues to be on driving innovation and customer satisfaction as we continue to broaden our portfolio of offerings.In Q3, we saw healthy demand across all product areas and geographies. On the HCM front, we added great new customers, including Lowe's Corporation, M&T Bank Corporation, Lloyds Bank PLC, Software AG, and Oshkosh Corporation. Consistent with past quarters, more than 70% of our customers are in production. A few of the notable go-lives included Dell USA, Coca-Cola Company, and Cerner Corporation.We also continue to see strong traction for our financial management suite of applications. In Q3, we added 37 new financial management customers, up over 60% from last year. Some of the new financial customers include Sanford Health, University of Louisiana, and Melco Resort Services. In addition to the strength of our core financials offering, we also added another 34 planning customers, bringing our total number of planning customers to over 200. As importantly, we continue to deliver on our commitment of getting customers live and successful. Some of the key goal lives for the quarter include Union Group, Acura Corporation, and University of Miami.Our momentum in customer success was most recently seen at our annual user conference, Workday Rising, which took place last month in Chicago. We had more than 8,500 attendees, including almost 5,500 customers, representing over 1,200 organizations. Additionally, we had over 650 perspective customers representing 270 organizations, our largest perspective customer participation at Workday Rising in the history of the company.At the conference, we also revealed our annual customer satisfaction rating, which came in at 98%. Just two weeks ago, we had a similarly positive user conference in Barcelona for our European customers and prospects. We continue to believe that our relentless focus on customer success is a unique differentiator in our marketplace and is a major reason for the continued growth of our customer base across the globe.One of the keys to our high customer satisfaction is our continuous innovation cycle, which brings new capabilities to our customers on a frequent basis. During the quarter, we were pleased to introduce Workday 29, highlighted by the general availability of Workday Prism Analytics and Workday Data-as-a-Service.Workday Prism Analytics brings together all of the data and the business analytics needed to make critical financial, people, and business decisions and enables customers to incorporate non-Workday data as part of the Workday reports, dashboards, and scorecards. I'm excited to share that Hitachi, Shelter Insurance, and United Technologies Corporation are some early adopters of this leading-edge solution.On the Data-as-a-Service front, we introduced our first offering, Workday Benchmarking, which provides key metrics to our customers to help them better understand their company's relative performance in comparison to peers and achieve optimal performance in their respective markets. This solution is offered on an opt-in basis and has the potential to leverage the data cross 1,900 global organizations and over 26 million workers.Switching to the people front, a key part of our success continues to be our company culture, which enables us to have very high employee satisfaction scores and greatly helps us to attract new talent across all levels of the company. In the past 12 months, we've had particular focus on bringing in senior talent into our Worldwide Field Operations organization, that is led by Chano.I am pleased to report on our newest addition to the senior management team of the company, John Schweitzer. John joined us a few weeks ago as Senior Vice President of Sales and is responsible for sales and field operations for the North America region. John brings strong senior executive sales experience and a reputation for building great teams to Workday and has a strong track record of success in both emerging and large enterprise applications companies.As we look forward to Q4, next year and beyond, we are confident that we are well positioned for continued growth in all of our markets. As a peer cloud vendor, our technology advantages, such as in-memory computing and true multitenancy, continue to serve us well and enable us to build differentiated solutions for our customers. As a result, we have firmly established ourselves in a leadership position for HCM, where we continued to have an unparalleled combination of product capabilities, technology scalability, and customer reference-ability and expect to continue to grow our business and market share in this category in the years to come.On the financial management front, we are increasingly being viewed by analysts as one of two leaders in the space as the market begins to transition from on-premise to cloud solutions. The market shift is well under way in the medium enterprise segment of the market and is beginning to emerge in the large enterprise segment as well.Lastly, in 2017, we have laid the foundation for future growth for many years to come. While our HCM and financial management suites will continue to be the primary drivers of growth in the near term, the introduction of Workday Prism Analytics and Workday Cloud Platform sets the stage for Workday to expand our total addressable market and become a more strategic supplier to our customers, with both initiatives representing billion-dollar-plus revenue opportunities.With that, I will now turn it over to Robynne. -- Thanks, Aneel, and good afternoon everyone. As Aneel mentioned, our third quarter is an exciting time of the year as we host our US Workday Rising event. It's always great to meet our amazing innovative customers and be able to speak with new prospects looking to transform their business with Workday. Rising is also when we hosted our Analyst Day, and it was great to see so many of our analysts and investors in attendance. We appreciate all of the support and interest in our company.Let me start with our results from the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We delivered another strong quarter with total revenue of $555 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 34%. Our Q3 subscription revenue was $464 million, up 37%. Our subscription revenue outperformance was driven by net new customer growth, solid addon sales and high renewal rates with existing customers, and a continuation of the improve in quarter linearity we've seen this year. Our Q3 professional services revenue grew 21% to $92 million.As we highlighted at our recent Analyst Day, we are continuing to invest in global expansion as we believe international markets provide significant future growth opportunities for Workday. In our third quarter, total revenue outside the US was up 48% to $116 million, representing a record 21% of total revenue. Non-GAAP gross margins for the third quarter rose to 74.1%, primarily as a result of the continued mix shift toward subscription revenue.Our non-GAAP operating profit for the third quarter was $50 million, an operating margin of 9%. We did not see any material impact from FX changes within the quarter. Our relentless focus on customer success continues to drive our business forward. High customer satisfaction drives strong renewal rates, customer reference ability, and add-on sales, which support both long-term growth and profitability. We believe we are unique in our customer-centric approach and have a differentiated long-term model as a result.Total unearned revenue at the end of Q3 grew 21% year-over-year to over $1.2 billion. Current unearned revenue, which will be recognized over the next 12 months, was over $1.1 billion, representing annual growth of 27%.Consistent with our communication last quarter, noncurrent unearned revenue was down 18% year-over-year due to fewer customers paying more than one year of subscription fees upfront. The amount of the decline in the quarter was less than we had anticipated as we saw cash upfront trend up a little in Q3.When looking at trends in unearned revenue, both short and long-term, please keep in mind that balances in any given quarter are impacted by increasing seasonality as well as variability in the timing of renewals, net new opportunities, and contractual billing terms.Our subscription revenue backlog, which represents all future revenue for existing customer subscription contracts, both on and off-balance sheet, was $4.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Approximately two-thirds of the backlog reis expected to be recognized within the next two years, with a remaining balance to be recognized thereafter. As I've mentioned before, one of the factors impacting this number is the duration of contracts signed in the quarter.During the Q3, we saw a marginal decrease in duration from previous quarters. Duration is generally a product of deal size and customer preference and may vary quarter-to-quarter. In Q3, $421 million of our $464 million of subscription revenue, or 91%, came from the balance sheet. This is consistent with Q3 of last year, where 91% also came from the balance sheet.Our biggest investment continues to be in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q3, we successfully added and integrated 500 net new employees, bringing our total work force at the end of the quarter to almost 7,900.Cash flow from operations was $144 million in Q3 and our trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $449 million, up 32% year-over-year. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $311 million, up 49% year-over-year.During the quarter, we also issued 1.1 billion of 25-basis-point coupon convertible senior notes due in 2022, resulting in our ending the quarter with over $3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalent, and marketable securities. This positions us well to settle our convertible notes previously issued in 2013, continue to invest in long-term growth, and maintain financial flexibility for strategic investments and opportunistic M&A.Operationally, we continue to execute exceptionally well as we head into the fourth quarter, our seasonally strongest. The continued strength in our business is allowing us to raise our fiscal 2018 outlook as follows: For subscription revenue, we're raising our full-year estimate to be in the range of $1.78-1.782 billion, or growth of 38%. We expect our Q4 subscription revenue to be $482-484 million, or 31-32% growth. As we've mentioned previously, the year-over-year growth in Q4 reflects tough comparisons as we lap the subscription revenue growth acceleration we experienced in Q4 of last year.We expect professional services revenue of approximately $352 million in fiscal 2018 and $89 million in Q4. We, therefore, estimate the total revenue for fiscal 2018 will be $2.132-2.134 billion, or a growth of 35-36%, with Q4 total revenue in the range of $571-573 million, or growth of 30%.For non-GAAP operating margins, we are expecting approximately 9.5% for the full year and 7-8% for Q4. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 23-24 percentage points in Q4 and for the entire fiscal year.We are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance of $420 million, but anticipate there might be some upside to that number, depending on Q4 linearity, timing of collections, and invoicing terms on new contracts.In terms of our fiscal 2008 (sic) capital expense of our owned real estate projects, we are forecasting $130 million for the year, down from our previous guidance of $150 million. For all other CapEx, we are maintaining our previous forecast of $160 million.As we discussed at our Analyst Day in October, we remain committed to measured incremental non-GAAP margin improvement with an intermediate term target of 20% while establishing a new long-term target of 25%.While we are early in our fiscal 2019 planning cycle, and still have an important Q4 to close, we'd like to provide a preliminary and high-level view of fiscal 2019. We remain confident in our ability to sustain strong long-term revenue growth, given the secular market trends toward cloud adoption and our established leadership position.The strength we have seen in our topline growth to date in fiscal 2018 has been driven by three primary factors. First, acceleration of cloud adoption, especially in the large enterprise market. Second, continued high customer satisfaction, resulting in strong renewals and upsell opportunities. And third, improved linearity resulting in more revenue recognized on deals signed within the year and the quarter.As we plan for next year, we expect to maintain similar linearity to FY18. With that as context, we are currently planning for FY19 subscription revenue of approximately $2.25 billion. We continue to expect pronounced seasonality toward Q4 with our Q1 being the seasonally slowest in terms of net new bookings. We expect subscription revenue in Q1 of FY19 to grow approximately 5% sequential from Q4.We continue to prioritize growth and have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in product this year and beyond that will limit the pace of margin expansion in FY19. With that investment context, we're currently planning for FY19 non-GAAP operating margins of 10%. In addition, as we communicated at our Analyst Day, we expect operating cash flow margin to return to historical highs.I'll close by again thanking our amazing customers, partners, and employees for their continued support and hard work. We will continue to focus on our customer success, driving continuous innovation, and look toward closing out the year with strong momentum....Operator, let's begin the Q&A process.[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Murphy of JP Morgan. -- Yes, thank you very much and congratulations on a strong result. You commented on the linearity. I wanted to ask you, has the linearity of bookings actually continued to improve versus what you saw in the first half? Would you expect that to continue into Q4, just considering that you had that anomalous air pocket you encountered in the month of November last year? -- Hi, Mark. Yeah, we've actually experienced fairly consistent linearity this year, significantly improved from last year, but fairly consistent within the first three quarters of this year. So, we do expect that to continue through Q4 of this year. And that's baked into our guidance. -- As a quick follow-up, Aneel. We've noticed outstanding traction with financials in the midmarket and the upper midmarket -- I think a lot of organizations around 3,000-5,000 employees. It seems like we've also seen more activity at the 10,000-20,000 type of level. When you look back on it, do you think the typical or median size of the financial customers you're adding today has changed materially versus a year ago? -- It's definitely an average bigger customer today than it was a year ago, and much bigger than a couple of years ago. The ones that we highlighted in our opening remarks were all greater than 10,000 employees to your point. I'd say the other good trend is we'll have some good news for you when we report our next quarter, with some wins that are above the 20,000-employee size, that are more Fortune 500 type of accounts. They're beginning to emerge in the pipeline and becoming more predictable. It's more a matter of getting from being selected to getting the deals closed. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord. -- Hey, thanks. Everyone's talking about artificial intelligence and machine learning. To what extent do you believe this is an evolution from inline business intelligence, such as Prism and things like that, or is it kind of discontinuous? -- I think if you have a true multitenant cloud architecture like Workday, where every customer is on exactly the same version and the data models harmonize across every customer, you can then take advantage of all of the machine learning and artificial intelligence that's being built, both open source and what we're doing, and apply those algorithms against the data. For us, I think it's a natural evolution into this era of intelligent applications. I think if you're a legacy company that's different than Workday and you've got on-premise and cloud and single tenant and multitenant, I don't know how you harmonize that data and actually leverage the machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities across your customer base. I think it's much harder for those players. -- That's helpful. Thank you.Our next question comes from Justin Furby of William Blair & Co. -- Thanks, guys. Congrats. I wanted to follow up on Mark's question. Aneel, you mentioned what seems like a lot of confidence in some big wins in Q4. What drives that confidence? Are those deals that have already closed here through November or they're extremely late in the cycle? And, taking a step back, can you give us a broader sense of what the growth in that business is? It sounds like customers grew 60%, deal sizes are even higher than that. So maybe bookings growth is more than 60%. Just give a sense for what's going on with that business and what pipeline looks like. -- Sure. I'll start with the last one first. If we look across the year, and of course Q4 is our biggest quarter, I'm going to guess that you'll see net new ACV and financials grow faster than 50% -- if that's a good guess, Robynne -- which is considerably faster than what we're seeing in HCM, which is still at a very healthy rate. So, I think that's probably a pretty valuable data point and we're now beginning to get a critical mass of customers and revenue from that base. So, that growth rate compounds into bigger and bigger numbers.Where the optimism comes from, number one, was a great Q3 in terms of closing 37 new financial customers. Equally positive are all of these big companies like Unim and Aon and others going live. Aon is now two-thirds of the way through their implementation and very happy. As these companies go live, they're additional proof points for bigger and bigger companies to go with Workday. We're seeing that basically being manifested into where we are with several large financial transactions, where we've been selected -- haven't yet closed, but pretty confident that at least a few of them will close in this quarter. -- That's helpful. Thanks.Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. -- Thank you, guys, for taking the question. A question for Robynne. In thinking about the invoicing terms, we've been going through a multiyear trend of you guys invoicing less and less of the deal upfront. To what degree is that still impacting the deferred revenue number, particularly the current deferred revenue number? And, should we see that reverse as we head into FY19, that sort of headwind to what we calculated as billing starts to turn the other way? -- Yeah, as we said for a while, Keith, we continue to structure deals in the best long-term interests of our customers and of Workday, and our business, of course, isn't linear and contractual terms vary. That makes both billings and unearned revenue challenging metrics to predict and rely on. In addition, our success with add-on sales often results in customers early renewing their existing contracts, which often changes the timing of the billing cycle for those contracts as well.And then, uniquely to the unearned revenue side, unearned revenue has actually been negatively impacted this year by our strong linearity. As we recognize more in-quarter revenue on a contract, we actually exit that contract in the quarter with a lower unearned revenue balance. As a result of all of these dynamics, we continue to expect inconsistency and variability in billings and unearned, short-term and long-term, and that's why we don't really believe either are good indicators of our performance in any given quarter. They become very hard to predict, particularly a year out.So, we continue to believe that if we keep focusing on structuring deals that are really long-term focus, that the business will naturally continue to grow and be successful and neither billings or unearned are metrics that we manage to internally. -- Got it. On the appointment of John Schweitzer to SVP of Sales -- is that a new role for him or is he replacing someone? Can you tell us a little bit more about what's changing in terms of management? -- As we transitioned to a large enterprise and medium enterprise national organizations in the US -- one led by Ed LaPerche and the other led by Doug Robinson -- Chano and I felt like we needed someone that ran all of the North American operations, just to bring more experience and strength as we continue to scale the business. And that's where we brought in John. It was not a position that had existed before. -- So, it's a new level of sales management on top of both the enterprise and the commercial? -- Yes. -- Excellent. Thank you very much, guys.[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. -- Hey, guys. Let me add my congratulations and Happy Holidays in advance. Two things I want to get your perspective on. I knew you talked about net new ACV financials, but can you talk about net new ACV growth rate trend for the entire company this quarter, especially because you've been telling us not to look at billings growth and deferred revenue growth rate as a true indicator of the growth here of the business.Secondly, when you look at Workday in two to three years, when some of these larger companies are signing multiyear contracts, you have a lot more to go back and renew and upsell -- just planning, analytics, etc. So, how should we think about the growth curve for the next 12 months? I know generally software companies grow slower as they get bigger, but you're in a very unique position in that you have a lot more new product to sell. How should we think about that in the context of your ability to continue to grow at 30%-plus, if that's still a goal? -- I'm going to defer to Robynne on the ACV question. On the long-term growth, I think we're really well poised for long-term growth. Financials are kicking in. HR continues to be healthy. International operations have really kicked in, as you heard in the opening remarks. These two new drivers of Workday Prism and Workday Cloud Platform are definitely big opportunities for us, but it's too early for us to tell. I think we'll give you a clearer picture of where we see things, both headed into next year after Q4, and then along the way as we begin to get more experience selling, in particular, Workday Prism Analytics, which is ready to go now. But, very new and very different than what we've sold in the past. It's still early days for the cloud platform.So, I continue to see high growth in front of us, but it's hard to be more specific until we get through the end of this year and we get some data points on some of the newer offerings. -- Kash, on the net new ACV, we don't disclose net new ACV growth. But, if you'll look back a year -- Q3 of last year was when we started experiencing acceleration of subscription revenue growth, so we've now lapped that quarter. We're in a period of difficult comparisons. We're very pleased with the net new ACV achievement that we had in Q3 and I think that that really shows up in our revenue beat as well as our increased guidance for Q4. -- Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch Wonderful. Thank you very much. Happy Holidays.Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead of Deutsche Bank. -- Hi, thank you. Robynne, on the Q1 Fiscal '19 guide for 5% sequential growth in subscription revs, that's a little slower than the 7-9% you've put up in the last couple of Q1s. And, I think, off your 4Q guide, equates to about $508 million, so up about 27%. I suppose, before we conclude that you're just being conservative in that guidance two quarters out, I just wanted to ask you what maybe are the seasonal factors weighing into that guidance that we should keep in mind? -- Thanks, Karl. One of the dynamics that we're seeing this coming Q1 that we have not had in the past is that the improved linearity that we've built into and expect for our Q4 business actually increases the revenue recognized on contracts that are signed within Q4. That means that you have less incremental revenue on those same contracts in Q1 and therefore it impacts the sequential growth trend. So, we don't think it's a negative. It's just really the shift in linearity that causes the shift in the sequential change from Q4 to Q1. -- So, it sounds like the strength you're seeing in 4Q is just pulling stuff forward a little bit and skewing that sequential growth. -- That's correct. Pulling it forward within the quarter, yes. -- Yep. Thank you.Our next question comes from Phillip Winslow of Wells Fargo. -- Hi, this is actually Michael Barris on for Phil. Thanks for taking our question. You mentioned you've seen increased movement to the cloud in large enterprise, ERP, and financials. Are you seeing any differences in the competitive environment there versus the medium enterprise segment? What sorts of deals are things like Prism and the Cloud Platform potentially opening up that you may not have seen in the past? -- On the second part, it's still too early. I do think Prism is probably the one we'll get more feedback on sooner, and that definitely strengthens the story around financials. It's not just a transactional platform, but it becomes both a planning platform with Workday Planning and an analytics platform now with Prism Analytics. That's what the office of the CFO is looking for today. I feel like we're going into the market with a complete solution.On the higher end of the market in cloud, if you look at the reports, it's pretty much a two-horse race -- the other being Oracle. Gartner has the two of us in the magic quadrant. The other main competitor doesn't really have a cloud offering yet, so they're not really even considered. At the medium enterprise -- the low end of the enterprise -- we'll see NetSuite. It's really just those two. We don't really come across others and the market's plenty big for all of us. -- Thanks.Our next question comes from Adam Holt of MoffettNathanson. -- Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I guess this is for Aneel. If we look at the bookings number, it looks like it was a little different than we expected. Durations are moving around with you all, but if you look at the business that you're doing, do you feel that even with durations maybe moving around a little bit, you're actually getting better business with better long-term potential in terms of the duration or the upsell potential. If you're us, looking at the business, what do you think at this point is the best thing to look at to measure the strength of the momentum from a customer perspective? -- I'll answer the first and defer to Robynne on the second. In terms of the kind of business we're doing, Chano runs a very tight ship. We're doing very clean, healthy business. The big difference is that we're not optimizing for cash up front, and it might be surprising but there are a lot of very big companies that are very concerned about the cash outlays for these projects as opposed to the expense. Frankly, these are AAA Credit Rating companies focused on cash. I don't really care if we get it today or a year later or even two years later. Given interest rates, it's not much we're losing for it. If I can get a longer-term contract at better pricing, we'll do that every day of the week. Chano, do you want to add anything to that in terms of what you see in the marketplace without the focus on cash? -- No, I think it's a continuation of what we've been seeing. I think definitely we like the customer ability and satisfaction that we've been commanding and that's really helping us out significantly in the market opportunity out there. As you know, no particular changes or trends or any other dynamics. I think we're more focused on getting discount rates on healthier business and, in the long-term, that is good for our customers. -- In terms of what's the best guide for how we're doing, I still think it's subscription revenue growth. There might be some delay in what you see, but that's what we run the business off of and that's how we project what we're going to invest in next year. Any other things you want to add, Robynne? -- Yeah, Adam. I assume that when you talk about bookings, you're talking about calculated bookings off our backlog number. Keep in mind that the subscription backlog number is driven by three primary factors. There's obviously the net new business that we do in the quarter. There's also the renewals contracts that we ink in the quarter, the timing of which often varies, and can be impacted by early renewals, which is a pretty common occurrence when customers buy additional products from us.And then the third being duration, which I noted ticked down slightly this quarter. We don't actually worry about duration. We believe that, if we continue to do the right thing by the customer, continue to focus on high levels of customer satisfaction, then we'll continue to have very high renewal rates. In the end, the duration of the original contract is not an important factor for us longer term. I do believe that the backlog number is a meaningful metric, but I think it's more meaningful when you look at it as how it trends over time. In any given quarter, given these three variables, it can move around. So, it's not necessarily a direct tie to how we've done in a particular quarter, but it is good for measuring us over a longer period of time. -- Great. Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. -- Thanks a lot. Aneel, Oracle is obviously in the cloud financial market. SAP is moving that direction with S/4HANA Cloud. Do you think the two incumbents sort of pushing this message is a positive or a neutral or negative for Workday? And Robynne, on cash flow from operations margins next year, you said you'd get back up to your historic high levels. I think that would get you back to -- I believe it was 22%. I just wanted to double-click on that and make sure that's what you meant. Or, is it possible that we could actually move about that historic high water market on cash flow from operation margin? -- I think it's a big positive when all of the vendors in a given marketplace are talking about a shift to the cloud. It creates demand. This is a huge market. Financials market is twice the size of the HR market. As it flips over, there is a ton of market opportunity for more than one. I think we're very well positioned to get our fair share. The biggest thing that we're all in this market looking for are the signs that this market's beginning to tip from on-premise to cloud. So, anything that promotes that is a good thing. -- Ross, on your cash flow question, you were correct that our historical high has been 22%. As I said at the Analyst Day, we believe next year we can get back to those levels and then over time go beyond. It's still early days for us in looking at next year. We've got a huge Q4 in front of us to execute against which will impact our cash view of next year. So, we'll have better information for you on the next earning call with regard to cash flow next year. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from John DiFucci of Jefferies. -- Thank you. I think my question's for Robynne. All the commentary on the call from both you and Aneel has been positive on the business momentum in the quarter, and frankly, our field checks indicate at least decent momentum this quarter -- good business. But, I didn't really hear an answer to Adam's question. Is there anything that you'd suggest that we consider to gauge the current momentum of the business on a quarterly basis?There are numbers out there that are calculated billings and we understand how some of the things can move around, but is there anything that we can look at? Looking at backlog -- looking at revenue -- those are things that we can look at over the long-term health of the business. Obviously, that's very important for long-term shareholders. But, to gauge the momentum of this particular quarter, maybe you might want to reconsider giving your assessment of new subscription annual contract value. I know you said it was good this quarter, but maybe -- is there anything you'd suggest we look at? -- John, I would just point back to Aneel's earlier comment about subscription revenue growth. I really do believe that's the best metric and what you can use this quarter would be the overperformance that we had in Q3 on subscription revenue as well as the increase in our guide, a lot of which is driven off of the net new business we did in Q3, which will impact full quarter next year. That's the metric we manage to, and I think it's the best indicator on a quarterly basis to gauge how we did. -- But, you also said that over 90% of the subscription revenue in this quarter came in off the balance sheet. You also said you're seeing more linearity, which means you're seeing more revenue being recognized in the quarter. That just doesn't seem to me to be a -- well, it doesn't necessarily seem to be a great gauge for this quarter. Again, we've heard things are good for you guys. I'm just trying to reconcile that with the numbers. That's all. -- If you take that information and marry it with some of the commentary that Aneel had in his prepared remarks around customer growth and new customer logo wins, I think all of those paint a picture of a highly successful quarter. -- Okay. Thank you.Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. -- Great. Thanks very much. Just a question as it relates to 4Q. Do you have any significant renewals up for signing? -- Every Q4 we have a lot of renewals because that's our historically highest quarter. So, as the renewals stack up year-on-year, Q4 becomes our largest renewal quarter in general as well. As I mentioned before, we can have renewals moved to different quarters if customers early renew, but Q4 is a big renewal quarter for us and we have great renewal history and expect to continue that solid renewal history in Q4 as well. -- Great. Thanks.And our next question comes from Alec Buckin of Piper Jaffray. -- Hey, guys. Thanks very much. I want to ask one on the subscription backlog number. Is there any way, if you adjust for duration and normalize, to talk about the growth rate at a high level? And then, one for Aneel. When you think about the financials customers that you talked about signing for the fourth quarter, were any of those customers initially starting off as planning, or are they existing HCM customers as well? -- Alec, on the backlog, obviously the three factors I talked about before -- renewals, bookings, net new bookings, and duration -- all play a factor in that number and interplay. We're not going to be disclosing those three components, so I do think that it's a meaningful metric to gauge how we're doing longer term, but it's going to be difficult for you to actually pull that apart into those three pieces. But, the reason that I mentioned the downtick in duration was just to give you guys some color around why the increase in the backlog number maybe was not as high as it had been in Q3 last year. -- In terms of the large financial opportunities in Q4, the ones that I'm aware of are actually full platform opportunities, but financials is actually the driver in both cases. Chano, anything else to add? I don't think it's a broad enough set to say that that's a leading indicator for what they're going to look like over the next 12 months. It just happens to be the two in front of us right now are full platform across HCM and financials. -- You're right on that one. I would say the main difference you have in medium enterprises becoming ERP option as a whole starting point and potentially large customers -- when they're really large, they either take first fees or HR because of the complexity of the project is just larger. But there are some taking it at the same time as well. -- Yeah, Robynne maybe just one quick follow-up on the duration question. Can you talk about maybe why that ticked down this quarter? Was there anything you guys were doing to drive that? Any more clarity would be helpful. -- That's not something that we actively manage or focus on. We believe the duration of the original contract, if we can continue to achieve strong renewals, is an important measure of the business. Duration of the contract is usually driven by the customer and what contract term they're comfortable with. Often, the larger deals have longer term contracts and Q3 historically is a quarter with fewer large deals than other quarters and that's been true for many, many years. It also just comes down to customer preference. As we have success in add-on business, a lot of customers, when they add new product(s) to their contract, they co-term that with the original contract so the duration of that new business is actually fairly short. So, that's a factor as well. Lots of things that impact it and not something that we focus on or think is important in the long-term, although it will impact the backlog number.At this time, we will now take two more questions. Our next question comes from Pat Walravens of JMP Securities. -- Great, thank you. Aneel, I saw you speak a month ago and you talked about this idea of being a multigenerational company, which I thought was new and interesting. What did you mean by that and how do you do it? And Robynne, I'd love to know any impact you can share with us in terms of impact on Workday if tax reform passes. -- I think that was at the event down at Half Moon Bay. It's really about two things. One, transcending technology trends and being multigenerational across technology trends and not being a vendor that only exists because of one particular trend. The second piece is our view on succession at Workday and the longevity of both the opportunity and the company, that we can build over time.So, when Dave and I look back at our previous company and think about what we want to do differently at Workday, one of the things we set out to do was to build a management team that we could pass on from generation to generation. And we've done some of that. If you look at the management team currently running big parts of our business, they were not running it five years ago. Chano and Robynne are two examples. Setting up a pattern of doing that on a consistent basis sets us up for the long-term and for multiple generations of management for this company over time. -- Pat, on your tax reform question. We don't expect tax reform to have an impact on us for quite some time. We have over $1 billion worth of net operating losses that we can burn going forward. We continue to generate taxable losses based on our GAAP income statement. So, we will have some slight balance sheet adjustments as we revalue our tax assets and tax liabilities, but it won't -- we continue to be in a position where we won't be a cash taxpayer for many years to come. -- Great. Thank you.Our last question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities. -- Thank you for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe a little bit of historical perspective from the recent past that might help us think a little bit about the future here. As we compare last year to this year, we did see in our checks a fair bit of hesitance in the first three quarters of last year -- maybe in North America and the US related somewhat to the election. It seemed like enterprise buyers started to open up a little bit more in December. You had commented in November about some weakness there around the time of the election. And then, it seems like, in December and January, it was really off to the races for Workday and other companies as well. It's been a good year in the enterprise market, and certainly for Workday. It looks like a much better year.You spoke, Robynne, about cloud adoption. Is that the only factor? Are there other factors driving Workday this year versus last year? And then, as you think about next year -- you've given us some initial forecast, and that's helpful -- is there any chance that buyers might catch up with kind of pent-up demand that they weren't doing projects as much this year and they've now caught up? Or, do you see just a reservoir of projects that are going to continue to support the kind of demand environment you've been seeing this year? -- I would say what a difference a year makes. This has been a very strong year. We did definitely have softness in the first three quarters of last year, and we've not seen that this year. Going into Q4 of this year, it's the best position we've been going into Q4 for several years and not just compared to last year. It's a pretty consistent demand environment. The pipeline continues to grow at a healthy clip, so it positions us well for next year. I'd say the two things that are -- and our sales execution actually has improved in the last 12 months. Our win rates are consistently high.I'd say, if there's anything that's really continuing to drive the success that's becoming clearer and clearer over time, it's our customer satisfaction. Especially when you get to the large companies, in many cases we're the only proven solution. If you're at 50,000 or 100,000 employees, and you look at all of the proof points of successful customers, they're almost always Workday customers. It's creating somewhat of a network effect, where customers are talking to other customers. \"Hey, if you're going to go down this path and you want to have a successful project, Workday is the safe choice.\"I think that's bearing out more this year than it did last year. Kudos to the product organization, services organization, QA organization, and support organization for keeping these customers happy and for having products that truly scale. But, this last quarter -- Coca-Cola, just another example of a very large company who went into production very happy. Happy customers get you more happy customers. -- Right. Very good. Thank you, Aneel. I appreciate it. Congrats again. -- Thank you, everybody....We thank you for your participation in today's earnings call.

Let's take a deeper look at what Workday accomplished over the past few months, as well as what investors can expect going forward.Image source: Workday.Data source: Workday, Inc. *For the quarter ended Oct. 31, 2017.Workday co-founder and CEO Aneel Bhusri stated:CFO Robynne Sisco elaborated that subscription revenue growth this quarter was helped by a combination of high renewal rates, add-on sales with existing customers, and strong net new customer growth.\"We continue to invest for long-term growth,\" Sisco added, \"while delivering consistently solid operating and cash flow margins.\"For the fourth quarter, Workday expects revenue in the range of $571 million to $573 million -- the midpoint of which represents growth of 30% -- assuming subscription revenue of $482 million to $484 million. Here again, that's well ahead of consensus estimates for fiscal Q4 revenue of $556.3 million.To be fair, that does represent a notable deceleration in year-over-year growth rates. But Workday management already  , noting that comps would be more difficult toward the end of this fiscal year as they lap an acceleration in subscription revenue growth that began around this time last year.Thus, Workday increased its full fiscal-year revenue guidance to a range of $2.132 billion to $2.134 billion, above estimates for $2.10 billion and representing growth of 35% to 36%.All things considered, there was little not to like about this impressive quarter from Workday. The company's core HCM and Financial Management platforms remain healthy and popular with both new and current customers alike.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Coca-Cola (KO), Honeywell (HON) and Chubb (CB). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have underperformed the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry since the beginning of the year, (+9.7% vs. +13%). However, Coca-Cola enjoys solid long-term fundamentals given its worldwide reach, strong brand power, higher international presence and impressive cash position.Although the top line needs to show sustained improvement, the Zacks analyst likes the company's strategic efforts toward creating the portfolio of a total beverage company with improved marketing and innovation, focus on driving revenues by improved price/mix, digital focus, and productivity initiatives toward driving margins. Moreover, Coca-Cola's transformative global re-franchising initiatives will lead to better margins and returns as well as superior growth, despite hurting sales/profits in the near term.Also, Coca-Cola's new revenue platforms should drive growth over the long term. However, challenging  conditions, weak CSD volumes and currency and structural headwinds remain challenges.(You can  ).Shares of  have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry in the year to date period, increasing +32.3% vs. a -4.0% decline. With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell's diversified business portfolio has the potential to earn consistent above-average returns and mitigate operating risks through a balanced organic and inorganic model.The Zacks analyst likes the company's diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and conservative balance sheet. However, adverse foreign currency translations, high R&D expenses and volatility in commodity prices are likely to peg back its growth momentum to some extent.Although the company's proactive restructuring initiatives have positioned it to navigate better than many of its peers, it has yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets. A change in the U.S. government's defense and aerospace funding could also adversely impact sales of the Aerospace business.(You can  ). 's shares have gained +15.5% year to date, in line with the Zacks Property, Casualty and Title industry. The Zacks analyst thinks Chubb stands a good chance of taking leadership in the P&C space, benefiting from compelling products and services. Its inorganic growth story is impressive, helping it achieve higher long-term ROE.Investment results are exhibiting improvement owing to improving rate environment. A strong capital position helps Chubb boost in shareholders' value and invest in strategic initiatives to drive growth. Notably, it is on track to achieve annual run-rate integration-related savings of $875 million (up from $800 million guided earlier) by the end of 2018.However, exposure to cat loss and escalating expenses raise concerns for Chubb. The company estimates fourth quarter cat loss from wildfire in California to be about $249 million and another $34 million from all other natural catastrophe. Though the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 moved south, the consensus mark increased for 2018.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Statoil (STO), Travelers (TRV) and Workday (WDAY).A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors. Zacks names 5 stocks to buy now.Mark VickerySenior EditorThe Zacks analyst believes ONEOK continues to gain from expansion of its existing capacity in the prolific oil and gas regions.Though concerned about its high debt levels and the sluggish automotive unit, the Zacks analyst likes the company's prudent cost management and shareholder-friendly measures.The Zacks analyst expects Statoil to generate significant cash flow from new upstream projects in the Norwegian Continental Shelf.Per the Zacks analyst, Workday benefits from strong product portfolio that is helping it to win medium-sized customers on a regular basis.Per the Zacks analyst, Tech Data benefits from buyouts like Technology Solutions, which it acquired from Avnet. But, the company needs to watch out for stiff competition and sluggish PC market.Per the Zacks analyst, Travelers is set to gain from pricing and other actions, which drives higher returns and improve profitability, and strategic buyouts.Per the Zacks analyst, Radian is poised for growth given its focus on core business and services with higher-growth potential besides more predictable and recurring fee-based revenues.Five Below's comparable sales growth has improved over the quarters. Per the Zacks analyst, better price management, merchandise, cost containment and focus on pre-teen customers should drive sales.Per the Zacks analyst, Big Lots' furniture and soft home categories will help drive sales in the coming quarters. For the third quarter, comparable sales are expected to be up in the low-single digitsThe Zacks analyst believes that the LitePoint acquisition has expanded Teradyne's presence in the fast-growing wireless testing market, with solutions for next generation wireless networking.Per the Zacks analyst, Greif's results in FY17 will be hurt by unfavorable impact of Hurricane Harvey. Raw material cost inflation and delays in equipment delivery will also hit growth.The Zacks analyst believes that although Ligand's revenue has increased, its dependence on royalties for its revenues remains a concern as failure on its partners' end will severely impact prospects.Per the Zacks analyst, there is development boom of self-storage units in many markets. This is likely to fuel competition for Extra Space, curb its power to raise rents and result in more discountingWant the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

General and administrative expenses climbed 7.8% to $34.5 million.The company reported non-GAAP operating profit of $50.1 million compared with $8 million in the year-ago quarter.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $3.2 billion as of Oct 31, 2017.Operating cash flows were $144.0 million and free cash flows were $107.7 million.Unearned revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 21.5% from the year-ago quarter. Current unearned revenues (that will be recognized over the next 12 months) were more than $1.1 billion, representing annual growth of 27%.Non-current unearned revenues declined 18% year over year as fewer customers opted for paying more than one year of subscription fees upfront.Subscription revenue backlog, which represents all future revenues from existing customer subscription contracts, both on and off-balance sheet was $4.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and 37% year over year.Management observed slight decline in duration of contracts signed in the quarter compared with previous quarters.

The company's ability to manage costs and increase its margins over the same time period have been equally impressive.The company's preferred margin metric is adjusted  margin, a measure of operating profitability as a percentage of revenue. Paycom's adjusted EBITDA margin  from 16.7% in 2012 to 28.7% in 2016. And it looks like this number will continue to rise. The company's latest guidance implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 31% for 2017. Let's examine Paycom's incredible expanding margins in the context of a couple of its peers.Image source: Paycom Software.Paycom sells cloud-based payroll and human capital management (HCM) software that employers use for everything from payroll and performance reviews to hiring and governmental compliance. It's a crowded industry with established legacy players like  and  , as well as newer entrants like Paycom,  (NASDAQ: WDAY) , and  (NASDAQ: ULTI) . data by These latter three companies don't necessarily compete for the same customers. Paycom is focused on smaller companies in the 50- to 2,000-employee range. Workday counts roughly 30% of the Fortune 500 as clients. And Ultimate seems to play mostly in between those extremes. But they all offer cloud-based solutions that essentially perform similar functions. And they're all scaling up as quickly as possible.But all growth is not created equal. Though each of these companies is prioritizing top-line expansion, over the past three years, Paycom's revenue growth has significantly outpaced growth in its \"big 3\" variable operating expenses. Even though the company has had to make significant investments in R&D, its salesforce, and administrative operations to fund its growth, it's been able to keep these expenses (as a group) at a level that improves its bottom line.\n  \n*Workday's fiscal year ends Jan. 31 rather than Dec. 31. Data source: Company financials. Growth rate calculations by author.By the same measures, Ultimate Software Group's expenses are heading the wrong way relative to its revenue growth. For Workday, its revenue growth came in ahead of its growth in expenses, but not by much.You can see the effect of revenue vs. expenses over time even more clearly in these companies' operating margins.\n  \n*Workday's fiscal year ends Jan. 31 rather than Dec. 31. Data source: Company financials. Calculations by author.From 2014 to 2016, Paycom's operating margin rose by 7.5 percentage points, more than double the margin improvement seen by Workday (which isn't yet profitable). Ultimate's margin nearly got cut in half over the same period. With the highest margins in the group by far, Paycom is also improving its margins more quickly than the others as well.This year, things have continued to play out largely the same for Paycom. In the most recent quarter, revenue increased by 31% year-over-year, while G&A, R&D, and sales and marketing expenses (combined) increased just 16% year-over-year.Don't misunderstand -- Paycom is still investing heavily in R&D, marketing, and its sales team in the pursuit of top-line growth. In fact, CEO Chad Richison has said R&D costs are likely to keep growing at 80% to 100% annually. But despite this, Paycom has set a long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 30% to 33%, implying future upside beyond what the company is likely to achieve this year. The simplest reason for that is the company says its beginning to benefit from economies of scale that have helped moderate certain sales and marketing expenses.To me, Paycom looks like the superior operator in the HCM industry. The company's rapidly rising revenues, combined with expanding margins, should provide plenty of future earnings growth as well. I expect Paycom to keep outperforming the broader market -- and its peers -- in the years ahead.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

That contrasts with  's (TSLA) Model 3 production problems and CEO Elon Musk's seeming inability to focus on them, prompting markets to reconsider views on who is really leading the race to the future. : Autonomous and electric cars also will take the spotlight at AutoMobility LA, the portion of the Los Angeles car event that is for media and industry running Monday through Thursday. It will showcase stalwarts like GM alongside automotive upstarts like  (NVDA), which are in the vanguard of efforts to bring new products and solutions to market. As cars become increasingly infused with technology, giants like  (MSFT) and  (INTC) will also have presentations.The portion of the event for the general public, the LA Auto Show, will follow, running Dec. 1-10.

But it's up from the pokey pace of under 17 million over most of the summer.The insurance software provider issues its fiscal Q1 report on Wednesday, and the bottom line is projected to reverse to a loss of 14 cents a share from a profit of 2 cents a year ago, while revenue is seen up 7.1% to $110.83 million. The results come amid Guidewire's continued transition to a cloud subscription model, which has delayed revenue recognition and lower margins compared with its term licenses - both of which are causing the financials to look \"messy\" in the near term, according to the company. Guidewire first staged a breakout over an 81.56 buy point on Nov. 6, and though the stock quickly dipped below that level, it found support at the 50-day line and is now back within the buy zone. (BOX), a cloud-based provider of content management services, will report after the market close Wednesday.

Video-processing chipmaker  (AMBA) is scheduled to report after the close on Thursday, and EPS is expected to tumble 40.5% to 66 cents, as revenue drops 11% to $89 million.

(FIVE) reports Q3 earnings on Thursday, and analysts expect EPS of 13 cents, a 30% jump, on 23% revenue growth to $245 million. The teen- and tween-focused retail chain is coming off a strong Q2, when fidget spinners fattened sales and margins. Store expansions and plans to remodel others also have helped attract customers.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 795 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $18.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $87.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $105.59/share today.Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of WDAY stock at the current price level of $105.59/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $115.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 26.53% if the stock gets called away at the January 2020 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if WDAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

The provider of cloud-based solutions for human capital management, financial management and other services has leveraged three earnings beats this calendar year into 75% gains since Jan. 1, and shares now sit near all-time highs. Consensus estimates for Workday's fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 31, to be reported after the market's close on Nov. 29, are for 31.9% year-over-year revenue growth to $540.2 million and a quintupling of adjusted profits to 15 cents per share.

The narrative that Amazon.com's purchase of Whole Foods will spark a grocery apocalypse has driven Kroger's shares 34% lower this year, but analyst estimates - 3.4% top-line growth to $27.5 billion, and a slight 2.4% profit dip to 40 cents per share - indicate that the company is far from sunk. In fact, Kroger has enjoyed a string of upgrades over the past few months from analysts such as Pivotal Research's Ajay Jain, who said in September that the pullback in KR has created a shorter-term buying opportunity. In the long run, Wells Fargo analyst Edward Kelly thinks Kroger could prop its stock up next year with a massive buyback program accounting for 12% to 14% of its outstanding shares.Earnings Spotlight: Ulta Beauty (  ) - Ulta, once a stock market darling that put up 230%-plus gains from the start of 2014 through 2017's midpoint, has cratered from its peak at all-time highs in June and now is off 18% for the year. The market has turned so hard on Ulta that even a 28% spike in second-quarter earnings, along with top- and bottom-line beats - was met with a steep selloff in August. Wall Street's pros still expect more growth from Ulta in its quarter ended Oct. 28, to be reported after the Nov. 30 close - specifically, an 18.8% jump in revenues to $1.34 billion, filtering to 19.3% growth in profits to $1.67 per share. But what's really weighing on Ulta is sentiment on the broader beauty industry, with analysts from Oppenheimer, BMO Capital and Piper Jaffray all downgrading ULTA shares over the past few months on concerns about a slowdown in beauty spending.Other Noteworthy Reports: Ambarella (  ), Barnes & Noble (  ), Express (  ), Five Below (  ), Michaels Cos.

Shares that had nearly tripled over the past year have tumbled 20% since the critique broke in early October. That naturally leads an investor to wonder whether the e-commerce storefront will overcome these charges and make its stock a buy, or they'll prove true and buying now will be like catching a falling knife.Famed short-seller Andrew Left at Citron Research issued a scathing rebuke of Shopify, alleging the platform routinely violates FTC marketing guidelines and was \"dirtier\" than  (NYSE: HLF) , the multi-level marketing company that was required to pay a  with the regulatory agency.Image source: Getty Images.There are several aspects to Left's accusations. On the one hand, he contends Shopify is violating FTC regulations by promising people if they use its product they could become millionaires. He also says people promoting the service aren't disclosing they're being compensated for their endorsement by the outfit. Although other, larger marketers may also do something similar, it's still an illegal activity, similar to Herbalife, which was slammed by the FTC for advocating \"members can 'quit their job' or otherwise enjoy a lavish lifestyle\" by using its products. Left says Shopify even has a form letter on its website that platform users can use to send to their bosses when they quit their jobs.Comparing the company to Herbalife seems to fall short, since people aren't directly selling Shopify products like they do with the supplement distributor; users are using its platform to sell their own goods and services (Left does note bloggers and other sites can make money referring people to Shopify, and notes that is akin to affiliate marketing rather than an MLM scheme).There appear other, more problematic accusations that Shopify will need to address. The Citron report has a lot more teeth when it accuses the company of being highly overvalued. At 20 times sales, it is valued about twice as much as other leading SaaS companies like  (NYSE: CRM) and  (NASDAQ: WDAY) , and Left contends Shopify's far richer than it has any right to be considering there is little known about the  of its 500,000 customers.He also notes that only 50% of Shopify's revenue comes from subscription fees while other, better SaaS businesses are reporting 85% of their revenues come from subscriptions. Left notes Shopify is an $11 billion business trading at nosebleed valuations.

The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY), the market cap is now $14.37B, versus Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (Symbol: HST) at $14.36B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of WDAY vs. HST:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, WDAY and HST collectively make up 1.56% of the iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF (  ) which is lower by about 0.2% on the day Monday.At the closing bell, WDAY is off about 1.9%, while HST is down about 0.6% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Equities closed out last week with a bang. The large-cap-laden  galloped to a new record closing high of $2,575.21. As the bull market beat rolls on, quality chart patterns continue to emerge. Opportunists on the lookout for the best trades each week have been treated to a plethora of choices, many of which continue to deliver.For the chart-wielding trader, the best trades are those flashing bullish signals across a variety of technical indicators.The trend is rising, volume patterns support buyers and a low-risk, high-reward setup has usually emerged. Indeed, buying dips to support or breakouts over resistance is the name of the game for many tactical traders.I've scoured the market over the weekend and narrowed my focus to three all-star-quality candidates for the coming week. While it remains to be seen if they end up big winners, they sure do have clean setups.Behold, three of the best trades on the Street. (NYSE:  ) has undoubtedly one of the sweetest setups on the Street.One of the biggest benefits of the docile market environment is the ease with which textbook bullish patterns have formed and followed through. CRM stock has been locked in an uptrend all year long. The occasional dip has been bought, and breakouts have scored strong follow-through. Over the past two months, Salesforce formed a clean cup-and-handle formation. Friday's high volume breakout signaled the pattern's completion.With CRM firing on all cylinders and just now breaking out, it's undoubtedly one of the best trades for the week ahead. Buy the Dec $100/$105 bull call spread for $1.65 to capitalize on a potential run into year-end.The action in  (NASDAQ:  ) has mirrored that of CRM. It has been trending higher all year long and sits well above rising 200-day, 50-day, and 20-day moving averages. The sharp ascent that kicked off last month and subsequent flag formed in recent weeks are completing the right side of a larger cup-and-handle pattern.With Friday's pop, WDAY is now a stone's throw away from breaking out to new multiyear highs. The record highs near $116 from 2013 are beckoning, and I suspect at least a re-test is on the horizon. If WDAY can break above Friday's high ($109.43), then bullish trades are worth a shot.Buy the WDAY December $110/$115 bull call spread for $2.10.While our first two selections have been trending higher all year,  (NYSE:  ) just recently bottomed. Up until August, SNAP stock was stuck in a downtrend, unable to get out of its own way. But there was enough bloodletting following its last earnings release to finally deliver a sustainable bottom.

The company's non-GAAP earnings of 24 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents.Revenues of $525.3 million increased 39.1% year over year and beat the consensus mark of $507.4 million. The figure was much better than the guided range of $505-$508 million.Subscription revenues (82.7% of total revenue) soared 42% year over year to $434.5 million, driven by strong net new customer wins and renewals. The figure surpassed the guided range of $420-$432 million. Professional services revenues (17.3% of total revenue) grew 34% from the year-ago quarter to $91 million and were better than the guided figure of $85 million.Geographically, revenues outside the United States (20% of total revenue) increased 59% to $106 million, which is indicative of the company's growing international foothold. Reportedly, Munich Germany-based manufacturing giant Siemens replaced their current HR system with Workday HCM. Additionally, in Europe and Asia Pacific's Japan region, the company added Shell and Johnson Electric, respectively as customers.The company reported non-GAAP operating income of $49 million compared with $6.1 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 770 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 9.3%.Workday exited the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $2.01 billion compared with nearly $2.0 billion as on Jan 31, 2017.Workday's cash from operating activities for the quarter ended Jul 31, 2017 was $15.1 million compared with $6.5 million in the year-ago period.The company's free cash outflow was $23.4 million in the quarter, greater than an outflow of $20 million in the prior-year quarter.For fiscal third-quarter 2018, Workday expects revenues in the range of $538-$540 million. Subscription revenues are anticipated in the range of $450-$452 million, while professional services revenue expectation is $88 million.Workday anticipates non-GAAP operating margin to decline sequentially and be in the range of 5-6%.Buoyed by the encouraging first-half results, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2018. Revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $2.093-$2.1 billion, up from the prior guidance of $2.04-$2.05 billion. The company now expects non-GAAP operating margin for the full year to be 8%, up from the previous guidance of 6-7%.Additionally, Workday now projects subscription revenues to be between $1.750 billion and $1.757 billion compared with the prior guidance of $1.705 billion to $1.720 billion.

On the one hand, he contends Shopify is violating FTC regulations by promising people if they use its product they could become millionaires. He also says people promoting the service aren't disclosing they're being compensated for their endorsement by the outfit. Although other, larger marketers may also do something similar, it's still an illegal activity, similar to Herbalife, which was slammed by the FTC for advocating \"members can 'quit their job' or otherwise enjoy a lavish lifestyle\" by using its products. Left says Shopify even has a form letter on its website that platform users can use to send to their bosses when they quit their jobs.I'm not familiar enough with FTC rules to say whether encouraging entrepreneurs to use your service to become a millionaire is a violation or not, but if it is truly illegal, then it's incumbent on Shopify to change its marketing to comply with the law.Yet otherwise comparing it to Herbalife seems to fall short, since people aren't directly selling Shopify products like they do with the supplement distributor; users are using its platform to sell their own goods and services (Left does note bloggers and other sites can make money referring people to Shopify, and notes that is akin to affiliate marketing rather than an MLM scheme).There appear other, more problematic accusations that Shopify will need to address. The Citron report seemingly has a lot more teeth when it accuses the company of being highly overvalued. At 20 times sales, it is valued about twice as much as other leading SaaS companies like  (NYSE: CRM) and  (NASDAQ: WDAY) , and Left contends Shopify's far richer than it has any right to be considering there is little known about the  of its purported 500,000 customers.He also notes that only 50% of Shopify's revenue comes from subscription fees while other, better SaaS businesses are reporting 85% of their revenues come from subscriptions. Left notes Shopify is an $11 billion business trading at nosebleed valuations. He suggests the stock could and should sit at about half its current price and then still have much more room to fall if and when the FTC gets involved.Image source: Getty Images.In cases like this there is often a lot of confusion, and Shopify posted a note on its website stating \"We vigorously defend our business model and stand resolutely behind our mission and the success of our merchants.\"The platform provider does provide its customers with the tools they require to meet the needs of consumers who expect to be able to transact anywhere, anytime, on any device.

This was primarily driven by 7% (6% in constant currency) growth in revenues that was in line with the high end of management's guidance of 4-6%.Oracle's top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (16.2% of total revenue versus 11.4% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 51.3% (60% in constant currency) to $1.49 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenue increased 8% in constant currency to $7.41 billion. Management noted that 80% of Oracle's trailing 12-month software and cloud revenue is now recurring. | We believe that the company's growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future. The expanding customer base that includes the likes of AT&T Inc.  , Liberty Mutual Insurance, Advance Auto Parts Inc.  and others is a key catalyst.Shares were down 4.5% in after-hour trading following the results. The decline apparently reflects soft outlook. Earnings are anticipated to be between 64 cents and 68 cents for the quarter, with a positive impact of couple of cents from favorable currency tailwind.The high-end of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, which was pegged at 69 cents.Moreover, cloud growth outlook was unimpressive. Cloud revenues including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow between 39% and 43% (41% and 45% in the U.S. dollars), much lower than 51.3% reported by Oracle in the last quarter and 64.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Oracle's stock has gained 37.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the 27.2% rally of the  it belongs to. However, a brake in the cloud momentum can drag down the stock price in fiscal 2018.Cloud software as a service (SaaS) revenues advanced a significant 61.6% (62% in constant currency) year over year to $1.09 billion. Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) revenues surged 29.2% (28% in constant currency) to $403 million. Cloud deferred revenues surged 53%.On-premise software revenues (64.2% of total revenue versus 67.6% in the year-ago quarter) increased 1.6% (1% at constant currency) to $5.92 billion reflecting continued higher attachment rates of software support and renewal rates.ERP surged 90% organically. Management stated that Fusion HCM soared 109%, which was double the growth rate of Workday  . Database as a Service was up 53% from the year-ago quarter. CX also increased double digits organically.On Oct 1, Oracle is set to launch the next-generation database, which will be a totally autonomous system supported by machine learning.

While the company has actually performed quite well over the past few years, activist investor Bill Ackman thinks it can do much better, and  an 8% stake in the company. He backed his thesis up with a 168-slide, three-hour presentation. I read it (you're welcome!) to distill the relevant points.Ackman's main point is that Automatic Data Processing, the leader in payroll processing, has not invested correctly in software and technology, which has allowed upstart competitors such as  (NYSE: WDAY) and  (NASDAQ: ULTI) to release better products and take market share.Ackman believes that ADP, started by accountants, has brought innovation through acquisitions, which have never been fully integrated. Many of these systems rely on legacy COBOL code from the '90s, which not only makes them difficult to use but also makes it difficult to attract top software engineering talent.While company cheerleaders claim ADP's business model is high-touch and focused on the first-class service, Ackman's team believes the focus on sales and support is only necessary because the company's products are buggy and don't work well.While a large back-end integration would require a large initial investment and potentially disrupt operations, Pershing believes it's necessary, and that the riskiest path is actually the status quo.Image source: Getty Images.Ackman also called out the company for having bad incentives in two respects. One, each business unit -- small-medium business (SMB), mid-market, enterprise, and Canada -- has its own manager, CFO, and HR head. Not only is this redundant, claims Ackman, but it also causes turf wars between departments, as company executives focus on their own division at the expense of a broader overall vision.Ackman also believes there is a misalignment on executive pay, claiming yearly sales goals align employees and executives with incremental improvement, rather than transformational change. Ackman proposes offering a big slug of long-dated shares and options so that executives are aligned for the long term, rather than year to year.Ackman also thinks that management is insular and that the public and the board have been kept in the dark due to complicated financials and a lack of disclosure. For instance, while the company used to discuss its business units individually, it no longer does. The same goes for the split between its core payroll and newer \"Beyond Payroll\" services. Ackman believes that this is done to mask a slowdown in its core enterprise services business as other newer business lines grow.Ackman believes that this is done to mask a slowdown in its core enterprise services business as other newer business lines grow. While the company does discuss increasing client counts, Ackman believes this is due to small business gains, while the company is actually losing larger-dollar enterprise clients.Ackman also points to the 20-year average tenure of senior management. He believes these senior executives are essentially \"yes-men\" (and women) for CEO Carlos Rodriguez. Ackman cites other evidence that employees lower down the ladder are dissatisfied, pointing to ADP not being on Fortune Magazine's, \"100 Greatest Places to Work\" list, while competitors Ultimate Software and Workday are numbers seven and 18, respectively. The company also significantly lags competitors in  rankings, with a 3.1 rating.So, what does Ackman think ADP could become? He believes his proposed overhaul could lead to significant margin expansion of 1,500 to 2,000 basis points (no, I did not add a zero), bringing company operating margins up from 19% to 34%-39%. That could increase 2022 earnings to $8.70, as compared with $5.70 in Ackman's estimated \"status quo\" scenario. At his midpoint multiple of 26 times earnings, Ackman believes the stock will be worth $238 in four years, or more than double the current price.As proof of concept, Ackman points to two previous businesses that were spun off from ADP: Solera, and  (NASDAQ: CDK) , each of which have almost doubled EBIT and  margins since being spun off in 2006 and 2014, respectively.If I were an ADP shareholder, I'd be pretty nervous. ADP management was fiercely resistant to Ackman's arguments, setting up a fight in the upcoming weeks. That's not surprising, as Ackman's presentation basically called out management as out of touch, and may have alerted ADP customers to \"superior\" alternatives in the market. On the other hand, even if Ackman is successful in getting the three board seats he desires, the company will likely undergo a massive overhaul over the next year or two, which is not without risks. That may pay dividends long term, but for now, with a stock still trading at a lofty 27 times earnings, I'm happyOn the other hand, even if Ackman is successful in getting the three board seats he desires, the company will likely undergo a massive overhaul over the next year or two, which is not without risks. That may pay dividends long term, but for now, with a stock still trading at a lofty 27 times earnings, I'm happy to watch the drama from the sidelines.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Non-GAAP earnings of 62 cents per share and revenues of $9.21 billion comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents and $9.03 billion, respectively.Earnings increased 12.3% from the year-ago quarter and were better than the company's guided range of 59-61 cents. This was primarily driven by 7% (6% in constant currency) growth in revenues that was in line with the high end of management's guidance of 4-6%.Oracle's top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (16.2% of total revenue versus 11.4% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 51.3% (60% in constant currency) to $1.49 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenue increased 8% in constant currency to $7.41 billion. Management noted that 80% of Oracle's trailing 12-month software and cloud revenue is now recurring. | We believe that the company's growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future. The expanding customer base that includes the likes of AT&T Inc.  , Liberty Mutual Insurance, Advance Auto Parts Inc.  and others is a key catalyst.Shares were down 4.5% in after-hour trading following the results. The decline apparently reflects soft outlook. Earnings are anticipated to be between 64 cents and 68 cents for the quarter, with a positive impact of couple of cents from favorable currency tailwind.The high-end of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, which was pegged at 69 cents.Moreover, cloud growth outlook was unimpressive. Cloud revenues including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow between 39% and 43% (41% and 45% in the U.S. dollars), much lower than 51.3% reported by Oracle in the last quarter and 64.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Oracle's stock has gained 37.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the 27.2% rally of the  it belongs to. However, a brake in the cloud momentum can drag down the stock price in fiscal 2018.Cloud software as a service (SaaS) revenues advanced a significant 61.6% (62% in constant currency) year over year to $1.09 billion. Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) revenues surged 29.2% (28% in constant currency) to $403 million. Cloud deferred revenues surged 53%.On-premise software revenues (64.2% of total revenue versus 67.6% in the year-ago quarter) increased 1.6% (1% at constant currency) to $5.92 billion reflecting continued higher attachment rates of software support and renewal rates.ERP surged 90% organically. Management stated that Fusion HCM soared 109%, which was double the growth rate of Workday  . Database as a Service was up 53% from the year-ago quarter. CX also increased double digits organically.On Oct 1, Oracle is set to launch the next-generation database, which will be a totally autonomous system supported by machine learning.

ORCL stock was up over 37% year-to-date, though that strength seemed overshadowed by huge gains at other large-cap tech plays. Source: ShutterstockFears about the company's vulnerability to newer, younger, cloud-based competitors had left the stock basically flat for three years from early 2014 to early 2017. But newfound enthusiasm toward Oracle's own cloud potential had led to a bit of a 'catch-up' rally in Oracle stock.But newfound enthusiasm toward Oracle's own cloud potential had led to a bit of a 'catch-up' rally in Oracle stock.That rally should be extended after Oracle posted a nice Q1 earnings beat. Overall, the numbers look good. Cloud growth looks even better. And with Oracle now looking like a legitimate player in cloud - not a victim of the disruption caused by that trend - ORCL stock looks to have a lot more rallying left to do.The headline figures for  in Q1 look solid, as our Hilary Kramer  . Adjusted EPS of $0.62 rose 12% year-over-year. The figure beat consensus estimates by two cents, and was above the company's guided range of $0.59-$0.61.That beat wasn't driven by taxes, either, as has been the case at a number of companies of late (see, for instance,  (NASDAQ:  )  ). The non-GAAP tax rate of 25.0% actually was higher than the expected 23.5% (itself a penny per share hit), ad basically flat year-over-year.The news might have been even better on the top line. Revenue of $9.19 billion increased 7% year-over-year, two full points better than the average Street estimate. In fact, the number come in above the  of the 28 analyst estimates.How Oracle drove that growth helps the bull case as well. Cloud revenue rose 51%, toward the end of guidance for 48-51% growth. The figure totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter; just last year, Oracle set a goal of reaching $2 billion in cloud sales for the  .The strength was enough that CEO Mark Hurd even felt comfortable calling out competitors in the Q1 release. He pointed out that Oracle's cloud apps business was growing more than twice as fast as that of  (NYSE:  ). Hurd added that the company has 30 times as many ERP (enterprise resource planning) customers as high-flying stock  (NYSE:  ). And after a quarter like Q1, Oracle does have some reason to strut.The message Hurd and Oracle were trying to give seems pretty clear. Oracle is back, and it's a legitimate giant of its own in the cloud space, not a once-great on-premise software company trying to make a comeback.In other words, the ORCL story looks a lot more like Microsoft than  (NYSE:  ). But ORCL stock actually is valued closer to IBM than to MSFT.Full-year EPS estimates likely will come up after the report, but even with 1% after-hours gains ORCL stock still trades at less than 18x FY18 EPS estimates. Those estimates look low as well, against post-Q4 guidance for double-digit growth this year.Assuming ORCL received a multiple closer to MSFT's 22-23x figure, ORCL could hit $70 by year end - another 30% upside from after-hours prices around $53. That's not a huge multiple in the context of 50%+ cloud growth, a rock-solid balance sheet (ORCL actually has net cash), and improved market share.In short, it looks like the cloud story at Oracle is just beginning. And even after nearly 40% gains year-to-date, that means investors still have time to buy into that story.The post ) Stock Is a Strong Buy After Q1 Earnings Beat appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported fiscal second-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 24 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents.Revenues of $525.3 million increased 39.1% year over year and beat the consensus mark of $507.4 million. The figure was much better than the guided range of $505-$508 million.Subscription revenues (82.7% of total revenue) soared 42% year over year to $434.5 million, driven by strong net new customer wins and renewals. The figure surpassed the guided range of $420-$432 million. Professional services revenues (17.3% of total revenue) grew 34% from the year-ago quarter to $91 million and were better than the guided figure of $85 million.Notably, Citigroup Management Corporation  , Nordstrom, Qualcomm  and Humana were added as human capital management (HCM) customers in the reported quarter. The company's financial management application was chosen by the likes of Ohio Health Corporation, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Giant Tiger Stores and Carlyle in the reported quarter.Geographically, revenues outside the U.S. (20% of total revenue) increased 59% to $106 million, which is indicative of the company's growing international foothold. Reportedly, Munich Germany-based manufacturing giant Siemens replaced their current HR system with Workday HCM. Additionally, in Europe and Asia Pacific's Japan region, the company added Shell and Johnson Electric, respectively as customers.Notably, shares of Workday have gained 62.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the  18.1% rally.The company reported non-GAAP operating income of $49 million compared with $6.1 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 770 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 9.3%. | Workday exited the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $2.01 billion compared with nearly $2.0 billion as on Jan 31, 2017.Workday's cash from operating activities for the quarter ended Jul 31, 2017 was $15.1 million compared with $6.5 million in the year-ago period.The company's free cash outflow was $23.4 million in the quarter, greater than an outflow of $20 million in the prior-year quarter.For fiscal third-quarter 2018, Workday expects revenues in the range of $538-$540 million. Subscription revenues are anticipated in the range of $450-$452 million, while professional services revenue expectation is $88 million.Workday anticipates non-GAAP operating margins to decline sequentially and be in the range of 5-6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at earnings of 9 cents per share on revenues of $522.05 million.Buoyed by the encouraging first-half results, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2018. Revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $2.093-$2.1 billion, up from the prior guidance of $2.04-$2.05 billion. The company now expects non-GAAP operating margin for the full year to be 8%, up from the previous guidance of 6-7%.Additionally, Workday now projects subscription revenues to be between $1.750 billion and $1.757 billion compared with the prior guidance of $1.705 billion to $1.720 billion. Professional services revenues are anticipated to be about $343 million in fiscal 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at earnings of 65 cents per share on revenues of $2.05 billion.Workday's revenue growth continues to be driven by high demand for HCM and financial management applications. The company continues to win new customers, which demonstrate high demand for its applications. We believe Workday's high customer satisfaction rate bodes well for its long-term business strategy.Workday's HCM suite of applications demonstrates strong growth momentum driven by the transition of organizations to the cloud. Per management, Workday has been selected for core HR by more than 30% of Fortune 500 companies. We, therefore, see much room for expansion here. Also, the company's traction in the international market is also a positive.The company's growing clout in the HCM market is evident from market research firm Gartner's latest \"Magic Quadrant for Cloud HCM Suites for Midmarket and Large Enterprises\" report where it put Workday in the \"Leaders\" quadrant.The company's dominance in the financial management sector is also increasing, which is evident from Gartner's June 2017 \"Magic Quadrant for Cloud Core Financial Management Suites for Midsize, Large, and Global Enterprises\" report where Workday was again placed in the \"Leaders\" quadrant. Moreover, Workday Planning application is also doing well with more than 170 customers including Qualcomm and Bank of America  .Workday's intention to foray into the platform-as-a-service market by launching the Workday Cloud Platform is expected to further boost the company's top line in our view.However, increasing competition in the HCM and financial software market could lead to pricing pressure and affect Workday's margins. Also, increasing marketing spend remains a concern.Workday has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company just posted a very solid quarter and analysts will be revising estimates higher and that tends to improve the Zacks Rank for any stock.COUP isn't that big of a stock compared to others in the enterprise software space. At $1.6B the company is only a fraction of WDAY, CRM, SAP and ORCL. The company's software helps businesses manage their purchasing. As their tag line says, what CRM is to sales, COUP is to expenses.The company reported a loss of $0.10 per share, but that was $0.09 better than expected. Revenue rose 43% from the year ago level to $44.6M when $41.6 was expected. The key idea here is that the fiscal first quarter that was reported back in June of this year showed growth of 40.8% on the topline , so the 43% rate is an acceleration of growth. Growth investors love to see this and they are generally willing to pay a little more for growth than value investors are for any sort of value play.The company guided next quarter inline , as they gave a range of a loss of $0.12 - $0.10 when a loss of $0.12 was expected. However, the company guided revenue for next quarter above consensus with an expected range of $44.8M-$45.3M when the consensus was calling for $44.08M.For FY18, the company sees a loss between $0.48 to $0.50 when the consensus was looking for a loss of $0.51. The company expects revenues of between $177M - $179M when the consensus was calling for $174M.This is what we call a beat and raise report and aggressive growth investors love to see this.I see three recent research reports on the stock with two of them being initiations. First Analysis out of Chicago started the stock with an Overweight rating and price target of $37 in early August. BTIG Research started the stock at a Buy in early June and put a $40 price target on the stock. On June 1, RBC Capital Markets reiterated their Outperform rating on June1 and at that time they raised their price target to $40 from $35.Following this most recent beat and raise the stock is still a ways away from even the lowest price targets. The probability of a higher price target isn't all that good (at least at the time this piece was written).This was a solid quarter and down the road, COUP will be bought by one of the bigger players. Long term investors will be rewarded if they hold this stock and ride out any rough patches. For the more immediate traders, this stock is primed for a move higher as options were pricing in a move of 11.6% and the stock was up around 8% in after hours. The thing is, the shorts were probably looking to hammer this stock as good reports from CRM and WDAY failed to move those stocks. Given those ideas, don't be surprised if COUP runs up more than 15% today.Following this report, the stock deserves to be on your radar screen.Let's face it, there is just too much data to keep track of.

The company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate thrice and missed it once in the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 239.06%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 29 cents per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents. Revenues increased 39% year over year to $480 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $467 million. The strong revenue growth was driven by robust increase in its subscription revenues.Following strong fiscal first-quarter results, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2018. Revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $2.04-2.05 billion, up from the prior guidance of $2.01-$2.03 billion.Notably, Workday's shares have gained 56.7% year to date, significantly outperforming the  15.7% rally. The outperformance can be attributed to improving results as well as increasing adoption of its products in the market.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Workday's revenue growth is consistently driven by high demand for human capital management (HCM) and financial management applications. The company continues to win new customers, which demonstrate high demand for its applications.In Jun 2017, the company's existing HCM customers, 21st Century Fox and CNA Financial  , adopted Workday's financial management application, which reflects its growing clout in the market. The company added 29 new core financial management customers in the fiscal first quarter.The company's strong growth potential in both HCM and financial application space is further reflected in the market research firm Gartner's latest reports. In June 2017, the firm put Workday in the \"Leaders\" quadrant in its \"Magic Quadrant for Cloud Core Financial Management Suites for Midsize, Large, and Global Enterprises\" report. Again, Workday has recently been placed in the \"Leader\" quadrant in Gartner's \"Magic Quadrant for Cloud HCM Suites for Midmarket and Large Enterprises\" report.Workday Planning and Workday Learning - the two new applications of the company - have also demonstrated well in terms of sale by adding over 140 and 165 new customers, respectively, in the last-reported quarter. Further, the company's expansion in the  is also a positive.However, increasing competition in the HCM and financial software market could lead to pricing pressure and affect Workday's margins. Also, increasing investment in development programs remain a concern. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Workday is likely to deliver a positive surprise this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 235 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new March 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.20. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $90.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $102.89/share today.Because the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of WDAY stock at the current price level of $102.89/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $105.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.06% if the stock gets called away at the March 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if WDAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

It took all of two days for Elon's flagship to reclaim all that was lost during the June 9 tech drubbing. A banner year? You better believe it.A fist fight broke out on Wall Street this month as numerous bears decided to crash the party. As is often the case, the damage was meted out disproportionately. While large caps remained largely above the fray, small caps were in the thick of it. The  7% drubbing stands in stark contrast to the relatively unscathed 2.8% dip suffered by the  .On the sector front, technology gave as much as it got in the fracas, holding its own. Especially this week.Yesterday, the tech-heavy index led the fight by rallying 1.18%. The pop in the  (NASDAQ:  ) effectively doubled that of the S&P and Russell. That's some outperformance.To be fair, the strength didn't unexpectedly arise from the ether. Tuesday's bullish engulfing candle (mentioned in  ) signaled that buyers were on the move. They obviously pressed their advantage, delivering a trendline breakout on modest volume. The next stop should be resistance at $146, which will likely act as a magnet in the coming trading sessions. Source: OptionsAnalytixWhy all the talk of tech? Well, because PYPL stock calls the Nasdaq home. And as a result, it carries a strong correlation to QQQ.If Wednesday's launch was the beginning of a comeback in tech-land, then that can only bode well for bullish positions in PayPal stock.With the tech sector's posture now updated, we can analyze PYPL with renewed perspective. We begin, as usual, with the weekly time frame. Source: OptionsAnalytixEver since breaking out of its post-IPO base earlier this year, the stock has been on its best behavior. Down weeks have been a rarity due to the urgent buying beneath the surface. And it's not like the ascent has been driven by fluff.The past two earnings announcements delivered sufficient positive news to justify the price rise and provided reasons for further increases. Yesterday's jump carried PayPal stock above its five-week base marking yet another in a long line of buyable breakouts.And the daily time frame? Well, there's nothing not to like there, either. Source: OptionsAnalytixAs with all stocks perched at record highs, PYPL stock sits above all major moving averages. I find it particularly instructive that the 20-day moving average provided support for the past two weeks. Bears tried multiple times to take the stock below this oft-watched smoothing mechanism, but buyers weren't having it. The continual gobbling up of shares on each retest both confirmed and reinforced the underlying bid beneath the surface.And then resistance finally gave way.Admittedly, I would have preferred more volume accompanying yesterday's pop, but perhaps that's too much to ask in a sleepy August market. Regardless, the stock rallied all day and closed at the top of the range.If you think the record highs will bring all the buyers to the yard, consider grabbing call options to capitalize on further upside.  Your risk is limited to the initial cost and will be forfeited if the stock sits below $60 at expiration.More conservative traders seeking a higher-probability bet could instead  for 58 cents.

These companies were typically popular brand names, highly profitable, and going through a funk. It's a sound strategy. Following it will likely lead to market-beating returns. However, it's a strategy that eliminated an entire universe of soon-to-be great businesses that are in the early stages of the business lifecycle.In fact, of the best-performing stocks of the last 10 years, 3 are in the biotechnology industry and 3 are companies that never looked \"cheap\" by traditional metrics --  ,  , and  . These winners make it clear, traditional value investors may be missing out on an opportunity by ignoring well-managed, highly focused, growth companies.Lately, I've started thinking  (NYSE: WDAY) checks a lot of those boxes.One reason it's easy to shy away from growth stocks like Workday is that it is very difficult to model on a spreadsheet. When companies are growing revenue at a pace close to 40% a year, it's impractical to believe one can predict how long that growth can be sustained or how much it will slow down.An alternative strategy to gauge the growth potential of a high flyer like Workday is to look at the total addressable market, a term that is used to reference the total revenue potential of a company based on the size of the market it serves. Workday has earned most of its revenue selling human capital management (HCM) software in the cloud. As an early adopter of the cloud, Workday has shown success in obtaining customers who don't want to host software on their own computers and servers. They've also shown the ability to steal customers away from traditional on-premise software giants like  (NYSE: ORCL) .According to IDC estimates, the HCM market is estimated to be about $13 billion globally. By 2021, the HCM space is expected to grow to nearly $20 billion. With trailing twelve months of revenue of $1.6 billion, Workday has captured a meaningful portion of the HCM market but it still has room to grow. According to Workday, as of the end of its fiscal year ending 2016, over 895 customers made the switch from Oracle,  (NYSE: SAP) , NetSuite, and various payroll providers. In a recent CNBC interview with Jim Cramer, CEO Aneel Bhusri mentioned data from Goldman Sachs that shows it will continue to gain market share at the expense of traditional on-premise software vendors.Despite the gains in HCM software and Workday's potential in this space, the market alone is not large enough to justify Workday's 12-times-trailing-sales valuation. Even Executive Vice President Chano Fernandez hinted that despite its global potential, the U.S. market may be close to reaching a saturation point:To justify its valuation and give investors hope that it will grow significantly from today's prices, Workday needs to have success outside of HCM. It is looking to do just that by selling cloud services in the financial management and analytics space.The company may have hit an inflection point in the first quarter as it obtained  (NASDAQ: NDAQ) , Adventist HealthCare and Nuffield Health, the largest not-for-profit healthcare provider in the UK, as new customers. It also reported that two large existing HCM customers,  and  , will include financial management applications. According to IDC data, the HCM market is only half the size of the financials market, so if Workday can continue its strong momentum with financials, the company might blow past current growth expectations.Between human capital management, payroll, financials, analytics and the student business, Workday estimates its addressable market at $65 billionWorday Financial Management on an iPad. Image source: Workday, Inc.Workday's addressable market could grow from $65 billion as more companies adopt the cloud. However, there is another significant opportunity at Workday that hasn't been talked about much. At Workday's annual user conference, the company announced it will offer a platform as a service (PaaS) as it opens its technology to developers. \"The platform we will have is a business-run platform. It's a place where you would be able to extremely productively build sophisticated business applications using the Workday framework,\" stated technology executive David Clarke.Giving developers the ability to create applications to maximize the power of Workday is a significant step in opening new markets and creating loyalty. The strategy has been a significant source of business for SAP and  (NYSE: CRM) . Last year, SAP announced a partnership with Apple that allows corporate developers to build iOS apps utilizing SAP's HANA database technology.Salesforce AppExchange is a place where developers can sell and distribute apps created on the Salesforce platform. It currently houses over 3,000 apps. Just how important is the development platform to Salesforce? Earlier this month, Salesforce announced a $100 million fund to help developers, start-ups, or independent software vendors build and sell apps. Success stories of large applications built on the Salesforce platform include DocuSign and  . The latter is an $8.5 billion cloud software provider to the life sciences industry, which chose to renew its deal with Salesforce until 2025.It's too early to know if Workday can achieve the level of success as Salesforce and the rivals it aggressively chases. But the opportunity is there and the company has shown it is playing to win. The stock may look pricey now, but if Workday is able to show continued success in HCM, financials, and then expand its market with innovative technologies, today's price may turn out to be a bargain.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In that time, the stock has more than doubled, handily outpacing rivals  and  , which are up around 50% during the same period. data by Workday's returns since its IPO have been impressive, but peeling back the onion a bit, half that increase has occurred since the beginning of this year as Wall Street appears optimistic about improved offerings and increasing market share. With its recent run, it's understandable that investors would be hesitant to invest in a company that is still seeking profitability. In fact, many investors may be thinking about cashing in their chips. However, the company still appears to have room to run. Here are four reasons I like the company and its stock, even at today's prices.As Workday matures, it's only natural that growth at the company slows, which did happen for a time at Workday. The chart below shows Workday's quarterly revenue growth from its IPO until July 2016. data by However, since then, growth has picked up in every quarter, accelerating the most in the most recent quarter ending in April. data by Even more impressive is that Workday's bread-and-butter source of revenue, subscription fees, were up 42.7% in the last quarter, an increase from 39% during the same period last year. Over the last year, Workday has increased momentum with Workday Financial Management, the company's core finance and accounting management application, along with other add-on solutions. It has also succeeded in obtaining larger enterprise customers as the company said it had its highest growth in its annualized contract value in three years.One of the reasons for the uptick in revenue growth is the momentum in Workday Financial Management. In Q2, Workday added 29 new core financial management customers, including  and and Nuffield Health, the U.K.'s largest not-for-profit healthcare provider. Workday also announced deals with  and  .In addition to success in its financial management suite, Workday Planning, which offers the ability to collaborate on financial and workforce plans, now boasts over 140 customers, which CEO Aneel Bhusri called one its best new product launches. Workday Learning, its learning management system, is up to 165 customers. The company is not resting on the laurels of its past successes either, as the company looks to gain momentum in its new analytics offerings. Bhusri made the following comment in the company's latest  [transcript via  ] :The HCM [human capital management] field is where Workday has had most of its success. Although not all its sales are related to HCM, with trailing-12-month revenue of $1.7 billion and a total addressable market estimated by IDC at $13 billion, Workday still has ways to go in capturing more share. However, analytics and financials are estimated to be $19 billion and $27 billion markets, respectively. If Workday can capture meaningful market share in these areas, its growth may prove to be in the early innings.As a pure SaaS [software as a service] provider, Workday is more attractive to smaller budgets that may put on-premise solutions out of reach. Therefore, it's a natural fit for the mid-size market where it has seen a lot of success.Workday Financial Management user interface on mobile devices. Image source: Workday, Inc.With Nasdaq and 21 st Century Fox, Workday has shown it can succeed with larger enterprises, too. However, the company had even bigger wins in the HCM space. This year, the company has added  ,  , and  as customers. Qantas Airways also signed up, covering 45,000 employees in 26 countries. Human capital management is Workday's strength. Now that it has its foot in the door with heavy hitters, expect the company to make inroads in the much larger financial management market.Workday stock currently trades at over 12 times sales. Salesforce, which has a business model comparable to Workday, is trading at 7 times sales. Despite Salesforce being a more mature company, Workday still appears richly valued at first glance. However, I believe it may still have room to run.Last summer, Oracle purchased cloud enterprise resource planning provider Netsuite for $9.3 billion, a valuation of 11 times NetSuite's previous 12 months revenue, which could provide insight into what Workday is worth. This acquisition provides a good yardstick for Workday as Netsuite exhibited 15 straight quarters of revenue growth over 30% prior to the acquisition -- a feat accomplished by Workday over a longer time frame. With the overall market trading at higher levels than last summer, especially among tech companies, paying 12 times sales for a company with Workday's growth is not far off from what Oracle paid for NetSuite.Additionally, Workday boasts a market capitalization of $21 billion. Salesforce was a $21 billion company in July 2011. At that time, similar to Workday, it also traded around 12 times sales with revenue just under $2 billion. Not too many analysts or investors would have called the company undervalued. Today, Salesforce sports a market capitalization just under $65 billion, triple its value from 2011. Whether Workday can execute as well as Salesforce remains to be seen, but between human capital management, financial management, and analytics, Workday's total addressable market is estimated to be over $65 billion. According to  , the customer relationship market in which Salesforce specializes is estimated to be $36.5 billion in 2017. Although there are no guarantees that Workday can become as successful as Salesforce, I see many similarities between the two companies.Between accelerating revenue growth, the addition of successful product lines, and signing up big customers, Workday has a lot going for it. This has been reflected in the stock price. However, the market may just be underestimating how large Workday may become.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

An expanding gross margin is a sign of a desirable product or service, strong pricing power, and an increasing economic moat. And if a company can grow revenue at the same time it is increasing its margin, all the better.Often, a young company, especially in Silicon Valley, will sacrifice its margin and profitability to win market share. However, there is one software creator that has managed to expand its margin while maintaining strong growth. In fact, over five-plus years as a public company,  (NYSE: WDAY) has steadily increased gross profit from 51% in fiscal-year 2012 to about 71% in its most recent quarter.Data by  .Meanwhile, annual revenue has grown from just under $135 million to nearly $1.6 billion over that same period.Digging into the company's financial statements, it becomes obvious that the main driver of higher profitability is the reduced size of the professional services segment relative to the software subscription business. Professional services fees are charged to customers for assistance with software deployment, optimization, and training. The work can be performed by the Workday staff, a third party, or a combination of the two. It's an important service to provide, as a successful deployment leads to increased customer success and satisfaction. However, it's also a very low-margin business. As shown in the chart below, professional services are almost sold at cost:Data source: Workday. Chart by author.The professional services segment is still growing with the rest of the business. In the most recent fiscal quarter, it grew revenue 18.7% year over year. However, over 80% of the company's top line comes from highly profitable software subscriptions, which were up 43%. Since Workday has increased subscription revenue at a much faster pace than professional services, the software provider has become less dependent on the latter:\n  \nSubscription and professional services revenue as % of total revenue. Data source: Workday. Table by author.Investors should expect this trend to continue. Workday offers its customers numerous training options to support them in configuring and administering its services. The company also expects customers to engage directly with its partner firms for assistance with deployment, training, and optimization. Given the lack of profitability from professional services, investors should view this as a positive development.That said, what should really get investors excited is how the company is growing profits in the subscription business. During the past five years, Workday has steadily increased its margin from 79% in fiscal year 2013 to 85% in its most recent quarter:Data source: Workday. Chart by author.After seeing a dip in fiscal 2017, Workday is off to a strong start this year, reporting gross margin of 84.1% during the first quarter and and 85% in the second. Workday hasn't publicly spoken to this progress, but one reason could be the company's ability to scale as it gets larger. Workday did announce its highest growth rate in three years for average contract value.A further shift in the sales mix can also affect profitability. The company is making successful inroads with Workday Financial Management. It also recently announced the deployment of two analytic and reporting tools, Workday Financial Performance Management and Prism Analytics. Whether these newer tools are more or less profitable than Human Capital Management remains to be seen, but the fact that the company was able to achieve 85% gross margin last quarter is a good sign of progress.Growing revenue and profitability is proving to be a powerful combination for Workday. Looking at the numbers from the latest quarter, it appears that promising trend is going to continue.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NYSE: WDAY) is no secret. As noted elsewhere, I believe the company is still  .Despite my affinity for the cloud provider, it isn't without its risks. Workday stock is prone to volatility, especially now that it's trading at 12 times trailing sales and its stock price has already run up about 50% year to date. But volatility, the traditional Wall Street measure of risk, is not what keeps me up at night. Given my time horizon of at least five years, I'm more concerned about risks that may permanently impair the company.Image source: Getty Images.Workday was co-founded by former PeopleSoft executives David Duffield and Aneel Bhusri. Mr. Duffield had founded PeopleSoft, which was ultimately purchased by  (NYSE: ORCL) in a hostile takeover. Mr. Duffield now serves as the chairman at Workday. Mr. Bhusri, who ended his career at PeopleSoft as vice chairman, serves as CEO of Workday. He is also a partner at Greylock Partners, the venture-capital group that was an early investor in  , Dropbox, and Airbnb.Duffield and Bhusri are both reported to be billionaires; neither needs the money. They could live prosperous lives without the heartaches of running a 7,000-employee company -- especially Duffield, who is 73 years old. However, they continue to lead the company through aggressive growth. That dedication comes not from money, but from a desire to build something special. Also, despite their not admitting it publicly, I believe both Duffield and Bhusri are out for Oracle's blood.I'm a fan of founder-led companies. With a dual-share class structure, Duffield and Bhusri have voting control over Workday and control its destiny. Given their expertise, past success, and pride in the business, I'm OK with that. However, if one or both were to leave Workday, that would be reason enough to sell my shares.Cultivating Workday's employee-first culture is a big part of the company's strategy. Sports clubs, cocktail Fridays, yoga classes, and bringing dogs to the workplace are the norm at the company; Workday goes the extra mile for its employees, and it shows. The company is ranked highly as a top employer in lists from  , Glassdoor, and LinkedIn. CEO Aneel Bhusri was also given an approval rating of 90% on Glassdoor, while 72% of employees would recommend Workday to a friend.Whether or not the company can sustain a strong culture as it grows is questionable. Despite strong Glassdoor ratings, the ratings trend has recently come down, falling from an overall rating above four stars (out of five) in recent years to 3.8 stars today.In the first-quarter conference call last year, Mr. Bhusri acknowledged the growing pains:Headquartered in Pleasanton, California, Workday is a stone's throw away from where I live. Every encounter I have had with a current or former Workday employee has been positive, and most rave about the company.However, as companies go from start-up to grown-up, there can be some challenges. Given Mr. Bhusri's focus on culture, I believe Workday can work through those challenges. But if I see further signs of a deteriorating workplace, it would be cause for concern.According to IDC estimates, the human capital management (HCM) market is estimated to be about $13 billion globally; by 2021, the HCM space is expected to grow to nearly $20 billion. With trailing-12-month revenue of $1.6 billion, Workday has captured a meaningful portion of the HCM market. Despite the gains in HCM software and Workday's potential in this space, this market alone is not large enough to justify Workday's valuation of 12 times trailing sales. Even executive VP Chano Fernandez hinted (in the June conference call) that despite HCM's global potential, the U.S. market may be close to reaching a saturation point, saying: \"We are still in early days globally for HCM, the period that U.S. markets are more mature but opportunities outside of the U.S. remain robust.\"Workday Financial Management is the company's foray into a much larger, yet more competitive, market. The total addressable market for financials is estimated to be $27 billion. The company has also begun providing financial and human-resource analytics tools that have a market potential of $19 billion. The company has shown early success in these markets, but it will need to continue to win customers and take market share for the stock to be a success going forward.As a cloud-computing leader in HCM, Workday has proven itself to be a mighty competitor to nemesis Oracle. It is also looking to capture even more share in financials and analytics. Although Workday is not without its risks, with its strong leadership and dedicated employees, I believe the company is set up to do just that.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Workday's operating loss of $60.2 million was 12.5% of total revenue of $479.9 million, a considerable improvement over the loss of $70.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, which equaled 20.6% of total revenue of $347.7 million. data by  .Workday managed the operational improvement by holding product-development costs and general and administrative costs roughly even with the previous quarter. But the company benefited most from rapid growth in its subscription services, which expanded at a rate of nearly 43%. A decrease of 1.5 percentage points in the costs associated with subscription services provided much-needed operational leverage. Finally, a decline of four percentage points in sales and marketing expenses relative to revenue also contributed to the lower overall loss.Investors should take note of one cautionary metric which may merit attention in future quarters. While total  grew 31% year over year, the noncurrent portion decreased 6%. Management attributed this drop to fewer customers renewing subscriptions which last more than one year.Image source: Getty Images.On Workday's  on June 1, management expressed confidence in customer-acquisition trends in both the organization's Workday HCM (Human Capital Management) product and its Financial Management application suite.

Workday is also projecting top-line growth of 35% to 36% in the second quarter.

The company projects double-digit earnings growth.Management expects cloud capital expenditure spending to be about $1 billion in fiscal 2017, roughly equivalent to fiscal 2017 level.ARR is projected to be better than fiscal 2017. Further, management anticipates SaaS gross margin to eventually rise to 80% in the long haul.Oracle continues to gain traction on its cloud endeavors. Specifically, the company's offerings in SaaS and PaaS have gained significant momentum in the past few quarters, which improves competitive position against salesforce.com and Workday.

Trends keep trending, volume remains subdued and the market drifts to little fanfare. Thursday was  one of those days. Small-caps stole the show in a take-no-prisoners rally that left bears shellshocked. That's right, friends. The  (NYSEARCA:  ) - long since left in the dust by its larger-cap brethren - is back!Not wanting to disappoint, I pulled out my charts and went to town on some whiz-bang analysis and a trade, which you'll find below. The IWM soared just shy of 2% on heavy, heavy volume yesterday. The only thing that stopped the advance was the closing bell.It's a wonderful example of sector rotation. While tech stocks cooled their jets - the  (NYSEARCA:  ) rallied a scant 0.25% - retail, biotech, oil and financial stocks were all revving their engines.Small-caps have been stuck in neutral virtually the entire year. IWM entered Thursday's trading session virtually unchanged in 2017. Compared to the Nasdaq's substantial gains we're talking about some serious underperformance in IWM. Not that delta-neutral option sellers are complaining. A sideways shuffle is just what the doctor ordered for credit spread and condor sellers.Take note of the Comparative Relative Strength () indicator shown in the lower panel of the accompanying weekly chart. Its downtrend over the past six months confirms IWM's weak-sauce behavior. Source: OptionsAnalytixBut if Thursday's pop is a sign of things to come, we could finally see IWM start trending again.The base that has formed in recent months could serve as a launchpad for small-caps next ascent. Breaking out of a long-term base is quite the promising technical setup. As the old saw goes, \"the longer the base, the higher in space.\" While we're a ways from a breakout (IWM needs to climb above $141), this is certainly one potential outcome worth anticipating.For greater detail, let's drill down to the daily chart, and then we'll tackle a trade idea.Though moving averages carry little significance during trading ranges, it's worth noting today's rally lifted IWM back above both its 20- and 50-day moving averages. Source: OptionsAnalytixThe fund breached a short-term descending trendline (dotted black line) today as well. If buyers press their advantage here, we could see continuation to the upper end of its multimonth range near $141.I also like that the relative strength indicator was able to pop above its descending trendline showing the return of outperformance. Time will tell if it holds, but buyers have definitely established a foothold here.If you're interested in upping your exposure to small-caps, consider buying a bull call spread.The long call vertical consists of buying to open the Jul$138 call while selling to open the Jul $142 call for around $2.00. The max risk is limited to the initial $2 cost, but to lose the whole nut, you would need to ride all the way to expiration and have the IWM ETF sitting below $138.The max reward is limited to the spread width ($4) minus the initial debit, or $2. To capture the entire gain, IWM needs to rise above $142 by expiration.By risking $2 to win $2, the spread offers a potential 100% reward.The post ): Small Caps Are Breaking Out! appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NYSE:  ) recently reported data from one of its two lead ongoing migraine programs. The headline data was positive - though you wouldn't know it, looking at TEVA stock - and the trial hit its primary endpoint. Alongside the numbers, Teva reported that it is set to submit a Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at some point during the third quarter of this year. Source: At a glance, there looks to be nothing we might consider as being a red flag in the safety data. Despite all this, however, and after an initial spike at market open, TEVA shares traded down on its Tuesday close (the market close immediately preceding the news).In other words, markets aren't happy with what hit the press.Here's why this is the case and a look at what it all means for Teva and a number of its competitors in this space going forward.Let's look at the drug in question. It's called fremanezumab, and it's part of a family of drugs called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors. To understand why and how it works, it's first important to understand a bit about migraines as a condition and the current (and legacy) standard of care (SOC) therapies in the space.Migraines are a big market. Evidence  that more than 37 million individuals in the US alone, or around 12% of the total population, suffer from migraine attacks on a regular basis, and right now, there is a distinct lack of effective therapies available to these millions of sufferers. That is, therapies that work consistently and reliably in a large portion of the population in question.For a long time - and we're talking the past 50 years - therapies targeting migraines have had an associated mechanism of action (MOA) that targets vasodilation. The idea is that vasodilation in the blood vessels causes pressure on certain areas of the brain and that it is this pressure that results in the pain experienced by the sufferer.As a bit of a reference point, this vasodilation is the opposite of what causes a traditional headache, which is increased pressure as a result of vasoconstriction. This is why painkillers that work for headaches won't work for migraines; they could actually contribute to the migraine severity.Anyway, I digress.More recently, scientists have increasingly subscribed to the suggestion that migraine pain is caused by the above-mentioned CGRP.  that when a patient suffers from migraine, expression of this peptide increases dramatically, and the theory is that this peptide amplifies the transmission of pain signals within the brain. This amplification results in the intense pain associated with the condition, and not the vasodilation on which many of the current treatments are based.Needless to say, if there is credence to this suggestion, and if a company can get a drug to market that bases its MOA on the reduction of CGRP expression, there's a massive potential market waiting for it.Analysts suggest it's about a $6 billion market globally.That's what Teva is trying to do. Its drug, as mentioned, is called fremanezumab, and it's designed as a CGRP inhibitor. Basically, it inhibits the activation of the peptide, which is the above outlined theory is correct, should stop the amplified transmission of pain across the brain when a migraine patient suffers an attack.As mentioned in the introduction to this piece, Teva's numbers look good.The phase III was called HALO and it looked at the drug when used in a population that suffers from chronic migraines, defined as more than 15 headache days per month over a three-month period of which more than eight are migrainous, in the absence of medication over use. It's the more serious of the two classifications, with the second being episodic migraines as defined as less than 15 headache days per month.As per the latest data, then, patients treated with fremanezumab experienced a statistically significant reduction, reported at -2.5, in the number of monthly headache days of at least moderate severity vs. placebo during the 12-week period after first dose. Further, this extended across both dosing regimens - monthly, -4.6 days, and quarterly, -4.3 days. Looking g at the safety profile, the most commonly-reported adverse event in the study was injection site pain, with similar rates in the placebo and active groups. No problems there.Basically, there's no argument as to whether the drug works. It does. And it's safe and tolerable. Readers that have had migraines will know that a bit of injection site pain is nothing compared to the debilitating effect of the condition when it hits.So what's the problem?Well, this is where the competition comes into the equation.As mentioned, there are a number of companies trying to force their own CGRP assets along their respective development pathways.  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) have joined forces on a CGRP asset called erenumab.  (NYSE:  ) just put out phase III data two trials of its CGRP asset galcanezumab last month (also positive).  (NASDAQ:  ) did the same for ALD403 earlier this quarter.Right now, it looks like there won't be too much of a time difference between a bunch of different assets hitting markets. This has left investors looking at safety and efficacy as a way to differentiate between the companies that are likely to pick up the lion's share of the market when they reach commercialization.The above mentioned programs have all read out ahead of Teva, and the hope was that the company could differentiate its drug, and get ahead of the pack, with some strong efficacy data from this readout. Unfortunately, there's practically no difference between these numbers and data already put out by any of the others.Well, CGRP is going to be a big market - of that there's no doubt. Between now and end 2018, we're probably going to see at least three different CGRP drugs hit the shelves, each of which will backed by hefty, big pharma size marketing budgets.It's also going to be fragmented. With no discernible difference between one CGRP asset and another, chances are we're looking at a pretty even market share for each player in the space.For the individual companies, this is disappointing. For an investor wanting to gain exposure to the $6 billion market, there's only one real strategy available right now: spread across each of the three major CGRP assets through an exposure to the four major players behind them, Novartis, Amgen Eli, and now, TEVA stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NYSE:  ) shares have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $97.57 for each share of WDAY stock. When an investment like WDAY stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction to Workday Inc price movement may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 35 different analyst targets contributing to that average for WDAY stock, but the average is just that - a mathematical average.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new July 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $91.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $99.23/share today.Because the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of WDAY stock at the current price level of $99.23/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $100.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.81% if the stock gets called away at the July 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if WDAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing WDAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $100.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Yes, Snap has done some innovative things and might be more loved by younger users, but user growth is already slowing relatively early in Snapchat's life, and worse, the stock is richly valued while profitability is elusive.Meanwhile, aforementioned Facebook - which tried to buy Snap but was rebuffed - has been fighting the company by shamelessly copying its features.SNAP stock has little upside from here. And these are two of the biggest reasons why.Some see Snap and other companies such as  (NASDAQ:  ) as evidence of a  . I don't know about that, but I find it difficult to argue against the view that Snap is richly valued.SNAP stock trades at a whopping  times sales. Keep in mind that this valuation is for Snap Inc, a company founded in 2010 that never turned a profit and was projected to lose  (more than Tesla and Twitter  !) \u2026 before the company reported it lost $2.2 billion in just the first quarter alone!As  noted, Snapchat trades at a higher price-to-sales multiple than other internet companies like Facebook and  (NASDAQ:  ) did when they first listed. Facebook traded at 8.64 times sales when it listed in 2012, and Alphabet stock changed hands at 14 times sales when it went public in 2004. So Snap isn't just at a higher multiple - it's higher by several times over.And Facebook and Alphabet were profitable at the time they went public, unlike Snap.Does this seem reasonable to you?Bulls will say, \"OK, maybe Snap trades at a high price-to-sales ratio, but keep in mind Snap's revenue grew 589% in 2016.\"Fine, but even when you factor in forecast growth, the company doesn't look cheap.

The market has very high expectations of Snap's future growth, and if Snap disappoints, investors will punish the stock.Internet companies like Snap can grow two different ways.

Snap appears to be saturating its target demographic; Samadhi Partners estimated that a whopping  between the ages of 18 and 24 uses Snapchat.And Facebook, Snapchat's archenemy, is copying Snap's best features on Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, and this appears to be affecting Snap's growth. Snap's quarterly daily active user growth  after introduction of Instagram Stories.Snap may face difficulty expanding overseas, given founder Evan Spiegel's alleged comments about  (Snap denies these comments, calling it the work of a disgruntled former employee).One of Snap's growth engines appears stalled; in the future, Snap's growth will depend more heavily on ARPU growth.Snap faces several risks that could potentially drag the stock down. Valuations are at stratospheric levels, and the company is bleeding out billions of dollars this year.Not only is Snap not profitable; Snap is burning cash like there's no tomorrow. As  of  noted, Snap has the distinction of being one of the few companies she's ever seen to boast a cost of revenue higher than its revenue.And if that weren't enough, one of Snap's two growth engines, user growth, is petering out; slowing user growth means Snap will rely more on ARPU growth.There's a small bull case, but it can't shout over the bears.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["At the start of April,  (NASDAQ:  ) launched the Titan Xp, its new flagship and what was billed as the \"world's most powerful graphics card.\"  (NASDAQ:  ) did not take long to respond.

And while AMD is still gunning to have its GPUs inside high-end gaming PCs - especially ones running demanding virtual reality applications - the company is aiming for another target demographic with this card.It describes the Radeon Vega Frontier Edition as empowering the next generation of data scientists, visualization professionals and digital pioneers.If that messaging isn't clear enough, AMD starts the Radeon Vega Frontier Edition announcement with this intro:\"Who are the pioneers?

Flynn.The White House denied that anything of the sort was said, but for now, the three key words that everyone is now focused on are \"obstruction of justice.\"Obstruction of justice is an impeachable offense that requires the government to establish a few things, most notably that \"the defendant corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which the proceeding was pending.\" Legal analysts are debating whether, if what Comey said is true, what Trump said would constitute this federal offense.Rep.

BBRY then received another boost in early April when the company earned a $814.9 million arbitration award from  (NASDAQ:  ) in a dispute over the latter's royalty cap program.However, BlackBerry has been jolted again over the past two days, climbing nearly 9% in the wake of the WannaCry malware outbreak.

While I'd typically be the first to admit that chasing a stock like this is a low-probability strategy, WDAY stock currently sports one of the most bullish technical patterns that should reward both investors and traders.Not wanting to disappoint, I pulled out my charts and went to town on some whiz-bang analysis and a trade, which you'll find below. Before discussing the pattern and digging into the charts, I would be remiss not to make you aware of Workday's next earnings announcement, scheduled for June 1.All of this depends on how the stock acts in the next couple of weeks.When it comes to technical analysis, there's no shortage of \"patterns\" one can construct either bullish or bearish trades around. However, in my nearly 20 years of trading experience, I can tell you that not all patterns are created equal. Some are more likely to lead to profitable trades than others.One of the highest-probability technical patterns is called the \"inverse head-and-shoulders pattern,\" which has bullish implications for the asset in question.Workday currently has one of these patterns on display.On the multiyear chart, we see that WDAY recently broke past the black horizontal (or slightly diagonal) line. This line is what we refer to as the \"neck line\" of the pattern.Click to EnlargeNote the three blue bubbles I marked on the charts. Those from left to right are the left shoulder, head and right shoulder respectively (hence the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern).Also note that WDAY stock had several attempts at trying to overcome this line of resistance around the $90 mark. But this week, it finally managed to break higher.More often than not, a big-picture breakout over time leads to a check-back to the breakout line. In this case, that means the $90 area. This type of check-back may be in the cards following Workday's upcoming earnings announcement - or earlier, depending on how the stock reacts between now and June 1.Regardless, through a multiyear lens, this is a bullish chart that ultimately should find it easy to move well into the $120s or higher.On the daily chart, we see that this week's breakout has cleanly pushed the stock above the $90 mark.Click to EnlargeWhile the move may already be somewhat overbought in the near-term, momentum looks to be on the side of Workday. I don't want to fight that.As such, traders could look to establish an initial long position in WDAY stock at current levels to position themselves for much higher gains over time, as per the above chart.

The cloud-based enterprise software firm unexpectedly reported its second straight quarter of positive earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter. Wall Street now sees increasing profitability as the company grabs market share from giants  (  ) and  (  ).[ibd-display-video id=541265 width=50 float=left] On June 1, analysts expect Workday to report that fiscal Q1 earnings surged 220% to 16 cents a share excluding various items. Revenue likely rose 35% to $467.33 million. After a 12-cent profit in fiscal 2017, the company's first year in the black, analysts project EPS to accelerate to 51 cents, 81 cents, and $1.32 over the next three years.Workday provides human capital management and payroll software and has recently expanded into financial applications. Its investment in new products and features and its ability to maintain a high customer-satisfaction rate bodes well, according to Credit Suisse analyst Michael Nemeroff.\"Our subscription revenue estimates imply continued market-share gains in both the HCM and Financial applications markets due to WDAY's best-of-breed capabilities and competitive advantages in its large and growing total addressable market,\" Nemeroff said in an April report.Workday mostly targets larger companies, boasting FANG stocks  (  ) and  (  ) as two premier clients. But it also serves retail giants  (WMT) and  (TGT) as well as big biotech  (AMGN).Workday finished January with 1,528 human capital management customers, including 136 Fortune 500 companies.Existing top-tier customers are contributing to Workday's growth as many are signing contracts for additional product offerings.\"There are many cases in the first several years of (our human-resources product) where we won the HR deal, but they don't want to touch payroll and now our payroll attach rate is over 60%,\" CEO Aneel Bhusri said on Workday's fiscal Q4 conference call on Feb. 27.Bhusri noted on that call that Netflix is one of five Fortune 500 companies that has signed up for Workday's new financial performance management software.\"We are really well-positioned to run the tables within that enterprise (client) when they do move their transactional platform as well,\" he said.Credit Suisse calls Workday the leading vendor in cloud HCM applications \"for upper midmarket and large enterprises.\"Workday has reorganized to better accommodate companies of different sizes. The company has divided its North America business into two groups - large enterprise and medium enterprise - from the account executive level to the sales and services levels.After hitting a nine-month low of 65.79 on Dec. 30, shares closed Friday at 99.99, near their best levels since their early-2014 all-time high. Workday shares cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 92.56 buy point in heavy volume on May 15. The stock is now extended from the 5% buy range, but if it pulls back in light volume - as some leaders do - it could provide investors with another chance to purchase shares.The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of 99, yet it's still ranked seventh in the highly rated enterprise software industry group.Workday says that continued into the most recently reported quarter. \"The win rates against SAP and Oracle were as high as they have been in recent memory,\" CEO Bhusri said on the Q4 call.Despite expectations for strong revenue growth and margin expansion over the next few years, Credit Suisse and Benchmark both initiated coverage on Workday's stock in April with a neutral, or hold, rating.\"We are wary of intense competition in its core target Human Capital Management (HCM) market, which continues to drive pricing pressure, unfavorable billings terms and lengthening sales cycle,\" Benchmark analyst Yun Kim said in an April 26 report. But Kim did highlight Workday's successful execution, citing \"strong product positioning and superior customer references.\"Meanwhile, Nemeroff said there are not yet signs of \"accelerated momentum\" in large clients for Workday's financial management software, due to the risk and complexity of switching core financial applications to the cloud.But he notes that IDC projects the cloud-based financial applications software market will reach $9.5 billion in 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 12%.Workday could adjust its outlook on the next quarterly call, but last forecast fiscal 2018 revenue of $2.005 billion to $2.025 billion, or growth of 27% to 29%.

While it's had its shares of ups and downs over the decades, the technology giant has still gone on to enjoy a total return to investors of more than 104,000%. Yes, you read that right.Such growth is rare indeed, but finding the next Microsoft is still a worthwhile pursuit. So we asked three Motley Fool contributors to name a company they think is similarly positioned today. Read on to find out why they believe  (NASDAQ: TSLA) ,  (NASDAQ: NTES) , and  (NYSE: WDAY) are just where Microsoft was back in 1986.Image source: Tesla. Tesla has been a public company for seven years, putting it not quite at the same point in its growth stage as Microsoft in 1986, and it has already offered up returns of nearly 1,200% for investors, far outstripping the performance of the tech icon. But there's no reason it can't continue growing at such a torrid pace in the decades to come.There are, of course, its electric cars, which are transforming the automotive industry. In its first-quarter earnings report, Tesla reported that deliveries surged 69% to 25,051 vehicles, more than  for the period while losses narrowed.Perhaps more notable is what's about to come. The Model 3 is due in July, and that will be where the rubber of Tesla's car ambitions hits the road. These will be its first cars priced for the mass market, and that should help it quintuple annual production by next year to its planned 500,000 vehicles.What could be of even greater importance down the road, though, even though it's currently just a small fraction of its portfolio, is its energy generation and storage division, which is looking to become profitable rather than just driving growth for its own sake. Tesla's earnings release noted, \"Rather than prioritizing the growth of (megawatts) of solar deployed at any cost, we are selectively deploying projects that have higher margin and generate cash up front.\" So even though deployments have fallen year over year, they generated better results.From its residential energy storage products such as the Powerwall 2, and inverters for the home or business and industrial uses, as well as solar roofing tiles that should begin production very soon, Tesla has the potential to ramp up phenomenal growth in what promises to be a burgeoning business.Pursuing profits instead of simply growth in futuristic industries that exist and are needed today, Tesla can easily rival what Microsoft achieved, and perhaps sooner.Image source: Getty Images. Chinese online media, communications, and commerce company NetEase is a powerhouse in the gaming industry. The company makes a mint hosting online games that it created, as well as third-party products, serving as the gateway partner for gaming companies seeking to enter the lucrative Chinese market. The company earns attractive margins on that business, averaging more than 60% during the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, that business continues to grow at a brisk pace, up 60% during the fourth quarter.But while NetEase has already done a fantastic job expanding its gaming business over the years, its best days still appear to lie ahead. First of all, only about half of China's population is even online at the moment, suggesting plenty of growth potential as more people in that country discover the internet and then NetEase's portals. Meanwhile, the company is looking to expand into countries other than China, which could increase the number of gamers on its network.However, gaming is just part of the NetEase story, because the company is investing to diversify beyond just that industry. It already owns briskly growing email and e-commerce businesses that currently deliver a quarter of its revenue. Meanwhile, the company is investing in new technologies such as virtual reality that have the potential to add more sources of growth.Because of the company's rapidly expanding core online gaming business and growing opportunity set, when I look at NetEase, I see a stock that feels like it that has the potential to deliver Microsoft-like market-smashing returns for decades to come.Image source: Workday. Way back in 1986, Microsoft was a company poised to make many of its early investors extraordinarily wealthy by 2000. Of course, it's incredibly difficult to uncover the next Microsoft, but Workday offers investors explosive growth and could be a long-term winner.Workday is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider offering enterprise resource planning software for medium to large enterprises. Basically, Workday sells cloud-based applications for finance and human resources, and its products have been on fire, in a good way. Workday's fiscal 2017 revenues jumped 35% over the prior year and totaled $1.57 billion. Its subscription revenue was up 39% year over year, and the fourth quarter put the finishing touches on a strong year, as it was the best quarter in company history.The advantage for Workday is that most companies have finance and human resources software that serve as expensive corporatewide solutions requiring updates. Workday is different in the sense that it sells its software on an as-needed basis, and that software is continually updated on the cloud. Now Workday enters into its potential growth-story phase and has introduced additional applications for hiring and recruiting, payroll processing, and even supply-chain planning and management software.Workday is far from a guaranteed winner for investors, however, and the young company battles two huge competitors in  and  . But Workday has won more than its fair share of customers, and if the company can string together a couple of big-time customer wins and develop its newer applications, it could be the beginning of a long-term success story for investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 37 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Workday Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $61.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $114.00. The standard deviation is $11.03.But the whole reason to look at the  WDAY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with WDAY crossing above that average target price of $89.68/share, investors in WDAY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $89.68 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $55 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.4% return against the $55 commitment, or a 3.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to WDAY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $55 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Workday Inc sees its shares decline 35.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $51.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.50 from $55), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put at the $55 strike for the 3.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Workday Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $84.89) to be 33%.

When the general economy is doing well, or even booming, the industry usually isn't far behind. When growth slows or a recession strikes, the appetite for construction projects takes a big hit. Luckily for investors, we're currently in the midst of a broad economic expansion.That has made construction companies, and specifically those of cement and concrete manufacturers, some of the best-performing stocks over the last three years.  and  have nearly tripled the returns of the S&P 500 during that period, while the smaller  (NASDAQ: USCR) has gained an incredible 181%.Although there are great fundamentals supporting the stock's rise, investors appear to be suspicious. Slightly over 28% of the the company's shares are traded short, according to numbers compiled by Yahoo! Finance. There's no denying that shares have outperformed most other stocks, but I think investors are wrong to bet against U.S. Concrete. Here's why.Image source: Getty Images.The stock trades at an eye-popping 125 times trailing earnings, but there's an innocent, if not downright weird, explanation. It may sound odd, but the better the stock performs, the bigger the company's GAAP net loss becomes. That's because U.S. Concrete must account for non-cash derivative gains and losses from fair value changes in its issued warrants when the stock price moves down or up, respectively, in any given period.The good news is that recent quarterly GAAP net losses have no impact on the company's cash position and have not had major impacts on the share price. The great news is that operations have maintained a strong level of performance for several years in a row.U.S. Concrete notched $75 million in operating income and $1.17 billion in revenue in 2016. Those metrics grew 235% and 95%, respectively, from the performance achieved three years ago. Operating cash flow reached $112 million last year, which was well above the $24 million achieved in 2013.In other words, the stock has certainly earned its 181% gain in the last three years. data by  .That said, there's a strong case to be made that the company's growth isn't over. Unlike other cement and concrete manufacturers, U.S. Concrete has strategically (and almost exclusively) focused on major metropolitan areas in Texas, New York/New Jersey, and northern California. Those markets were responsible for 38%, 31%, and 25%, respectively, of total revenue in 2016. There are several advantages to that strategy that short-sellers may be overlooking.First, it allows the company to strategically acquire assets to become a major and dominant player in each region and city. Consider that in 2016 alone, U.S. Concrete acquired four smaller ready-mix concrete operators in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. The acquisitions provided the company with 10 ready-mix concrete plants and 189 mixer trucks. In addition to swiping away competition, the acquisitions allow the company to make more competitive bids on larger projects. And in New York City, there are some pretty big projects.In fact, the company supplied the concrete that built the new World Trade Center Complex, including Freedom Tower, which was the highest height concrete has ever been pumped in North America. Expansions at LaGuardia Airport and the Modern Museum of Art were also aided by the company, as are other major ongoing projects in the New York, Dallas-Fort Worth, and San Francisco metropolitan areas.Second, extending its leadership position in each major market allows U.S. Concrete to have a greater influence on product pricing. The fourth quarter of 2016 marked the 23rd straight quarter that the company achieved year-over-year ready-mix concrete price increases. That has an obviously beneficial impact on revenue and margins, and it has played a huge role in the company's industry-leading margins in the ready-mix concrete segment. Whereas the average material spread margin in the industry was 45% last year, U.S. Concrete achieved 49.2%. data by  .Third, operating in urban environments allows the company to benefit from environmental considerations and initiatives, such as LEED building certifications. Humans manufacture more cement than any other material. Unfortunately, cement is also one of the most carbon-intensive materials to produce, accounting for 5% of  each year. While certain materials can be substituted into cement production processes, they can significantly alter the performance of mixed concrete. In other words, it's not easy being green.Luckily, U.S. Concrete is a leading producer of low CO2 concrete. The company's EF Technology can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with cement production by between 42% and 46%. Today, over 30% of concrete used by the company benefits from the technology. That allows it to place highly competitive bids on major construction projects with LEED requirements -- an increasingly important consideration. That's especially true in environmentally conscious San Francisco, where the company has won projects including the Google Bayview Campus, the Workday Campus, and even the Golden State Warriors Arena.It takes a bit of digging around the company's primary strategy and the driving forces for the industry at large, but I think short-sellers are wrong about this stock. The only way short-sellers could be right about U.S. Concrete stock is if the American economy heads for a slowdown, which would have much broader consequences. While that's not impossible -- in fact, with recessions occurring every eight years or so, we're \"due\" for one -- it's unlikely to sneak up on investors. The company works off of a backlog of projects that are agreed to years prior, which provides fair warning to shareholders of potential trouble on the horizon.

While Oracle returned 19%, the industry gained 9.3% over the same period.During the conference call, Oracle's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mark Hurd acknowledged Netsuite ERP as its \"biggest pillar\" for future growth in the ERP market. This should help calm down nerves of Netsuite customers, who may have thought of discarding Netsuite ERP solutions, post its acquisition by Oracle.Traditionally, Oracle is not well-known for maintaining high-levels of customer satisfaction, which had prompted many customers to select rival solutions. Sensing that this trend can worry existing Netsuite customers, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Larry Ellison had vowed during the acquisition that he will pull out all stops to stay ahead of rivals, according to The New York Times.Moreover, the acquisition will help Oracle expand into the small and medium business (SMB) segment, where it does not have a strong presence. Per Bloomberg, NetSuite had more than 30K customers at the time of acquisition, the bulk of which were SMB companies.Be it ERP, HCM or CX applications, growing adoption of Oracle's cloud solutions is the key growth driver in the long run. During the call, Larry Ellison noted the superiority of Oracle's Gen 2 Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud in running large databases at cost-effective terms in comparison to Amazon  IaaS.Although we note that Amazon remains a leader in the IaaS market segment, Oracle is fast catching up. Management at Oracle believes that IaaS will soon grow faster than Software-as-a-Solution and Platform-as-a-solution (PaaS) services and will eventually become the largest cloud business.We note that IaaS is expected to grow in the range of 25%-29% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

After going public at $15 per share last June, the stock surged to nearly $70 in late September before overheated valuations and a secondary offering sent the stock tumbling back to the low $30s.All that drama might have convinced Twilio bulls -- who once believed that demand for its cloud platform would keep rising -- to finally give up. But before you sell this volatile stock, make sure you aren't doing it for these three reasons.Image source: Getty Images.Analysts expect Twilio's revenue to rise 33% this year, but the stock isn't cheap -- its price-to-sales ratio of 10 is more than double the industry average of 4.5 for software companies. However, that ratio isn't terribly high relative to other cloud-based players with comparable sales growth.Cloud-based CRM provider  (NYSE: VEEV) , which analysts expect to post 19% sales growth this year, trades at 12 times sales. Cloud-based finance and HR services provider  (NYSE: WDAY) , which trades at 11 times sales, is expected to grow its sales by 29% this year. Twilio's P/S ratio has also cooled down considerably since it peaked in the 20s last October. Therefore, Twilio's high valuation raises eyebrows, but it isn't necessarily a red flag.Twilio has never posted a GAAP profit, and hasn't offered a timeline for achieving profitability. But Twilio isn't the only cloud-based SaaS (software as a service) company with a bottom line stuck in the red.That's because competing in the SaaS market requires high marketing expenses to secure new clients, low subscription fees to keep them locked in, and high R&D costs to add new services. Even SaaS giant  (NYSE: CRM) doesn't consistently post quarterly GAAP profits despite generating $8.4 billion in revenues last year.The good news is that Twilio is adding more services -- like voice, video, security, and analytics tools -- to its ecosystem to generate additional revenues per customer. That's why its \"dollar-based net expansion\" rate, which measures its revenue growth per customer, rose 155% annually  . That growth indicates that Twilio can eventually spend less on marketing and R&D as its customers rely on more of its services -- which could eventually pave the way toward profitability.Twilio's two largest customers in 2016 were  's(NASDAQ: FB) WhatsApp and  . WhatsApp accounted for 9% of its sales, and Uber accounted for \"more than 10%\". The bears will suggest that losing either customer would be disastrous -- but that's unlikely to happen anytime soon.WhatsApp is a \"Variable Customer Account\" which never entered a 12-month minimum revenue commitment contract with Twilio -- so it doesn't pay minimum payments every month, and can end its service at any time. However, Twilio's dependence on WhatsApp has declined sharply -- the app accounted for 17% of its revenues back in 2015. Facebook also added Twilio services to Messenger last year, which tightens the relationship between the two companies.Uber is a \"Base Customer Account\" which has signed a minimum revenue commitment contract with Twilio, and the company notes that Uber's usage has \"significantly exceeded\" those minimum payments. Last quarter, Twilio notes that its \"base revenue\", which excludes revenue from Variable accounts, rose 73% annually and accounted for 92% of its top line. This means that the company can bounce back on Base accounts growth even if it loses big Variable accounts like WhatsApp.The market is extremely bearish on Twilio right now -- 39% of its float was being shorted as of Feb. 27. But when everyone is looking in one direction, it sometimes pays to be looking the other way.Twilio's top line growth forecasts are still strong, its customer base and ecosystem are expanding, and its valuations are reasonable relative to those of peers with similar growth rates. Once institutional investors, who own just 52% of Twilio's shares, notice those strengths, there could be a big short squeeze -- which will reward investors who didn't sell the stock in the low $30s.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The other day we saw a good quarter from  (ORCL) and now we get another good report from  (ADBE).Last night after the close ADBE reported EPS of $0.78 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for $0.72. That $0.06 beat translates into an 8.3% positive earnings surprise and it is the fourth straight beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.I am a growth guy and just based on the size of the companies like ADBE and ORCL I would avoid them. My thinking was that the best days were behind these names and growth would be very hard to come by. I am adjusting my thinking on the big cap tech names.Let's look at the ADBE and specifically the topline. As a growth guy, I am much more interested in what is going up top than on the bottom line. Don't get me wrong, earnings are super important, but to me, I need to see what is causing the growth and why.The topline number of $1.68B was better than the consensus estimate of $1.64B. Now that is already what I want to see, but as I dug in deeper, I really liked what I saw.Digital Media was $1.4B and that was well ahead of the $1.11B consensus estimate.Digital Marketing was $501M, again ahead of the $487M estimate.Print and Publishing came in just barely ahead of the consensus at $42M.Seeing this brought a smile to my face. I love to see revenue come in ahead of the consensus. But this next line item really stunned me.Annualized Recurring Revenue was $4.25B compared to a consensus number of $4.21B and up from $3.98B in the prior quarter.Wunderlich Securities upped the stock to buy from hold and increased their target price to $145 from $115. Analysts at Pivotal, Atlantic Equities, Cowen and Deutsche Bank all increased their target prices. Pivotal remains somewhat cautious on the stock as the maintained their hold rating and moved their target price to $109 from $104. With the stock trading $127 and showing good revenue growth, that target price looks rather bearish to me.Adobe traded as high as $130.30 today and that is a new 52 week high for the stock. The move higher by around $5 puts the 5-year run at roughly +$95 or 280%. To me, this stock could easily see a similar run over the next five years as well.Right now, ADBE is Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). All the estimates aren't in yet and when they do get in I would not be surprised to see this stock become a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). | Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

And those revenues were off by nearly 13%. Valaent blamed higher interest expenses and wider foreign exchange losses for its deficit.Not even an optimistic revenue forecast for full-year 2017 could help VRX. The midpoint of Valeant's range of $8.9 billion to $9.1 billion just beat out analyst expectations for $8.96 billion.VRX shares were off 6% in Tuesday's premarket trade, cutting considerably into shares' 15% year-to-date rally.PCLN shares were getting a bump amid a positive fourth-quarter earnings report.Priceline said it earned net income of $674 million ($13.47 per share) for Q4, far better than the year-ago period's $504 million ($10 per share). Meanwhile, adjusted earnings of $14.21 per share were well better than the consensus estimate for $12.98 per share.Revenues of $2.35 billion were 17% better year-over-year and got over Wall Street's mark by about $50 million.The big driver for the company behind Priceline, Booking.com, Kayak and Opentable was a 31% improvement in hotel reservations to 129.7 million nights.

Nonetheless, PCLN was surging by about 4% in Tuesday's premarket trade.WDAY shares were getting clipped on Tuesday following its fourth-quarter results.Workday earned an adjusted 7 cents per share, easily topping expectations for a 1-cent loss. Revenues of $436.7 million were up 35% year-over-year and also hurdled estimates of $430.2 million.Guidance also beat the Street, with Workday forecasting full-year fiscal 2018 revenues in a range of $2.005 to $2.025 billion versus expectations of $1.99 billion.

Workday also offered an upbeat outlook for both the current quarter and new fiscal year.Let's take a closer look, then, at what the human capital management and analytics applications company accomplished as fiscal 2017 came to a close.Image source: Workday, Inc.Data source: Workday, Inc.Workday co-founder and CEO Aneel Bhusri elaborated:During the (current) fiscal first quarter of 2018, Workday expects revenue of $467 million to $468 million, representing 34% to 35% year-over-year growth. For perspective -- and though we don't usually pay close attention to Wall Street's demands -- analysts, on average, were modeling lower fiscal first-quarter 2018 revenue of $449.2 million.Finally, note that Workday has formally adopted ASC 606 accounting standards, which divorces timing of invoicing from revenue recognition. As such, Workday is transitioning from providing detailed annual billings guidance to annual operating cash flow guidance, which serves as a more effective gauge of performance as the company grows and improves profitability.With that in mind, Workday anticipates full-fiscal year revenue of $2.005 billion to $2.025 billion (up 27% to 29% year over year) -- well above the $1.99 billion investors were expecting -- including subscription revenue of $1.68 billion to $1.70 billion (up 30% to 32%), and 15% growth in professional services revenue, to $325 million. Annual operating cash flow for the full fiscal year 2018 should increase 20% year over year, to $420 million.All things considered, there's nothing not to like about this strong quarter as Workday continues to consciously forsake profitability in favor of scaling its business. As Workday's solutions increasingly become an integral part of how the world's largest businesses operate, I think investors should be more than happy with the company's direction today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NYSE: CRM) and  (NYSE: WDAY) are together two of the hottest stock names in the software-as-a-service space. At valuations of 275 times trailing earnings and infinity-times-nonexistent earnings, respectively, they're also two of the most expensive stocks you can buy today. (On the other hand, with earnings due out from Workday on Feb. 27, and from Salesforce on Feb. 28, the valuations on both these stocks could change drastically before the end of this month.)This morning, analysts at famed investment banker  made a bold call to buy both Salesforce  Workday stock, arguing that despite their high prices, both stocks could go higher -- all the way to $100 a share each, in fact.Here are three things you should know about that.Image source: Getty Images.Piper announced its upgrade of Workday stock before the market opened on Friday, arguing that its \"channel checks\" indicate that Workday's fundamentals have improved materially since last quarter, and recommending that investors \"overweight\" the stock, according to a write-up on  this morning. Workday stock costs vastly more than Salesforce when measured by price to earnings (P/E), by free cash flow (P/FCF), or even sales (P/S). But according to Piper, \"a premium valuation is warranted\" because Workday's performance today is \"the strongest in recent memory.\"Pier believes that Workday stock, currently selling for $85.50 a share, will hit a nice, round $100 valuation within a year, delivering 17% profits to investors who buy it today.At the same time, Piper hasn't fallen out of love with Salesforce.com. In the course of upgrading Workday, Piper made sure to mention that it still rates Salesforce \"overweight\" as well. As the analyst explains in a write-up on  , Salesforce is expected to post \"another strong quarter\" when it reports earnings 11 days from now, which could help the stock hit its price target sooner rather than later.Coincidentally, Piper assigns the exact same stock price to both stocks -- $100. But because Salesforce stock is currently cheaper than Workday, per share, this works out to an even bigger profits potential on Salesforce stock -- 23%.It should be emphasized that Salesforce.com has nearly 700 million shares outstanding, while Workday has only 125 million. Thus, a $100 price target on both stocks works out to a $69.7 billion projected market capitalization on Salesforce, but only a $12.5 billion market cap for Workday -- if both stocks hit their price targets. Regardless, Piper seems to be projecting more profits potential for Salesforce than for Workday.At so much bigger a market cap than its rival, you might expect that Salesforce stock has  room to grow in the future. But as it turns out, Piper is not alone in its view that the larger company actually has the better prospects. According to a poll of analysts following both stocks on  , the consensus is that over the next five years, Workday will grow its earnings at a 23% annualized rate, while Salesforce will grow at a 25% pace.And that fact could be key: Not only does Salesforce stock carry a lower P/E and P/S (i.e., it costs less) than Workday, but analysts believe that it will  than Workday as well. Thus, while Piper Jaffray is telling investors to buy both stocks, if you only have enough money to buy one, Salesforce may actually be the better bet.Free cash flow data support this thesis. Over the past 12 reported months, Salesforce has generated nearly $1.5 billion in real cash profits from its business, versus just $207 million for Workday. Adjusted for market cap, Salesforce stock therefore sells for 37.5 times trailing free cash flow today, versus an 83 P/FCF ratio for Workday.Conclusion: While neither of these stocks looks cheap by any measure, Salesforce stock is at least cheap-  than Workday -- and the better buy.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The increase can primarily be attributed to higher cloud SaaS and PaaS, IaaS and research & development (R&D) expenses in the quarter, which were up 80 bps, 40 bps and 70 bps, respectively.SaaS and PaaS gross margin was 65% significantly higher than 51% reported in the year-ago quarter. IaaS gross margin was 30% lower than management's expectation due to continued investments.Operating margin (including stock-based compensation) contracted 100 bps from the year-ago quarter to 38.5%.Oracle bought back 30 million shares for a total of $500 million in the third quarter.

Moreover, management anticipates SaaS and PaaS gross margin to eventually rise to 80% in the long haul.Oracle continues to gain traction on its cloud endeavors. Specifically, the company's offerings in SaaS and PaaS have gained significant momentum in the past few quarters, which improves competitive position against salesforce.com  and Workday. Further, the introduction of Gen 2 IaaS data centers is expected to improve Oracle's competitive prowess against Amazon  .Oracle continues to win new customers in HCM, ERP and CX. We believe the company's growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth for the foreseeable future.However, the transition from on-premise licensing to cloud-based subscription business model will take some more time to complete, which will impact near-term results.

The price recently dropped 16% in a matter of six trading days on virtually no news. That offers a compelling opportunity for investors to purchase an initial lot at a much better entry point. Here's what I mean...Image source: Getty ImagesIn December, I outlined all of the reasons I'm so excited about owning this stock. You can read the  if you want to dig deeper, but here's a quick review of the major points.Image source: Getty Imagesdevelopment of a single application to lower labor costs, drive employee engagement, and reduce exposure.\" Most people under-appreciate the \"ongoing development\" part, which means that further functionality will be added to Paycom's cloud for customers. That's why R&D spending quadrupled between 2013 and 2015, and has essentially doubled over the first three quarters of 2016 alone.Combine these factors and I believe you have a compelling stock to own.There's no doubt that this is still an \"expensive\" stock. As of this past week's low of $42.50, shares were still trading for 54 times non-GAAP earnings. But that's a much better entry point than the 67 it traded for in December.Just as relevant, the company is trading for only 42 times expected 2017 earnings. If recent history is any guide, those estimates might be artificially low as well. Over the past ten quarters, the company has exceeded analyst expectations by an average of 42%! Even if we adjusted expected 2017 earnings up to account for a more modest 15% beat, we still get a notably more reasonable ratio of 36 times expected earnings.To be honest, though, I'm not much for haggling on price. I include the section above because the recent drop is what encouraged me to buy more shares of Paycom in February, but what's really important is the company strengthening its moat.There are two big risks that an investment in Paycom faces. The first is execution problems: Paycom relies heavily on its sales force to convince companies to switch from their usual paycheck processor. Here, high switching costs -- which provide substantially Paycom's entire moat -- work against the company. They have to convince companies that making the change is worth the headache. I'll be watching the company's Glassdoor ratings closely to see if the sales force remains motivated.Just as important, it has to beat a host of rivals to gain market share. Because of high switching costs, once companies are signed in to the new wave of HR SaaS providers, they usually stay locked in. While there are a host of larger rivals focused on big names, Paycom has to compete against similarly small start-ups like  (NYSE: WDAY) and Namely.That's why I'll be monitoring the client count closely when annual results are released. Here's a look at the growth the company has recently experienced on that front.Data source: SEC filingsI expect that the customer count will come in above 18,000 for 2016, especially considering the company's geographic expansion of its sales force.Combine all of these facts -- powerful company forces and a better entry point -- and you can see why I recently added shares of Paycom. It's important to note that there's still a fair amount risk involved with the company. That's why it only accounts for less than 2% of my family's real-life holdings. But if you're like me, you see a growth story that you can continue to add to over time as it becomes more and more relevant for American HR departments.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, we think the velocity and magnitude of its decline is likely to surprise many investors.The deflationary pressures that have already hit the database market are just getting started, including:Revenue from database software represented ~36% of Oracle's total FY16 revenue and ~55% of its operating profit.The company's decline in projected database revenue is distinct from and in addition to the decline in its on-premises application revenue, which accounted for ~25% of total FY16 revenue and ~39% of operating profit.Microsoft and IBM will be hurt only marginally, as database software generates just ~5% of revenue for each.Without aggressive action to significantly increase non-database revenue, we do not believe Oracle can offset the oncoming decline in commercial database revenue fast enough to maintain its present valuation.Specifically, we believe Oracle needs an even more radical and rapid organizational and cultural shift toward \"cloud-first\" that incentivizes both its sales force and its customers to move aggressively into the cloud. The company also needs to consolidate its various home-grown and acquired cloud/SaaS offerings toward a single platform in order to generate operational leverage down the road. Both of these initiatives will be painful in several ways, especially financially, for a few years to come. To partially offset the pain, Oracle should divest its remaining hardware and other non-core businesses.______For those that are interested in a more technical dive, below is a deeper, historical explanation of the five interrelated trends that are gaining momentum, and that will, in combination, cause the commercial-database market to contract 20% to 30% by 2021: Except for a few of the first SaaS offerings that were built on top of an Oracle database, namely Salesforce.com (  ), NetSuite (N), and Oracle itself, it is difficult to find a SaaS provider that uses any commercial database. For companies founded after 2005, that number is virtually zero.The vast majority of SaaS providers today either use an open-source database, or, as is the case with SaaS HCM vendor Workday (  ), develop their own. Every user of an on-premises enterprise application, including one of the five core client-server application categories: ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Customer Relationship Management), HCM (Human Capital Management), SCM (Supply Chain Management), and BI (Business Intelligence) applications, which moves to SaaS therefore eliminates a commercial database seat, and with it, the maintenance/support and future upgrade revenue it would have generated. Even an enterprise seat that moves to Salesforce.com will generate far less revenue for Oracle than that seat did when it was deployed on-premises.Hence, we believe the enterprise migration to SaaS/cloud is highly deflationary for commercial-database revenue. Further, we are still early in the migration from client-server to SaaS/cloud. Depending on which research one believes, this migration is only 10% to 25% complete and is only just beginning to impact more mission-critical applications - such as ERP - that are more likely to be running on higher-end SQL databases (including those from Oracle and IBM, and to a lesser extent, Microsoft). After SQL was standardized in 1987, it went unchallenged for over 20 years in defining how data was organized, searched, and sorted. However, in the mid-2000s, colossal tech companies began running into the limitations of SQL databases in handling both the sheer volume and varying structure (or lack thereof) of the data that they wanted to preserve, navigate, analyze, and serve up on-demand to their users/customers.Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), LinkedIn (LNKD), and Facebook (FB) each solved its own scaling problems by developing and implementing its own database software that broke with the constraints of the SQL standard.What's more, each company released open-source versions of its databases shortly after. Dozens of new open-source databases were consequently produced in 2008 and 2009, leading to what Guy Harrison - the author of Next Generation Databases - termed \"a sort of Cambrian explosion.\" As a result of their departure from SQL, these databases all fell under the term \"NoSQL\" - even though most were as different from each other as they were from SQL.Given the exponential growth in the volume and variety of data - driven by richer social media content, more social media users, and an explosion of autonomously captured IoT data - and given the increasing desire for analysis on captured data, we believe the number of use cases suited to NoSQL will soon far exceed those suited to SQL.The rise of these new use cases will drive greater adoption by large enterprises of open-source NoSQL solutions at the expense of commercial SQL databases. SQL and Schema-on-Write Are on the Wrong Side. In general, NoSQL databases are substantially more processor, memory, and storage intensive than SQL databases, even after considering the fact that they relax many of the constraints that SQL places on how data is organized. Though NoSQL database architectures existed well before 2005 - at least, in theory - there was simply not enough processing power, memory capacity, and storage space for them to be put to practical use outside of academia.During the comparatively processor/memory/bandwidth-starved 1980s and 1990s, adherence to the more-rigid SQL standard was effectively compulsory to ensure the performance and reliability that enterprises needed in order to migrate their applications, especially those more mission-critical applications, from mainframes and minis to the more-distributed and network-dependent client-server architecture.The price paid for SQL's acceptable performance and reliability was driven by:Over time, however, Moore's Law-driven improvements in processing power, memory capacity and speed, storage capacity and speed, and network throughput have made the rigidity of the SQL standard and the requirement for schema-on-write processes increasingly less necessary and will continue to do so. Hence, with every Moore's Law cycle, SQL and its resource-efficient schema-on-write process loses its competitive advantage, while NoSQL, with its relatively resource-inefficient but much more flexible schema-on-write process, becomes increasingly free from the constraints that prevented it from being adopted in the first place. . When SQL was standardized, hard disk drives (HDDs) were the only cost-effective storage medium that could be accessed in real time. Therefore, much of the fundamental code written into SQL database software is designed to accommodate the shortcomings of HDDs, such as the slow speed with which they can read and transmit requested data into memory and their relatively higher failure rates - at least, compared to the major solid state components of a system such as the CPU, memory, and network throughput. Now that SSDs are rapidly becoming a cost-effective replacement for HDDs, much of the design and certainly much of the code of legacy SQL database software that made such compromises in order to accommodate comparatively much slower HDDs is now rendered unnecessary.In contrast, many NoSQL databases are written so as to take maximum advantage of SSD storage and will likely be updated to take advantage of even faster-emerging non-volatile memory technologies such as Intel (INTC)/Micron's (MU) 3D xPoint, which is just now becoming commercially available. We believe that, given the strong requirement to maintain compliance with the SQL standard and maintain their own backward compatibility, SQL database vendors will not be able to optimize their code for SSDs nearly as fast as many of the open source projects will be able to, putting them further at a competitive disadvantage - a classic example of Clayton Christensen's \"The innovator's dilemma\". . We are seeing an increasing number of software tools and services designed to help enterprises migrate from commercial SQL databases. Even the most mission-critical applications running on an Oracle or IBM database can be increasingly surrounded, \"quarantined\", and dismantled over time, much like what happened to many of the legacy mainframe applications during the shift to the client-server architecture in the 1990s.While SQL databases from the likes of Oracle, IBM, and MSFT will survive in some enterprises for many more years - again, much like mainframes - they will be increasingly marginalized and cost-reduced as much as possible. We see many of these tools maturing already within the Hadoop ecosystem, which already has multiple ways to integrate with SQL databases and/or put SQL interfaces and querying ability on NoSQL databases. In our opinion, this is a very similar development to the early-1990s emergence of multiple ways to integrate mainframe applications with PCs and client-server applications.______To subscribe to the Samadhi Brief newsletter, please visit SamadhiPartners.com.

Even with TWLO more than 50% off late September highs, the stock still trades at over seven times the midpoint of its 2017 revenue guidance. And that multiple excludes the company's $300 million in cash. Meanwhile, the price-earnings ratio for Twilio stock is infinite because the company is unprofitable, and rather sharply so. 2017 guidance implies an operating loss of $13 million to $17 million on a non-GAAP basis. Source: In other words, for every dollar of revenue Twilio generates this year, it expects to lose at least 4 cents, plus another 3 to 4 cents in stock-based compensation. (That dilution is excluded from Twilio stock's non-GAAP figures.)So if  (NASDAQ:  ) is overvalued at 62 times earnings, TWLO stock must be even moreso. And that should make Twilio stock a tempting target for short sellers.But it's not that simple. TWLO is a growth stock after all, and growth stocks can stay elevated for a long time. Short sellers indeed have targeted TWLO stock, one reason shares have declined so sharply of late. But as those same short sellers say, \"Valuation is not a catalyst.\" And recent history proves them right.Value investors, in particular, often criticize stocks like TWLO, with more than a bit of frustration in their voice. \"I guess, for growth stocks, the numbers don't even matter.\" (AMZN shareholders surely are familiar with that sentiment.)But that's not the case. A company like Twilio isn't  to be profitable yet. It's not even a decade old, which isn't a long time in the competitive tech space. It's investing money in attracting new customers to its cloud communications service, which is what it should be doing. There's no need to forego that spend for profits now, when that spend can drive far more profits later.Purely from a valuation standpoint, it's too simplistic, particularly in the PaaS/SaaS space, to look at profits without context. It's better for Twilio to spend a dollar on sales and marketing now - even if that adds to its net losses - if that dollar is worth $3 in sales later. And the reason cloud stocks have been so hyped - and so highly valued - is that $1 upfront doesn't just lead to $3 later \u2026 Rather, it leads to $1, or even $2, for years and years and years.So there are investors who are taking the long term - and, dare I say, fundamental - approach toward Twilio stock. TWLO's valuation is based not on what it's doing in 2017, but what it can do in 2020, or 2025. That leads to quite a bit of volatility, as seen in TWLO's short time on the public markets. But that volatility doesn't mean TWLO longs aren't paying attention, and it doesn't mean TWLO is failing. Most notably, for short sellers considering TWLO, it doesn't mean Twilio stock will  going down.Of course, there are fundamental arguments for TWLO stock to continue to tumble. Unlike more well-known cloud plays, Twilio has relatively low gross margins since it still has to pay network providers who transmit calls and text messages. Revenue growth is guided to slow in 2017, to 33%.With similar deceleration, sales wouldn't double again until 2020. $700 million-plus in sales at even 15% operating margin still implies barely $100 million in operating profit. That, in turn, probably puts EPS under $1 - and TWLO stock's 2020 P/E multiple above 35.But investors should look at recent history in the cloud space. Pretty much every high-flying SaaS or PaaS stock has had similar concerns. And pretty much all of them have held up just fine.  (NYSE:  ) bottomed in early 2016 near $50; it's since rebounded sharply, and now trades at over 10x revenue.  (NYSE:  ) was a popular short seller target in 2015; it's at all-time highs, with sales multiples similar to that of TWLO.  (NASDAQ:  ) is near a 52-week high - and trades at over 8x revenue on an enterprise basis. A high valuation doesn't mean a bad stock - at least in the short term.So there are two concerns when shorting a stock like TWLO. The first is that as long as near-term performance is enough to keep bullish investors happy on the long-term prospects, the stock is unlikely to come down. With Twilio coming out of a strong Q4 that beat expectations, that sentiment seems likely to stay positive for at least the next couple of months.The second is that a short seller on TWLO can be right and still lose badly. \"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent,\" the old saw goes. But the market also can be  and just flat-out wrong. A short seller, however, only profits when the market realizes it's wrong. And that can take a long time.To be sure, short sellers continue to target Twilio stock. But it's a dangerous game. Just ask short sellers of WDAY, VEEV, SPLK or, most notably, AMZN. Timing is key. And right now, the timing does not look right, at all, for a short of Twilio stock.The post ) Stock Is Not a Short! appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he S&P 500 has risen less than 1% since the beginning of the year, but plenty of stocks posted double-digit gains during that time. Let's take a closer look at three stocks that have rallied about 20% in January --  (NYSE: SHOP) ,  (NYSE: BOX) , and  (NYSE: WDAY) -- and see if they can continue rising through the rest of the year.Image source: Getty Images.Shopify provides a cloud-based e-commerce platform for small to medium-sized businesses. Its software enables companies to design, set up, and run their own online stores, and lets them accept credit cards, view incoming orders, and review completed transactions.Shopify's 18% rally in January is a continuation of its 150% rally over the past 12 months. That rally can be attributed to its impressive top-line growth -- its revenue surged 89% annually, to $99.6 million last quarter, following four straight quarters of 90%+ growth.Shopify served over 325,000 merchants at the end of last quarter, which was a big jump from its customer base of \"over 200,000\" merchants in the prior-year quarter, and its gross merchandise volume doubled to $3.8 million. It also announced deeper integration with  's sales channel earlier this month, making it easier for its customers to sell products on the e-commerce giant's marketplace.Analysts expect Shopify's revenue to rise 86% for the full year, but it still isn't profitable yet on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis. Its GAAP loss widened last quarter, mainly due to higher stock-based compensation expenses, but its non-GAAP loss slightly narrowed. Shopify is a pretty pricey stock at 13 times sales, but its growth trajectory might support that valuation.Box provides online file sharing and personal cloud content for businesses. The company faces tough challenges in the cloud-storage market from Dropbox and bigger tech giants, but its customer base already includes massive companies like  and  .Like Shopify, Box has great top-line growth and weak bottom-line growth. Its revenue rose 31% annually, to $102.8 million last quarter, as billings rose 26%. Deferred revenue, a key indicator of future demand, jumped 36%, to $192.6 million. Box's quarterly revenues have now risen by more than 30% annually for the past five quarters, and analysts anticipate 31% sales growth this year. Box is unprofitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics, but its losses are narrowing by both measures.Image source: Getty Images.Box has rallied 23% in January, but still trades at six times sales, which is only slightly higher than the industry average of four for application-software companies. But looking ahead, Box and Dropbox both face very tough competition in the cloud-storage market.Companies like  (NASDAQ: MSFT) are offering plenty of free and cheap storage to enterprise customers to tether them to their cloud ecosystems. Despite that competition, Microsoft has integrated Box into Office 365, sparking rumors of an eventual takeover. With an enterprise value of just over $2 billion, Box could certainly be a lucrative target in a consolidation of the cloud-storage market.Workday provides enterprise cloud applications that help companies staff, pay, and organize their workforces. They also utilize analytics and machine learning to help companies make financial and workforce-related decisions.Demand for these services has been robust -- Workday's sales rose 34% annually last quarter and have risen 30% to 40% over the past four quarters. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 35% this year, although the company warned in early January that a few of its bigger deals had been delayed by global uncertainties regarding Brexit, the U.S. presidential election, and other G8 country elections.But like Shopify and Box, Workday has weak profitability. That's because the cost of securing new customers coupled with price competition and the low margins of the cloud SaaS (software as a service) market make it tough to squeeze out a profit, even with double-digit sales growth. Workday squeezed out a narrow non-GAAP profit last quarter, but its GAAP earnings remain deep in the red. Its price-to-sales ratio of 11 also looks pricey relative to its software-industry peers.However, Workday stock  after  (NYSE: WMT) subscribed to its Human Capital Management, Recruiting, Learning, and Planning products. That deal  add $100 million to $200 million to Workday's annual revenues (5%-10% of its projected revenues for next year), according to Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White -- but Wal-Mart didn't disclose how many of its 2 million+ employees would actually use the system. Nonetheless, that rally lifted Workday stock 24% in January.Shopify, Box, and Workday are all fairly high-risk growth stocks. I believe that Box's lower valuation and buyout potential make it the \"safest\" stock on this list, while Shopify's incredible top-line growth makes it the best growth play. Workday is also a good growth play, but its weak profitability and high valuations make it a risky bet for a frothy market.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 37 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Workday Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $56.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $110.00. The standard deviation is $10.885.But the whole reason to look at the  WDAY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with WDAY crossing above that average target price of $81.70/share, investors in WDAY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $81.70 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Specifically, IBM pulled off a nice beat on both the top and bottom lines. But the reaction from Wall Street is muted, and IBM stock was actually wavering between slight gains and losses in Thursday's aftermarket trading. Source: ShutterstockFor Q4, IBM generated adjusted earnings of $5.01 per share on revenues of $21.77 billion. Analysts were expecting profits of $4.88 per share on roughly $21.64 billion in sales.Investors had already been anticipating improvement, evidenced by 11% gains in IBM stock since October - about double the  in that time. But momentum is slowing, as you can see from the company's dwindling Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the chart below.One thing IBM didn't do was end its streak of consecutive revenue declines. Despite the top-line beat, revenues were off by 1%, marking the 19th straight quarter that sales have dipped. At the core of the transformation is strategic imperatives, which account for 41% of revenues. The segment saw a 13% increase in revenues in 2016 to $32.8 billion.A major driver of the growth is the IBM cloud business, which posted a nice 35% jump in revenues last year to $13.7 billion. Cloud as-a-service revenues were up 61%.IBM has some big-time advantages here, including a trusted brand, global footprint, decades of experience in handling mission-critical functions and thousands of highly talented engineers. What's more, the global consulting unit has been important, which has provided lots of business with cloud deployments with companies like  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ).Another critical part of the strategic imperatives side of IBM is Watson, which is the pioneering system for artificial intelligence. Some of the diverse use cases include customer service, the internet of things, financial services, weather forecasting, regulatory compliance and cybersecurity.To put all this into perspective, IBM spent more than $15 billion in R&D and acquisitions for strategic imperatives in 2016. But the company still was able to deliver nearly $9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. The current yield on IBM stock is 3.4%.So, why is IBM stock showing weakness in after-hours trading?Shares have already rallied strongly, as we mentioned before. But there also are lingering concerns about the core business.The fact is IBM has a number of technologies that are getting \u2026 well, crusty. They're based on old approaches, including on-premise installations. Furthermore, there is quite a bit of hardware in the IBM portfolio. During the latest quarter, Global Business Services revenues fell by 4% to $4.1 billion, Systems plunged by 12% to $2.5 billion and the Software unit saw only 1% growth to $7.1 billion.IBM also must deal with the classic problem of disruption. A little good news there, though: IBM has been transforming to adapt over the past couple of years.

Yet even though investors were generally pleased with the move, Workday didn't take the opportunity to update its financial guidance for the current of coming fiscal year. Nevertheless, many believe the Wal-Mart agreement could be a game-changer for Workday, and at the very least, it will ease any concerns that competitors were leaving Workday behind.Finally, Atwood Oceanics gained 8%. The offshore drilling company recovered all the ground it had lost in recent days, with yesterday's completion of a secondary stock offering that involved the sale of 13.5 million shares at $12.20 per share. Atwood shares seemed to respond favorably to the lack of selling pressure following the offering, and after several days of poor performance from the energy markets,  finally bounced higher today as well, finishing up about 2.5% to close near $53 per barrel. Looking forward, investors are more optimistic about the prospects for Atwood and its peers as crude rebounds from rock-bottom levels over the past couple of years.

In fact, despite plunging early in 2016 along with the broader market's historically painful start, shares of Workday were up slightly year to date leading into its fiscal third-quarter 2017 report on Dec. 1, 2016. And its results were solid. Revenue climbed 34.2% year over year, to $409.6 million -- well above guidance provided three months earlier for quarterly revenue of $398 million to $400 million -- including 38.3% growth in subscription revenue, to $335.7 million, and 18.1% growth in professional services revenue, to $73.9 million. Workday also lauded strong demand for all three of its recently launched key applications, including Workday Learning, Workday Planning, and Workday Student.During the subsequent conference call, however, Workday worried investors when it confirmed a few larger deals with multinational customers had been delayed. To blame, according to CEO Aneel Bhusri, were likely uncertainties stemming from global political concerns including Brexit, the U.S. presidential election, and other G8 country elections. Bhusri also insisted this should be a temporary issue that resolves itself in the coming months, noting demand for its core human capital management otherwise remains strong.In the meantime, Workday's latest guidance calls for revenue in its fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 to be in the range of $427 million to $430 million, or up 32% to 33% year over year, which fell below Wall Street's estimates at the time calling for revenue of $433.6 million.In any case, investors will need to wait until late February or early March -- when Workday typically releases fiscal Q4 results -- for more clarity on whether the underlying causes of Workday's delayed orders have passed.

Wal-Mart has over two million employees and is the world's largest private employer, so it could easily become Workday's largest customer.Image source: Getty Images.Based on that employee count, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White claims that the deal could potentially generate $100 million to $200 million in annual revenues for Workday. But White warns that Workday didn't specify how many Wal-Mart employees will be included in the deal, and that its revenue impact wouldn't likely be fully recognized in the first one or two years. Let's discuss what this deal means for Workday and Wal-Mart, and whether or not it makes the cloud applications provider a worthwhile buy.Workday's enterprise cloud applications help organizations staff, pay, and organize their workforce. They also use analytics and machine learning to help organizations make financial and workforce-related decisions. Demand for Workday's services has been robust -- its revenue rose 68% in fiscal 2015 and another 48% in fiscal 2016. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 35% this year.That top line growth looks strong, but Workday's stock plunged in early January after it announced that some of its bigger deals were delayed by global uncertainties regarding Brexit, the U.S. presidential election, and other G8 country elections. As a result, Workday reduced its fourth quarter revenue forecast to 32%-33% growth, missing the consensus estimate for 34% growth.$100 million to $200 million in revenues would equal 5% to 10% of Workday's projected revenues for next year. However, Workday didn't update its guidance after the Wal-Mart announcement, and White's warning about the ramp up period indicates that investors shouldn't expect to gain a big tailwind over the next few quarters.Workday, like many other SaaS (software as a service) providers, is also struggling with profitability because the cost of securing new customers and price competition often outweigh its subscription revenues. Workday squeezed out a narrow non-GAAP profit of $0.03 per share last quarter, but it remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis. Therefore, Workday likely spent heavily to secure the Wal-Mart contract, but we won't see if the benefits outweigh the costs until a few years later.Under CEO Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart invested billions into retraining its workforce, clarifying career advancement paths, and increasing wages. But Wal-Mart also recently announced that it will cut hundreds of jobs in a fresh round of layoffs -- many of which will come from its human resources department.Image source: Wal-Mart.Since that announcement coincides with the Workday deal, it's likely that Wal-Mart plans to use automated cloud services to take over some of those manual HR tasks. A few hundred jobs only represent a tiny slice of Wal-Mart's workforce, but those job cuts could still boost Wal-Mart's earnings, which are expected to drop 6% this year due to higher expenses. Looking ahead, Wal-Mart could also use Workday's analytics services to decide which departments to downsize and which ones to invest more heavily in.Partnering with Wal-Mart is a positive development for Workday, but it isn't a game changer. The ramp up period will be long, and it's unclear how many of Wal-Mart's two million employees will actually use Workday's services, so Drexel Hamilton's estimates might be too optimistic.Workday already serves plenty of Fortune 500 customers, and it's carved out a niche in the highly competitive cloud SaaS market that bigger rivals still can't touch. But it's also deeply unprofitable, and the stock trades at 11 times sales -- which is much higher than the industry average P/S of 4 for application software companies. Therefore, Workday's future looks bright, but I'd like to see steadier bottom line growth and lower valuations before I start a position in this volatile stock.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Its Finance Controls and Automation platform reduces the need for human accountants and the potential for human error in data entry and calculations. The platform is currently used by over 1,500 companies in over 120 countries worldwide.Prior to its IPO, its biggest shareholders were Silver Lake and Iconiq, which respectively owned 46.5% and 22.8% of the company.

However, the $146 million it raised from the IPO should easily cover those debts and strengthen its cash position.BlackLine's direct competitors in the automated accounting market include smaller start-ups like FloQast, Tagetik, and Hubble. These rivals aren't dangerous, however, since BlackLine has already established a strong presence among Fortune 500 companies.The real threat to BlackLine comes from bigger cloud infrastructure players like Oracle and SAP. These IT giants have the resources to acquire, create, and build similar accounting automation solutions on top of their own cloud platforms.SAP offers ICR (Intercompany Reconciliation), a first-party tool for the management of financial accounts. Oracle offers a similar tool called ARM (Account Reconciliation Manager). BlackLine's automation platform is compatible with these platforms, but there's no guarantee that these bigger companies won't start evolving their own bundled tools into direct competitors against BlackLine.BlackLine currently has a market cap of $1.1 billion. This gives it a price-to-sales ratio of 13. That's a pretty high figure compared to other high-growth tech companies. Cybersecurity firm  , which posted 49% sales growth last year, trades at 10 times sales. Cloud-based CRM (customer relationship management) company  , which generated 31% growth last year, trades at 11 times sales.Those comparisons indicate that BlackLine's upside potential could be limited by its valuations until its sales growth catches up. Its high valuation -- combined with slowing sales growth and non-existent profits this year -- could be an invitation for short sellers to swarm in. Its lockup expiration next April could also exacerbate that decline. Therefore, I'm keeping an eye on BlackLine for now, but I'm not in a hurry to invest in this hot new stock.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

As just one example, roughly 90% of the world's data has been created in just the past two years alone, according to  .To manage this explosion of data, a new crop of publicly traded  has come to market in recent years, many of them relatively new IPOs. Big data stocks like  (NASDAQ: SPLK) ,  (NYSE: CRM) , and  (NYSE: WDAY) offer ways to invest in the long-term growth of the big data industry.\n  \nData source: Google Finance.These names each tap into the power of big data, some in obvious and direct ways and others in more subtle ways. However, in total these companies offer a useful snapshot of the varied and important ways software companies are harnessing the power of big data to help drive their business results.Though it might sound flimsy, big data powerhouse Splunk's business is to make something out of nothing -- or perhaps to say it more precisely, to yield insight when once there was none. As a bit of background, conventional data analytics platforms as we commonly know them rely on what's referred to as structured data, sets of information that have already been organized in some way -- think the market capitalization figures above, which are already organized around a central theme. That's structured data. However, the software that Splunk licenses to its customers operates further upstream in a company's digital reporting efforts, taking unstructured data -- the unorganized and disorganized digital noise produced by connected devices -- and parsing it for insight.It's a tremendously hard technological task, and Splunk's leadership position has already earned it a legion of customers and the enviable moniker of \"the Google of the Internet of Things.\" Much like the Big G, though, Splunk's budding empire will take some time to fully establish itself. As is common with similar growth companies, Splunk remains unprofitable at present, but it continues to grow sales like a weed.Revenue is expected to rise 36% this year and 28% next year, by which point the analyst community expects the company to have reached regular profitability. Looking further into the future, Splunk's earnings per share is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 38% over the next five years. It's easy to get turned off by Splunk's admittedly aggressive valuation -- 9.7 times LTM sales and 117 times NTM EPS -- but Splunk's overall business opportunity and leadership within its market make it a strong contender to grow into and beyond its valuation today.Cloud software giant Salesforce.com might not seem like an obvious big data play. However, as is happening throughout the cloud software industry, Salesforce has moved quickly to integrate big data functionalities into its suite of products.Salesforce is best known for pioneering cloud-based software for corporate sales teams, known as customer relationship management (CRM) software in industry parlance. The company has in more recent years added a suite of other software offerings aimed at addressing other business verticals. Today, four main reporting segments drive Salesforce's revenue -- sales cloud (43% of sales), service cloud (29%), app cloud (17%), and marketing cloud (11%). None of these offerings explicitly deals with big data, but that is changing in important ways for both Salesforce and the broader industry.Last May, the company launched its Salesforce Analytics Cloud platform to help integrate big data into its broader software offerings. The platform leverages AI and machine learning to parse data from a company's connected data sources to uncover trends that might otherwise go overlooked and recommend the most productive actions for sales and marketing teams. In this way, though Salesforce isn't a pure-play big data firm, it stands as a useful counterpoint to the likes of Splunk as an example of the way cloud software platforms are increasingly turning to big data to drive value for their customers, a trend further exemplified by Workday.At its core, cloud HR and finance platform Workday might not seem like a big data play either. However, big data remains very much a part of Workday's mission to dominate the back office's cloud computing future.Founded by software industry veterans, Workday's two best-known areas of operation are its cloud-based HR and finance software products. Though this area has become more diverse in terms of the actual software providers and the kinds of companies to which they cater, Workday explicitly aims to sell its products to large organizations like  and  . This strategy has helped fuel explosive growth: Workday's revenue has grown roughly 1000% since 2012, and the company's customer-centric business model should help cultivate strong recurring revenue, subscriber retention, and eventually profitability in the coming years.In terms of Workday's big data chops, the company has continued to emphasize adding big data and analytics capabilities to its suite of services. In 2012, Workday unveiled its original Big Data Analytics toolkit. The cloud-based big data platform aimed at serving HR and finance departments integrates Workday's applications with other third-party enterprise software to -- as the company phrased it -- \"make more informed business decisions based on a holistic view of worker and financial information.\" The company has continued to add to its big data capabilities via acquisition as well, acquiring operational analytics and data discovery start-up Platfora this summer, as just one example.As you can see, big data is impacting tech companies both new and old, and we've only witnessed the beginning of this big-ticket trend. Thankfully, there are any number of ways investors can cash in on this increasingly important trend, as the examples above demonstrate.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

He rates Paycom stock as a buy with a price target of 55.[ibdchart symbol=\"PAYC\" type=\"daily\" size=\"threequarter\" position=\"rightchart\" ]Paycom focuses mostly on small and midsize companies with 50 to 2,000 workers for its software-as-a-service.

He rates Paycom stock as sector perform with a price target of 54.While most providers of payroll and HR software tick off all the necessary boxes for functionality, Paycom excels in several ways, MacMillan said.For starters, its software is based off a core system of records maintained in a single database. Since the Paycom software is essentially a single application, it is easier for administrators to manage, MacMillan points out.\"We believe our success is due to the growing recognition of the benefits that can be gained from Paycom's single database architecture,\" Paycom Chief Executive Chad Richison said on a conference call with analysts on Aug. 2.Paycom's software also is sold directly to customers through agents in regional sales offices.\"Paycom has a very clear playbook for driving growth by adding customers and by increasing the average recurring revenue per customer,\" MacMillan's report says.Its customer growth strategy is based on expanding its sales organization through new regional offices across the U.S. Paycom has 42 sales offices now with line of sight to about 124 possible offices, MacMillan said.\"We are still in the early stages of a multiyear mission to gain market share and grow into one of the largest providers of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software,\" Richison said.MacMillan believes Paycom can grow its sales by 25% or more for the next three years by adding new customers and increasing revenue per customer.HR management today is all about regulatory compliance and benefits, so Paycom and the industry benefit when the government imposes new employee rules on companies.For instance, Paycom has gotten a boost from selling software to help companies comply with the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare.The company also recently released a tool kit to comply with changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act, allowing customers to make strategic decisions related to new overtime pay regulations.Another area for compliance involves meeting diversity requirements.Paycom says it helps companies effectively navigate a rapidly changing business environment. Its software is designed to manage employees from recruitment through retirement.The market for cloud and outsourced payroll processing and related human capital management services is worth about $25 billion to $30 billion a year in the U.S. and is growing in the high single digits, MacMillan said.\"We think Paycom can address up to $14 billion of the payroll/HCM market,\" MacMillan said. \"Paycom's calendar 2016 revenue forecast of $326 million suggests the company has single digit share.Paycom likely gets about half its new customers by winning business away from ADP and, to a lesser extent, Paychex, he said. The rest it pulls from small regional players running payroll-centric licensing software and from in-house and on-premises services like  (MSFT) Dynamics GP and Sage.Paycom is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the market close on Nov. 1.In the second quarter, Paycom reported earnings per share of 21 cents excluding items, up 110% year over year, on sales of $73.9 million, up 51%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 13 cents EPS minus items on sales of $70.6 million.For the September quarter, analysts are looking for Paycom to earn 11 cents a share excluding items, up 38%, on sales of $76.7 million, up 39%.Paycom is starting to face difficult comparisons to big year-ago quarters, so its growth rate is likely to decelerate, MacMillan said.There's a lot to like about Paycom, MacMillan said.

At Oracle's OpenWorld event Ellison said his company's new \"bare metal\" cloud is going to cost less, do more and generally make customers forget Amazon was even in the game. Some analysts are putting buy ratings on ORCL stock based on the Ellison media offensive.At its current price, Oracle has a market-matching price-to-earnings multiple of 18.4, and its dividend of 15\u00a0cents per share delivers a yield of 1.55. Oracle stock has managed to hold its level of nearly $39 per share over the last five days, although the  is up 0.5% during that time.At its current price, Oracle has a market-matching price-to-earnings multiple of 18.4, and its dividend of 15 cents per share delivers a yield of 1.55.AMZN stock, meanwhile, has a P/E of 200, is up 3% over the last five days of trading, and has held the $800 per share level for the last three trading days. So should you take your Amazon profits and buy ORCL stock?In my view, no.Oracle built its new cloud infrastructure with staff hired from Amazon and  (NASDAQ:  ), the current leaders in selling public cloud. It has the advantage of having been created on a \"clean slate.\" It uses software-defined networking logic to create \"off-box virtualization\" that allows provisioning to be addressed in front of computing jobs  .The result is that ORCL can claim its technology offers corporate customers major benefits against  , and the message is aimed mainly at large corporations who have used Oracle equipment and databases in the past, but still face skeptical boards of directors asking why they spend so much on ORCL, while Amazon is so cheap.The market being addressed is basic \"data warehousing,\" in which large amounts of unstructured data, like web logs, are analyzed in real-time to adjust corporate strategies. The picture remains incomplete and the offering is a \"  ,\" some technology analysts say.Ellison's problem is that the cloud ship has already sailed, and even if Oracle could catch up, the prize may not be worth the powder.AWS has grown by offering self-service public cloud infrastructure, with prices starting at free, that can be scaled and built on until a company like  (NASDAQ:  ), which barely existed a decade ago, can itself become part of the Fortune 500. It is an entrepreneur's cloud, not a corporate cloud.Second, even if ORCL were right, and it could overtake AWS in the public cloud, AWS is a $10 billion per year business. Oracle is a $37 billion per year business, and the corporate customers it moves to its bare metal cloud are going to be closing-out existing Oracle systems in order to go there. Cloud saves money, it reduces computing costs, and it transforms computing from something you buy like a house to something you buy like electricity. Oracle's business model is not equipped to handle that change.ORCL's hope is that large enterprises that are just now looking at cloud are going to give Oracle another look, viewing the cloud race as a marathon and not a sprint. But even if cloud is a long game there should be no rush to sell AMZN stock and buy ORCL stock. We will see the change in quarter-to-quarter numbers, and shouldn't buy the press release.All this is why traders have  Oracle's announcement, which came after it disappointed investors with its latest quarterly earnings.ORCL has called-out cloud competitors by name before. In recent years, it has specifically played the feud with  (NYSE:  ), which took an early lead in customer relationship management applications, and with  (NYSE:  ), the leader in human resource management cloud applications. Since Workday's 2012 IPO, it has delivered 150% of Oracle's stock gains, and the price of Salesforce has nearly doubled.The bottom line is that even Oracle optimists aren't raising their price targets. Investors need to be from Missouri on this, and demand that ORCL show them progress in its numbers before they buy its product claims.The post ) Puffs Its Chest, But Amazon.com, Inc.

Few companies have successfully developed therapies that target Parkinson's disease, but  (NASDAQ: ACAD) is one of them. With evidence that Nuplazid reduced hallucinations and delusions in Parkinson's disease patients during clinical trials, the FDA approved the drug in April.That approval makes Nuplazid the only FDA-approved therapy for Parkinson's disease psychosis, and investors will soon discover whether or not that monopoly position translates into a blockbuster commercial success. Acadia Pharmaceuticals officially launched Nuplazid on May 31, so third-quarter results should provide some color on how quickly doctors are embracing it. Since about 40% of the 4 million people suffering from Parkinson's disease suffer from psychosis, the potential exists for this drug to be a top seller.If so, then Acadia Pharmaceuticals would benefit handsomely. Rather than sign on a partner during development, the company retained full global rights to Nuplazid. As a result, if Nuplazid gets off to a strong start, Acadia Pharmaceuticals could be in a prime position to negotiate global rights to the drug, or an outright sale of itself. Potential acquirers wouldn't be limited only to those working on Parkinson's disease, either. Nuplazid is in late-stage studies in Alzheimer's disease psychosis, too. Results from a phase 2 Alzheimer's disease trial are anticipated later this year, and if those results are solid, it could significantly expand Nuplazid's addressable patient population. Between 25% to 50% of the 5 million Americans suffering from Alzheimer's disease also suffer from Alzheimer's disease psychosis.Admittedly, investors could already be pricing a premium for a potential merger or acquisition into shares. Despite lacking sales and spending $72 million on expenses last quarter, the company's market cap exceeds $3.2 billion. Nevertheless, Nuplazid's potential makes me think that Acadia Pharmaceuticals could fetch even more than that from an acquirer. Of course, that depends a lot on Nuplazid's sales ramp and the upcoming Alzheimer's disease data, so investors will want to stay tuned.Image source: Workday. After its exceptional fiscal  , I think cloud-based HR and operations software company  (NYSE: WDAY) is ripe for the picking. Workday only just expanded its multiyear strategic partnership with  for example, and Big Blue will use Workday's Human Capital Management (or HCM) solution to support its entire global workforce of more than 350,000 employees. Workday also welcomed  last quarter as its first South Korean customer, while Dell expanded its use of Workday's products to 125,000 employees given its impending purchase of That's not to say the purchase would be cheap, as Workday currently sports a market capitalization of more than $17 billion. And it would need to be on the terms of co-founders David Duffield and (CEO) Aneel Bhusri, who  through a dual-class stock structure they adopted after their previous company, PeopleSoft, was acquired in a hostile takeover by  over a decade ago.But the appeal is still there with the highly competitive win rates of Workday's core HCM products, which serve as an effective gateway for the company to upsell to other complementary products. Last quarter, almost a third of all new customers purchased Workday Financial Management. And Workday has already secured more than 50 new customers for its Workday Planning product, which will launch with its Workday 27 release within the next month. And that's not to mention the coming releases of Workday Learning, which focuses on encouraging career development for employees, and Workday Student, an education-focused app.In the end, I think Workday could be an attractive acquisition candidate for a number of tech behemoths looking to streamline costs while establishing a solid presence in the enterprise cloud application market.

Sure, it offers a wide range of devices for many needs and lifestyles, but my biggest fear is that the company will at some point feel the pressure to diversify for growth and end up \"diworsifying,\" as legendary investor Peter Lynch would put it.

Financial terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. The move comes as part of Accenture's strategy of strengthening its position across Europe as a provider of Salesforce services and cloud implementations.New Energy Group was founded over a decade ago and the company has evolved as one of the leading provider of Salesforce capabilities in Italy and Spain. The company has operative headquarters in Rome, Milan, London, Madrid and Barcelona, and employs over 450 professionals.The deal pertains to all the assets of New Energy Group, comprising the New Energy Salesforce services team in Italy, the New Energy Salesforce services Aborda team in Spain and the digital services team, Mind, in Italy.Apart from these assets, Accenture will also acquire New Energy's suite of products and solutions based on Salesforce - Bit2win. As per the company, Bit2win \"enables companies to transform their front office with simple, agile and digitally enabled sales solutions\".Post the acquisition, Accenture intends to integrate New Energy Group with its Cloud First Applications team, which specializes in delivering cloud services for Salesforce, Workday  , ServiceNow, Alphabet's  Google and other cloud technology providers.With the latest acquisition, we believe that Accenture will be able to leverage the latest technology for its clients, enhance its performance, and fortify its position as a global leader in the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based application and Salesforce service markets. It will also help Accenture improve customer relationships and expand its market share by solving business-critical issues. | Acquisitions have been one of the key growth strategies for Accenture. Since last year, the company has been aggressively trying to strengthen its position as a leading provider of Salesforce capabilities.Notably, Accenture is already a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with currently over 3,700 skilled consultants. Moreover, given that Salesforce is one of the largest providers of cloud-based applications and software, it is imperative that Accenture enhances its capabilities in delivering the former's services.To this end, in Oct 2015, the company acquired Cloud Sherpas, which specialized in providing cloud advisory and technology services for Google, Salesforce and ServiceNow, in the U.S.In Jan 2016, it bought CRMWaypoint, a cloud advisory and technology service supplier, especially Salesforce's cloud solutions for sales, service and marketing, across the Netherlands. Also, this May, it acquired Tquila UK - one of the leading independent consulting service providers of Salesforce's products and solutions in the region.The company's strategy of enhancing its cloud capabilities through such acquisitions is a step in the right direction, as evident from the recent forecast provided by several independent research firms. According to Gartner, the SaaS and cloud-based business application markets are likely to grow from $31.4 billion in 2015 to $37.7 billion in 2016, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 20.3%.Another research firm, International Data Corporation (IDC) predicts that the cloud software market will witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.3% during the 2014-2019 period, reaching $112.8 billion by 2019 end.Exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud-computing vendors. Therefore, considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, we expect Accenture's investments in this space to propel long-term growth.We are encouraged by Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream.However, we remain cautious about intensifying competition and an uncertain IT spending environment, which may undermine Accenture's near-term performance.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  .Interested in IPOs?

But despite those challenges, IBM has made some promising moves this year. Let's look back at three of its best.IBM's Watson Center at Marina Bay, Singapore. Image source: IBM. (NASDAQ: INTC) currently controls about 99% of the data center chip market, making it tough for IBM's Power CPUs to gain much ground. That's why IBM teamed up with  (NASDAQ: NVDA) and paired its Power CPUs with Nvidia's high-end Tesla GPUs for machine learning and AI purposes. Nvidia claims that its Tesla K80 GPU can run certain science applications \"significantly faster\" than Intel's Xeon 7120 CPU.Last year, IBM claimed that pairing the Tesla K80 with its Power CPUs enabled its Watson AI platform to answer questions 1.7 times faster. It also partnered with Nvidia and the U.S. Department of Energy to install its Power8 CPUs with Tesla P100 GPUs into two new supercomputers by 2018. This May,  that it would start offering Tesla M60 GPUs to its cloud-based enterprise clients to help them \"deploy fewer, more powerful cloud servers while churning through complex jobs faster.\"This partnership strengthens IBM's  initiative, which \"open sources\" Power-based server designs with third-party vendors to boost sales of Power CPUs. Customers who use Power-based servers could also be more likely to buy additional services from IBM's higher-growth \"strategic imperatives\" of cloud, mobile, social, analytics, and security.In June, IBM announced that it was partnering with networking giant  (NASDAQ: CSCO) to provide analytics capabilities at the \"edge\" of networks. The partnership combines IBM's Watson IoT (Internet of Things) and business analytics platforms with Cisco's edge analytics to analyze data from a wide variety of devices in remote locations with limited bandwidth.IBM states that the service's target companies include oil rigs, factories, shipping companies, and mines. By monitoring equipment in real-time with wireless connections, IBM claims that maintenance costs could be reduced \"by up to 50 percent\" as productivity is boosted \"by 25 percent.\" The data gathered from those devices should make Watson, a core component of the company's Cognitive Solutions business, more effective at predictive analytics.IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. Image source: IBM.IBM and Cisco extended that partnership later that month with the creation of cloud-based workplace tools and apps integrated with Watson. That partnership combines IBM's Watson, analytics, email, and social platforms with Cisco's collaboration (business messaging, meeting, and calling) solutions. IBM believes that as Watson gathers data from that platform, it can offer workers \"real-time advice\" for handling tasks and boosting workplace efficiency.In mid-August,  that  (NYSE: WDAY) , a provider of enterprise cloud apps for managing finances and human resources, had adopted IBM Cloud as its primary platform for development and testing. Workday will also eventually use the IBM cloud for other purposes as part of a multi-year agreement.Workday's platform helps companies staff, pay, and organize their workforces. It employs analytics and machine learning to help companies make financial and workforce-related decisions. Therefore, the partnership complements IBM's recent enterprise deals with Cisco.IBM and Workday already worked together prior to the deal. IBM acquired Meteorix, one of Workday's top service partners, last year. It also uses Workday's Human Capital Management platform to manage its own workforce. Demand for Workday's services is strong -- analysts expect its revenue to rise 34% this year and 31% next year.IBM's partnerships with Nvidia, Cisco, and Workday all bolster its higher-growth strategic imperatives, which accounted for 38% of its revenues over the past 12 months. IBM has already announced or closed ten acquisitions this year to strengthen those businesses with new technologies and inorganic sales growth.IBM still faces plenty of near-term headwinds, but investors should also take note of Big Blue's accomplishments over the past year. These individual partnerships might not boost IBM's sales growth back into positive territory on their own, but they represent key building blocks for the company's higher-growth businesses.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Workday shares are up 5% as of this writing.But not everything was exactly peachy for the cloud firm. The results came after the close Wednesday, with revenue growth taking center stage amid strong mid-market results and a \"confusing\" acquisition of  (NYSE:  ) by  (NYSE:  ).On the revenue front, WDAY grew quarterly sales by 34% year-over-year to $377.7 million. That beat estimates for $372.7 million. Subscription revenues were up 37% to $306.2 million.According to Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri:\"We delivered record second-quarter results with solid customer momentum and strong competitive win rates. The results were well balanced across our key initiatives, as we saw consistent strength across product lines, industries, and geographies, and we are proud to welcome our new largest customer based in the APJ region.\"However, the company lost 4 cents per share on an adjusted basis compared to a profit of 2 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. It also missed the consensus estimate for a 2-cent loss. And to top it off, WDAY provided weak guidance for Q3 - $398 million to $400 million against the consensus for $401.1 million.So why exactly is WDAY stock up more than 5%?If investors cared more about this quarter's top line than profit, the lowered Q3 guidance kind of throws that whole \"sales are better than profits\" argument out the window. Rather, it was the mid-market opportunity powering the wheels on the WDAY stock train.According to Workday Co-President Phil Wilmington, Oracle acquired Netsuite to keep up with Workday's progress in luring in financial customers. The cloud firm actually hit its second-strongest quarter for boosting its financial management customer stats. Workday believes Oracle is  in the mid-market with Netsuite, and in doing so, it is also providing a bit of a confusing product:\"Any time a company is confused as to which product is to buy from a competitor, and we're very clear about which one we have, we only have one code line. I think it bodes well for us. And that's based on what happened when Taleo was acquired and SuccessFactors was acquired that both of those have led to a lot of defections over to Workday.\"Of course, when the confusion clears up and the synergies between Oracle and Netsuite become more apparent, Workday is going to have its work cut out for them.

For the quarter, DG earned $307 million, $1.08 per share, on revenues of $5.39 billion, against earnings of $292 million, 95 cents per share, and revenue of $5.1 billion a year earlier. Net profits were 31.2%, high for a retailer, and were up slightly from a year earlier. Source: The problem was that same store sales were up only 0.7% from a year ago, which the company attributed to bigger transactions. Traffic was actually down, especially in home goods and apparel.That was enough for traders, who dropped DG stock 13% on the open, briefly falling below $80 per share, after the company had previously been trading over $90 per share. The fall was especially sharp because expectations for earnings had been high.Dollar General is commonly called a \"dollar store,\" but that is a misnomer. Dollar General might better be termed the department store of last resort, serving rural communities too small for a  (NYSE:  ) to operate, and food deserts in poor urban areas not served by grocers like  (NYSE:  ).Within its niche, Dollar General competes most actively with Family Dollar, which was bought by  (NASDAQ:  ) last year, after a fierce takeover battle with DG.Dollar Tree itself is a true dollar store, in that all the merchandise costs $1. Dollar Tree can put stores in middle-class strip malls and serve bargain hunters coming in for party favors, small gifts or just to see what's available.Dollar General and Family Dollar customers, by contrast, may not have a choice on where to get life's necessities, due to poverty or a lack of transportation (Dollar Tree also reported results below expectations and its stock has fallen 8% in early trade on Aug. 25.).This is what may have changed in the last quarter. The tell for me is the categories where Dollar General was weak - home goods and apparel. These are items stores like Walmart always carry, at comparable or lower prices, but to buy them, you have to get to them, and poor people often can't. With more people getting raises, and with gas cheap, maybe poor people can again.In other words, the present problems with the low-end discounters may persist through the present recovery, but they may recover quickly in the face of another recession.Dollar General has also benefited this decade from changes in its product mix, specifically, the addition of tobacco and alcohol to the product mix. Under former CEO David Perdue, now a U.S. Senator for Georgia, the stores did not usually stock these items.In changing its strategy, DG mostly followed Family Dollar, whose stores are supplied exclusively by the McLane Co., a division of  (NYSE:  , NYSE:  ). Family Dollar moved aggressively in this direction, and Dollar General followed where it could under state laws.Dollar General, however, has a broader, more diverse product mix than Family Dollar, which tends to have the same merchandise in most stores. DG stores will stock pork rinds where customers like pork rinds, and may have extensive liquor stores in small towns that otherwise lack them.A Dollar General may look unkempt, but I learned in touring several for another publication that there is a management method to the apparent madness, with costs obviously kept low to encourage buyers to believe they are getting value for money.Management acted quickly in the face of the latest results. The company authorized repurchase of $1 billion in shares, representing about 5% of the common. DG also continued its regular 25 cent per share dividend, which at Thursday's stock price represents a yield of 1.25%.At its new price level, DG stock has a price-to-earnings multiple of 19, a bit higher than the market. But this is a company that regularly delivers over $10 billion in operating cash flow per year, on a market cap of under $23 billion, whose balance sheet has only 25% of assets under debt - reasonable for a retailer - and which continues to spend to grow, with $268 million in capital allocated over the last six months to open 510 stores and close 594 others.In its earnings report, Dollar General also said it still expects fully diluted earnings for the full year will be up 10% to 15% over last year. The company can compete with anyone and is buying 42 Walmart Express stores - Walmart's threat to build smaller stores and serve smaller communities was the most serious threat to Dollar General's future, in my view.In short, the company is a solid performer and you can get it now at a discount.The post ) Is a Gem at Discount Prices appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: Workday, Inc. (NYSE: WDAY) released fiscal second-quarter 2017 results Wednesday after the market close, and the enterprise cloud application specialist is rightly pleased with its progress, as it continues to prioritize revenue growth and taking market share over its near-term profitability.Quarterly revenue grew 33.6% year over year to $377.7 million, including a 36.9% increase in subscription revenue, to $306.2 million, and 21.3% growth from professional services, to $71.5 million. During the subsequent conference call, management also confirmed total derived billings -- or the sum of revenue and the sequential change in total unearned revenue -- were $431 million, up 38% from the same year-ago period.By comparison, Workday's guidance  called for lower revenue in the range of $371 million to $373 million, while assuming 35% to 36% growth in subscription revenue, to a range of $303 million to $304 million, and 15% to 17% growth in professional services. That guidance also called for total derived billings to grow a more modest 34% year over year, to around $420 million.Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), that translated to a net loss of $108 million, or $0.55 per share. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which adds perspective by excluding items like stock-based compensation, Workday's net loss was $8.6 million, or $0.04 per share.Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri added, \"We delivered record second-quarter results with solid customer momentum and strong competitive win rates. The results were well balanced across our key initiatives, as we saw consistent strength across product lines, industries, and geographies, and we are proud to welcome our new largest customer based in the APJ region.\"To be sure, Workday continued to enjoy solid momentum with the global adoption of its Human Capital Management solution, including -- as I noted in my  earlier this week -- an expanded multiyear strategic partnership under which  will support its entire global workforce of over 350,000 employees. Workday also saw new HCM adopters including Kering (47,000 employees) and  (30,000 employees) in the EMEA region, while at the same time welcoming  as its first South Korean customer, as well as  and Air New Zealand in the ANZ region. Workday also enjoyed a happy consequence of the impending close of Dell's acquisition of  , as Dell expanded its Workday subscription to bring its total employee count to 125,000.Workday also achieved its  quarter in company history for securing new financial management customers, with almost a third of all new customers purchasing Workday Financial Management. Moreover, Bhusri revealed during the call that competitive win rates in the financial management arena are now similar to the typically high rates enjoyed in its core Human Capital Management space, which remain largely unchanged from last quarter.Regarding newer product offerings, for which Workday's core HCM platform tends to serve as a gateway for upselling, Workday has already signed more than 50 customers for the new Workday Planning product, which is on track for general availability with the launch of Workday 27 next month. Management also promised more details on the impending launches of Workday Learning and Workday Student at the company's Financial Analyst Day, scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2016.Workday also acquired operational analytics and data discovery tools provider Platfora during the quarter. During the call, management noted the purchase was similar to Workday's previous acquisitions, as it was \"focused on acquiring world-class technology and talent.\" In the coming quarters, Bhusri says Workday will focus on building Platfora's technology \"into the fabric of our technology platform.\"Workday offered fresh color on what to expect for the remainder of the year. For the current (fiscal third) quarter, Workday expects total derived billings for the quarter to increase 31% year over year to $445 million. And as a result, fiscal Q3 revenue should be in the range of $398 million to $400 million, representing year-over-year growth of 30% to 31%. That includes 36% to 37% growth in subscription revenue, to a range of $331 million to $333 million, and professional services growth of just 7% -- albeit primarily as the company continues to push more services to its ecosystem.For the full fiscal-year 2017, Workday now expects derived billings of $1.88 billion to $1.89 billion (up from previous guidance for $1.87 billion to $1.885 billion) and total revenue of $1.548 billion to $1.558 billion (up from $1.545 billion to $1.555 billion previously). The latter range now assumes fiscal 2017 subscription revenue of $1.278 billion to $1.285 billion, marking a slight increase to the bottom end of Workday's previous subscription revenue guidance range.In the end, this was a straightforward beat-and-raise scenario from Workday, and you'll be hard pressed to find an investor willing to complain about these solid results.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Indeed, for those unlucky investors who bought into Fitbit stock near its August 2015 high near $52, FIT has been downright painful to own. Source: Of course, in light of the company's limited but mostly troubled history as a publicly traded company, the poor performance doesn't come as a complete surprise. That is, by early January a tidal wave of embarrassments - and lawsuits -  was already in motion, and as early as February of this year, the company was already able to warn its first-quarter sales  .Some fans and followers have continued to cheer it on in the meantime, touting the  unveiled just a few days ago. The overall market wasn't impressed, however, judging from the continued stagnation of FIT stock.It begs the question: Giving credit where it's due, last quarter was a decent one for Fitbit. The company  . The bottom line was down on heavy R&D spending, but sales were up 46% as the company kept its fair share of a still-fast-growing wearables market.On the flipside, it has been an ugly fight.As one would expect, once Fitbit validated the market for heart-rate monitoring wearables, cheaper competition materialized. At the same time, the company's so-called PurePulse technology - the part of the tracker that actually tracks the wearer's pulse - has fallen short in terms of consistent accuracy. Lawsuits have  .For all of the headaches Fitbit has faced though, the idea of a wearable activity tracker isn't a bad one. Fitbit has simply chosen the most difficult path to take \u2026 appealing to consumers in a sea of competition. The wiser path may be appealing to insurers.Mobile, medical-grade heart monitors (wrist-worn or strapped across the chest) aren't exactly new, though they're hardly mainstream yet. Part of the reason is simply that insurers don't see a compelling cost/benefit ratio yet, and as such rarely reimburse customers for the purchase of the devices.Strangely, the ones that work with tablets and smartphones are even  .The issue may be one of perception; the  (NASDAQ:  ) watch and Fitbits haven't exactly cultivated an image that they're anything more than high-tech novelties. If FIT stock can work past that stigma and establish itself as a medical-grade equipment maker, it may be able to carve out a nice piece of an upper-tier medical monitoring market.It may need to redesign the product, and then push it through the FDA's 501k regulatory pathway for medical devices. It would be worth it, however.How worth it? The global cardio monitoring market is projected to be worth nearly  . By 2020, the mobile health market as a whole is expected to be  . The overlap of those two markets alone represents a nice-sized piece of pie for current and future owners of Fitbit stock.The nice part is the key fact that Fitbit already has one of the most recognizable names in the market.It's admittedly an off-the-wall idea. Then again, the idea of a wrist-worn activity tracker was an off-the-wall idea a few years ago, and it's a relatively common idea now.It should also be noted such a shift would require a logistical overhaul. There are no strict consumer standards when it comes to wearable technology, while there are mountains of red tape to cut through to satisfy the healthcare industry.Aside from the necessary testing and R&D, Fitbit would need a small army of medical device development veterans to walk it through the process. Meanwhile, FIT stock investors would be forced to remain patient and resign themselves to some turbulence.It may well be worth the wait, however, considering the more the consumer wearables market grows, the better Fitbit's competition gets, and the slower the upgrade cycle gets.

(NYSE: WDAY) is set to announce fiscal second-quarter 2017 results this Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2016, after the market close. With shares of the HR and finance enterprise-application company trading roughly flat so far this calendar year despite handily beating expectations for each of its past  , now is a great time for investors to start thinking about what we should expect to hear when Workday's latest release hits the wires.For perspective, three months ago, Workday told investors fiscal Q2 revenue should arrive in the range of $371 million to $373 million, good for year-over-year growth of roughly 31% to 32%. This range assumes 35% to 36% growth in subscription revenue, to a range of $303 million to $304 million, and \"just\" 15% to 17% growth from Workday's professional services segment. Workday CFO Robynne Sisco reminded investors last quarter that the latter, more modest range was the \"result of our pushing more services to our ecosystem.\"Workday will also break down its total derived billings -- or the sum of revenue and the sequential change in unearned revenue -- which are expected to grow 34% year over year, to around $420 million.In addition, listen for color from management on both competitive dynamics in the industry and Workday's typically high win rates as related to its primary competitors. Last quarter, Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri insisted that the company's pipeline remains healthy -- and especially so when looking at the second half of this fiscal year -- with little to no change in competitive dynamics.That said, Bhusri did note that Workday plans to shift those dynamics in its favor by placing more emphasis going forward on selling and servicing medium-sized businesses. For that, Workday will look to its new lower-cost deployment technologies built specifically to serve this segment of the market. So assuming those plans are now in motion, I'll be interested to hear more on Workday's progress capitalizing on this key incremental growth opportunity.We should also hear comments on whether demand remains strong for Workday's core financial management and human capital management (HCM) products, the latter of which acts as a gateway through which Workday can upsell customers to complementary products. To that end, we'll also want to see if Workday remains on track to deliver several innovative new products later this year, including Workday Planning, Workday Learning, and Workday Student, the successful adoption of which should accelerate Workday's momentum going forward.Relatedly, subsequent to the end of fiscal Q2, Workday announced a new multiyear strategic partnership with  , under which Workday has adopted IBM cloud as the foundation for its development and testing environments. According to Bhusri, this partnership will serve to \"continue accelerating Workday's internal development and testing efforts to support our ongoing global expansion.\"Moreover, Workday hinted in its press release of plans to \"expand the use of IBM Cloud over time beyond development and testing,\" namely by building on the companies' partnership, which already includes IBM's global Workday Consulting Services, IBM's acquisition of Workday services partner Meteorix last year, and IBM's existing use of Workday HCM for its global workforce. Listen for any added clarity this week, then, on the impending expansion of Workday's collaboration with Big Blue.Finally, depending on the gravity of any outperformance or underperformance this quarter, look for any changes to Workday's existing full fiscal-year 2017 guidance. As it stands, that guidance calls for fiscal 2017 revenue to increase 31% to 32% year over year, or to a range of $1.87 billion to $1.885 billion, and for subscription revenue to increase 37% to 38%, or to a range of $1.275 billion to $1.285 billion. Workday also most recently expected operating and free cash flow growth (excluding owned real estate investments) to be approximately in line with growth in billings for fiscal 2017.Given this impressive growth, it might be surprising to see shares of Workday trading even with the start of 2016 as of Tuesday's close. To be fair, shares have also rebounded nearly 70% from their 52-week low, which was set after a painful start to the year as many high-flying, fast-growing tech companies pulled back. But if Workday manages to continue its recent habit of underpromising and overdelivering, I think investors should be more than pleased with where it stands.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The increased capacity gained from IBM Cloud, which has data centers in 17 countries across six continents, should help Workday accelerate its worldwide expansion.Over the course of the multi-year partnership, Workday plans to expand its use of IBM Cloud beyond development and testing purposes. Let's see how this new partnership could benefit both companies.Image source: Getty Images.Workday's services enable organizations to staff, pay, and organize their workforces. Its cloud-based services also leverage analytics and machine learning to help organizations make financial and employee-related decisions. This isn't the first time IBM has partnered with Workday. Last year, IBM acquired Meteorix, one of Workday's top service partners. IBM also uses Workday's Human Capital Management service to manage its own global workforce.Partnering with Workday attaches IBM to a high-growth player in the cloud. Workday revenue rose 38% annually last quarter and is expected to climb 34% this year and another 31% next year. That's a stark contrast to its own 17 straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines.Workday is growing so rapidly, because it has carved out a niche that enterprise cloud giants like  -- which specializes in customer relationship management -- hasn't adequately addressed. That's why Salesforce integrates Workday's software into its own CRM suite.IBM's partnership with Workday will boost the growth of its strategic imperatives (cloud, AI, analytics, mobile, social, and security) businesses -- the high-growth segments which it hopes can offset ongoing declines in IT services, software, and hardware.Revenue from strategic imperatives rose 12% annually to $8.3 billion last quarter and accounted for 38% of IBM's top line over the past 12 months. Within that total, cloud revenue grew 30% to $3.4 billion last quarter. The annual run rate for its higher-growth \"cloud as a service\" revenue -- which includes deals with companies like Workday -- rose nearly 50% to $6.7 billion.Over the past few years, IBM has been aggressively divesting its slower-growth businesses while investing heavily in cloud acquisitions and partnerships to bolster its top line growth. Since the beginning of the year, IBM has acquired  (or parts of companies) to boost its cloud and analytics capabilities. It also secured major cloud deals with  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Workday has a smaller market cap than all of those companies except for Twitter, but its top line is also growing the fastest.Workday stock has stagnated over the past 12 months on concerns of slowing sales growth. Its 38% jump last quarter was impressive, but it also represents a slowdown from 43% growth in the previous quarter and 57% growth a year earlier. Its operating losses have also been widening, and the company's bottom line remains deep in the red.To re-accelerate its revenue growth, Workday must expand to new markets -- something that IBM Cloud can help it do. The scalable nature of IBM Cloud can help keep operating expenses under control as Workday expands.With this announcement, IBM gains a multi-year deal with a fast-growing niche player in the cloud, and Workday gains the ability to expand faster with potentially lower operating costs. So it's safe to call this deal a win-win situation for both companies. However, IBM will likely benefit less, since revenue from the deal will only account for a small slice of its cloud business, while Workday will gain a stronger cloud-based testing and development platform.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Oracle's software as a service (Saas) and platform as a service (PaaS) revenue grew 66% in the fourth quarter, accelerating its annual pace of 36% year-over-year growth. The company is guiding toward even faster growth for in Q1, as it expects cloud revenue to grow between 75% and 80%. Longer term, Chairman Larry Ellison has even higher hopes for its $2.9 billion cloud business:Despite the incredible growth rates coming from cloud, Saas and PaaS revenues are still a small portion of Oracle's overall business. Oracle's cloud revenue in its latest fiscal year is only 7.7% of its total sales. Therefore, increasing cloud revenue wasn't strong enough to offset the loss of business in its more profitable on-premise business. Overall revenue in 2016 decreased 3% from the prior year. Nevertheless, the trend of growing its cloud business relative to total revenue is heading in the right direction.Source: company filingsOracle isn't the only software giant showing success transitioning its traditional on-premise business to the cloud. Last year, Ellison, who's never shy regarding his feelings about the competition, said he no longer pays attention to  (NYSE: SAP) . However, Oracle's German counterpart has also made significant inroads into the cloud.SAP's cloud business in its latest quarter ending March grew 35%. Its trailing-12-month cloud revenue came in at 2.46 billion euros, an 80% increase over the same time frame the prior 12 months. Translated to U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate over one year, SAP's cloud revenue was $2.72 billion, which is slightly below Oracle. Contrary to Oracle, SAP was able to grow its overall revenue in Q1 by 5%.Although Ellison hopes to lead the first software company to grow into a $10 billion cloud business, his chances are pretty slim.  is already at $7 billion in revenue over its past 12 months. In addition to SAP's fighting for the same business as Oracle,  (NYSE: WDAY) is also aggressively going after Oracle's turf.At $1.26 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, Workday is doing less than half the cloud business as Oracle and SAP. However, it's growing at a rapid pace, growing first-quarter revenue at 38% over last year. Unearned revenue -- which is a more accurate reflection of its business, as not all revenue is collected up front -- grew 42% over last year. Additionally, the company founded by former Peoplesoft co-founder Dave Duffield and executive Aneel Bhusri is aggressively going after Oracle's bread and butter. The former victims of a hostile takeover by Oracle are rapidly expanding their Workday Financials solutions to go along with the company's HR software suite.Both SAP and Oracle can be criticized for being late to the cloud-computing game. The hesitation was somewhat justified given the sacrifice it had to make to its high-margin on-premise business. Cloud solutions aren't as profitable as on-premise software, but the software juggernauts had to move aggressively to changing customer demands. However, it comes with a sacrifice to margins.Source: company filings..Although a shift to the cloud was a necessary strategy change for the tech behemoths, the payoff hasn't been to kind to investors. Both Oracle and SAP are trailing the S&P 500 since 2013 by a wide margin.Despite its recent struggles, neither company is taking its foot off the pedal. In May, Oracle acquired Opower, the leading provider of customer engagement and energy efficiency cloud services to utilities. Meanwhile SAP has set a target of 8.0 billion euros in cloud revenue by 2020.High hopes and talking a big game seem to be SAP and Oracle's forte. However, results have been mediocre at best.

The most any investor can hope for is a few clues along the way.Screening for sales growth is easy. Finding profitable sales growth requires more work. Image source: Getty Images.\"Past performance,\" the experts tell us, \"  .\" But life is generally short on guarantees in any case. The most any investor can hope for is a few clues along the way.In the absence of a crystal ball, I can't think of any better clue how a company will perform in the future than how it's shown itself able to perform in the past. So if I'm asked which companies are likely to double their sales next year, the first thing I want to know is which companies have proven their ability to double their sales -- consistently -- in the past.And this is where a screener comes in handy.Using  's excellent, free screening program, I quickly pulled together a list of no fewer than 57 companies that have averaged roughly 100% sales growth annually over the last five years.Granted, most of these companies are names you've never heard of before -- speculative microcap names with stocks priced in the pennies, like  ,  ,  , and the like. Companies that, as a general rule, I'd advise any investor to be very careful about investing in, and only to buy after doing substantial due diligence beforehand.On the other hand, though, the list of 100% growers includes quite a few more recognizable names -- including the three that we'll look at today.Let's start with  (NYSE: WDAY) , the cloud computing human resources software company. Valued at $15.3 billion, Workday is no fly-by-night penny stock operation but a major software provider that did $788 million in sales last year. Over the past five years, Workday has grown its sales at an average of more than 175% annually, and next year it's expected to generate sales more than twice what it collected last year -- $1.56 billion, according to analysts surveyed by  .A second big name that you'll surely recognize is  (NASDAQ: TSLA) , the electric car company run by tech billionaire Elon Musk. Tesla's only been in business for a little over a decade, but as you can probably imagine, selling luxury cars at more than $100,000 a pop is a great way to grow sales quickly. It's also a path to sales success that Musk has capitalized on.Over the past five years, Tesla's sales have averaged a growth rate of 103% per year, hitting $5.3 billion in 2015. Analysts who follow the company expect to see that number double again to $11.7 billion.One somewhat more esoteric name that popped up on Finviz's screen -- but a name that will be immediately familiar to anyone who follows the Chinese stock market -- is  (NYSE: QIHU) . Often ridiculed as  (which has in turn been derided as a Chinese knockoff of  ), Qihoo has come into its own of late, outgrowing its archrival and posting compound sales growth of 99.1% over the past five years.Okay, so I bent the rules a bit to call Qihoo a \"100% grower.\" But at least Qihoo is maintaining its momentum. Last year, Qihoo tipped the scales at $1.8 billion in sales, and next year, it's expected to generate sales more than twice that number -- $3.7 billion, according to analysts polled by S&P Global.Each of these companies has been growing at 100% (or near enough) for years. Each is expected to post superb sales growth next year as well. But assuming they do, is that fact alone reason to buy these three stocks?Not necessarily. You see, anyone can grow sales rapidly. The key to successful investing, though, is finding a stock that can grow sales  (The old example of the car salesman who buys cars for $20,000, sells them for $10,000, and promises to \"make it up on volume\" springs to mind. He'll make a lot of sales and grow revenues nicely for a time... but eventually go bankrupt.) So how do these three stocks stack up in terms of profitable sales growth?Well, Workday has its work cut out for it. While sales are rising nicely, losses are growing as well. Last year, Workday reported generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) losses of $248 million. This year, it's expected to lose $290 million, and losses are expected to continue mounting through 2019. Workday isn't expected to turn profitable before 2021 at the earliest.Tesla, despite  it's been getting lately, is actually in a slightly better position. While unprofitable today, Tesla is forecast to turn the corner -- and turn in positive profits -- as early as 2018. If analysts are to be believed, those profits will then double in 2019 (to nearly $7 a share) and keep growing steadily from there on out.Meanwhile, Qihoo 360 sports the shiniest numbers of all. Whereas Tesla sees profitability in the near future, and Workday could become profitable... eventually... Qihoo is already earning its profits today. Last year, Qihoo booked $1.58 per share in profits. It's set to nearly double that number this year, grow profits nearly 70% in 2017, and average 35% annualized earnings growth over the next five years.In short, if you're screening for great sales growth, it's not too hard to find a few stocks worth considering. But if it's  rapid-fire sales growth you're after, the choices may come down to just one: Qihoo 360.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

What's an investor to make of all the recent developments?LendingClub's problems started when CEO Renaud Laplanche was sent packing by the board of directors back in May. Laplanche  didn't provide full information on a probe into a basket of loans made with questionable characteristics, and also didn't fully disclose holding an outside investment.The fallout continued this quarter. The departure of CFO Carrie Dolan was announced along with second-quarter results. LendingClub also reported a big loss, due in part to the drop in loan volume and the write-down of an acquisition in 2014 of a healthcare lender.Second-quarter revenue increased a respectable 7% to $103.4 million from the same quarter last year. But a hefty $35.4 million goodwill impairment from the failed purchase of  back in 2014 and charges related to the loan investigation and departure of Laplanche sent the net loss down to a hefty $81.4 million. This worked out to a loss of $0.21 per share.Management tried to put a positive spin on the quarter. It touted $2 billion in total loan volume and 170,000 borrowers. The website is definitely unique and lets individuals sign up for as little as $25 to earn money by making loans.The new CEO, Scott Sanborn, also mentioned that 15 of its top 20 lenders have already returned to the website since bailing back in May on the concerns its loan practices are questionable.LendingClub ended the quarter with $832 million in cash on its balance sheet. This works out to nearly $2.20 per diluted share. In other words, it represents nearly half of the current share price.Book value hovers right around $3 per share and likely represents a floor to the stock. A general rule of thumb is to buy a financial stock at book value and sell it when it doubles. Currently, LendingClub hovers right in between those two levels.The company should also eke out a profit this year. Analysts expect seven cents in earnings and an improvement in 2017 to $0.16 per share.Despite the reasonable multiple of book value and high cash balance, it's hard to make a compellingly bullish argument for investing in LendingClub.The management turnover is worrisome. Laplanche founded LendingClub and the loss of the CFO indicates that the company is on uneven footing right now.The drop in loan activity is also a big uncertainty, though the return of large investors is certainly encouraging.Also, in contrast to more traditional lenders, LendingClub doesn't make loans. Instead, it earns fees for matching up lenders and borrowers. It also charges much less than credit card firms, including  (  ),  (  ), and  (  ).In other words, consumers benefit from LendingClub's business model.Back in March I penned an article speaking to the  of the fintech, or financial technology, industry. Compared to larger financial firms, the fintech players are smaller, more nimble and subject to less regulation and scrutiny.At that time, LendingClub was estimated to earn $0.27 per share, though its business model was still in flux and it was having to change how it charges fees to comply with state regulations.Given the management turnover, reduced expectations, and loss of trust, investors would be best off waiting on the sidelines right now. Of the stocks I profiled,  (  ), which helps smaller firms run their human resources functions, including payroll and related financial responsibilities, is performing the best. It trades at a high price-to-earnings ratio, but is projected to be firmly profitable this year.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoIn trading on Friday, shares of Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY) crossed below their 200 day moving average of $74.08, changing hands as low as $73.39 per share.

The difference between the two numbers can be extensive. For example, below is a look at GAAP and non-GAAP net income reported by some popular tech names in their most recent quarters.\n  \nAll numbers in thousands, USD. Source: Company filingsPitching profits by backing out compensation to employees is not a practice I'm fond of. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett agrees. Prior to the dot-com bubble bursting, Buffett wrote the following in his 1998 letter to shareholders:Not only is share-based compensation often misrepresented by managers, it also triggers a risk that is overlooked by investors. If the price of the stock goes down, whether it is related to the company itself or the overall market, there is a higher chance of decreasing morale and higher attrition. Although any company with a large portion of its compensation tied to equity is susceptible to this risk, one that sticks out to me is Workday.In its most recent fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2016, Workday's share-based compensation of nearly $250 million accounted for 22% of total revenue. To put that into perspective, share-based compensation at Salesforce and  are 9% and 3%, respectively. Now, imagine how much of the workforce is not going to be happy if the stock price is cut in half.A stock price decrease of a large magnitude at a company that relies heavily on share-based compensation recently occurred. When LinkedIn reported fourth-quarter 2015 results in late January, its stock price plummeted over 40%. The next day, CEO Jeff Weiner held an all-hands meeting reassuring employees of the strength of LinkedIn:In case the motivational speech wasn't enough, Weiner forfeited his $14 million annual bonus and gave it as a bonus to employees.Image Source: LinkedInThe importance of keeping employees happy is important at Workday and LinkedIn. Both companies stress the role of culture to the success of their respective businesses. In its 10-K, LinkedIn singles out its values and unique company culture as the foundation of its success. In Workday's annual report, the company mentions the failure of maintaining its company culture as a risk to its business.When a few negative Glassdoor reviews showed that the company may be having morale issues, the company addressed them aggressively. CEO Aneel Bhusri was questioned about the reviews in its latest earning call and he answered with the following:Regardless of recent negativity surrounding LinkedIn and Workday, both companies still score well on Glassdoor. Of the LinkedIn employees who rated it on Glassdoor, 89% would recommend it to a friend and 98% rank its CEO favorably. In fact, Weiner was the 5th highest rated CEO of 2016. For Workday, 73% of employees would recommend the company to a friend while 94% approve of Bhusri.Although it is pure speculation on my part, I believe one of the reasons LinkedIn sold itself to  (NASDAQ: MSFT) was because it was in danger of losing its highly valued employees. A price drop over 40% likely left many employee options worthless, especially the newer ones.The company granted over 280,000 stock options during fiscal year 2015. The average price of those options was $259 per share. According to company filings, LinkedIn had 683,788 or 47% of all options outstanding that had a weighted exercise price over $170 per share. On the day of the announcement of the sale, LinkedIn shares popped 47% from $131 per share to over $192, bringing many of those options in the money.Over the last 4 years, the amount of share-based compensation as a percentage of revenue at LinkedIn climbed from 9% to 17%. Workday is seeing a similar trajectory.Data source: Company filingsAccording to its most recent annual filing, the company did not grant any new stock options in its latest fiscal year. However, it did grant over 5 million restricted stock units which are priced at over $85 per share, which is near where it trades today. A 40% haircut in its share price may not necessarily mean Workday will need to find a buyer, but it will put a dent in the pocketbooks of its employees.It's common practice in the Silicon Valley for tech companies to compensate employees with a combination of stock and stock options. While the practice often dilutes the equity ownership of the company, it also aligns the interests of employees and management with shareholders'. Additionally, cash is often needed to help grow the company. Profits are not expected over the short term so compensation in equity is a good way for these companies to recruit talent without paying high salaries. While not all shareholders are fans of share-based compensation, it is commonplace in many young companies and it does serve a purpose.However, investors should not only keep a close eye on management's accounting treatment of options, but they should also be keen to how a drop in stock price can affect employee morale and turnover.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Stock-based compensation, or equity compensation, is a method used by companies to reward and retain employees. Fast-growing technology companies use it as a way to attract engineering and executive talent, with the potential for major stock appreciation in the future compensating for lower cash salaries today.Stock-based compensation comes in a few different flavors. Stock options, which give employees the right to buy shares of the company's stock at a predetermined price after a vesting period, are one popular form. Restricted stock units, which result in the company distributing common shares directly to employees after a vesting period, are another. In both cases, the vesting period creates an incentive for employees to remain at the company for at least a few years, and the resulting ownership stake is supposed to align the interests of executives with those of the company.Prior to 2005, companies were not required to treat stock-based compensation as a cost under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Disclosures in the footnotes of financial reports were required, so investors weren't completely in the dark, but stock-based compensation had no effect on the bottom line. Stock-based compensation does increase the total number of outstanding shares, making each share represent a smaller ownership stake in the company.The rules were eventually changed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to reflect that stock-based compensation represents a real expense, despite the fact that it's non-cash. Today, companies are required to expense stock-based compensation during the period in which its granted. When a company reports its GAAP results, stock-based compensation is included in the relevant expense categories.Technology companies that rely heavily on stock-based compensation to attract employees often report large GAAP losses due to this rule. A few examples are social network  (NYSE:  ) , network security equipment vendor  (NYSE: PANW) , and software-as-a-service provider  (NYSE: WDAY) .Technology companies, particularly those unable to produce a GAAP profit, often report non-GAAP figures along with the required GAAP results. These non-GAAP numbers back out various items, some of which are more reasonable to exclude than others. Stock-based compensation is almost always backed out, and the result is that an unprofitable company can claim to be profitable, at least according to its own fairy-tale numbers.\n  \nData source: Twitter, Palo Alto Networks, and Workday quarterly reports.GAAP accounting isn't perfect, and there are some adjustments that are often reasonable to make. But stock-based compensation is not one of them. Warren Buffett put it best in his latest letter to  shareholders:Unfortunately, many analysts perpetuate the game that technology companies play with earnings by providing estimates on a non-GAAP basis. Investors who don't look past the headlines are led to believe that companies like Twitter, Palo Alto Networks, and Workday are profitable. They're not.Stock-based compensation also complicates free cash flow, which is sometimes touted as an alternative to GAAP earnings. Free cash flow is a useful number, as it represents the amount of cash a company's operations generate minus capital expenditures. But since stock-based compensation is non-cash, it gets added right back in. When the only source of free cash flow is stock-based compensation, that free cash flow fails to reflect the company's true profitability.Handing out massive amounts of stock-based compensation has one major downside for companies. In the event that the stock price crashes, retaining employees, who would then be receiving compensation in a currency that's losing value, becomes a challenge.Twitter is currently struggling with this exact problem. The company's stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value since April of 2015, when  . This deep slump forced Twitter to offer additional cash and stock bonuses earlier this year to employees in an effort to keep them on board, raising costs and diluting shareholders further.For investors, the key takeaway is this: stock-based compensation is a real expense, and should be treated as such. Ignore the non-GAAP numbers that tech companies tout as superior, and ignore analyst estimates that fail to account for all of a company's costs. Don't assume that free cash flow is a reasonable representation of profitability, because it's often not when stock-based compensation expenses are high. The number that a company wants you to focus on is rarely the number that you should.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Shares of the cloud-based HR and finance applications company fell around 3% in Tuesday's after-hours trading despite releasing better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter 2017 results.Quarterly revenue climbed 38% year over year, to $345.4 million, including a 39% increase in subscription revenue, to $280 million, and 31% growth in professional services revenue, to $65.4 million. For perspective, each of these figures were above Workday's most recent guidance, which called for revenue in the range of $337 million to $339 million, including subscription revenue of $277 million $278 million. During the subsequent conference call, Workday CFO Robynne Sisco elaborated that total derived billings -- or the sum of revenue and the sequential change in unearned revenue -- was $372 million for the quarter, up 37% from the same year-ago period and also ahead of guidance, which called for total derived billings between $360 million and $365 million.Trending toward the bottom line -- and keeping in mind Workday consciously forsakes profitability in favor of taking market share and driving top-line growth -- that translated to an operating loss of $73.6 million, and a net loss of $80.6 million, or $0.41 per share, compared to a net loss of $61.6 million, or $0.33 per share in last year's first quarter. On an adjusted basis, which adds perspective by excluding items like stock-based compensation, Workday generated operating income of $11.1 million, and net income of $10.7 million, or $0.05 per share.In this case, note Workday doesn't typically provide specific financial guidance for its bottom line. But as I pointed out in my  last week, analysts' consensus estimates predicted Workday would incur an adjusted net  of $0.02 per share on lower revenue of $338.7 million.Meanwhile, Workday continued to generate healthy cash flows; Operating cash flow jumped just over 75% year over year, to $161.5 million, and after accounting for $34.5 million in capital expenditures excluding owned real estate, free cash flow climbed 98.8% over the same period, to $127 million. Recall last quarter, management told investors they expect growth in both operating and free cash flow (excluding investments in new buildings) to be roughly in line with billings growth this fiscal year.Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri added,Looking forward, Workday anticipates current-quarter revenue to be in the range of $371 million to $373 million, representing growth of roughly 31% to 32% over last year's fiscal Q2. Within that total should be subscription revenue of $303 million to $304 million, or 35% to 36% growth, with derived billings up 34% to roughly $420 million. To that end, according to Sisco during the call, Workday's professional services segment will achieve growth of \"only\" 15% to 17% year over year in the fiscal second quarter \"as a result of our pushing more services to our ecosystem.\" Though we don't pay much attention to Wall Street's near-term demands, note analysts' consensus estimates called for fiscal Q2 revenue of $370.9 million, or just below the low end of Workday's guidance range.Finally, for the full fiscal-year 2017, Workday now expects derived billings to increase to a range of $1.87 billion to $1.885 billion, or 31% to 32% growth, representing a modest increase from its previous forecast for full-year derived billings of $1.855 billion to $1.875 billion. At the same time, Workday reiterated its guidance for full fiscal-year 2017 subscription revenue to be in the range of $1.275 billion to 1.285 billion, up 37% to 38% over last year.So it might seem strange to see the market driving shares down in response for now. But while shares were technically down around 5% year to date going into Tuesday's close, investors would do well to remember Workday stock had also rebounded to the tune of 60% from its February lows, thanks to a combination of both the market's historically painful start to the year and Workday's impressive fiscal fourth-quarter 2016 report released in late February.Nonetheless, there's no denying this was a solid beat and (selective) raise from Workday. As the company continues to enjoy strong demand for its flagship applications while looking forward to the impending release of promising new products, I think long-term investors should be more than happy with this performance.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 38 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Workday Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $49.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $99.00. The standard deviation is $11.895. But the whole reason to look at the  WDAY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with WDAY crossing above that average target price of $79.05/share, investors in WDAY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $79.05 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

(NYSE: WDAY) is set to release fiscal first-quarter 2017 results Tuesday, May 31, 2016 after the market close. With shares of the HR and finance enterprise-application specialist down around 5% so far this year -- and despite  in March following its strong fiscal Q4 2016 report -- you can bet the HR and finance enterprise-application specialist would love to continue that momentum with another strong showing.But what, exactly, should investors be watching when Workday's latest results hit the wires?First, note that Workday's most-recent guidance calls for first-quarter revenue in the range of $337 million to $339 million, representing year-over-year growth of 34% to 35%. Within that total, Workday anticipates recurring subscription revenue to comprise $277 million to $278 million, good for roughly 38% growth from last year's fiscal Q1. Meanwhile, total derived billings -- that is, the sum of revenue and the sequential change in unearned revenue -- should be between $360 million and $365 million, or growth of 33% to 34%.Digging deeper into the drivers of that growth, listen for comments from management on whether the company has enjoyed its typically high competitive win rates, and whether demand remains strong for its financial management and human capital management (HCM) products, both of which are crucial to developing and driving sustained growth. The highly regarded HCM products, in particular, enjoy strong renewal rates, and tend to act as a gateway product through which Workday can upsell its customers to additional complementary products. This, in turn, makes Workday and its software offerings increasingly indispensable to the clients it serves.Looking further out, Workday also told investors last quarter that it expects subscription revenue to grow sequentially in the fiscal second, third, and fourth quarters of the year by just under 10%. At the same time, Workday stressed its strategy of prioritizing top-line growth over margins, while simultaneously maintaining its longer-term goal of achieving operating margin of at least 20%.Next, Workday doesn't typically provide specific bottom-line guidance, primarily given its conscious decision to forsake profitability in favor of driving revenue and market share higher in these early stages. But for perspective -- and while we typically don't pay much attention to Wall Street's near-term demands -- analysts' consensus estimates predict Workday will incur an adjusted net loss of $0.02 per share on revenue of $338.7 million -- the latter of which is near the high-end of its guidance range.We should also watch for Workday to continue generating healthy levels of operating and free cash flow. Last fiscal year, for example, operating cash flow skyrocketed 150% year over year, to $259 million, while free cash flow grew to $125 million last fiscal year, or just over 10% of total revenue, from roughly breakeven in fiscal 2015. In addition, with the caveat from CFO Mike Peek that Workday's cash flow is \"inherently difficult to forecast due to changes in working capital,\" and excluding investments in new buildings, the company expects growth in both operating cash flow and free cash flow to be roughly inline with growth in billings this fiscal year.Depending on the extent of any variances in Workday's first-quarter performance, investors should also keep an eye on any revisions to the company's full-year guidance. As it stands, Workday's outlook calls for full-year derived billings to be $1.855 billion to $1.875 billion, good for 30% to 31% growth, with roughly 42% of that total expected in the first half of the year.Meanwhile, Workday should secure subscription revenue for the year of $1.25 billion to $1.285 billion, or growth of 37% to 38%. And total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.55 billion, or growth of 33% over fiscal 2016.This quarter's results are only a snapshot of the early days of Workday's long-term growth story. But it's a valuable picture that will give investors plenty to chew on as they decide whether the stock is worthy of a place in their long-term portfolios. If Workday delivers on its promises as it strives to secure as large a piece of its growing market as possible, next week's report should make that decision much easier.

Yet, since its IPO in October 2012, the stock price has increased 175%.Many value-oriented investors will often grow frustrated with this type of performance from an unprofitable business. Words like \"bubble,\" \"frothy,\" and \"overvalued\" are popular adjectives used to describe Silicon Valley-based technology companies. These same words have been used to describe  .The year before it launched on the Nasdaq in 2004, Salesforce incurred losses of $10 million. Since then, the company has fluctuated between losses and meager profitability. However, net income in 2015 came in at -$263 million. The company's stock price since becoming public is up an incredible 1,680%.So what gives? A mistake many value investors make is that they look at how a company has performed in the past and how it's performing now. For example, since 2000, net income at  has tripled. Its stock price since then is up 2.9%. One of the reasons is what the market is forecasting going forward. Wal-Mart has done a  gaining traction in e-commerce, and the market is pricing its expectations accordingly.Workday, on the other hand, has grown revenue 54% annually over the past five years, from $134 million in 2011 to nearly $1.2 billion in its latest fiscal year. Naturally, as the base grows higher, it becomes harder to grow the top line at such a strong pace. Growth  to 43% in its latest quarter, but there's still a long runway ahead.According to Grand View Research, the HR software market size is projected to reach $10 billion in 2022. The global enterprise resource planning market is expected to reach $41.69 billion by 2020. Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri sees higher potential, as he pegged Workday's market opportunity at $60 billion, with an opportunity in financial solutions being larger than human capital management (HCM).For comparison purposes, Gartner estimates the customer relationship market (CRM) that Salesforce competes in to be just under $25 billion in size. Salesforce does control a much larger share of its respective market than Workday does for HCM and financials. However, the opportunity is there for Workday to become at least as large as Salesforce. In terms of market capitalization, Salesforce is a $52 billion company, while Workday is worth $15 billion. Looking at the income statement of Workday, it's understandable why investors would quickly move on to the next idea.\n  \nAll numbers in thousands of U.S. dollars. Source: company filings.However, a closer look at the cash flow statement tells a better story.\n  \nAll numbers in thousands of U.S. dollars. Source: company filings.Free cash flow is often a better measure of profitability, since it's not beholden to accounting rules and management estimates in the income statement. You can see with Workday that free cash flow is painting a much brighter picture than the income statement. In fact, Workday became free cash flow-positive this past year, generating nearly $125 million in cash. That's important, since that cash can be invested right back into the business, lessening the need to dilute shareholders by raising more equity.There are two main reasons for the large gap in free cash flow and net income.The first is that share-based compensation of $250 million is included as an expense in the income statement but it is not actually a cash outlay for Workday. However, I'm not a fan of giving companies credit for issuing stock to employees and management. There's nothing wrong with giving team members incentive, but it does come out of shareholders' pockets. It may not hit the cash flow statement, but it does dilute the equity.The more important metric in measuring Workday's success is its increase in deferred revenue. Workday typically offers customers access to their applications with a three-year agreement. The customer will pay for one year at a time until the three-year subscription expires. Because of accounting rules, although the customer is obligated to pay for three years and pays one of those three years upfront, revenue isn't recognized immediately. It's spread out over the term of the agreement. In its latest fiscal year, Workday's deferred revenue increased over $260 million to $900 million, nearly the same amount in actual revenue.As my Fool colleague Tim Green noted in  article, free cash flow isn't always free. If Workday were to all of a sudden stop growing like gangbusters yet maintain the same cost structure, the company would burn through cash really quickly. However, if it can maintain growth, the free cash flow can be a great source of funds to grow its business while it leverages its operating costs over time. A quick look at Workday's cost structure compared with its peers shows that the company can become very profitable when it no longer needs to invest in its business at the rate it does today.\n  \nSource: latest annual company filings.Workday is already on pace to catch up to Salesforce in terms of gross margins. Workday was able to achieve 76% gross margins in its latest quarter, surpassing Salesforce's 2015 margin. The bulk expense weighing down Workday's profitability is its development costs. Workday spends 40% of its revenue on product development compared with its peers, which are spending a mid-teens percentage of their budget on the same category. This expense should come down as Workday's product matures and as the company grows the top line. Reducing development costs in half will lead operating margins close to breakeven.Workday is still a long way from achieving profitability. Like many fast-growing technology companies, its focus right now is investing in its sales team and product. If the company can continue to grow at a rapid pace and improve margins down the road, investors may be rewarded accordingly. However, buyer beware: With the company priced at 13 times sales, any hiccups can lead to a volatile ride.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Subscription revenue rose 44% to $261.8 million, while professional services revenue rose 39% to $61.6 million.Non-GAAP EPS came in at a loss of $0.01, an improvement over a loss of $0.06 during the prior-year period, and $0.04 higher than analysts were expecting. On a GAAP basis, Workday lost $0.42 per share, worse than a $0.32 loss during the same period last year. GAAP operating loss was $73.4 million, representing 22.7% of revenue.The company expects subscription revenue between $277 million and $278 million during the first quarter and total revenue between $337 million and $339 million. For the full year, revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.54 billion to $1.55 billion, representing 33.2% growth at the midpoint. Workday continues to grow revenue at an astounding rate, even as it passed the $1 billion mark in fiscal 2016. The company is still wildly unprofitable on a GAAP basis, but it is free cash flow positive thanks to deferred revenue growth and its heavy use of stock-based compensation. In fiscal 2016, the company generated $125 million in free cash flow, compared to a $290 million GAAP net loss and a $2.5 million non-GAAP net loss.Going forward, Workday will need to keep up its impressive growth rate to keep investors on board.

And for that reason, investors should always be on the lookout for similar high-growth stocks.If you're looking for a place to start, consider these eight stocks to buy - all of which are growing faster than NFLX. 33% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth:  31% (  ) is one of the fastest growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers in the world, with expected revenue growth of 33% and 31% over the next two years, respectively. While the company operates in many layers of SaaS, its core business is in human resource management (HRM).HRM is a business that has  , and Workday is the fastest growing company in the arena. With just $1.5 billion in revenue expected this year, WDAY is still a fly on the wall in HRM, but over time, its push to bring all human-resource-related operations to the cloud are sure to bring the company higher market share.It is this assumption that explains Workday's $14 billion market capitalization. 28% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 27%Ironically,  (  ) stock recently fell 50% in a single session after it  . That \"light\" guidance still figures revenue growth at a midpoint of 28%, and analysts expect DATA to grow another 27% the year after. (As a note, Wall Street is expecting revenue growth of 29% for Tableau this year.)While the company is not growing at the 50%-plus rate it once was, DATA still is performing just fine. During its last quarter,  , with the number of $100,000 or higher transactions rising 36% year-over-year to 414. Furthermore, Tableau's international business remains a bright spot, growing 63% during its last quarter and accounting for 26% of total revenue.Clearly, Tableau Software is growing much faster than Netflix, and because it is oversold, investors are likely to find much higher long-term upside in DATA than NFLX. 32% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 29%If DATA is the big data stock that Wall Street loves to hate, then  (  ) is the one it loves.SPLK has soared 43% in the past month behind its strong fourth-quarter earnings and outlook for the coming year.The company's guidance implies revenue growth of 32%, and analysts think that SPLK could add another 29% revenue growth the year after. With  and over 11,000 total, SPLK certainly appears to be operating on autopilot.As a result, many research firms like BMO think that SPLK will  billings by 45% this year. Since billings translate to revenue, such growth bodes well for SPLK investors long-term.Frustratingly, Fitbit's financial performance has actually been exceptional, making its downward spiral all the more confusing. Despite three straight quarterly beats on revenue and earnings per share, Wall Street always seems to find something to dislike about Fitbit. 32% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 21% (  ) revenue is expected to grow roughly 32% this year, and more than likely, that figure is well short of how FIT will  perform.Since Fitbit's IPO last year, all the company has done is beaten and raised guidance with each earnings report. Its full-year revenue of $1.86 billion last year was $460 million higher than what analysts and the company expected last July. Further, Fitbit was the  of the holidays,  that 2016 will be yet another breakout year for FIT, and the company  to enter the faster growing smart wearables market.Collectively, there is a lot to like about this fast growing company, and the fact that Wall Street pairs it so closely to the failures of  (  ) makes it all that much more attractive. After all, FIT has given investors no reason to bet against it, yet the stock is down 50% over the past three months.To me, that's a rather good reason to be bullish from here. 33% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 24%Threat prevention leader  (  ) has faced harsh criticism over the past year for its decelerated growth.While FireEye may never again grow 150% or more in a single year, the company maintains an impressive growth rate. For 2016 and 2017, revenue will grow 33% and 25%, respectively.Meanwhile, with FEYE shares down 57% the last year, its stock price is better aligned with the actual performance of its business. That's why low expectations and the company's strategic move toward FireEye-as-a-service (FaaS) could provide an unexpected spark for current owners of the stock.FaaS has only penetrated  , and is already on a $100 million-plus revenue run rate after recently launching.That success gives investors a reason to be excited. 46% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 33% (  ) is the cybersecurity stock that Wall Street favors among the group of next-gen service providers. The company's $1.1 billion in revenue supports a whopping $14 billion market capitalization.The reason is because of its growth. Palo Alto is expected to grow 46% this year and 33% next year. That's impressive, but with PANW's next-generation firewalls being a secondary service among the majority of its customers, there is great upside for Palo Alto to further up-sell its products and services long-term.Yes, PANW might be a little pricey, but then again, cyber crime is a serious threat, and PANW is one of the best at solving the problem.Based on just about every traditional value metric, Facebook stock looks expensive. FB sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 85, a forward P/E of 26 and a price-to-sales ratio in the high teens. 46% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 33%Facebook is the final, and perhaps most impressive, company growing much faster than Netflix.FB is much larger than NFLX, with its revenue expected to top $33.8 billion by the end of next year, which will come via 42% and 33% sales growth over the next couple years, respectively.What's more impressive is that there is no end in sight. Facebook has at least  that can grow the company much, much larger. Furthermore, FB could very well  in the next five years, just off the success and growth of Facebook's core platform and Instagram alone, completely eliminating the potential from WhatsApp and Messenger.With that said, some put FB and NFLX in the same conversation, believing Facebook is too expensive.

But things may be changing - and the reason is deal-making. Today the company announced the $2.6 billion acquisition of  , which is a top provider of healthcare data analytics.Keep in mind that there is still much to do to get things back on track. After all, IBM stock is still down about 24% since July. On the news, IBM stock is up about 5%.Let's face it, the core business has continued to languish. In the fourth quarter, revenues plunged by 8.5% and the guidance was definitely uninspiring.The problem is that IBM has been paying the price for its foot-dragging with the move to the cloud. The result is that a variety of other companies, like  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and even  (  ), have been able to get the lion share of the opportunity.Interestingly enough, the growth in the cloud has also weighed on the IBM consulting services unit. After all, there is not as much need for these types of offerings when companies are using technologies that are easier to install and maintain.So to put things into perspective, IBM has seen over  ! Oh, and there have been declines for  . So in light of this, is it any wonder that IBM stock has been a loser?All kind of grim, right? Perhaps so. Yet for gusty investors, there are still some positives to consider.Basically, IBM has been focused on aggressively pursuing its so-called Strategic Imperatives, which involves heavy investments in fast-growing categories like security, mobile, the Internet-of-Things (IoT), analytics and the cloud. And so far, there has been traction. Last year IBM posted a  in revenues for its Strategic Imperatives, which now account for a hefty 35% of overall revenues.But at the heart of all this is a focus on cognitive functions. In other words, this involves the ability to process huge amounts of data so as to allow for better decisions. This is really about the next phase of the cloud revolution, which will go beyond just allowing for ease-of-use and lower costs.The good news is that IBM is nicely positioned for this megatrend. Keep in mind that last year, the company generated almost $18 billion in revenues from analytics. No doubt, a key has been from its Watson technology.In fact, to bolster this, IBM has been smart to acquire data-savvy companies, such as the  and yes, Truven.Although, the deal for Truven could provide the biggest catalyst for IBM stock. Consider that the company will have a data set of about  , with information on important categories like costs, claims and outcomes (there have also been other important acquisitions in the space during the past year, such as for  ,  and  ). Truven will also bring with it over 8,500 customers.All this technology should help with the major changes in the healthcare industry, which will increasingly be about getting better value for services and a move away from the traditional fee-for-services model. And this requires sophisticated data and insights.The market opportunity is also massive. According to a report from  , the spending on healthcare IT is excepted to hit a whopping $104.5 billion by 2020 in the U.S.The valuation on IBM stock is certainly at attractive levels, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio at only 9X. By comparison,  's (  ) is at 13X and Microsoft trades at a multiple of 17X. What's more, IBM sports a dividend yield of 4.3%.But there is more than just a cheap stock here. IBM has key advantages that should help it be a winner in the move towards cognitive computing - including a trusted global brand, a massive infrastructure and armies of talented engineers and scientists.Granted, it will probably take more time for the efforts to really move the needle.Yet the good news is that IBM is making the right moves to get things back on track.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["erman business software provider  collaborated with digital identity and access solutions provider Certified Security Solutions (\"CSS\") Inc., in order to deliver a secure and scalable cloud-based solution to customers.The technology sharing agreement entails the integration of SAP HANA Cloud Platform for the Internet of Things (IoT) with CSS' large-scale public key infrastructure-based certificate management security solution.CSS' solution, in essence, generates and manages digital identities for device authentication, secure communication and data encryption.

They provide psychiatric and chemical dependency services, including inpatient psychiatric hospitals, residential treatment centers, outpatient clinics and therapeutic school-based programs.On January 4, Acadia announced a $2.2 billion deal to buy the Priory Group, the UK's largest behavioral care provider managing over 300 facilities with 7,200 beds. Priory is known for being the addiction treatment and rehab locale for Britain's famous and wealthy.Acadia already owned the second-largest behavioral health group in the UK when they purchased Partners in Care (PiC) in 2014. Priory's 7,200 beds and PiC's 2,000 beds will have a combined market share of 30% in the UK mental health provider market.To help finance the purchase of Priory, Acadia issued 10 million new shares of stock in a public offering at the price of $61. The Priory purchase price will consist of $1.9 billion in cash and $335 million of the newly issued equity, or 5.4 million shares. The companies expect to close this transaction by February 16, 2016.So far, the share offering, which was priced on January 6, appears to be well-accepted by large investors as the stock has traded between $61 and $65 on strong volume since the pricing. This indicates willing demand by existing large shareholders and new investors.It's also worth noting that the UK has much lower corporate tax rates: 20% in 2016, 19% in 2017 and there is a proposal to reduce that further to 18% by 2020.Acadia is on a stated mission to double their 2015 revenues of nearly $2 billion by 2018. Obviously, M&A is a key part of that strategy. But the company is also focused on organic growth and making their facilities a unique part of each community where families and individuals can seek healing from mental health or substance abuse issues.If you go on the Acadia homepage, you'll see a nation-wide virtual tour of dozens of small, beautiful, one-of-a-kind care facilities tailored to the needs of each community. This focus on being a leading behavioral care provider in the US and the UK has created a consistent path of earnings growth. :The energy markets are getting trounced lately, and it isn't just oil that is getting hurt, gas, and methanol have been stumbling as well. Prices for oil, gas, and methanol have been tumbling as the markets have been oversupplied for the past several months. This oversupply has been felt in North America, Europe, and China which has put a big squeeze on these producers of energy. Due to the oversupply, falling prices, and sluggish demand Methanex Corp (  ), is the Zacks Bear of the Day.This Zacks Rank #5 (strong Sell) company is a Vancouver based company engaged in the worldwide production and marketing of methanol. Methanol, made from natural gas, is a basic chemical building block used to manufacture products such as formaldehyde, MTBE, acetic acid and others. The Company operates production facilities in Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Chile. The Company also markets additional methanol from plants in the US, Trinidad and Europe.In their most recent quarter, the company saw 0% year over year earnings growth while revenues fell -27.8%. According to John Floren, President and CEO of Methanex, \"Our third quarter Adjusted net income reflects lower average realized methanol pricing compared to the second quarter of 2015. Prices decreased as the affordability for methanol into certain energy applications moved lower relative to the second quarter, in alignment with lower oil and related product prices.\"The fourth quarter earnings season is just around the corner. Despite a turbulent stock market in 2015, courtesy sliding crude prices, Greek debt drama, the slowdown in the Chinese equity markets and geopolitical tensions emanating from Syria, Yemen and Ukraine, the tech sector remained relatively unscathed.In the last reported earnings season, the tech sector performed well, with total earnings for the sector (based on 94.9% of the tech stocks by market cap in the S&P 500) up 6.7% on 4.3% revenue growth. As many as 71.4% companies in the sector beat earnings per share (EPS) estimates while 57.1% posted better-than-expected revenues.For the full year, the S&P North American Technology Sector Index grew 8.5% in the year in contrast to the S&P 500 that closed in the red, down 0.7%. Software stocks once again led the tech sector rally with S&P North American Technology Software Index up 11.7% in 2015.Software means a set of commands given to a computer to carry out a definite task. It is intangible unlike computer hardware.As technology continues its rapid invasion into every corner of human existence, the need for better software has skyrocketed. The past year witnessed strong advancements in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, breakthroughs in chip shrinking technology, self-driving cars, personal assistants, high-speed Internet and home automation. All these developments have set the stage for a stronger software industry.As per Fortune, Forrester Research has estimated software spending to increase 5.7% to a staggering $600 billion in 2016, driven mostly by cloud applications, analytics and mobile. This is way above the projected growth rate of 3.8% for overall tech industry spending, which is likely to touch $2.9 trillion in 2016. The report also pointed out that spending on SaaS will be $108 billion this year, up 24% on a year over year basis.As software promises a bright future, we believe adding some of these stocks to investment portfolio will make 2016 a profitable one for investors.By using the Zacks proprietary methodology, investors may select stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - and a positive  , which have a fairly high chance of performing well in the near term.

Financial regulation and tepid global growth trends since the credit crisis have made it difficult for banks, insurers and those that process financial transactions to boost profits consistently. Source: A burgeoning area within finance is looking to combine the best of financial products and services with technology. The combo has been dubbed financial technology, or fintech for short. These firms are hungry for customers, small, and looking to grow rapidly.Encouragingly, fintech opportunities are growing at an astounding rate. A  of the space highlights payment and transfer, lending and financing, banking, and financial management as key areas where online can beat traditional lending models.Here are five key players in fintech that could help investors in the finance space boost their anemic returns.Lending Club bills itself as the of matching borrowers with investors, or those willing to lend\nmoney to the borrowers. Because it doesn't have any physical\nbranches, it pitches that technology helps keep borrowing rates low\nand is more efficient since borrowers and lenders can find each\nother online, combining one of the best benefits of the internet -\nsocial connections. If there is a bellwether in the burgeoning fintech field,  (  ) is arguably it. Recent developments at the firm also speak to just how many of these new business models there are.Lending Club bills itself as the  of matching borrowers with investors, or those willing to lend money to the borrowers. Because it doesn't have any physical branches, it pitches that technology helps keep borrowing rates low and is more efficient since borrowers and lenders can find each other online, combining one of the best benefits of the internet - social connections.Due to individual state regulations for banks, Lending Club is  how it charges fees and makes money. In a nutshell, it is looking to more closely tie the fees it earns to how a loan performs over time.That makes sense, and earnings estimates for this year have been bumped up a couple of pennies to $0.27. Next year, analysts project a 63% jump to $0.44 per share. The stock is down from a 52-week high of $21.15 to a recent close of $9.01 and the forward earnings multiple is a pretty reasonable 21x (well, reasonable for fintech), especially considering rapid expected revenue growth of more than 70% this year. (  ) is another online lender but it focuses more on smaller businesses. It is a baby by financial company standards, having been incorporated in 2006. But revenues are growing rapidly and expected to jump around 30% in each of the next two years to more than $426 million in 2017, a huge increase from the $25 million reported in 2012.According to On Deck, it has originated over $2 billion in loans and processed more than 5 billion customer payments since its operations go going in 2007.If offers term loans and lines of credit to small businesses in the U.S. and Canada.  is that its loan processing and approval process is streamlined due to its technology and the fact it operates only online.Profits should be minimal at six cents per share, but are expected to jump significantly to $0.37 per share in 2017. The company has been generating positive cash flow for a number of years now, which speaks to how scalable and profitable online financial business models can be. While researching  , an online pioneer in consumer-to-consumer international money transfer, I realized it was acquired by  (  ) - a company that, though it is well past its startup page, qualifies as a financial technology firm.Consumers and businesses know PayPal as the preeminent provider of online financial transactions. Only paying by credit card (which can still be done via PayPal) is more common online.PayPal  back out of  (  ) last year and again provides investors one of the safer ways to profit from the growing online payment industry. Company revenues should grow about 15% in each of the next couple of years and reach more than $12 billion by 2017.Profits are growing at a decent clip (though not as fast as the above two fintech firms) and are projected to reach $1.76, also in 2017. (  ) focuses primarily on helping firms efficiently manage human resource functions online, but also qualifies in the fintech space by helping HR departments run their payrolls and related financial functions.The firm is small and was founded just in 2005, but is growing rapidly (the common theme for the most successful fintech players). Revenues are running at over a billion annually right now but are expected to reach $2 billion by 2017, when profits should jump to 28 cents per share.At a recent $70-plus-per-share stock price, the company's forward earnings valuation is lofty (259x based off 2017 estimates). But its growth since inception has been impressive, and investors appear to be banking on the fact the founders did this once before, helping  compete with HR giants such as  (  ) and  (  ). The last company in this list is  (  ), which burst onto the fintech scene with its  mobile application last year. Apple Pay's success is somewhat of an unknown, but the service is accepted at many large retailers and can dominate as part of the Apple ecosystem.Apple's mobile devices, along with  's (  ,  ) Android-based phones, are important beachheads for any fintech firm with mobile ambitions. From this standpoint, they are indirect plays on the growing online and mobile financial transactions space.This goes for any financial institution too. Credit companies including  (  ) and  (  ) are also likely to build large presences in fintech.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he fourth quarter earnings season is just around the corner. Despite a turbulent stock market in 2015, courtesy sliding crude prices, Greek debt drama, the slowdown in the Chinese equity markets and geopolitical tensions emanating from Syria, Yemen and Ukraine, the tech sector remained relatively unscathed.In the last reported earnings season, the tech sector performed well, with total earnings for the sector (based on 94.9% of the tech stocks by market cap in the S&P 500) up 6.7% on 4.3% revenue growth. As many as 71.4% companies in the sector beat earnings per share (EPS) estimates while 57.1% posted better-than-expected revenues.For the full year, the S&P North American Technology Sector Index grew 8.5% in the year in contrast to the S&P 500 that closed in the red, down 0.7%. Software stocks once again led the tech sector rally with S&P North American Technology Software Index up 11.7% in 2015.Software means a set of commands given to a computer to carry out a definite task. It is intangible unlike computer hardware.As technology continues its rapid invasion into every corner of human existence, the need for better software has skyrocketed. The past year witnessed strong advancements in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, breakthroughs in chip shrinking technology, self-driving cars, personal assistants, high-speed Internet and home automation. All these developments have set the stage for a stronger software industry.As per Fortune, Forrester Research has estimated software spending to increase 5.7% to a staggering $600 billion in 2016, driven mostly by cloud applications, analytics and mobile. This is way above the projected growth rate of 3.8% for overall tech industry spending, which is likely to touch $2.9 trillion in 2016. The report also pointed out that spending on SaaS will be $108 billion this year, up 24% on a year over year basis.As software promises a bright future, we believe adding some of these stocks to investment portfolio will make 2016 a profitable one for investors.By using the Zacks proprietary methodology, investors may select stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - and a positive  , which have a fairly high chance of performing well in the near term.

The preliminary results come ahead of SAP's scheduled earnings report on Jan 22.Revenue for the quarter rose 16% year over year to \u20ac6.35 billion ($6.95 billion), as both cloud and SAP's core license business displayed exceptional momentum. SAP's license sales in the fourth quarter rose 15% to \u20ac2.15 billion ($2.35 billion), while cloud subscriptions and support revenue grew a whopping 76% to \u20ac630 million ($690 million). Adjusted operating profit for the quarter rose 7% over the prior-year quarter to \u20ac2.28 billion ($2.5 billion).Revenues for full-year 2015 jumped 18% over the previous year to \u20ac20.81 billion ($23.1 billion). SAP also reported record annual operating profits of \u20ac6.35 billion ($7.1 billion), up 13% over 2014.In addition to renewals from existing customers of higher-margin, licensed software and faster-growing Internet-based software, SAP's results also benefited from a relatively weaker euro.SAP's flagship product - a revamped version of its core business-management software, called S/4 Hana, was a big driver of the company's creditable performance this quarter. S/4 Hana can run in customers' data centers or as an online service, thus retaining thousands of corporate customers with the company in the midst of an industry-wide shift to cloud computing.We feel that SAP has charted a very comprehensible road map with S/4 Hana, which has breathed fresh life into sapped customer interest. SAP revealed that over 2,700 customers are running the new suite now, which is more than double the number at the end of the third quarter.For 2016, SAP expects operating profit to lie in the range of \u20ac6.4 billion to \u20ac6.7 billion, compared with \u20ac6.35 billion last year. Last year, SAP outlined its revenue expectations of \u20ac26 billion and \u20ac28 billion for 2020 with cloud and support revenues between \u20ac7.5 billion and \u20ac8 billion, which might have seemed a bit optimistic at that time. However, in light of its recent performance, the numbers are starting to look quite conservative now.SAP dominates the $30 billion enterprise resource planning software market, with its fellow competitors being Oracle Corp.  and Workday, Inc.  . It also competes with salesforce.com, inc.  in the $26.9 billion market for customer management software.SAP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Workday Inc shares are currently trading off about 5.8% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of WDAY shares, versus its 200 day moving average:    Looking at the chart above, WDAY's low point in its 52 week range is $65.33 per share, with $95.17 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $78.98.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, WDAY makes up 1.79% of the iShares North American Tech-Software ETF (Symbol: IGV) which is trading lower by about 1.7% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors considering a purchase of Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $49.55/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $27.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.60. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 9.4% return against the $27.50 commitment, or a 4.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to WDAY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $27.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Workday Inc sees its shares fall 44.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $24.90 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.60 from $27.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.9% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, and highlighting in green where the $27.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $27.50 strike for the 4.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Workday Inc (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $49.55) to be 40%.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 795 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the WDAY options chain for the new January 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $13.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $75.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $62.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of WDAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $79.86/share today.Because the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

It also offers tools to help clients manage ObamaCare plans. Most of its business comes from small and midsize firms.Paycom's HCM software features a suite of applications that range from employment applicant tracking and background checks to time and labor management, payroll and tax management, performance management and employee learning and training.There's plenty of competition in this field. Besides big players likeADP (  ),Paychex (  ) and privately held Ceridian, other companies that offer HCM tools include smaller (for now) outfits such asUltimate Software Group (  ),Workday (  ),Cornerstone On Demand (CSOD) andPaylocity Holding (PCTY).Even software companies that don't specialize in payroll or HR are moving into the HCM space.\"Salesforce.com (CRM) is continuing to build out its product offering, andSAP (SAP) has exposure to the human capital management side of things,\" Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom told IBD. (Salesforce is scheduled to disclose its second-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.)With only $151 million in sales last year, Paycom is dwarfed by multi-billion-dollar companies such as ADP. But it's still carving out market share thanks to the strength of its technology, analysts say.\"Paycom is chipping away at the fringe of the traditional payroll processing market,\" Wahlstrom said. \"Certainly the Software-as-a-Service model is something that a lot of newer companies are looking for. A lot of new customers are spending incrementally with Paycom that would not be spending with ADP or Ceridian because a lot of the functionality does not exist on those platforms.\"On a Q2 conference call with analysts earlier this month, Paycom CEO Chad Richison said his company is \"relentlessly focused on software development.\"In addition to rolling out new applications, he said, Paycom also continues \"to deepen the functionality within each of our existing offerings. As a result, we once again more than doubled our research and development expenditures\" during the second quarter by growing them 103% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis.It's hard to argue with Paycom's results. It went public just last year, but has a yearslong streak of 33%-or-better revenue growth.After the close on Aug. 4, Paycom reported Q2 revenue of $49 million, up 47% from the prior year and above consensus analyst estimates for $45.8 million.Recurring revenue climbed 46% and made up 97.6% of the total. Annualized new recurring revenue gained 43% to $16.5 million. The company also raised its full-year sales outlook.Second-quarter earnings more than tripled from a year earlier to 10 cents a share -- topping views by 4 cents -- while adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $13.1 million. GAAP net income hit $5.9 million vs. $593,000 lost a year earlier.The day after reporting earnings, Paycom's stock price shot up 18% to 37.85. Shares set a record high of 41.36 this past Monday.The company's Q2 results were helped by a rising volume of larger deals, JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy noted in a report.\"Management also highlighted good initial traction for two new products released in the quarter and reported encouraging deal wins with its Learning module, which was launched last quarter,\" Murphy said. \"The continued strong results solidify our belief that Paycom is in a position to capture market share and increase long-term shareholder value.\"The market share gains will be partly driven by the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare, which has added another layer of complexity to health benefits processing. Paycom's cloud-based products help clients manage changes under the ACA.In December, the company rolled out a new dashboard for its ACA software that lets customers more easily navigate. During the second quarter it added an enhanced ACA compliance offering with greater functionality for clients, CEO Richison said on the conference call.Based on feedback from monthly ACA webinars, he said, businesses \"are more concerned than ever by the employer mandate reporting requirements. With this in mind, we set out to aid eight businesses in their pursuit to better monitor, report and evaluate the organizational needs in order to comply with this significant piece of health-care reform.\"Paycom is an IBD 50 stock with a 98 Composite Rating.

At 12:20 Wednesday afternoon, the stock was down nearly 12%. Workday is a stock with a valuation mostly supported by extreme optimism. The stock traded at around 22 times sales before the earnings report, and at that level, the company needs to consistently exceed expectations in order to keep its stock price afloat.Workday is still growing quickly. The company reported revenue of $251 million during the first quarter, up 57.1% year-over-year, about $6 million higher than analyst estimates. It reported a non-GAAP loss of $0.02 per share, six cents better than what analysts were expecting, while on a GAAP basis the company lost $0.33 per share.Workday's guidance for the second quarter was in-line with analyst estimates. That's something that normally shouldn't be an issue, but since Workday has consistently exceeded analyst estimates in the past, the stock sold off in response. Volatility is nothing new for Workday, and with its stock still trading around 20 times sales, any sign at all that growth is slowing will likely send it tumbling. That's exactly what happened today, and this probably won't be the last time it happens.With an extremely lofty valuation, Workday remains a very risky stock. Investors betting that the company can continue to grow rapidly for years to come are paying a high price to do so, and I'm happy to avoid the stock altogether.

(Symbol: DRI), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY), the market cap is now $9.15B, versus Darden Restaurants, Inc. (Symbol: DRI) at $9.13B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of WDAY vs. DRI:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, WDAY is up about 0.3%, while DRI is down about 0.5% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors considering a purchase of Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $87.00/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $55 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 7.8% return against the $55 commitment, or a 4.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to WDAY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $55 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Workday Inc sees its shares decline 36.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $50.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.30 from $55), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.5% annualized rate of return. Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Workday Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55 strike is located relative to that history:  The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $55 strike for the 4.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Workday Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $87.00) to be 37%.

Down as much as 10% during morning trading, the stock had recovered some of its losses by 3 p.m., down about 6% on the day. The fact that the stock sank even as the company met analyst expectations is an indication that expectations from investors were high. Workday reported revenue of $226.3 million for the fourth quarter, up 59% year over year, and a few million dollars higher than the average analyst estimate. The company reported a non-GAAP net loss of $0.06 per share, in-line with analyst expectations. On a GAAP basis, Workday's net loss for the quarter was $0.32 per share.Workday guided for first-quarter revenue between $242 million and $245 million, above the analyst consensus of $239.5 million. Guidance for the full year also came in above expectations, with the company projecting 42%-45% revenue growth in fiscal 2016. To say that Workday's valuation is generous would be an understatement. The stock trades at a staggering 21 times sales, even after the stock declined today. On a GAAP basis, Workday recorded an operating loss of $216 million for the full year, a whopping 27% of revenue. Even with the company's operating cash flow benefiting from the heavy use of stock-based compensation and a big increase in unearned revenue, free cash flow was still negative for the year.Given the valuation, it's not surprising that the market reacted negatively to Workday's results. Most fast-growing software companies like Workday at least manage to report positive non-GAAP earnings, usually thanks to adding back stock-based compensation, but Workday is unprofitable even on a non-GAAP basis. It seems as though the stock's valuation has completely detached from the fundamentals of the business.

Initially, the position was more of a relative value hedge for a Twitter (  ) short, but over time we warmed to deep out of favor treatment the stock was receiving in the social media and broader tech space. That discount quickly disappeared, and left us wondering what was the incentive to remain long the stock. We sold our shares at the start of the year and sat back and watched with great displeasure as the stock climbed another 30%. Those gains were vaporized last night as LinkedIn's issues readily presented themselves. Our view is that LinkedIn needs to start rapidly moving away from its early social network identity, and begin a full transformation into a Talent Management and Recruiting SAAS. We believe the most opportunistic way for them to do this would be by acquiring Cornerstone OnDemand here.This may seem like an obvious statement, but the reality is that these two platforms are still struggling to completely break away from their early social network roots. Twitter, at least as we see it, has a future that is going to look a lot more like a Bloomberg terminal than a display advertising business. Public relations, celebrity, news, and financials are all verticals in which they should ultimately be offering high value premium subscription services. LinkedIn is in a sense a step ahead of Twitter on this front as it has managed to leverage its extensive professional network to sell a subscription service targeting the HR recruitment space, but we see that strategy starting to stagnate.Michael Lewis's book \"Flash Boys\" has a rather interesting section on how RBC's John Schwall (former global head of equities product management) was able to figure out that Credit Suisse was running a HFT Dark Pool. In a nut shell, he figured it all out by scouring LinkedIn profiles that generally tend to reveal a lot more about an employer's business than they would like. Schwall's LinkedIn expedition allowed him to reconstruct the entire Credit Suisse Dark Pool Organization chart from publicly available information. Pretty impressive work, but not exactly shocking news. Last year we were able to map out the entire customer base and addressable market in life sciences CRM by mining public LinkedIn profiles. By the time we were done we knew exactly what CRM system each top 50 pharma was using, how many reps they had, geographic splits, and deployment schedules which could be used to ascertain revenue impact at certain public companies (whether 15,000 thousand seats will be implemented in 2014 or 2015 is valuable information to be able to pluck from the web). We also have used LinkedIn to collect or gain insight for several other market related investments over the years. Job listings, new hire bios, and consultant project descriptions all can help from things as basic as timing new communication equipment roll out to figuring out new competitive threats in a space.Yet, all this valuable information is free, and LinkedIn has not optimized its own search product to take advantage of this data, almost everything we do in terms of search on LinkedIn is driven by Google's (  ) (  ) search engine.We have a hard time reconciling the way we use LinkedIn with the way the site communicates with us. Do we really want birthday notifications from people in our professional network? Who congratulates anyone on a \"work anniversary\", we surely have never seen someone celebrate this in the non-digital world. Should we receive a \"Congratulate X on their new job\" message every time someone tweaks their profile or title? The answer to that question is no, and hence the need to turn off notifications. The thing is we are actually quite interested in knowing when someone has actually changed jobs. That is valuable and highly relevant information. The fact that Linkedin hasn't figured out how to capitalize on the potential engagement issue by now is somewhat concerning. We could go on and on with respect to the increased level of spamesque activity from a platform that has no need to be diluting their brand equity in such a way, but that is not the point of this piece.We strongly believe LinkedIn has an immense opportunity in the human capital big data space, but as things presently stand we have a hard time seeing how that they end up being the big winner there.Consider what Workday (  ) is doing in this space...Retention risk analytics can be used by HR departments to determine which employees are likely to leave in the next year. This insight can be used to anticipate and consequently avoid losing top performers and HIPOs which is at the core of HR at any organization. Workday has also been mining professional profiles to find optimal matches for job openings, and thus improve recruiting functions. Now LinkedIn is obviously positioned to provide similar functionality with respect to public profiles (the recent Newsle acquisition speaks to these ambitions), but by not being an enterprise talent management solution provider they are at a clear disadvantage. LinkedIn's public data can easily be mined by any SAAS vendor focusing with a robust talent management suite, while they remain outside the wall of the enterprise systems. In the short run, this is not the biggest deal, but in the long run it could prove to be quite disadvantageous. While there is some appeal to LinkedIn moving into HRIS and Payroll, the market is awfully crowded and we have a hard time seeing the long-term value add to its core model. This is definitely not the case in Talent Management software. Recruiting, succession planning, applicant tracking, learning management, performance management, and onboarding are all areas in which LinkedIn could significantly add value down the road by innovating and more tightly integrating with its core business. For example, imagine how difficult competing with a Talent Management SAAS player would be if it had LinkedIn's search algorithms and member data optimized into its recruiting and succession planning modules. Over time imagine how much more useful LinkedIn's current data set would become when paired with insights attained from servicing large enterprises.Cornerstone (  ) is arguably the best talent management focused SAAS vendor in the market, and they also happen to still be independent. While they are mostly known for their strong extended enterprise LMS offering, they offer all the relevant talent management modules. They also are one of the few, if not only, organically built talent management vendors around. This has always made them an expensive target as a niche player which is probably why they are still independent. With Oracle, SAP, and IBM all making notable acquisitions in this space over the past few years; the consensus view has been Cornerstone OnDemand prefers to remain independent. This last man standing element in talent management has worked out well for them over the past couple years as they have been able to grow at their competitors' expense, and maintain close relationships with the non-fully integrated HRIS/Payroll players like Workday and ADP. There is no reason to BELIEVE that strategy won't continue to work as Cornerstone's aggressive expansion strategy and high customer satisfaction continues to fuel 30% top line growth, but the problem is the market doesn't seem to presently agree with this thesis. That is the opportunity we think LinkedIn should immediately seek to exploit.Even before the Q3 2014 collapse in the stock, CSOD stood out as a notable underperformer in a generally stable SAAS valuation environment. This had been going on for the better part of the previous month and half, and has continued throughout this year. This obviously jumped out at us as we keep a close eye on the space. While a certain degree of underperformance is expected when a high growth stock has a hiccup or two, Cornerstone's recent SAAS valuation discount is confounding. Its current forward ev/sales multiple of 4.2x is more in line with, and in some cases even at a discount to, on-premise software vendors.We could get into a lot more detail regarding CSOD and why it now makes for an interesting standalone long idea, but for now we will stick to summary bullet points as tossing the idea out there with respect to the strategic transformational value it offers LinkedIn is our focus in this piece.1) Our research indicates nothing has changed with respect to CSOD's competitive position or their business model that warrants them trading at a 55% discount to their SAAS peers let alone at an on-premise multiple.2) We believe CSOD presents a unique and potentially transformational acquisition opportunity for the cash rich and arguably growth challenged LinkedIn.3) CSOD remains a potential target for more conventional HR players like ADP and Workday. All that has changed is the higher likelihood of getting a deal done with a significant premium (we estimate a 75-100% premium based on recent comparables).4) Management which has arguably been quite reluctant to sell has been recently humbled, and will have a much harder time justifying a vote to reject a decent premium offer especially from the current depressed relative valuation.We will most likely be taking advantage of the recent sell-off in LinkedIn shares to reestablish a longer-term position, however, we remain cautious on the strategic direction being taken by management. The Lynda acquisition is interesting, but we would much rather have seen them pull the trigger on CSOD first. Because we see large risks in LinkedIn's model going forward, particularly as the SAAS vendors in HR get more sophisticated, we don't plan to be too aggressive here.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoA new wrinkle in federal rules this year aims to urge more hospitals and other medical providers into the 21st century.Those expectations have helped lift a handful of companies in IBD's Computer Software-Medical group, a group at the intersection of health care and Internet technology -- and key suppliers to the health industry's conversion from paper to digital electronic records.Cerner (  ),Athenahealth (  ) andVeeva Systems (  ) are at the head of that list. All three have seen benefits from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus bill. All have also seen their share of recent ups and downs.The initial bill set aside $19 billion to help health care providers convert their patient records systems from paper to digital, or electronic health records. As of Dec. 1, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported the program had paid more than $25.7 billion to participants, including hospitals, doctors and insurance companies, meeting \"meaningful use\" requirements.Beginning this year, the government will ratchet up the pressure by trimming reimbursements to medical providers not yet converted to EHR systems, or converts that are falling short of the meaningful-use benchmarks set out by the stimulus bill.Nearly 80% of physicians and hospitals are already using EHRs or plan to start soon, according to data from the federal government and industry research groups. That's up from the paltry 17% of doctors and 9% of hospitals equipped with EHRs in 2008, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.An increasing number of new conversions are using software-as-a-service (SaaS) type implementations, driving a growing portion of the health industry to cloud-based products.As a result, the global cloud computing market segment within the health care industry is expected to reach $6.7 billion in 2018, rising from $1.8 billion in 2011, according to research firm Transparency Market Research.It's a major industry shift that suggests fertile ground is still ahead.\"Health care is littered with decades-old technology,\" Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Wieland told IBD. \"There's a significant replacement cycle to come.\"Companies that provide EHR services are generally alike in that they digitize the medical world. All are also making acquisitions to expand their technological capabilities and client base. But that's largely where the similarities end.The largest, measured by market capitalization and revenue, is Cerner. Founded in 1979, it got its start selling medical lab software to hospitals. Today, the Missouri business supplies its clinical and revenue management software to 14,000 large health organizations worldwide, including 3,000 major hospitals and 4,900 large physician groups.No. 2 Athenahealth is known as a leader in cloud services. It provides Web-based billing and EHR functions to 59,000 health care providers, mainly doctor's practices. This month, the Massachusetts-based company expanded into the hospital inpatient segment with the purchase of RazorInsights, a cloud-based EHR and billing system for hospitals.Third in line is Veeva Systems, a California-based newcomer that went public in October 2013. It sells its cloud-based software programs to pharmaceutical companies and biotech organizations. Veeva says it now serves 59,000 providers in the biotech and life sciences industries.While each firm is focused on health care, all three companies also belong to the broader cloud computing industry segment, right along with firms including leading customer relationship management software businessesSalesforce (  ) and employee services providerWorkday (  ).With investors excited about the potential of the cloud/SaaS sector, IBD's Computer Software Medical group rallied for five years to a high in early March of 2014. The SaaS group then turned -- along with a broad swathe of the software sector. Athenahealth tumbled 53% from March to May. Veeva tanked 57%. Cerner was hurt least, dropping 23%.Analysts attributed the sell-off to worries about the end of a federal stimulus program and investor overexuberance about cloud firms.The sell-off in cloud stocks followed Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's March 19 comments that year indicating that the central bank's stimulus program could end as early as last fall, Stifel analyst Tom Roderick told IBD. \"It started in late February and picked up steam as the Fed had some commentary about interest rates inevitably rising. That seemed to take a lot of risk appetite off the table from institutional investors,\" Roderick said.And investors had gotten absolutely giddy early last year about all things cloud. \"If you had cloud in your pitch book, your stock was going up, whether you were health care or non-health care related. The fundamentals were not driving the (stocks') move either up or down, it was just the buzz around the cloud,\" added Piper Jaffray's Wieland. \"It was momentum buying, then it hit a peak, and then it was momentum selling.\"Solid fundamentals revived the stocks, analysts said.\"Throughout that whole time, Athenahealth was reporting 30% growth in its core business and Cerner was reporting beat-and-raise quarters,\" said Wieland. \"Everything was thrown out in the sell-off, but Cerner and Athenahealth had fundamentals that were good, so people started to gravitate (back) towards those names.\"As for Veeva, Roderick said: \"Their Q2 results were extraordinary, you could see it in the growth margins and the cash flows. They put up fantastic results, but the market didn't have a lot of patience for stocks that were high multiples at that time.\"Challenges for all the companies remain.While the federal stimulus funding was the initial catalyst for EHR installation and growth, companies must now prove \"meaningful use\" in order to get full payment for delivering medical care.For example, Wieland gave the theoretical case of a physician using Athenahealth who gets paid an incentive fee for each of their patients who gets a flu shot, but some of those patients get flu shots at a chain drugstore rather than at the doctor's office. Putting IT systems in place to collect and analyze that kind of \"population health management\" data is the next level of investment that is driving today's electronic health technology spending, Wieland said.Cerner, already the largest player in the group, will nearly double in size after it completes its $1.3 billion acquisition of the Germany-based Siemens health IT business unit, which it announced in August. The deal is expected to close Feb. 2.The single biggest challenge post-merger \"is not doing any harm\" to Cerner's core operations as it digests the $4.5 billion Siemens unit and its far-flung network of clients, products, workers and research initiatives, FBR Capital Markets analyst Steven Halper told IBD. \"You don't want to take resources away from Cerner and move them over to Siemens, because that will erode the deliverables from Cerner,\" Halper said. A second feat will be to hold onto Siemens' existing customer base as well as to sell those clients additional health care IT products, Halper said.Cerner is also vying for a major contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to replace and standardize its EHR systems, which now support nearly 10 million active duty service members, retirees and dependents.Another applicant for the military's $11 billion EHR contract is PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has teamed withGoogle (GOOGL) and others in its bid.Athenahealth's Jan. 14 announcement that it would acquire RazorInsights moved the company into providing cloud-based electronic health record services to small and rural hospitals, expanding their traditional focus on physicians' practices.\"That marketplace (small, rural hospitals) is not as easy as you might think, because they are not very sophisticated buyers of IT, and because their existing vendors are pretty sticky,\" said Halper.Veeva Systems is dependent on Salesforce.com's cloud-based Force.com suite of tools. But Salesforce.com does not compete in the drug manufacturing segment where Veeva thrives. Veeva's cloud-based CRM tools for the life sciences industry now provide 85% of the company's revenue, according to a November report by J.P. Morgan analyst Sterling Auty.Veeva has, Auty said, been snatching market share from Siebel's customer relationship management system - which is owned byOracle (ORCL) -- and from Cegedim, a global technology and services company specializing in health care that's owned byIMS Health (IMS).Analysts are pinning great expectations on Veeva's three-year-old cloud-based document management system, called Vault. That offering simplifies the production and sharing of regulated materials, both internally and with external partners. The system now has 230 customers, including 33 of the 50 largest global pharmaceutical firms, according to Auty.The Vault system \"is at an inflection point now, where they are starting to land multimillion-dollar deals with large pharma firms,\" said Roderick, the Stifel analyst. \"The document management story ... is ripe for disruption in the same way that customer relationship management was 8 to 10 years ago.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he following companies are expected to report earnings after hours on 02/25/2015.

With this in mind, we asked three of our top contributors to share with us their most promising investment alternatives in disruptive growth stocks for the new year --  ,  , and  . The TV industry is changing radically with the growing popularity of online video streaming. Netflix is the major driving force behind this change and arguably the biggest beneficiary from the streaming revolution. From the company's Long Term View:The company has more than 53 million global members as of the the third quarter, and it added 3 million subscribers during that period. These substantial figures clearly indicate that Netflix is beyond the inflection point when it comes to consumer demand and serve as proof that it offers an attractive option to consumers.Source: NetflixNot only is Netflix growing at a remarkable speed, the company is also increasing profitability. Contribution margin in the U.S. was 28.6% during the last quarter, a big increase versus 23.7% in the third quarter of 2013. Management plans to achieve a contribution margin of 30% in the U.S. next year, and it intends to increase margins by 200 basis points per year after that. Also, international markets launched more than a year ago are already profitable on a contribution basis, so Netflix is producing rising profitability both at home and abroad.The TV business is changing, and Netflix is leading the charge while delivering exciting growth and profitability for investors. I like to invest in companies that lead the world forward. LinkedIn, with its mission to \"create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce,\" certainly fits that description. With a user base of more than 300 million members in more than 200 countries and territories, LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network.This network connects people around the world with career opportunities, while also uniting thousands of employers with the talent they need to run their organizations -- a  . And thanks to the powerful network effects that such a model enjoys -- LinkedIn stands to grow significantly in the years ahead.Source: LinkedInBeyond its impressive user base, it is important to note how LinkedIn is disrupting the entire professional recruiting industry. As my colleague Tim Beyers explains:Matched with such a large network, this treasure trove of data is allowing LinkedIn to fundamentally change the way professionals and employers connect with each other, recruit talent, and more. As the company nurtures these relationships around the world, I believe it will also create substantial profit opportunities for long-term investors. Most people view Workday as just another software company, one that provides its services through the cloud. But in reality, Workday is much more of an ecosystem, like iOS for  , that focuses on human resources management (HRM) -- a massive market that Pacific Crest figures will grow from $50 billion in 2013 to $70 billion by 2015.What makes Workday a disruptive force is the manner in which it has expanded to become a one-stop shop for all of the HR-related needs of its enterprise clients. Back in Workday's infancy, the platform worked well for basic task such as storing employee information and managing payroll. It has since evolved to utilize the data to help clients review applications, evaluate talent, hire more effectively, and offer competitive pay.Source: WorkdayNow, businesses of any size can hire Workday and then access its cloud platform for all HR funcitons. This effectively eliminates the need for any older software that a client might have used for payroll, employee information, recruitment, and training. In many cases, a company can reduce the complexity of using multiple services by replacing them all with a comprehensive solution from Workday.The result of this disruption? Workday attracted more than 600 customers by the end of last year leading to significant revenue growth. During Workday's last quarter it grew revenue 68% year-over-year to $215 million and reported an additional $510 million of future business that has yet to be reported as revenue.Besides the company's compelling services, top line growth, and large target market, Workday has shown the ability to continuously improve its software with attractive new services. The stock looks like a great long-term investment opportunity. Its $15.5 billion market capitalization may seem pricey right now, but if Workday can keep growing its HRM market share long-term, then the company has plenty of room to run. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

We'll also show you whether they know what they're talking about. To help, we've enlisted  , our supercomputer tool for rating stocks and analysts alike. With CAPS, we track the long-term performance of Wall Street's best and brightest -- and its worst and sorriest, too. When one of the best-known names in stockpicking picks not one -- but two -- of the best-known stocks in tech to outperform, we sit up and take notice. And so today, we cannot help but notice that the analysts at Cowen & Co. are singing the praises of struggling cloud computers  and  .It's a good thing somebody likes 'em. Fact is, over the past year, shares of both salesforce.com and Workday have struggled to hold investors' attention. Shares of salesforce.com are basically flat for the past year (actually down a fraction of a percent). Workday shares, meanwhile, are off by a good 8.5% even after receiving a boost from Cowen.So, why does Cowen like them? As reported on  Friday, Cowen likes salesforce.com as basically a market-share play, noting that if salesforce.com's mere \"0.3% share of the avg. enterprise's budget\" were to just double, this fact alone would drive \"sustained high-teens billings growth.\" Indeed, Cowen foresees 20% growth in billings in fiscal years 2016 and 2017.The future is even brighter for Workday (according to Cowen), where the analyst thinks \"broadening distribution & cloud friendly end-markets should help sustain current billings growth north of 40% through F2017.\" As a result, while Cowen sees salesforce.com shares hitting $73 within a year, it's even more optimistic about Workday, hanging a $99 price target on the shares.But is Cowen right about that? Maybe, maybe not. You see, we've been tracking Cowen & Co.'s performance here at Motley Fool CAPS for more than eight straight years now, and honestly, the best we can say about the analyst is that it's a so-so stockpicker in software stocks. Across 13 picks in eight-and-a-half years, Cowen's only gotten its calls right  -- and its losers are often bigger than its winners:\n  \nSource: In short, while it's true that Cowen ranks among the better analysts we track here on CAPS (in the top 10% of ranked players, in fact), this analyst owes most of its reputation to a string of successes in  . But software? Not so much.And I can't help thinking this might not be great news for investors in salesforce.com and Workday today. After all, objectively speaking, and despite the relative weakness in share price of these two stocks over the past year, neither one looks like a great bargain to me today. Both companies currently showing negative profits on  -- and have done so for the past four years. True, both companies are free-cash-flow positive despite their weak GAAP performance. But consider how the valuations stack up.Unprofitable salesforce.com boasts $723 million in trailing free cash flow. Most analysts who follow the stock see profits growing strongly over the next five years -- indeed, with 27% annualized growth projected, most other analysts seem even  optimistic about the stock than Cowen is. But even so, the stock sells for a market cap of $37.1 billion, resulting in a price-to-free cash flow ratio of more than 51. That's pretty expensive -- even if the analysts are right about the growth rate.Meanwhile, most analysts agree with Cowen that Workday will be a strong grower going forward. Indeed, the average expectation for profits growth at the company tips the scales at 50% annualized over the next five years (again, a faster pace than Cowen predicts). Growing off of a minuscule base of just $10.2 million in positive free cash flow over the past year, 50% growth doesn't seem unrealistic -- but neither does it justify the stock's truly immense market capitalization of more than $15 billion. Call me crazy, or just call me a pessimist. I can't help thinking that these stocks' already too-high stock  are part of the reason that neither one has gained a penny's worth of share price over the past year. I don't expect that will change until the valuations come back down to earth, either -- and I don't expect a few kind words from Cowen to do much to change the math.Apple recently revealed the product of its secret-development \"dream team\" -- Apple Watch.

While the company's stock exploded out of the gate, and trades roughly 69% higher than its opening price, the last year has seen big pricing swings balance out to a decrease in value. Shares have fallen roughly 6.4% over the last 12 months, compared to roughly 11.2% growth for the S&P 500. data by Since the Nov. 24 release of the company's third-quarter earnings report, shares have fallen 11%, due mostly to projections for slowing growth, and now trade in the range that has shown the most stickiness over the past year. Is Workday stock an attractive investment option at current prices? Let's take a look. Workday's share price dipped significantly upon the release of its last earnings report, and has yet to fully recover, but the company's third-quarter business wasn't the driving force behind the contraction. The quarterly results were actually better than expected, but they arrived in conjunction with projections that suggest that Workday's sales growth is beginning to slow substantially. The third quarter saw the software maker record 68.2% revenue growth, but it only expects between 54% and 56% year-over-year sales growth in the current quarterly period, and the company has projected that yearly growth for fiscal 2016 will be around 40%. Workday has averaged 76.36% year-over-year quarterly sales growth in its nine recorded quarters as a publicly traded company, and slowing growth is a concern for shareholders and prospective investors given that the company has yet to turn a profit and its stock currently trades at roughly 21.6 times trailing sales. projects that the total cloud ERP market will have undergone 17.6% compound annual growth from 2013 through 2018, which far exceeds the expected growth rate for on-premise solutions and ostensibly gives Workday a big opportunity. The software-as-a-service provider has been a driving force in the move to transition human resources applications to the cloud, and its rise has put pressure on larger purveyors of ERP software like  and  . Those two competitors offer a much wider array of business software applications, while Workday has been mostly focused on human resources and financial management products. For context, Workday has approximately 700 customers, while SAP lists 183,000 total customers, 13,000 human resources customers, and approximately 700 customers for its SuccessFactors cloud HR suite.With regard to cloud HR applications, customer satisfaction levels indicate that Workday offers high-quality solutions, and the company claims that its cloud offerings are several years ahead of those from Oracle and SAP, but the picture could change as its two larger competitors devote more resources to bolstering their cloud services. Oracle and SAP have benefited from gradual transitions from on-site to hybrid and full-on cloud applications, but cloud services look to be the growth drivers going forward. Workday's offerings are more integrated and unified than the broader applications ecosystems from Oracle and SAP, but this distinction has a lot to do with the larger companies offering a more diverse range of commercial processes, both on-premise and in the cloud. As Oracle and SAP ramp up their cloud businesses and build better integration, they should be able to offer more applications under their unified ecosystems, appealing to a general client preference for dealing with fewer vendors, allowing pricing advantages, and bolstering available data for analytics. I think there's a lot to like about Workday as a company. The SaaS provider is basically a first-mover in the cloud HR field, its services are highly regarded, and there's a growing brand backing up its products. The company's management is also populated with innovators and industry veterans. That said, I would recommend holding off on Workday's stock for the time being. The extent to which sales growth is expected to slow is a big concern for me, particularly as Oracle and SAP are increasing their efforts to build their respective cloud ecosystems and minimize Workday's gains.Workday needs to deliver consistent wins outside of its comfort zones, those being HR software and the North American market, and I expect it will encounter continued resistance on those fronts. For the nine months ending Oct. 31, 2014, less than 20% of Workday's total revenues have come from territories outside of the United States, and improving its overseas standing could require significant expenditures and weigh down its earnings. This is worrisome, as free cash flow has yet to see significant gains and net income has sagged since the company's IPO. With regards to apps, Workday's Financial Management suite is key to sales growth and expansion of the company's broader platform, but the product launched in 2007 and just hit 100 customers as of last September. Workday's stock could be a good play if you think the tides are turning, or will turn, on those fronts. Otherwise, it may not be worth the risk. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks. But if you want to make sure that 2015 is  best investing year ever, you need to know where to start.

Estimates called for $205 million in revenue, with the actual sales coming in at $215.1 million,putting revenues for the quarter up 68% year over year. Losses were also lower than anticipated, thanks to better-than-expected sales and margins. Even with solid results, shares have fallen since the release, largely because of projections of slowing sales growth.After the earnings release, CEO Aneel Bhusri, CFO Mark Peek, and Investor Relations officer Mike Haase participated in a conference call to shed some light on the period's results and what the future looks like. Here are five key  takeaways, with quotes courtesy of  .One of the most encouraging pieces of data to come out of the earnings release was the increase in revenue from subscriptions. Sales from this segment hit $164.4 million, representing roughly 76% of total quarterly revenues and 75% growth year over year. This is one of the most important metrics to watch for Workday investors, as it essentially establishes a new sales baseline thanks to high customer satisfaction levels.Recording several years at a 97% customer approval rating is a significant achievement for Workday, particularly as brand and perceived reliability are big assets in the enterprise software market, and as the company competes with more established companies like  and  .At the annual Workday Rising conference in early November, the company unveiled Insight Applications, a new product suite that will use big data, machine learning, and predictive analytics to provide management suggestions for expenses management, employee career paths, and other business scenarios. CEO Aneel Bhusri stated toward the beginning of the call that these applications could usher in a new era of business analytics and give Workday customers a significant competitive edge. Here's Bhusri on some of the potentials of the new engine and platform:Bhusri also clarified that Insight Applications was a distinct suite that would lead to incremental sales growth, rather than just a strengthening of its broader product ecosystem. While it wasn't specified in the call, the SYMAN engine that drives Insight Applications will be applied across other products, so general enhancements to Workday's platform will also arrive with rollout of the new suite.In order to deliver the growth needed to sustain and drive its share price, Workday needs to improve its presence in territories outside North America. Towards the beginning of the call, Bhusri pointed to the signing of U.K. companies like  and  as big wins for the company. He later indicated that the company views its position in the U.K., France, and the Netherlands as strong, and hinted at significant expansion and building momentum in Europe:Explaining the company's $2.9 million non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter, CFO Mark Peek stated that Workday is focused on driving growth in the short term in order to promote long-term profitability. This has been the company's standard, and reasonable, way of contextualizing losses; however, Peek indicated that the company could soon see quarters with positive non-GAAP operating margins, before returning the focus to growth:The CFO's comments on this matter may be taken as an encouraging sign on multiple fronts. With a -1.4% non-GAAP operating margin in its most recently completed quarter, the company sees the possibility for positive non-GAAP margins in the next fiscal year, particularly in the latter half of the term. Taken in conjunction with a reaffirmed preference for growing sales, this is somewhat comforting news, as the company's projected 40% growth for the next year is much lower than previous rates.In order to deliver the necessary product adoption and revenue growth, Workday will be increasing spending in key areas like sales and marketing. For a young company that has yet to record a profitable quarter, this could be a problem, but Mark Peek's balance sheet outline suggests there's not much to worry about on that front:Peek later added that the company's cash and marketable securities had increased $12 million from the previous quarter, and that the quarter's $13 million in free cash flows put trailing-12-month free cash flows at -$5 million. Solid cash reserves and some positive balance sheet momentum are reassuring as the company looks to devote between $100 million and $110 million to capital expenditures this fiscal year, and a capex increase looks probable next year. The balance sheet also supports potential acquisitions, which could be needed to drive growth in key areas. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks. But if you want to make sure that 2015 is  best investing year ever, you need to know where to start.

Prior to the announcement of the company's  earlier this week, the past month saw shares climb roughly 12.5% in conjunction with the addition of new companies to Workday's client list and interest in new human capital management applications. The release of the quarterly results then prompted a roughly 6% decline in the company's valuation. Taking a more long-term view, Workday's valuation has grown roughly 75% since its October 2012 IPO price -- a strong performance compared with roughly 45% growth for the S&P 500 over the same stretch.There's no denying that Workday has been on an impressive growth trajectory, but it's also worth considering some elements that could cause the company some trouble. The following three factors don't provide concrete evidence that Workday's stock will fall, but they could have significant impacts on valuation and are important points for investors to watch going forward.Thus far, the company has done an admirable job of building cloud-based enterprise resource planning, or ERP, software that integrates with its other offerings. This strength is helping to bridge customers from its premier product, Workday Human Capital Management, to Workday Recruiting and Workday Financial Management. Now, the company is in the process of developing new applications for managing the workplace, and it's pushing into some uncharted territory. Workday Insight Applications is slated for a 2015 launch and will be the company's push into workplace management through predictive analytics.The new app suite will supply businesses with predictive data and recommendations for management and will be used to map out employee performance analyses, suggestions for career paths, and more. There's a lot of potential in this new applications suite, but if Insight Applications isn't up to par, it could dent Workday's stock. Competing ERP software companies are also targeting predictive management solutions as a potential next big thing in the industry, and the launch of an inferior product could dampen the outlook for Workday's growth prospects.Even after the post-earnings sell-off, Workday's stock is currently priced at roughly 22.4 times trailing-12-month sales, and its stock price is heavily dependent on revenue growth relative to expectations. The company has done an impressive job of building sales over the past couple of years, but total expenditures have also risen because of acquisitions and other expansion costs.Revenue has increased roughly 196%, while total expenses have increased roughly 135%, and the company's price-to-sales ratio has grown roughly 186%. Costs are increasing at a slower rate than revenue, but the extent to which the company's stock price has increased relative to sales growth may indicate that the company is overvalued. It wouldn't take big earnings misses or downward target revisions to cause major depression in Workday's share price. As the most recent earnings release indicates, even strong growth might not meet expectations. Analysts expected $205 million in revenue for the quarter, with actual sales coming in at $215 million, and representing 68% growth year-over-year. Losses were also lower than expected and revenue from subscriptions was up 75% YOY, indicating that even solid earnings results could fail to meet investor targets and trigger declines in valuation, especially as there are indications that growth may soon slow down.Cloud-based ERP software generally allows businesses to worry less about maintenance and product replacement, but it can also make crucial information less secure. Cloud data breaches accounted for 20% of all breaches in the third quarter of 2014, according to SafeNet, and storage security looks to be an ongoing concern.If Workday were to be hit with a significant data breach, it could have a calamitous impact on the company's valuation. The software maker has some significant advantages against competitors  and  in terms of cloud-based offerings, but the fact that these companies still provide on-site solutions could work in their favor and against Workday in the event of a security breakdown. A breach wouldn't even necessarily have to occur on Workday's network to have a significant impact on its stock; other headline-grabbing hacks could occur and damage confidence about the security of the cloud, making it more difficult for the company to grow its customer base.Workday offers esteemed products in a sector that is expected to see significant growth over the next five years. Even so, it's up against formidable, resource-rich competition in Oracle and SAP, and Workday will need to deliver excellent performance to justify and grow its valuation. That's not to say that the company won't provide wins for shareholders or those who might take a bullish position at the current stock price, but investors would be wise to weigh some of the key factors that could contribute to falling valuation.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed.

The enterprise resource planning software company delivered results that were better than expectations, with the big stories from the earnings release coming in the form significant earnings and revenue beats. While results were better than consensus estimates, they may not have met the market's expectations, as the release triggered a roughly 5% decline in the company's share price in after-hours trading.Analysts estimated that Workday revenue for the quarter would come in at $205 million, and actual sales for the quarter came in at $215.1 million, representing a roughly 4.9% beat on expectations. This quarter's revenues were 68% higher than the corresponding quarter in 2013, This revenue growth comes in notably below the average revenue quarterly increase of 77% year-over-year that the company had seen over the previous eight quarters. For the final quarter of its fiscal year, Workday projects year-over-year growth between 54% and 56%, a range that might give investors pause at current stock prices.On the other hand, revenue from subscriptions was up 75% YOY, coming in at $164.4 million. Subscription revenue is a key metric to watch for Workday investors, as subscribers are substantially less likely to take their business elsewhere. Total revenue for the quarter ending in October arrived 15.1 % higher than revenue for the July ended quarter, when the company delivered $186.8 million in sales. Operating cash flow for Workday's third quarter was $41 million, with free cash flow at $13.3 million. This brings 12-month-trailing free cash flow to -$4.8 million.Workday's operating loss for the quarter was $51.5 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share were -$0.03, representing a 70% beat on analyst expectations of -$0.10 per share. Looking at GAAP figures tells a less remarkable story, however. Analysts expected a GAAP loss per share of $0.34, while actual losses were $0.33 per share, or roughly 3% better than expected. GAAP losses in the corresponding quarter of the last fiscal year were $0.23 a share.Workday has the benefit of operating in a growing market. Human capital management app sales hit roughly $10 billion in 2013 according to IDC, and are expected to grow at a 8.2% CAGR through 2018, reaching $15.4 billion in revenue.In order to continue to deliver growth in line with investor expectations, Workday needs to continue to secure new customers and grow subscription revenues. It's scored some significant wins on the customer addition front recently, with  signing on for Workday's Human Capital Management suite, and  signing on as a service partner. The addition of Rolls Royce to Workday's client base is significant as the cloud-based software-as-a-service provider aims to improve its standing in Europe and other overseas territories. With a market cap of roughly $16.1 billion, Rolls Royce represents a notable win in Workday's goal to move up market. Conversely, Huron Consulting has a relatively small market cap at $1.55 billion, but its role as a deployment partner has the potential to lead to bigger things, as it is connected to government, health care, and education segments that Workday aims to become increasingly prominent in. Going forward, adding large customers that also act as service partners looks to be one of the company's best avenues to rapid revenue growth.Workday is also tasked with delivering substantial growth in products outside of its main Human Capital Management suite. To that end, Workday Recruiting, an add-on application that can be used in conjunction with the chief HCM platform, has been seeing good uptake, according to the company. Workday is also counting on becoming a bigger player in the financial sector, and the extent to which Workday Financial Management finds ongoing success will likely play a significant role in the company's valuation.Workday's recently unveiled Insight Applications suite is another key product to watch going forward. Set for release in 2015, the platform will be Workday's first major foray into using big data and predictive analytics for human resource management. Rather than simply gathering and organizing relevant data, this new product will actually provide companies with suggestions for employee career paths, talent retention, use of funds, and other business scenarios.The key engine driving Insight Applications will also be incorporated into other Workday apps, potentially improving the draw of the company's ecosystem. This is a bold new direction for Workday, but it's not alone in the predictive data push, as it seems like other ERP companies are also looking to predictive management solutions as a potential next-big-thing in the field. If Workday's Insight Applications delivers, it could significantly improve the company's competitive prospects against more entrenched ERP providers like  and  . Of course, the opposite is also true, and Workday's outlook could be dented if its push into predictive management comes up short amid broader support for related technologies.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed.

Given  's leading business-to-business solutions presence, investors might think it's dominant in the cloud, but the company has struggled in several key segments. With that said, given Oracle's tendency to enter new markets through acquisitions, and its struggles in the cloud, there is one big-time acquisition investors shouldn't be surprised to see, one that would solidify Oracle in an enormous market. Oracle is an enormous company, one with over 400,000 customers, a company that reported $11.32 billion in revenue during its last quarter. Primarily, Oracle is a software company, as it accounted for 75% of its revenue during its most recent quarter.Within its software segment lies the cloud, specifically cloud app (  ), app platform (  ), and cloud infrastructure (  ) products. While these cloud services created just $450 million during the last quarter, insignificant to total revenue, it's the fastest-growing segment at Oracle and has been essential in most of the company's merger and acquisition activity over the last few years.During Oracle's last quarter, it saw 25% growth in SaaS and PaaS combined, while laaS grew just 13%. The problem is that overall cloud infrastructure services, laaS and PaaS, are growing at a 50% clip annually, now surpassing $12 billion in 12-month revenue, according to Synergy Research. Therefore, Oracle is still a small player in this space with growth in SaaS, PaaS, and laaS combined that is underperforming Synergy's industry estimates. The question investors should ask is how Oracle can bolster its cloud growth. One way would be by acquiring the near-$17 billion market capitalization company  , whose second-quarter revenue growth of 73.7% would greatly boost Oracle's SaaS cloud growth.Workday is a cloud-based service provider of Human Resource Management offerings, a market that Pacific Crest estimates will grow from $50 billion last year to $70 billion in 2015. Oracle is already a major player in this particular industry, owning 12.4% of the market, according to IDC, but while Workday competes purely with SaaS, Oracle uses a host of software, hardware, and acquisitions like Taleo products.While Oracle uses a host of products, Workday's success derives from a single SaaS platform, one where it expands the services it offers. Within Workday's platform, it offers key services such as recruiting, application submission and review, and payroll, along with many others.Essentially, Workday has created an HR ecosystem, including big data and the cloud to help companies find compatible positions, offer competitive pay, and evaluate skills while improving training. These are valuable tools that help define Workday, explain its growth, and why Workday may be a good buy for Oracle. The final element of why Oracle may be interested in bolstering its HR presence with Workday, fueling its SaaS growth at the same time, is Oracle's planned $5 billion acquisition of Micros.Micros provides business solutions, specifically hardware like electronic waiting lists at restaurants and payment processing systems for retailers. One area where Micros has a large presence is in restaurants; the server inputs an order and pays a check using Micros hardware, but the company is widespread in hotels, casinos, retailers, and on cruise ships, too.These are areas outside of Oracle's core business, in data centers and factories, but it shows that the company wants to be more of a presence in the services arena. Notably, these are all industries that require a large workforce, and most likely large HR departments. Furthermore, Workday already works with multiple companies in industries that Micros serves, like Chucke Cheese's,  ,  ,  ,  , etc. Given the growth of Human Resource Management, and the cloud itself, it should be no surprise if a large software company shows an interest in acquiring Workday. While Oracle makes sense, there are others, like  , which competes with Oracle as a leader in software within the enterprise space.Not to mention, SAP has already made large cloud-related acquisitions in recent years, and has said that it would be open to additional large purchases. Therefore, with Oracle desperately needing accelerated growth in the arena and more market share, combined with the willingness for these software giants to acquire, Workday is an intriguing target, one that would definitely make a splash and get investors excited.

The company delivered strong revenue growth, with sales coming in above projections. These results show solid performance in the developing cloud-based enterprise resource planning sector, but whether the company can continue to deliver growth in line with its heavily forward-looking valuation will likely remain a point of contention among investors and analysts.Workday's second-quarter revenue came in at $186.6 million, a 74% increase on the $107.6 million generated in the corresponding period last year. Internal projections had forecast between $173 million and $178 million in sales for the period, while actual numbers represented a 5.3% overperformance relative to consensus analyst estimates. The company brought in $143.7 million in subscription revenues, good for 77% growth year over year.

As a leader in this  field, Workday would appear to be well-positioned to absorb a significant portion of this growth, but it's facing strong competition as  and  increasingly focus on the cloud. The two larger companies are transitioning their on-premise enterprise programs to cloud-based solutions, and their move to this model has the potential to disrupt Workday's growth plans. SAP AG expects to claim as much as $4.7 billion from cloud subscription and support revenue by 2017, a number that suggests it will aggressively court cloud ERP customers in the developing segment.Workday has built its market position through a well-designed, integrated software platform that is offered at less-expensive rates than competing alternatives. The company's service is structured in a way that allows for rapid adjustments and upgrades, with all clients operating on the same unified software hub. At present, Workday's human capital and financial management solutions offer clear advantages when stacked against the competition, but Oracle and SAP are likely to begin flexing their resource advantages to greater degrees. Many of the benefits that Workday's platform provides may be absorbed and replicated by the larger companies as they attempt to grab the cloud ERP market.To its credit, Workday has recently been successful in adding new, large clients; whether it can continue to secure contracts in line with expectations as big competitors adjust their offerings is the point to watch going forward.The latest quarterly results represent a strong performance for Workday as the company aims to expand the scope and reach of its business. That said, the performance does not offer strong indication as to whether its trajectory can match or improve on the growth implied by its current valuation. The company's price-to-sales ratio suggests that the company's stock remains more expensive than that of comparably sized competitors, and investors will have to weigh whether there is enough potential upside in Workday stock to offset the possibility that it will fail to deliver on projected growth.Apple recently recruited a secret-development \"dream team\" to guarantee its newest smart device was kept hidden from the public for as long as possible.

That said, its valuation has seen dramatic swings over the last year, with the share price reaching an all-time high of $116.49 at the end of February, then falling approximately 24% over subsequent months to reach current levels. data by Workday managed to grow revenue by 71% to $468.9 million in its last fiscal year, and expects revenue in the current annual term to climb to at least $710 million. The projected increase in business comes as the company expands the reach of its cloud-based enterprise resource planning software and aims to better address the education and government segment. Workday's streamlined human capital and financial management solutions might appear to put the company in good position to acquire new clients as demand for these systems grows, but there are notable risks that investors should consider before taking a position in the company. The following three problem areas could cause Workday's valuation to fall.While Workday has built a reputation for well-designed software suites and high levels of customer satisfaction, there's no denying that the young company is looking at increased competition with cloud giants going forward. Workday's most recent fiscal year report characterizes the human capital management sector as fiercely contested and lists  and  as its primary competitors in the space. Workday has a market cap of approximately $16 billion, while Oracle stands at approximately $185 billion and SAP AG is valued at approximately $96 billion, so the ERP newcomer is working at a considerable disadvantage as the established companies increasingly focus on the cloud.In order for Workday to meet its growth targets the company has been ramping up research and development and marketing expenditures, but these efforts could prove insufficient if bigger competitors utilize their financial and structural advantages.Both Oracle and SAP AG possess larger customer bases, better brand recognition, and superior advertising and development resources. Workday's big competitors could lower their prices in order to secure a larger share of the cloud ERP software market, thereby limiting the smaller company's ability to meet its growth targets. Large competitors like Oracle and SAP AG could also absorb Workday's smaller competitors, or form strategic partnerships like the arrangement made between Oracle and  . Any of these possibilities have the potential to destabilize the company's growth and push its share price downward.Workday's current earnings are mostly derived from contracts with its U.S. subscriber base, however the company's growth plans remain dependent on successful expansion into foreign markets. Reaching its goals in international territories requires significant product development and advertising resources so as to adequately shape and sell its offerings to a given market. Expanding its operations to a worldwide scale has obvious benefits for the company, however, a multitude of variables could render its efforts in foreign markets insufficient.Overseas suppliers of competing human capital and financial management solutions enjoy advantages in tailoring software solutions to the needs of their territory. Foreign companies and government institutions seeking ERP solutions may also opt to deal with their local companies for pricing or political reasons.Further complicating Workday's ability to diversify its geographical revenue sources, rival services may be able to replicate or absorb defining features of Workday's ERP platform, with some competitors potentially achieving this end through means that would be illegal in the United States. Additionally, the possibility for declines in national and global corporate spending, slowed growth or decline in use of cloud solutions, and changes in governmental structures and regulatory policies create opportunities for Workday's growth plans to falter, and also highlight the difficulties inherent to modeling expansion into untapped foreign markets.Workday has not turned a profit since its founding in 2005, and its current valuation is built around lofty growth projections. The cloud-based ERP market is forecasted to expand significantly as more businesses transition from on-premise resource management to SaaS solutions, and Workday is hypothetically positioned to benefit.That said, shares of the company are priced for growth that significantly outstrips expectations for its comparably sized competitors. Workday currently has a trailing price-to-sales ratio of 28.5, while Salesforce comes in at 7.7 and  has a ratio of 13.3.If confidence in the cloud-based ERP sector or Workday's individual offerings should falter, for any reason, investors could quickly lose faith in the company's growth trajectory, likely triggering significant downward adjustment in its share price. If Workday is forced to restructure ahead of schedule so as to generate profits, or at least reduce losses, its ability to scale its business as planned could be compromised.Given the challenges facing Workday and the company's highly growth-dependent pricing, the case can be made that shares are currently overvalued. That doesn't mean these risks, viewed individually or in conjunction, offer clear-cut evidence that shares will fall, but they are important elements to watch going forward.Apple recently recruited a secret-development \"dream team\" to guarantee its newest smart device was kept hidden from the public for as long as possible.

The growth was spurred by belief that the strength of its enterprise resource planning software would allow the company to achieve rapid and sustained growth. In March 2014, market optimism on the company reached a peak, and shares traded as high as $116.47. In May, its stock reached its current 52-week low of $64.21, then rebounded somewhat on a solid quarterly performance. data by  .Today, the stock is back to trading in the $79 range. Given Workday's wild swings and the appearance of stickiness in its current price range, it's worth looking at some factors that could drive shares higher. Amid significant threats to the business, there's no certainty as to what the future holds for the company and its investors, but these three elements could be key to rejuvenating the stock. In the company's last , CEO Aneel Bhusri pointed to the acquisition of new, large clients as a major growth driver for the company going forward. The provider of enterprise software-as-a-service solutions has found success with midsized companies, and is now focused on moving upmarket. In its last fiscal quarter, Workday secured  as a customer, its largest to date. The company also added another Fortune 500 customer to its client base, but its identity has yet to be disclosed. The reveal of this new client and other large customers down the line have the potential to brighten Workday's outlook, especially if these companies subscribe to all of the company's enterprise software suites.Workday has also indicated that it addeda number of global European businesses to its client list in the last quarter, and that these companies will be disclosed at some point in the not-too-distant future . The Oct. 8 announcement that  , a British telecom company with a market cap of $4 billion, had signed on for Workday's services wasn't enough to provide a sustained increase in its stock price , but more significant foreign signings should bolster optimism that the company can deliver the aggressive growth priced into its valuation. Beating adoption expectations in the government and education segments could also be drivers for the company's stock. The advancement of deployment partnerships with  and  represented some of the most encouraging Workday news in the last six months. As the company aims to move upmarket, it will be looking for more large customers to serve as deployment partners. This strategy allows the service provider to reach the customers of its direct clients while bypassing many hurdles and costs associated with acquiring new subscribers.Although Workday is broadly regarded as offering a high-quality product in the ERP software field, it is also relatively young, and deployment partnerships with large, established companies offer the software provider a means of combating the brand and positional advantages enjoyed by competitors  and  . For Workday to beat market expectations for its growth, it will need to deliver strong adoption for its finance and talent acquisition software. The company aims to get existing customers for its human resources management software suite on board with its financial and talent acquisition products, and to sign up new customers for its expanded enterprise management products. Success on these fronts would enable the company to grow revenue from subscriptions, which is one key metric investors are watching.The company hasn't given adoption estimates for Workday Recruiting, but it has indicated uptake is strong. If this product finds better than expected buy rates, it could be a compelling indication the company is building an integrated software ecosystem with staying power, and also strengthening its brand. Similarly, the announcement of impressive performance from its Workday Financial Management software suite could translate to increased optimism about the company's stock. The focus on moving into financial software products finds the company increasingly in competition with not only Oracle and SAP, but also  . If the enterprise market warms to Workday's finance management offerings, its future prospects could begin to look much stronger. Workday has a trailing price-to-sales ratio of 22.8, and the company doesn't expect to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future. As such, its stock pricing is largely dependent on the business's growth level. With Workday facing strong competition from larger, more established cloud companies, and with mounting fears that the market will turn bearish on tech, there are valid reasons to view Workday's stock skeptically. Even so, delivering in the areas that are key to growth gives the company's stock the potential to rise.Apple recently revealed the product of its secret-development \"dream team\" -- Apple Watch.

We will see results this holiday-shortened week from 71 companies in total, including 5 S&P 500 members. The notable companies reporting results this week include  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and others.Most of the remaining Q1 earnings reports are from the consumer-centric sectors, primarily the Retail sector. The coming reports are unlikely to change the picture that has emerged from the reports thus far. Strong results from a couple of retailers notwithstanding, it has been a tough environment for the sector. The sector's weak stock price performance year to date, the weakest among the 16 Zacks sectors, reflects this reality. Retail sector stocks in the S&P 500 are down -5.3% year to date, which compares to positive +3.2% gain for the S&P 500 index as a whole in that same time period.Total earnings for the 41 retailers in the S&P 500 that have reported results already (out of a total of 43) are flat +0.0% on +3.3% higher revenues, with a low 43.9% of them beating earnings estimates and an even lower 39.0% coming ahead of top-line expectations. Combining the Retail sector earnings for the 41 companies that have come out with the 2 still to come, the sector's total earnings in Q1 should be up 0.4% on +3.7% higher revenues and lower margins. Same-store sales improved markedly in April, with pent up demand following Q1's harsh weather and the Easter shift benefiting the numbers.The broad trends about the Q1 earnings are fairly well established by now and the coming reports are unlikely to change them in any material way. These trends pertain to anemic growth, fewer top-line surprises and continued negative guidance that is prompting estimates for the current period to come down. (  )Total earnings for the 489 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up 1.2% from the same period last year, with a 'beat ratio' of 67.7% and a median surprise of +3.96%. Total revenues are up +2.6%, with a revenue 'beat ratio' of 51.3% and the median company beating top-line expectations by 0.13%.The table below shows the current scorecard for all 16 Zacks sectors. As you can see, the earnings season has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from just 1.8% of the index's total market capitalization still awaited.The chart below shows how the earnings and revenue growth rates for Q1 thus far compare to what these same companies reported in 2013 Q4 and the 4-quarter average.The Q1 earnings growth picture is no doubt weak. But we should keep two things in mind while evaluating this growth picture. Firstly, it wasn't news to the market, as expectations had fallen sharply ahead of the start of the reporting season. As such, as shocking as the above picture seems to be, nobody was exactly shocked at seeing them. Secondly, the growth picture actually isn't as bad as the above picture is making it out to be once the drag from the Finance sector (which itself is a function of weak results at Bank of America) is excluded from the aggregate results.The comparison chart below of ex-Finance results clearly shows this.This chart of ex-Finance growth is showing that the earnings and revenue growth rates in Q1 are roughly comparable to historical averages. Nothing exciting about that finding, but it is actually an improvement over what was expected just a couple of weeks back.Looking at the composite Q1 picture, meaning combining the actual results from the 489 companies that have reported with estimates for the 11 still-to-come reports, total earnings are expected to be up 1.3% on +2.7% higher revenues. The table below presents the (composite) summary picture for Q1, showing the year-over-year change in total earnings, revenues and margins for all 16 Zacks sectors.As we saw in the Q1 results, the low expectations made it easy for companies to come out ahead of them. Roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 members beat earnings expectations every quarter any way and we are right around that level in Q1 as well. What we haven't seen for a while is positive guidance and favorable comments from management teams about business outlook. And Q1 is largely along those same lines, causing estimates for the current period to come down, as the chart below of evolving Q2 estimates shows.The downtrend in Q2 estimates is consistent with the trend that has been in place for almost two years now. Stocks made impressive gains over the last two years even though estimates were coming down during that time period, with the Fed QE keeping alive hopes of an eventual growth recovery. It will be interesting to see if investors will respond any differently to the coming period of negative revisions.For a detailed look at the earnings picture, please check out our weekly  .\n  \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

People began wondering: is founder and CEO Aaron Levie a quack or a modern-day genius?Let me be clear: he's a genius, and he's not the only one.I've known Levie for six years, ever since Box became an early customer of my company, Zuora, and his company's revenues were in the low single digits. I've watched with great pleasure as Levie, co-founder Dylan Smith and the team have grown Box into the force that it is today. He is the latest in a line of true entrepreneurs, laser-focused on making his vision of collaboration a reality. With over 34,000 paying companies across the globe including Bechtel, Eli Lilly (  ), and Gap (  ), it's obvious that companies see the value of Box and trust it to power their businesses.But it's crazy to me that 10 years after the IPO of  (  ) as the first public software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, Wall Street  doesn't understand the subscription business model. The software industry has been on an inevitable path to subscriptions since 1999, when Salesforce was founded.Fast forward to today with Workday (  ), Adobe (ADBE), Box, Zendesk (ZEN) and others. These companies have proven that a subscription model with recurring revenue is a different kind of business. It's complex. Yet, when managed well, it's a healthy and financially attractive model that has disrupted some of the most established industries across the globe.Even giant software vendors like SAP (SAP) are now offering major products via subscription. And I assure you this is just the beginning.Why then, is there such controversy about Box?  writer Kurt Marko recently questioned whether Box is a \"viable standalone business,\" pointing to the fact that operating expenses outweigh revenue and calling it \"the beginning of the end.\" Erik Sherman with  claimed that Box \"badly needs the money\" and that \"an IPO is necessary to bring in the capital needed for long-term viability.\"It's become apparent to me that there is a fundamental lack of understanding about the subscription business model, a term I call the \"Subscription Economy.\"In order to understand the true genius of Box, let's look at the four big differences between the subscription model and a traditional software business.The first thing to know is that for a subscription business, revenue is not revenue. It's the difference between a one-time payment and recurring payments.Just think about it - let's say you have two friends: Jack says he'll give you $10 just this once, and Jill says she'll give you $5 a year for each of the next 10 years. There is a big difference between the two - you know that Jill's deal is a better deal.That's why smart subscription businesses look at something called ARR, which stands for Annual Recurring Revenue, and consists of only the subscription revenue from customers for an ongoing service. To get at ARR, subscription businesses take the value of their subscription contracts, normalize it to an annual amount, and add it all up. For a subscription business, more so than cash or revenue, ARR is the true indicator of your company's health.But here's the thing: accounting rules today don't recognize ARR.In fact, accounting systems do not differentiate between a dollar that recurs and a dollar that does not. Accounting systems today are built on the double entry standard created 500 years ago by  to help Venetian merchants track the sale of spices. And in that system, a dollar is a dollar is a dollar.Fortunately, there's a simple way to approximate ARR from a standard income statement - just take the quarterly revenue, strip out non-recurring revenue such as setup fees or consulting fees, and multiply it by four.That will give you a close estimate as to what the ARR was at the start of that quarter. (The sophisticated reader here will note that this doesn't tell you what ARR is at the end of the quarter, and it doesn't include revenue contributed from in-quarter bookings \u2026 but we'll leave that for another time).In Workday's most recent filings, for example, the company reported $141 million in quarterly revenue, of which $110.7 million was subscription revenue. By taking the subscription revenue and multiplying it by four, you can see that Workday likely started out that quarter with about $443 million in ARR.We've performed the same calculations for Workday, ServiceNow (NOW), NetSuite (N) and Salesforce.com, below.\n  \nNow how about Box? Unfortunately, Box doesn't actually break down how much of its revenue comes from subscription versus that which comes from professional services. We do know that professional services is less than 10% of the total revenue, otherwise it would need to present that separately from subscription revenue.We'll make an educated guess that Box's consulting revenue is in-line with Salesforce.com's and plug in 5%. Based on that, we see that Box started its most recent quarter at $148 million ARR, double what they were at one year ago. That's pretty good growth.\n  \n(**) Our guessOne common refrain I've heard from people is that Box's costs must be high, since they are storing all those files and have to purchase so many disks. And they must be losing money because they give so much of storage per user.A look at Box's gross margins shows a different tale.But first, let's do a quick Accounting 101 for the non-CPAs out there. In a SaaS company, there are really just three sources of costs: people, data center, and marketing. In the income statement, the part of Box's S-1 filing causing the most comments, these costs are allocated into four key buckets:Take a look at what Box says goes into its costs of revenue:Now, most folks will take these cost buckets and map that to revenue to get a margin. Revenue minus costs of revenue, for example, is your gross margin. We're going to do something different and compare these costs to ARR.Why ARR? Think about it - the great thing about ARR is that it's a forward-looking metric - ARR very closely approximates what you expect to make this upcoming quarter, compared to revenue which tells you what you already made last quarter.If you are Levie and Smith, and you know what your ARR is at the start of the quarter, you can make some smart decisions on how you want to spend that money. Comparing expenses to ARR better approximates how the executives in the company actually think and run their businesses.To do this accurately, you have to take out the cost of goods sold that are tied to the professional services, and you have to take out the stock option expenses that are reported in the filings. That's why we call this a Gross Recurring Margin, vs. just a Gross Margin.Here are the numbers we calculated:\n  \nAs you can see, Box's gross margins are in line with others in the SaaS industry. It actually doesn't cost that much to offer storage in the cloud.At the heart of financial accounting is the concept of matching. When $1 is shown on the income statement, it shows the amount of cost of goods sold, sales and marketing, R&D and G&A (general and administrative) that went into making that one dollar.Unfortunately, the whole concept of matching starts to break down for subscription business models. That's because ARR represents revenue acquired in previous periods, which are simply now renewing. Sure, you need to service the customer, so cost of goods and G&A is to service the customer and does match to the ARR.How about R&D? Well, the traditional view says the products you are selling today are already done, and you are investing in research to create innovations that drive future sales. But here's the thing -- the customers of SaaS companies did not sign up for a static service that never gets better. If you know something about SaaS companies, they are obsessed about keeping their customers happy, to keep them buying the service, and they invest in R&D against that goal.At Salesforce, we started naming releases with the seasons, for example the \"Winter 2013 release,\" to convey the constant rate we expected to add enhancements to the products. That's why I like to think of R&D as being matched to ARR.Sales and marketing is where it gets interesting. If your ARR represents today's revenue that you expect to recur, then your spend on sales & marketing is going towards growing ARR, to acquiring future revenue that is not yet in ARR. In other words, today's sales and marketing expenses are matched to future revenue.(In accounting lingo, sales and marketing acts more like a \"capital expenditure,\" or capex for short. In the old manufacturing world, you invested in a big factory to build a bunch of widgets, and you spread the cost of that factory out over time as you made and sold those widgets over time. That would be depreciation of course. In the subscription economy, you invest in sales & marketing to acquire customers, and you recognize revenue from those customers over their lifetime, which often can be 3, 5, 10 years or more. However, accounting rules today do not let you spread or depreciate sales and marketing costs over time.)That's why we like to look at something we call Recurring Revenue Margin, which is your ARR minus your cost of sales, research and development, and G&A, but before the spend on sales and marketing.\n  \n* Quarterly numbers annualizedWhen you look at Box's business from a recurring revenue margin viewpoint, you see they are running a profitable business. If Box stopped all sales and marketing today, it wouldn't grow any more, but it would have an intrinsic 20% margin business. Now, Box isn't as profitable as Salesforce or Netsuite, yet, but when you look at Box's recurring revenue margin over the last four quarters (below), the trend isn't bad.\n  \nYou can see that Box and Workday are spending in research & development. Why is R&D spending so high? I would speculate that this is Levie betting on the future -- Levie likely believes he has a big market that is growing fast, and he needs to invest in R&D with more features to outpace Dropbox or Microsoft's SharePoint product.So what have we established so far? Subscription businesses really care about recurring revenue, which is measured by ARR. On an ARR basis, Box is a fast-growing SaaS company today. On a gross margin basis, it doesn't cost Box too much to offer storage in the cloud, and on a recurring revenue margin basis, Box is building an inherently profitable business.The last thing to look at is where all the controversy lies. On  , Tomasz Tunguz notes that:Let's take that again. Box is spending more money on sales and marketing than it has revenues, 3 times more than its peer group, and over 50% more than the #2 spendthrift on the list. I see the Box billboard every day when I drive down Highway 101. So what is Levie getting for all that money? Let's take a look.\n  \nIn the quarter ending Oct. 31, 2013, Box spent $46 million in sales and marketing to grow ARR by $20 million, net of churn. That means he spent over $2 to acquire $1 of growth. Compared to other public SaaS companies, that's on the high side, although if Box expects that $1 to recur for the next 5 or 10 years, that's still a pretty good deal.Has Levie built a house of cards, one that requires more and more money to fuel, but that ultimately will fall apart when the music stops?I don't think so. I see a person who, by the age of 28, has convinced some pretty big names in the investment community to give him over $400 million dollars to go after a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.That's pretty amazing in and of itself. But that's not all. Levie then built a business with strong fundamentals that is intrinsically profitable, if looked at in the right way.Finally, by recognizing that he's in a land grab in a fast growing market with multiple players, Levie is showing he has the courage to bet big and spend big to acquire as many customers as he can.What if one day Levie decides that he's won, that he sees the market for cloud collaboration slowing, and he's the clear market share leader? At that point, if he cuts R&D back down to 15%, and sales and marketing down to 15%, he'll have a 25% margin business. If he's a $1 billion company at that point, that means he can throw off $250 million in cash.If he can grow that into a $10 billion company, he's throwing off $2.5 billion in cash. That's a great business. And that's the genius of Aaron Levie. I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

And all three stocks are on the rise this morning. But the surprising thing is that analysts and investors continue to be bullish on these stocks despite growing losses.These companies operate in a sector known as \"enterprise software.\" Enterprise software stocks including  , and  are some of the most loved  , and enjoy remarkably rich valuations.The bullish case on these stocks seems to be completely reliant on rapid revenue growth, which investors assume will translate into future profits.But skeptics point to one big issue: these profits aren't materializing.While each of these companies continues to see their stock soar to new highs, losses continue to grow at an astonishingly similar rate.Let's examine the three biggest stocks in the sector: Salesforce, Splunk, and Workday. These players undoubtedly get the bulk of the attention from the media and investors.Theoretically a lot of this attention is deserved. The disruptive potential of these cloud-based enterprise software players is huge, and the revenue growth is real. Demand for these services is there. But thus far, these companies aren't turning a profit.A lot of stockholders will point to the unique nature of the Subscription as a Service (SaaS) business model, as a reason for the discrepancy in valuation. With enterprise software contracts typically spanning one to three years, revenue is recognized linearly on a quarterly basis. This gives the appearance of steady sustained growth over the long term.As these businesses have matured, it's surprises me to see growing losses. And what's surprised me even more is that no on seems to care at all.Let's take a quick look at each companies revenue and losses.\n  \nThe following table shows just how expensive these stocks are on a price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-earnings (P/E) basis.\n  \nDespite rapidly growing top-lines, every company managed to increase its losses by a significant amount year over year. This seems particularly worrisome given that all these companies are enjoying ludicrous P/S valuations.Many tech companies - including these three - like to report earnings on a non-GAAP basis. This allows them to selectively remove pesky expenses including stock options, write-offs, and taxes. On a non-GAAP basis, the income statements look far more favorable. Yet these numbers doesn't provide a true view of the profitability.As we saw this week, yet another quarter of growing losses was reported from each of these three companies. And you guessed it right! All three stocks are trading within 5% of their all-time highs.Sooner or later investors are going to have to start demanding profits, or some sort of tangible value. Very rarely has there been a growth company that was unprofitable during its  years and subsequently enjoyed long-term success.Apple, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle are all great examples of tech companies that were profitable during the period where they experienced the most rapid growth. No - it doesn't seem as though these enterprise software stocks are \"the next Microsoft.\"So why are investors giving a free pass to the most expensive stocks like Salesforce, Splunk and Workday?The simple answer is due to their \"software as a Service\" or SaaS business model. But this is nothing more than an argument of \"this time it's different because\u2026.\" And anybody  in shares of these companies now better hope that's right. With stratospheric valuations and no assets to fall back on, these stocks will have a long way to tumble when the growth finally slows down.If you own shares of these high flying enterprise software stocks, now may be a good time to be locking in your gains. If profits never materialize, there is no question these stocks will be trading at significantly lower prices sometime soon.We just found out that some of the savviest investors in the tech world are bankrolling a new, alternative, web-based banking platform. Most investors have never heard of it, but we believe it could revolutionize banking the same way the internet revolutionized music, communication and business. The best part?

Analysts had expected 60% growth.Investors responded in kind, sending shares soaring by over 12% on Feb. 5, a day after its Q4 results.The stock is up 45% this year after ending 2013 up 122% from its IPO offering price of 31 on May 17.Tableau Software is one member of an emerging club of young gun software players catching on with investors as they challenge multibillion technology stalwarts such asOracle (  ),SAP (  ) andIBM (  ) with innovative methods for managing electronic data, says Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.\"That is the appetite these days, you look across the landscape,Workday (  ),Splunk (SPLK), Tableau, all of these stocks are just up and to the right, and it's such a dynamic time in technology and some of these vendors are very disruptive with big growth curves, and valuations are getting bid up on an appetite to own these names,\" he said.Tableau's software lets companies sift through data from multiple departments and arrange that information in charts and graphs.The primary difference between Tableau and some of its rivals is that its software can be used by most office staff without the help of information technology departments, says Steven Ashley, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co.\"Tableau is coming into the market with tools that provide better visualizations of data that the common man or knowledge worker can use,\" he said.In the quarter, Tableau reported a per-share profit, minus items, of 20 cents due to a one-time tax benefit vs. 4 cents in the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a break-even quarter. Revenue in the quarter jumped 95% to $81.5 million vs. the same quarter last year.For the current period, the company said it expects revenue of $61 million to $63 million, or growth of 52.5% to 57.4% from the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had expected $60 million, or growth of 50%.Many investors have a one-track mind when looking at Tableau, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets.\"They are buying on the revenue growth; at the end of the day you can count on one hand the type of quality companies that are growing at this pace in these types of secular areas,\" he said. \"Relative to expectations, they kind of blew the cover off the ball.\"In the quarter, Tableau's license revenue grew 92.9% to $58 million vs. the year-earlier period. Revenue from maintenance and service shot up 99.6% to $23.4 million.Tableau released a new version of its software in November and is planning another new version in Q2 and yet another next year.During a conference call with analysts to discuss its earnings, CEO Christian Chabot said Tableau expanded relationships with several large existing customers, includingGoogle (GOOG) andFord Motor (F).Tableau's ability to find ways for customers to use its software is providing the fuel for much of its growth, Ives says.\"The new products help, but once Tableau gets in the door they are really able to expand their overall presence and that has been on their keys to success,\" he said.Is it enough? Analysts expect Tableau's year-over-year revenue growth to begin to decelerate to 57% in Q1 and 45% in Q2 after a steady climb from 62% to 95% the past four quarters.And Q1 is a particularly slow period for software companies.Many of Tableau's deployments are in specific departments rather than across a company. Pushing beyond that boundary could compromise the business model that has made Tableau a favorite among knowledge workers and the reason for its success, Wood says.\"If they want to get into the market in signing bigger platformwide deals, they are going to need to tailor not just to the business user but to IT,\" he said. \"When you start getting into bigger deployments, there is a need for security and schema and structure and compliance -- all of that stuff that IT needs to be in control of.\"In the quarter, Tableau's sales and marketing costs rose 72.9% to $40.1 million vs. the year-earlier period while R&D spending climbed 76.2% to $18.2 million vs. the same quarter last year.Tableau's global message is gaining traction. Its international business represented 22% of revenue in Q4 vs. 18% in the prior quarter.Growth does come at a price.\"The biggest challenge is managing rapid growth,\" Ashley said. \"If you are growing your business at 70%, 80%, 90% (annually) you have to hire 70% or 80% or 90% more people, more office space (and) more computer capacity.\"Tableau must keeping pushing the big boys such as Oracle and SAP, said Ives: \"There is a big opportunity in the installed base that is the traditional analytics vendors and it's really going after that opportunity.

(Symbol: DO), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY), the market cap is now $6.64B, versus Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (Symbol: DO) at $6.52B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of WDAY vs. DO:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, WDAY is up about 1.6%, while DO is up about 3.5% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors in Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY) saw new options become available this week, for the May 17th expiration.

The goal was to study the age-old maxim that it's better to be happy than to prove that you are right all of the time-i.e., it's not worth debating or fighting over most of life's details, it's better to simply go along and get along, especially with your spouse. (You know this is going to be good, right?)So they set up an experiment; instead of describing everything, I'll just quote the article (which was published December 17 online, and written by Belinda Luscombe, an editor-at-large for Time):\"So they found a couple who were willing to record their quality of life on a scale of 1 to 10. They told the man, who wanted to be happy more than right, about the purpose of the study and asked him to agree with every opinion and request his wife had without complaint, even when he profoundly didn't agree. The wife was not informed of the purpose of the study and just asked to record her quality of life.Things went rapidly downhill for the couple. The man's quality-of-life scores fell, from 7 to 3, over the course of the experiment. The wife's scores rose modestly, from 8 to 8.5, before she became hostile to the idea of recording the scores. Rather than causing harmony, the husband's agreeableness led to the wife becoming increasingly critical of what he did and said (in the husband's opinion). After 12 days he broke down, made his wife a cup of tea (New Zealand is, after all, a Commonwealth country), and explained the experiment. At this point the Data Safety Monitoring Committee, as the researchers called it, stopped the study because of \"severe adverse outcomes.\"\"This was a genuine piece of research where we hoped that both parties would be happy as part of one person agreeing with everything the other said,\" says the study's chief author, Dr. Bruce Arroll, who seems to have a pretty well-developed sense of humor. \"We thought that we would find a method of creating marital bliss (and probably a Nobel Prize if we had succeeded).\"The researchers concluded, shockingly, that humans need to be right and acknowledged as right, at least some of the time, to be happy. In politics, people often note that there can be no peace without justice, and that's true of the domestic sphere as well. The researchers also noted that this was further proof that if given too much power, humans tend to \"assume the alpha position and, as with chimpanzees, they become very aggressive and dangerous.\"I'll leave that part about chimpanzees for someone else to comment on. The point is that we, as human beings, deep down inside, actually derive pleasure from being right. Call it ego, call it human nature, call it whatever you want, the point is that all of us have a pre-set button that desires to, at least sometimes, to be right.We've all seen this (or lived it) at some point, even with small children-when a kid is constantly told he's wrong, he'll either rebel or suffer some sort of depression. Conversely, when someone (say, a co-worker) proves himself correct on a matter, he tends to feel he's earned his keep.---As it turns out, this ingrained desire to be right most of the time can not only spark the meaningless spousal argument (\"Who wants salad? I want pizza!!\"), but like so many basic instincts, it also causes big problems for investors. Some investor once coined the phrase \"Do you want to be right, or make money?\" and, while most investors believe these are one in the same, they are not.In the market, being right causes many to be stubborn with each and every stock they buy. It's almost as if every stock purchase represents a major financial decision that will affect that investor's life. I see it all the time-subscribers will agonize over every decision with every stock. Their real fear isn't losing a few hundred bucks, it's being wrong-if they sell, they're giving up hope, acknowledging that their initial, detailed analysis was incorrect.However, to make money (at least as an intermediate-term growth investor, like me), what really counts isn't maximizing every single trade. Instead, it's really the outlier trades that count; the big losers and big winners are what drive your results. In other words, you want to lose small and win big.Below is a histogram of results that would be typical of a successful few months' worth of trades. These wins/losses aren't measured in dollars (though they could be); they're expressed as a percent of what was risked. In other words, if a trade's initial risk was $1,000, and the trade ended with a loss of $1,000, it would be a -1.Conversely, if the trade resulted in a profit of, say, $2,500, it would be marked as a +2.5. (Initial risk = Loss limit minus buy price, multiplied by the number of shares.) All of the trades had similar initial risk, FYI, with each blue bar representing a trade result. These are ordered from worst to best.Details aside, you can see that the vast majority of trades came in between -1.0 and +1.0 (there were a few in the middle you can't see that were basically break-even trades, giving a reading of 0). That makes sense, as most of your trades are going to cancel each other out.Importantly, there were more losing trades than winning trades (44% winners, to be exact)-thus, this investor was wrong more often than he was right! However, as mentioned above, what really counts are the outliers, and you can see toward the right side, there were eight trades that were above +1.0, including five above +2.0 and one north of 6.0!In fact, when you do the math, it turns out that the average for every losing trade was -0.31, while the average from all the winners was 1.23. That means the average winner was nearly four times as large as the average loser! That's how the growth investor makes money.To be clear, I'm not claiming the win rate is meaningless-the goal is to have both a high win rate and some huge winners. But if you're overly concerned with always being right, chances are you'll hold onto losers, while booking your winners too early ... exactly the opposite of what successful growth investors do.---January's are often tricky for the market, what with myriad crosscurrents from a variety of retail and institutional investors. And we've seen plenty of ups and downs already this month, including this week's huge downdraft Monday, and equally huge rebound on Tuesday.Now, to be fair, coming after a huge run since October, this up-down-up-down action is a sign of distribution; the action tells you the bulls and bears are fighting it out. At the very least, it's a slight change in character from the relatively smooth uptrend we've enjoyed in recent months.On the flip side, what encourages me is that I've seen some breakouts so far this year among a few growth stocks ... really, the first big-volume lift-offs from well-formed bases I've seen since November. Moreover, even during Monday's weakness, none of these stocks took on too much water, and most snapped back quickly as soon as the market bounced back.I'm not going to pretend the action of a handful of growth stocks are the be-all and end-all to determining the market's health, but I do think you can use them as clues to the market's speculative sentiment. Thus, keep an eye on names like Yelp (  ), Pandora (  ), Canadian Solar (  ), Workday (  ) and YY Inc. (  ); if a few of them fall back into their prior bases, it would be at least a short-term yellow flag. So far, they're all looking good.In fact, the stock I'm writing about today is  . The solar sector as a whole is hit-or-miss (about half the stocks look good, half don't), but CSIQ is one that's acting very well, and part of it has to do with a unique business plan. Here's what I wrote about it in Cabot Top Ten Trader two weeks ago:\"Like all solar stocks, Ontario-based Canadian Solar, one of the largest solar power companies in the world, has been through some huge ups and downs in recent years. But the company, founded in 2001, had a monster year in 2013, partly in concert with the global recovery in solar and partly due to some big deals that are unique to Canadian Solar. The company specializes in building big power facilities that are sold to companies that will tie them into the local power grid. The most recent sale was a $57.4 million deal, announced on January 2, to sell the Mississippi Mills plant to TransCanada. Mississippi Mills is a 10 megawatt facility, and is the fourth of nine such facilities that will be sold to the same client. Just today, it was announced that the company's 30 megawatt solar project in Xinjiang (Western China) had been completed and connected to the power grid. Successful construction and installation news is fairly routine for Canadian Solar and investors like the company for its vertical integration (everything from silicon ingots, cells and modules to giant power plants) and its global reach. Germany is still the company's largest source of business, with the U.S., Japan, China, Canada and Spain filling out the list. The company's 54 cents in earnings in Q3 came after eight quarters of losses, and investors are betting that the company has turned the corner to consistent profits (estimates are north of $2 per share in 2014) in a supportive environment for solar power.\"Since that time, the firm announced the completion and grid connection of another 10-megawatt solar project in eastern China, which was constructed in just three months. Touting the results, management said \"This project is another good demonstration of Canadian Solar's success in the development and construction of utility-scale solar power plants on a global basis as well our growing momentum in China, a rapid growing emerging market that is poised to become the world's largest solar market in the years ahead.\"It also inked a deal with supply north of 84,000 solar modules to National Renewable Energy Corporation for four utility scale solar projects totaling 25.3 megawatts in North Carolina.As for the stock, let me be clear: It's already had a huge, huge run. It was the biggest winner of 2013! So by no means am I saying the stock is early on in its advance.However, shares did tighten up beautifully from mid-November through year-end, and then exploded higher on the first day of 2014. It ripped ahead from 30 to 40 in just four days (!), pulled back calmly and, this week's is powering ahead again. t's very volatile, but the powerful momentum, big earnings estimates and terrific price-volume action has me intrigued.I actually missed CSIQ in Top Ten when we wrote it up, looking for a dip that didn't come. However, given its action since then, I think you could buy a small position (maybe half what you'd normally buy, dollar-wise) in the upper 30s, with a loose stop near 32. Then, if (and only if) CSIQ advances, you could consider adding a few more shares. I wouldn't be looking to push the envelope too much, but if things go well, there's big potential here.Sincerely,Michael CintoloChief Analyst of Cabot Market Letterand Cabot Top Ten TraderThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nterprise cloud applications provider for human resource and finance,  (  )  reported fiscal third-quarter 2014 loss of 23 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents per share.Revenues surged 76.1% from the year-ago quarter to $127.9 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $118.0 million.

In 2000, investors felt the nasty sting of that fall, both seasonally and directionally, for a decade or more. Victims of the late 1990s tech boom neglected basic laws of intelligent investing and replaced them with nonsensical metaphors to justify greed, like  .Now, as the stock market soars, isolated strains of valuation amnesia have been reported once again. And among a few momentum stocks, the possibility of massive overvaluation is more than plausible.Bubbles usually start around real ideas, often ideas with dreamlike investment potential. In the 1840s, it was railroads. In the 1920s, we had radio, automobiles, aviation, and electric power grids. In the 1980s, it was anything Japanese.By the late 1990s, Internet and e-commerce stock valuations rocketed into the stratosphere. While a few of the highly-touted bubble stocks grew into big winners, most bombed.These days, the bubble is more narrowly focused-battery-powered cars, 3D printers, and software-as-service stocks.Conceptually, we love all three. What could be better than a car that uses no gas and has Ferrari-like pickup? We love the idea behind  (  ); we love the industry and love the product, but can't help but wonder if 100 times earnings might be a wee bit frothy for a car maker.Similarly, there's little doubt that 3D printers have the potential to change the world. Still, it's far from obvious which companies will be massively profitable as a result.We expect commoditization of 3D printing (which implies meager future margins), and wonder with amazement at the valuation of  (  ), trading at 114 times estimated earnings in 2014.In software-as-a-service, take your pick of silliness: Customer relationship manager software firm  (  ) trades at 104 times estimated 2014 earnings, or human capital management software vendor  (  ) boasts a P/E of infinity because it earns nothing and isn't expected to be profitable for at least the next couple of years.Another sign of excess is online real-estate information firm  (  ). Like most bubble firms, Zillow is exceptionally well-managed, growing quickly, and has a fantastic market position with a disruptive product. It just isn't worth 240 times forward estimated earnings.Thanks in large sum to the Fed, the spigot is on for the stock market, but risks are beginning to rise. Valuations for high-growth stocks are no longer below average. Pockets of excess - although not yet widespread - are clearly popping up.Rational stock pickers - people who buy great businesses at reasonable prices - seem likely to beat those chasing the latest hot thing. Be careful of glamour stocks like Tesla, Salesforce.com, Workday, Zillow, and ExOne.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hort seller  must be very bearish right now.

Sentiment remained very bullish, but the upward trend showed no signs of bending or breaking. Treasuries sold off heavily following the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday, but recovered strongly over the past two days.Next week will be cut short by the Thanksgiving holiday. Thursday, US markets will be closed and Friday will be a short day. Even still, there will be a lot of economic data released. Tuesday the delayed September housing starts and building permits will be released in addition to the October report for each. Mortgage applications for purchase only declined by 2.6% during the month of October, consistent with jumps in mortgage rates due to the government shutdown, so it is unlikely that there will be any surprises in the reports. The other report scheduled for Tuesday is the September S&P/Case Shiller home price index. Because existing home prices only rose 11.3% YoY and fell 5.4% MoM in September, it is likely that the S&P report has the potential to fall short of expectations.Consumer confidence fell in September and October due to the tensions from the government budget negotiations. The preliminary November University of Michigan/Reuters consumer confidence index fell to a 22-month low at 72.0. Additionally, the Conference Board's confidence measure fell to 71.2 last month from 80.2 and is forecast to rise slightly to 72.2.The last important data points for the week are October durable and capital goods orders, and the Chicago regional manufacturing survey. Durable goods orders ex-transports -- the more closely followed figure from the report -- is estimated to rise 0.5% from the month prior. Capital goods orders, which carry significant weight in the US's GDP, is estimated to rise 0.7% from the prior month. Lastly, the November regional Chicago manufacturing report is estimated to fall to 60.0 from 65.9 last month -- still strongly in growth territory. This region's manufacturing activity is tightly tied to auto sales, so a big beat likely means stronger auto sales.European markets will not be closed, but data releases are light regardless. The UK will release the first estimate of third-quarter GDP, which is estimated to grow 1.5% from a year ago. Also, Japan will release its consumer price index, retail sales, employment change, and consumer spending from October on Thursday night.There are only a few earnings reports scheduled for the week.

And while stocks don't (or shouldn't) move up or down based on insider activity alone, insiders tend to be good indicators of when real stock-moving events like earnings surprises, corporate actions, and new products may be in the offing.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nterprise cloud applications provider for human resource and finance,  (  ) reported fiscal second-quarter 2014 loss per share of 19 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 24 cents per share.Revenues surged 71.5% from the year-ago quarter to $107.6 million, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $101.0 million. Subscription revenues (75.4% of revenues) soared 92.2% year over year to $81.1 million in the quarter. Professional revenues (24.6% of revenues) increased 29.0% year over year to $26.4 million.Workday ended the second quarter with more than 500 customers in total. This apart, the company announced plans to deliver Workday Payroll for UK and Workday Payroll for France, which are targeted toward meeting the full spectrum of payroll needs. The applications are expected to be available in 2015 and 2016, respectively.Most of the contracts signed during the quarter were of just over 3.5 years in duration. This is an increase from the prior two quarters, mostly on the back of a couple of large deals with five year terms. The company focuses its selling efforts primarily on such short-term contracts. Management believes the higher renewal rates and economics of these contracts are favorable for the company in the long term.Operating expenses rose sharply to $99.1 million from $60.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter due to an 80.8% increase in general & administrative expense, 74.8% rise in research & development expense and a 49.0% jump in sales & marketing expense.As a result of higher operating expenses, Workday reported operating loss (including share- based compensation) of $32.3 million, wider than a loss of $26.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Net loss (including stock-based compensation) was $33.2 million or 19 cents per share.Cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.29 billion compared with $805.8 million in the previous quarter. Cash used in operations during the quarter was $12.9 million.For fiscal third quarter 2014, total revenue is expected in the range of $115 million to $118 million, up 58% to 62% compared to the prior year. Subscription revenues are anticipated to be within a range of $88 million to $91 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 71% to 76%.For fiscal 2014, Workday expects revenues to be in the range of $436.0 million to $444.0 million. Professional Services revenues are projected to decrease seasonally in fiscal fourth quarter 2014.We believe that Workday's innovative product pipeline will help it to gain significant footprint in the human resource and finance markets.

(INDEXSP:.INX) futures are down 5-7 handles giving some downside follow-through to yesterday's break of the 1698-1702 actionable pivot. Yesterday did give some reasons to take off some risk for the intermediate-term active market participant. If you were looking for cues to get short, yesterday could have provided a small inflection point. It seems like IBD tweaked its big picture section as they went to \"rally under pressure\" a bit quicker than in the past.In order for the bears to keep some control, they can't let the bulls reclaim the 1698-1702 area. Support stands at the 21-day around 1682ish and then 1671 is a bigger spot. We will measure the next few sessions to see what type action we could see in August. Nobody \"truly\" knows, but if you made adjustments around that pivot, you have some flexibility. I don't think the highs of the year are in, but some volatility will be nice.There has been lots of nice stock action as this earnings season has provided us with multiple set-ups for action.Today we will go over some stocks that showed some relative strength yesterday. (  ) had a big gap down on July 18 after the company missed its earnings estimate, then dip buyers stepped in at the $51 area to contain the sell-off. The stock built a base at this level for a few sessions before seeing a spirited move yesterday that brought it back above all key moving averages. The stock showed some relative strength yesterday. It could try to fill the earnings gap at above $53.92. (  ) spiked higher at the open yesterday after the luxury retailer posted earnings that nearly doubled. It sold off together with the broader market in the morning, but met some buyers at the upper level support of $67.85 and saw a strong rally off of lows. Holding above prior pivot high of $69.23 would be constructive for higher prices moving forward. (  ) absorbed debit card fees limit news that created a wide trading range in both Mastercard and  (  ) last Wednesday. Yesterday MA tacked on another 1.80% after flagging at highs for two sessions. It looks a bit extended on the daily chart now and hard to chase, but its relative strength is something to notice. Some work above $640 to allow the key moving averages to play some catch up would be healthy for higher prices. (  ) is a new issue that has a constructive-looking chart. It saw a nice break out at the $70 level on Friday after grinding higher for almost two months. It's now flagging nicely at highs showing healthy digestion of the potent break-out. The stock also showed some relative strength yesterday. We now have an upper support of $72.19 to trade against.We're seeing some mixed action in tech. (AAPL) had a small \"Red Dog Reversal\" at $470.67 yesterday as we talked about how it did look a bit extended from the short-term moving averages. It still looks good as it's trying to build a base at the $462 area. Next bigger support / buyable spot is $457ish. (NFLX) held up well yesterday as it did sell off with the market in the morning, but held the recent pivot level of $250 and bounced. The stock closed well off of lows and posted 0.81% of gains showing relative strength. Look for potential upside follow-through above $257.60 if the market continues to hold. (AMZN) is hovering around its 21-day MA and put in a long bottoming tail after it held the upper support of $297 yesterday. A move through $302-303 could help it penetrate through the short-term downtrend since July 26. (GOOG) was on our radar yesterday for a move through $907. It tried and failed and is a bit sloppy. I'm going to stay away until it starts acting better. Holding above $880 would be constructive, but a break below that level could add some pressure. (BIDU) has been acting better since early July and further re-energized after earnings. It has some support around $130ish with a major gap support around $120ish. (FB) has been super strong since earnings and could use a break. Yesterday's low of $37.94 is a point of reference. The 8-day stands at $36.53ish. (LNKD) is building a nice flag above its earnings gap, with $228ish being the level to trade against. A move above $235ish could set it in motion. (VMW) is building a nice pattern above its earnings gap. The $83.50ish pivot is the level for action if it can power through it. (FSLR) came out with very weak earnings last night and is getting beat up. The $40ish pivot is some bigger support to watch. (TSLA) has been a great stock on all time frames. Earnings are after the close. It is priced for perfection so I'm going to wait until after the number to trade it.. I'm probably not doing an option strategy here like I did into earnings with GOOG, AAPL, FB, and LNKD. Historic highs for after hours is $146.Bears have the ball a bit here, but if we close back above 1698-1702 it will be a very quick set of downs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["et's take a look ahead at what's coming up next week in potentially market-moving news.On Monday, durable goods orders will be released. Because the headline figure is very volatile due to large aircraft orders from  (  ), the figure that investors pay attention to is ex-transports. Durable goods ex-transports are expected to rise 0.5% in July, up from a decline of 0.1% in the month prior. Earlier this month, the ISM institute released its manufacturing survey. The survey showed strong growth at a reading of 55.4, up from 50.9 the prior month. Additionally, retail sales rose 0.2% in July.On Tuesday, the Case-Shiller/S&P home price index will be released. Economists expect to find that home prices rose 12.2% year-over-year in June, up slightly from a 12.17% gain in June. Also, the Conference Board's gauge of consumer confidence is expected to be released. Economists are predicting that consumer confidence has fallen off slightly, to 79.5 from 80.3 in the prior month. Last week, the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index fell to 80.0 in August from 85.1 in the prior month.The second revision of 2Q GDP will be released on Thursday. Due to a much tighter than expected trade deficit in June, economists have increased their estimate for the quarter to an annualized rate of 2.2% from the Bureau of Economic Analysis' first estimate of 1.7%. This would imply a nominal GDP growth of 3% from the prior year. Personal consumption is not expected to rise any further.The last bit of economic news due out is July's personal spending growth, which will be released Friday. Consumption is expected to have grown by 0.3% in July, and by 3.2% versus a year ago. Also, incomes are estimated to have risen 0.2% in July, up 3.4% from a year ago. These figures will be key as the rate of growth in consumer spending and income growth both slowed in the second quarter. That slowdown showed up in spades in retailer earnings.Earnings season has nearly come to a close, but a few retailers still remain.  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (WSM), and  (CRM) are scheduled to report next week.08:30 Durable Goods - consensus -4.0%, prior 4.2%08:30 Durable Goods ex-Transports - consensus 0.55%, prior 0.0%08:30 Cap Goods Orders - consensus 0.5%, prior 0.7%08:30 Cap Goods Shipments - prior -0.9%10:30 Dallas Fed - consensus 4.0, prior 4.411:00 Fed to purchase $1.25b-$1.75b notes in 2036-2043 sector11:30 US to sell $30b 3M bills, $25b 6M billsNo major reportsNo major earnings09:00 S&P/Case Shiller 20-City MoM - consensus 1.00%, prior 1.05%09:00 S&P/Case Shiller 20-City YoY - consensus 12.15%, prior 12.17%10:00 Richmond Fed - consensus -3, prior -1110:00 Consumer Confidence - consensus 79.0, prior 80.311:00 Fed to purchase $4.25b-$5.25b notes in 2017-2018 sector11:30 Treasury to sell 4-week bills,1:00 Treasury to sell $34b 2-year notes05:00 JPY Small Business Confidence08:00 EUR German IFO ExpectationsBefore: (  )After: (  )7:00 MBA Mortgage Applications10:00 Pending Home Sales - MoM consensus 0.0%, prior -0.4%11:00 Fed buying $2.75b-$3.5b in 2020-2023 sector1:00 Treasury selling $35b 5-year notesCNY Leading Index06:00 EUR German GfK Consumer Confidence06:00 CHF UBS Consumption23:50 JPY Japan Buying of Foreign Bonds/Stocks23:50 JPY Retail TradeBefore: (  ) (  )After: (WSM)08:30 Initial Jobless Claims - consensus 330k, prior 336k08:30 Continuing Claims - consensus 2988K, prior 2999K08:30 GDP QoQ Annualized (2Q 2nd estimate) - consensus 2.2%, prior 1.7%.08:30 Personal Consumption - consensus 1.8%, prior 1.8%08:30 GDP Price Index - consensus 0.7%, prior 0.7%08:30 Core PCE QoQ - consensus 0.8%, prior 0.8%11:00 Fed to purchase $1.25b-$1.75b notes in 2036-2043 sector1:00 Treasury to sell $29b 7-year notes8:50am Bullard speaks in Memphis2:00pm Lacker speaks in Virginia07:55 EUR German Unemployment Rate12:00 EUR German CPI23:30 JPY CPIAfter: (KKD) (CRM) (SPLK)08:30 Personal Income - consensus 0.2%, prior 0.3%08:30 Personal Spending - consensus 0.3%, prior 0.5%08:30 PCE Deflator YoY - consensus 1.4%, prior 1.3%08:30 PCE Core YoY - consensus 1.2%, prior 1.2%09:00 ISM Milwaukee - prior 52.4309:45 Chicago PMI - consensus 53, prior 52.309:55 University of Michigan Confidence - consensus 80.5, prior 80.09:00am Bullard speaks in Memphis01:30 AUD Private Sector Credit05:00 JPY Housing Starts06:00 EUR German Retail Sales08:30 GBP Net Consumer CreditNo major earningsThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoLeadership by example is sometimes the best way to gain respect and recognition from clients.Ultimate Software (  ), a provider of Web-based payroll and human resources services, has placed the customer first since its inception in 1990.But the company hasn't just been saying it. It's been doing it. It set the example by treating its employees like customers.\"The company is one of the pioneers of software as a service (SaaS),\" said Mark Marcon, an analyst at Robert W. Baird. \"It started transitioning its solutions to a SaaS model far earlier than the vast majority (of payroll service companies). It has grown very rapidly through providing a SaaS alternative to payroll and HR management services and building a tremendous reputation for excellent client service and customer satisfaction.\"How did it stand out in client service?\"It actually starts with management's focus on their own employees,\" he noted. \"A lot of management teams start by thinking about shareholders and what they need to do there. This management team starts with thinking about 'What do we need to do with our employees?'\"Ultimate Software makes sure it keeps its employees happy. For example, it covers 100% of their health care costs. It also is very good at screening and identifying promising additions to their team and has a very strong culture.\"Typically, there is a strong correlation between satisfied employees and the willingness to provide good customer service,\" said Marcon. \"The people are happy and satisfied, and they want to do their best for their clients. The company is viewed by many as one of the best employers in the country.\"Current President and CEO Scott Scherr is Ultimate's founder. Prior to starting the company, he was atAutomatic Data Processing (  ), one of the largest payroll processing and benefits administration companies in the world.\"He became sort of disenchanted with the ADP business model and with the idea of continuing to slice and dice sales territory,\" said Justin Furby, an analyst at William Blair. \"From day one, he started with a focus on a different approach, on a much more customer-centric approach than the big payroll service bureau providers.\"Ultimate Software wins more than 90% of competitive deals against major payroll service providers, such as ADP and Ceridian, when it runs its sales process, writes Furby in his research report. \"We believe that ADP, which is the largest source of Ultimate Software customers, continues to sell numerous, disjointed products to the market, and we have heard that the number of live Vantage (an ADP product) customers remains relatively small.\"Ultimate Software pursues a slightly different demographic from ADP. While ADP has employers anywhere from one to thousands of employees, Ultimate Software does not focus on the small-business market up to 200 employees. Instead, it pursues companies with 200 to 85,000 employees. Its market share is about 5% for the up-to-1,000-employee market and 10% in the enterprise niche for larger employers.Nevertheless, management has discussed plans to enter the small-business market with up to 500 employees as a third distribution channel.Its flagship product is UltiPro. It is an all-in-one cloud-based solution, providing employers with payroll administration, tax management, compliance, human resources, benefits administration, talent management, time tracking, performance management, salary budgeting, recruitment, reporting and analytics under one umbrella.\"Instead of having to run multiple reports, like you might have to with ADP, with Ulti it's all under one stack. I think the biggest reason why customers come to them is their unified architecture, where they have all these different products in one stack. Companies can run reports easily,\" said Furby.The company's recurring revenue makes up 82% of total revenue. Management expects it to grow at a 25% rate in 2013. This is also the higher-margin portion of revenue, with retention rates above 95%.The services line revenue is 18% of total revenue and comes from implementation services for new clients. This stream is viewed as less important by investors, and it can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.One of the risks analysts are naming is competition from new or existing competitors. Aside from the large companies, such as ADP and Ceridian, that may choose to upgrade their solutions,Workday (  ) is one that investors have been paying attention to.However, the focus of Workday is slightly different, analysts point out. The company provides a different product lineup and is also more globally focused, while Ultimate Software's main focus is the U.S. and Canada.\"Workday has made quite a splash,\" noted Marcon. \"Now, Workday and Ultimate aren't directly comparable. There's different elements of emphasis.\"Ultimate Software is also building out a next-generation platform. It expects to roll out updated modules of its existing products over the next few years. The first module to be updated is recruiting. The company plans to sell it to new customers in the first half of 2014. Converting existing customers will take place several months later.\"They've been through these transitions before,\" said Furby. The company successfully went from a DOS-based product to .NET and then from on-premise software to SaaS. \"People are going to be watching 'how is that progression' over the next few years in terms of how are they doing with the new technology and how are they doing with transitioning customers from the legacy to the newer technology.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is up 6.76 to 2,966.6.

Last quarter, it posted a 13.0% positive surprise with a trailing four-quarter average negative surprise of 16.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Workday's first quarter revenue growth was mostly driven by strength across all the segments, particularly Subscription. Subscription revenues surged 85.3% year over year, whereas Professional revenues increased 16.7% year over year to $23.2 million. The company ended the first quarter with more than 450 customers in total, of which 290 are live on Workday applications.However, operating expenses rose sharply to $87.6 million from $51.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter due to a 113.2% increase in general & administrative expense, 74.6% rise in research & development expense and a 54.5% jump in sales & marketing expense. Net loss (including stock-based compensation) was $33.0 million compared with $20.0 million loss in the year-ago quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Workday will beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. That is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 25 cents loss per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 24 cents loss per share. That is a difference of -4.17%. Workday has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. But we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Investors can consider other stocks with a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank including: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +66.7% and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (  ), with Earnings ESP of +25.0% and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (  ), with Earnings ESP of +1.9% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["arnings Release Date: 08/27/2013Time: After-hoursAvg.

An analysis of historical premarket and after-hours trading activity and liquidity conditions in WDAY following an earnings release indicates that the price change in the extended hours is likely to be of significant value in forecasting additional price movement in the following regular session.Analysts at MidnightTrader have tracked how WDAY's stock price has reacted to quarterly earnings events the past both in the after-hours and following regular session.

If that's all you know about them, it's enough. Those two facts define the industry more than any hyperbole coming out of Silicon Valley. Much as their predecessors did 15 years ago, today's tech companies are selling an exciting new technology; and like the dot-coms, they've embraced a business model that will self-destruct at the first sign of trouble.With few exceptions, and regardless of size or sector, these businesses are running losses. Many are funding themselves through the issuance of new stock, either directly or through stock compensation - a strategy that works well during the good times, and only then. Investors prize growth, so there's little incentive for these companies to sacrifice it by raising prices. On the other hand, costs have become worse rather than better, with SG&A (sales, general, administrative) expenses eating up ever-greater portions of revenue.At the moment, these companies are simply growing and hoping - a plan perfectly suited to springtime, though a little uncomfortable as summer closes in. With earnings season now behind us, we can see whether this strategy is paying off.I'll begin with the enterprise cloud, a relatively mature group of businesses with high valuations. Four of the largest are  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), each of which offers Web products that address basic business functions, like marketing and payroll. All of them lost money in the first quarter, with operating margins ranging from -2% at Concur to -36% at Workday. More surprising, each company saw its margins deteriorate versus a year ago. This, coupled with fast growth (though slower than in previous years) led to a doubling of pre-tax losses. A Bernstein analyst  , the largest of the four, that \"they're moving from organic to inorganic growth. And inorganic is very expensive.\"Together, these firms are worth $46 billion in market capitalization. They made $1.2 billion in sales, and lost nearly $100 million before taxes. At the same time, a total of 15 million new shares found their way to market, representing roughly $800 million in value - a remarkable amount when compared to business operations, but in line with past quarters. While this was mostly the result of stock valuations - 8% annual dilution being high but not extraordinary - it nevertheless provides a tangible benefit to these companies, by skewing payroll towards stock compensation. Earnings reports then emphasize non-GAAP earnings, which paint a rosy picture by ignoring stock compensation; but this understates real expenses, and ignores the risk that, should shares fall, employees will demand cash. Then there is always the danger that companies which depend so heavily on their stock valuation, will find ways to lead investors by the nose.Other cloud firms logged similar performances.  (  ), which operates a security platform, lost $6 million pre-tax on $101 million in revenue, versus a negligible loss one year ago. Share count rose nearly two million in the quarter, or more than $100 million at current value. The company's press release focused on the bright side:  . (ATHN) sells Web-based services to health-care professionals, and until recently it was a shining beacon of cloud profitability, with operating margins of 8% in 2012; but last quarter it bled $12 million before taxes, on $126 million in revenue. The loss was due in part to the acquisition of  , a mobile app developer and perennial money-loser. Nevertheless, the purchase allowed Athenahealth to maintain a 30% growth rate - a detail that received top billing  .Meanwhile, more grounded enterprise companies like  (ORCL),  (SAP), and  NASDAQ:CSCO) continue to earn big bucks. Growth was low but generally positive year-over-year, and margins steady. They may be dinosaurs awaiting the meteorite but, so far, these old men of enterprise don't seem all that endangered. We can say that, at least, it probably won't be a recession that kills them.When it comes to the consumer cloud, we have fewer public companies to look at.  (NASDAQ:NLFX) did turn a profit, earning $7 million ($3 million after taxes) on revenues of a little over $1 billion - a modest improvement over last year's awful Q1. Stock growth amounted to a relatively modest $150 million.  (P), on the other hand, lost $28 million on sales of $126 million, with improved margins accompanying a larger loss. The value of new shares was $24 million.I would characterize these results as ugly; others might not. In many ways, though, the first quarter was business as usual. The market  -  (MKTO) and  (DATA) - while the rest of the industry soared with market indices. Infrastructure providers like  (RAX) and  (EQIX) were, once again, more profitable than many of their clients. As in other gold rushes, this one has favored the brothels rather than the prospectors.It seems cloud companies are still growing, and they're still losing money.

Xoom's first-day pop is another positive data point, together with large money flows into equities, very low volatility and overall strong IPO returns, suggesting that the  could build quickly as more companies file audited 2012 financials.New IPO filing activity also picked up last week, as six companies, looking to raise over $1 billion in the aggregate, were added to the  . The IPO market remained challenging, however, for smaller, niche deals. On Thursday, Orchid Island Capital (  ) became the eighth consecutive mortgage REIT to fall on its first day, and two micro-cap diagnostics companies, AutoGenomics (  ) and Cancer Genetics (  ), pulled their deals.Xoom raised $101 million on Thursday after pricing above the range. Its 59% first-day gain was the largest since on-demand software company Workday (  ) popped 74% in October 2012, and the second largest since data software provider Splunk (SPLK) more than doubled in price (gaining 108%) in April 2012. Xoom provides online and mobile money transfer services to 776,000 customers, mostly immigrants in the US. Revenue increased 60% to $80 million in 2012, although the company remained unprofitable as it invested in growth.

Barclays and Needham were the joint bookrunners on the deal.ConnectOne Bancorp (CNOB), a community bank serving Bergen County, NJ, and Orchid Island Capital, a mortgage REIT investing in Agency RMBS, completed small deals of $45 million and $34 million, respectively. ConnectOne specializes in an underserved market for loans of $1 million to $5 million to small- to mid-sized businesses, and it has grown assets at a rate of 22%. However, its geographic concentration, lack of a dividend and small size made it palatable to only a small group of investors. While it priced slightly above the midpoint of its proposed range, it gained a modest 4% in its first week of trading.Orchid Island Capital currently has a $115 million portfolio, which is managed by Bimini Capital. Although Bimini once managed a $3.5 billion Agency RMBS portfolio, its array of housing-crash related issues, including two ongoing lawsuits, likely limited investors' interest in the deal, which finished the week down 3%.AutoGenomics, a delayed deal from the previous week, and Cancer Genetics were the final companies on the IPO calendar entering last week, and both postponed their deals. Both companies were early stage, had substantial accumulated deficits and faced much larger competitors in the crowded testing market. They were also micro cap companies that had each initiated at least one prior IPO attempt. According to an underwriter, AutoGenomics has withdrawn its offering. Cancer Genetics has not officially withdrawn, but it will need to obtain external financing by the end of the month in order to continue operations.With Presidents' Day resulting in a shortened week for the US financial markets and in light of the fact that all new issues with a December fiscal year end will now be required to file audited full year financials before pricing, the US IPO market is set to take a pause this week.

Unlike the public relations nightmare that followed the Facebook (  ) stock offering, shares in the cloud-computing applications provider have almost doubled in value since its October 12th IPO - further enriching both men. data by Both Duffield and Bhusri have had success building and selling software companies during the past twenty years, culminating in the January 2005 sale of PeopleSoft, the world's second-largest application software company, to Oracle (  ) for $10.3 billion. As of September 2012, the 72-year old Duffield had an estimated net worth of $2.1 billion, ranking him 221 on The Forbes 400. At current values, his 44% stake (of the 160.3 million shares outstanding) in Workday has boosted his wealth by an additional $3.9 billion.Wealth enough to bypass smaller sums? Not entirely, it seems. Financial documents filed during the regulatory review for the Workday IPO disclose:\u2022 In June 2010, Workday entered into a lease agreement with Lake Tahoe Land Company, an equipment leasing business owned by David Duffield. The contract provides for equipment financing credit for purchases of information technology and related equipment for use in Workday's business operations. To date, Workday has borrowings outstanding of $3.8 million (the percentage rate of the loan hasn't been disclosed). Though not detailed, the wording of the documents also suggests that Workday is paying rent on space for unspecified office properties, too (lowned by Duffield?).\u2022 In January 2009, Workday entered into a consulting agreement with Nevada Pacific Consulting that employs the latter company to \"provide finance and administrative services to us on a part-time, as needed basis.\" As of January 31, 2012, Workday had paid a total of $114,000 in consulting fees. The owner of Nevada Pacific - one David Duffield.\u2022 Duffield's son Michael works as a general manager on Education & Government projects at Workday. He must be doing an impressive job, seeing that his cash compensation (salary plus bonus) jumped 54% year-over-year to $573,000 in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2012.\u2022 And, Amy Zeifang, Duffield's daughter, serves on a \"part-time basis\" as a director of Corporate Giving, the philanthropic arm of Workday. Her salary wasn't disclosed in any filings.To be sure, Duffield has done some good with all this money. According to published reports, through his Duffield Family Foundation, he and his wife have donated more than $290 million to \"Maddie's Fund,\" an animal welfare foundation named after his beloved schnauzer. Not exactly the Gates Foundation's war against polio, but every man gets to give away his wealth as he sees fit.Here's a link to the  take on the value of Workday stock.If Duffield and Aneel Bhusri botch things, good luck in firing them, Workday shareholders. The equity structure of the IPO provided both men with Class B shares - 10 votes per one vote for every share of Class A stock. This capital structure voids any possibility of a hostile takeover, reflecting lessons learned in the losing battle fought a decade ago to keep PeopleSoft out of the clutches of Larry Ellison's Oracle. Together, Duffield and Bhusri, control 67% of the voting power.In total, holders of Class B stock control approximately 98% of the voting power of outstanding stock. The list of such stockholders includes Bhusri's venture capital firm, Greylock Partners, current Workday executives and a board of directors with unflinching loyalty to Duffield (many of whom were lieutenants at the erstwhile PeopleSoft).Substantially all of the 137.5 million shares of Class B shares were purchased or optioned at prices ranging from a few dollars to $13.75 a share. These shares will become available for sale on or around April 15, 2013 (subject to \"lock-up\" terms). Given their pre-existing net worth, it's doubtful that Duffield or Bhusri (estimated wealth of about $2 billion) will look to flood the market with their shares.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nterprise cloud applications provider for human resource and finance,  recently announced third quarter fiscal 2013 results.
