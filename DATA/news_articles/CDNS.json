This strategy looks for stocks trading at a reasonable price relative to earnings growth that also possess strong balance sheets.CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC (CDNS) is a large-cap growth stock in the Software & Programming industry. The rating according to our strategy based on Peter Lynch is 93% based on the firm\u2019s underlying fundamentals and the stock\u2019s valuation. A score of 80% or above typically indicates that the strategy has some interest in the stock and a score above 90% typically indicates strong interest.Company Description: Cadence Design Systems, Inc. provides solutions that enable its customers to design electronic products. The Company's product categories include Functional Verification, Digital integrated circuits (IC) Design and Signoff, Custom IC Design and Verification, System Interconnect and Analysis, and intellectual property (IP). Functional verification products are used to verify that the circuitry or the software designed will perform as intended. Digital IC design offerings are used to create representations of a digital circuit or an IC that can be verified for correctness prior to implementation. Custom IC design and verification offerings are used to create schematic and physical representations of circuits down to the transistor level for analog and memory designs. System Interconnect and Analysis offerings are used to develop printed circuit boards and IC packages. Design IP offerings consist of functional blocks, which customers integrate into their ICs for the development process.The following table summarizes whether the stock meets each of this strategy's tests.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDNS options chain for the new June 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of 35 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $64.65 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDNS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $80.83/share today.\n\nBecause the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 20% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 92%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.54% return on the cash commitment, or 3.85% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND", "Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. \tFor the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQEW), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $76.97 per unit.\n\n\nWith QQEW trading at a recent price near $69.78 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.31% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.

The rating according to our strategy based on Peter Lynch is 93% based on the firm\u2019s underlying fundamentals and the stock\u2019s valuation.

The Company's product categories include Functional Verification, Digital integrated circuits (IC) Design and Signoff, Custom IC Design and Verification, System Interconnect and Analysis, and intellectual property (IP).

Digital IC design offerings are used to create representations of a digital circuit or an IC that can be verified for correctness prior to implementation. Custom IC design and verification offerings are used to create schematic and physical representations of circuits down to the transistor level for analog and memory designs. System Interconnect and Analysis offerings are used to develop printed circuit boards and IC packages. Design IP offerings consist of functional blocks, which customers integrate into their ICs for the development process.The following table summarizes whether the stock meets each of this strategy's tests.
