{"Content": ["Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. \tFor the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQEW), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $76.97 per unit.\n\n\nWith QQEW trading at a recent price near $69.78 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.31% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of QQEW's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Baidu Inc (Symbol: BIDU), Cadence Design Systems Inc (Symbol: CDNS), and Netflix Inc (Symbol: NFLX). Although BIDU has traded at a recent price of $97.13/share, the average analyst target is 50.08% higher at $145.78/share. Similarly, CDNS has 12.78% upside from the recent share price of $78.47 if the average analyst target price of $88.50/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting NFLX to reach a target price of $453.82/share, which is 12.38% above the recent price of $403.83. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of BIDU, CDNS, and NFLX:  \n\n   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n\nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.  \n\n\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", ["ikon search string for individual stock moves: The Day Ahead newsletter: The Morning News Call newsletter: The S&P 500 was trading flat on Tuesday, handing back some gains from a strong rally in the previous session, as investors digested a mixed set of quarterly results from retailers including Home Depot and Walmart.

For more details on this strategy, About Peter Lynch: Perhaps the greatest mutual fund manager of all-time, Lynch guided Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund to a 29.2 percent average annual return from 1977 until his retirement in 1990, almost doubling the S&P 500's 15.8 percent yearly return over that time. Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (\"Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,\" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch's bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a \"stocks for the everyman/everywoman\", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.About Validea: Validea is an  service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

The sector is typically dominated by players in the United States, South Korea, and Japan.China's government has committed billions of dollars to help fund the domestic semiconductor industry, which it views as critical to catching up with the United States and other governments.The stakes for such initiatives have increased after the United States imposed restrictions on American companies supplying to Huawei, China's top telecommunications eqiupment provider and a leading chip maker in its own right.Intel Capital has consistently invested in Chinese startups along with small chip companies from around the world. In 2019 and 2018 it announced investments in two Chinese chip startups.This batch of announced investments comes days after Intel CEO Bob Swan wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Defense expressing readiness to build a chip fab in the United States, with the goal of ensuring U.S. technological leadership.(Reporting by Josh Horwitz; Editing by Stephen Coates)((; +86 21 20830007;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: The Motley Fool.\u00a0Q1 2020 , Good afternoon.

Copies of today's press release dated April 20, 2020 for the quarter ended March 28, 2020, related financial tables and the CFO commentary are also available on our website. I would also like you to note that we are adhering to social distancing practices, and therefore, are conducting today's  from remote locations. Apologies in advance if there are glitches or hand-offs to take a little longer than usual.And now I will turn it over to Lip-Bu. -- Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that in the difficult environment Cadence achieved excellent financial results for the first quarter of 2020. We are all going through truly unprecedented times, and I hope that you and your families are safe and healthy.I will start by commenting on the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation. Our first priority continues to be ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities. At this time, the vast majority of our global employee base is working from home and that transition has gone very smoothly. On the business continuity perspective, our infrastructure, collaboration platforms and tight communication have enabled us to maintain a high level of productivity, and our R&D innovation projects and customer deliverables continue to track well.Our sales and application engineering teams have also adapted well with this new work model. And have continued engaging productively with customers on the business, training and support fronts. As I stated earlier, there has been a silicon renaissance in the industry with strong design activity being driven by generational technology drivers such as 5G, AI, hyperscale computing and industrial IoT. So far, even in the current environment, we do not see any slowdown in design activity. And I do believe this period to be an opportunity especially for market shaping customers to further invest in R&D and accelerate their innovation.Our business is predominantly tied to semiconductor R&D. And in addition, our broadly diversified customer base, over $3.7 billion of backlog and highly ratable business model, all serve to highlight the resiliency of our business, particularly in challenging times -- sorry, resilience of our business, particularly in challenging times.After careful accessing the situation, at this time, we feel comfortable reaffirming our revenue guidance for the year. In a few moments, John will provide more details and commentary on our Q1 results and guidance for Q2 and the year. Our Intelligent System Design strategy enables us to maximize these opportunities, while tripling our TAM through proliferation in our foundation Design Excellence segment and expanding beyond EDA into a system innovation and pervasive intelligence.Now, let us look at some of the Design Excellence highlights for the quarter, starting with digital and signoff. Our Cadence Digital Workflow, which has been proven to hundreds of advanced node tape-outs have significantly enhanced to further optimize power, performance and area or PPA results across multiple application areas. The new full-flow featuring our innovative iSpatial technology, which includes unified placement and physical optimization engines, plus machine learning capabilities, delivers up to three times faster throughput and up to 20% improved PPA. The new full-flow is being used by several leading customers and was endorsed by MediaTek and Samsung Electronics.Additional digital and signoff highlights for the quarter include a major Asian hyperscale company successfully used Cadence digital full-flow to tape-out a machine learning inferencing chip, and is deploying full-flow at 7-nanometers and 5-nanometers. A marquee Asian electronics system company completed its first production Cadence digital full-flow tape-outs on 5-nanometer low power process, hitting its power targets. And a market-shaping semiconductor automotive customer committed to Cadence as its primary EDA vendor or digital design.Our Cadence Verification Suite wins in the marketplace because it delivers the best verification throughput driven by its four pairs of class engines; Xcelium, Jasper, Palladium and Protium. In Q1, we had multiple verification wins across various verticals, including cloud, data center, automotive and networking. Our hardware family had a better quarter with Palladium Z1 adding four new customers and nine major expansions. Our Protium FPGA-based prototyping platform continued its strong momentum, adding six new customers and six repeat orders as the X1 is increasingly deployed in Palladium accounts.Protium's X1 strong momentum is a result of its unique differentiation and having a common front-end compiler with the Palladium Z1. That also provide superior performance and a positive scalability for earlier software development and hardware equation. Both the Z1 and X1 platforms show a particular rank at hyperscale system companies. In addition to momentum at market-shaping semiconductor customers.Our IP business delivered double-digit revenue growth as our compelling offerings continue to benefit from the ongoing IP outsourcing trend with design wins and expansions at several uptier customer companies as well as products. Tensilica did particularly well and was adopted for multiple audio applications as well as by surveillance and mobile customers. In design IP, there was a strong demand for our DDR our portfolio as well as our high-speed SerDes and PCIe IP, particularly in data center, AI and high performance computing segments.Now I will highlight our progress in system innovation segment of our Intelligent System Design strategy. Earlier this year, we completed the acquisitions of AWR and Integrand. And we have received very positive response through the acquisitions from many of our partners and potential new customers. The integration is progressing well on all fronts, and we are combining this technology with our Virtuoso and Allegro platforms, which will enable us to offer a comprehensive platform for designing high frequency RF millimeter wave products.Our system analysis tools carry forward their strong momentum into the new year, and we now have more than 30 customers, including Renesas, Rohm, and Enflame. In addition to providing significant better performance and capacity without compromising accuracy. Clarity and Celsius also provide a tighter integration with our flagship Virtuoso and Allegro design platform.With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide an updated outlook. -- Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin with a few comments on the COVID-19 pandemic. Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees, partners and customers. And while some of our employees in China are already back working from our Cadence offices in the region, a vast majority of our global workforce are currently working in a remote environment. Our team continues to be very effective, even though many are working from home. For this, we are very proud and very grateful. Even with the global disruption and uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am pleased to report we met or exceeded all of our key operating metrics in Q1.Now let's review the key results for the first quarter, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $618 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32.2%. GAAP EPS was $0.44 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.60.Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. In mid-March, we borrowed $350 million under our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to provide additional liquidity in light of the recent global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, at the end of the quarter, our cash balance totaled $946 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $700 million. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $218 million, DSOs were 42 days, and during Q1, we repurchased $100 million of Cadence shares.Before I provide our guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2020, I'd like to take a moment to address some points that I think are important to understanding the assumptions embedded in our outlook. Our guidance continues to assume that the export limitations that exist today for certain customers remain in place for all of 2020. The shelter-in-place orders that are in effect today as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, creates some logistical challenges related to fulfilling some hardware and IP product orders, for which we recognized upfront revenue upon completion of delivery.At the low-end of our revenue range for Q2, we are assuming that the government mandated a recommended shelter-in-place orders, in effect today, will remain in place for the remainder of the quarter. And any hardware or IP products that we cannot deliver before the end of our Q2 will be delivered in the second half of the year.On the other hand, if starting some time in May, we can get sufficient physical access to complete hardware and IP deliveries, we expect to be closer to the high-end of our revenue range for Q2. Assuming we have sufficient physical access to complete hardware and IP deliveries by the end of Q3, we do not expect any negative impact to our full year guidance from the delivery delays we are assuming for Q2.For Q2, our guidance is as follows. Revenue in the range of $580 million to $600 million, non-GAAP operating margin of 30%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.28 to $0.32, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.54 and we expect to repurchase $75 million of Cadence shares. For fiscal 2020, our guidance is as follows. Revenue in the range of $2.545 billion to $2.585 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of 32% to 33%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.58 to $1.68; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.40 to $2.50; we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $775 million to $825 million and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2020. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.In summary, I am pleased with the results we delivered in Q1 and I have been impressed by the resilience of our business model and the agility and capability of our global team at Cadence to continue to operate so effectively in this environment. The world is facing unprecedented times and we are all deeply sympathetic to anyone who has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.We are clearly all in this together. So I would like to close by thanking our customers, partners and our hardworking employees for all that they do. Please note that we are adhering to social distancing practices and therefore are conducting today's  from remote locations. My apologies in advance if there are glitches or hand-offs, it will take a little longer than usual.And with that, operator, we'll now take questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Valera from Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, and congratulations to the Cadence team for delivering some very solid results in obviously challenging conditions. With that, I just wanted to ask about your China revenue in the quarter, which was actually up as a percentage of revenue year-over-year despite a very tough comp since last year, you didn't have the entity list restrictions on Huawei or several other likely Chinese customers. So just wondering if you talk about what drove the strength in China this quarter? Was it new customers? Was it sort of a ramp in demand from existing customers? And if there is any color in terms of which products were in high demand there? -- Yeah. Mitch, Lip-Bu here. So let me start. This has enabled design of future electronic products. Our China business remained quite good for us. Q1 was aided by both hardware and IP business, which was mostly upfront revenue, and John can provide more color in detail here. -- Yeah. Mitch, I would say this is unusual. Our China revenue over the past nine quarters is fluctuated between a low of 8% back in Q2 2018 and a high of 13% both this quarter and in Q4 '18. Q1 revenue was higher due to both hardware and IP business, which are mostly upfront for revenue. -- Great. New system product ramp, I heard your new customer count, it sounds like that's up to 30, which is great. Just wondering if you can provide any anecdotal evidence of customers that have ordered a single license, have proved it out, then will come back to order multiple license, and if you've seen any customer sort of scaling up the way presumably you'd like to see? -- Yeah. I think so far, I think we are very pleased with our system analysis tool that carry momentum into Q1. As you've already pointed out, we have more than 30 customers under Clarity and Celsius product line. And clearly, I think we're providing high performance better result and then the scalability and then not compromising any accuracy. -- Great. And just quick -- one quick one for you, John. I noticed your non-GAAP EPS stayed the same, but you're GAAP EPS actually went up. Any -- can you just quickly explain the delta there? -- Yeah. Just a slight difference in our assumptions for the M&A integration between what we had in the forecast at the start of the year and where we are now. -- Got it. Okay. Thanks very much, gentlemen. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. A couple of questions. First on China and geographic mix generally. According to the 10-Q, this evening your China revenues were a record at about $84 million, you explained the reasons why it was so strong. But looking out over the next number of years and thinking about all the issues that surrounded China over the last year and where U.S. government policy may go, how are you thinking about perhaps geographic risk mitigation, again notwithstanding the very good results in China this quarter. How do you think about perhaps mitigating the dependency there by perhaps focusing on other parts of the world. Europe, for instance, had a very strong year in 2019 for EDA. So perhaps that would be a region to think about refocusing on, as an example. So that's question number one.Question number two. You highlighted the newer products; Clarity and Celsius. How would you compare your experience thus far with those two products with the previous generation of [Indecipherable] products, Tempus, Voltus, Pegasus, which we frankly haven't heard a great deal about. Is your experience in terms of customer adoption meaningfully different or would you expect it to be different than the prior generation of signoff tools that you introduced? -- Yeah. So let me get started, and then John can fill in more details. So first of all, I think we were expected to do everything we can to support customer. But in our complying with all the application law and regulations and we want to provide the best tool for our global customers that include China, Asia Pacific, EMEA and the U.S., But that is all philosophy, given the best product and the support them in their design.And in terms of the new products, clearly I think we are very pleased with the system analysis products, a tool that came out and clearly shows the differentiation. And we are delighted that quarter-by-quarter we have more and more customers coming with us. It's a big end market for us. These two products, the TAM is about $700 million. So I think we will aggressively pursue that, and clearly we have a big advantage in terms of performance.Now in terms of the Voltus and Pegasus, they continue to do well, and then we will continue to update you from time to time. Pegasus are most important with the foundries, make sure that there are various process nodes, 35. And I think over the last few quarters we highlight a couple of process nodes at different foundries have been certified. And now we are starting to really driving somewhat the customer success and then stay tuned in the coming quarters. -- Yeah. And Jay, I would add to that I think you can see from our results and from our guidance for the year that our business benefits from the diversification we see across products and platforms and geographies that -- and as much as we encourage investors not look at any one quarter, I mean, China contributed 10% of our annual revenue in 2018 and 2019 and we're happy to get off to a strong start for 2020. But hardware and IP are lumpy for revenue. And so you should never focus on any one single quarter. -- Okay. Just a quick detailed question for you, John. If I'm reading the Q correctly, it looks like you took some inventory reserve on the hardware. If so, could you comment on that? -- Jay, I presume you're referring to the section where we say we have COGS? -- Yes. -- If there is any significant change in inventory reserves from quarter-to-quarter. But generally, if we have a hardware system that's out being demoed are on loan, we'll take depreciation or amortization for that into our P&L and include it in COGS even though we haven't sold it yet. -- Very good. Thank you. -- Okay. Your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I really had two. The first one is a little bit more for Lip-Bu. When I look at your comments about design activity, some of the checks, at least we're picking up is that they're trying to actually accelerate the design activity. So can you maybe give us a little bit of a broad overview of what you're seeing in China and in data centers, and I guess any sort of way you want to splice at the market in terms of what design activities are looking like across the different end markets or however you want to do the verticals? -- Yeah. So let me try to give you a bit more color. As I mentioned earlier, we are going [Technical Issues] renaissance in the industry. Clearly we see strong design activity driven by generational technology driver like the 5G and in the RF front and in the AI and machine learning, across different platform. And then the hyperscale, in this environment, actually they deploy even more and they are all finally building up their own silicon team. And then the whole digital transformation of the industrial group, we see a lot of -- so, I think clearly, so far as we see today, we don't see any slowdown in activity, especially I call it the market-shaping customer, they double down, triple down in their R&D and we're delighted to support them and that's kind of we see the opportunity in the design activity. And in some ways, our business are very much predominantly tied with the semiconductor R&D and that will benefit us. And then we have been very focused on the market-shaping customer and they have been really -- we are very excited to support them in all their various designs. -- Got it. And then second one is for John, just a little more on the financials. So China is up pretty significantly. Is there any way to talk about if that's just going to be sustainable, or if that's some pull-in from hardware? I mean, what do you guys think about the China percentage of revenue? I think that was a little bit surprising, but maybe -- you can maybe give us maybe a high-level of comment on what a full-year should look like if it should be around that type of revenue percentage or not? -- Sure. Yeah. I mean we -- it was large in the first quarter and it was mainly due to hardware and IP business -- IP revenue business. At the start of the quarter -- I mean, I think it's IP that surprised me in Q1 to the upside. At the start of the quarter, we thought that we would have lower royalty revenue in the region and we were a bit too conservative in Q1, I think. So, IP outperformed based on my expectations for Q1.And then in terms of China for the year, like I said, it's ranged by quarter from a low of 8% in Q2 '18 to a high of 13% now this quarter and as well back in Q4 '18. But we're happy to get off to a strong start for 2020 and I'm thinking double digits in terms of -- continuing at least double digits with China contribution to our annual revenue is reasonable. -- Okay, perfect. Thank you. I don't know how you guys can do much better than that. So a great quarter. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on solid results. John, you did a good job with the June quarter revenue guide kind of helping us understand the puts and takes around COVID between the low-end and the high-end of the range. But I'm just kind of curious, was there any absolute impact to June revenue from COVID that you've also included, because even at the high-end, you're coming in sort of below where the Street was. And then when you look at the full-year number, would you have raised the full-year revenue outlook, had it not been for COVID, i.e., are you building in some cushion on an absolute dollar basis there as well? -- Thanks, John. Thanks for the question. It's a great question and thanks for the opportunity to clarify that. I guess, when I sit and look at Q2, I think it's fair to view our guidance for Q2 was being a little bit conservative and maybe more conservative than normal. But when I look at the impact of COVID-19 on our revenue, that's like for hardware, we don't have our usual physical access to customer sites to deliver product. And then it's hard to predict when we'll get that access, but if we deliver some hardware in the last week of June, it becomes Q2 revenue. If we deliver a hardware -- if those hardware products slipped to the first weeks of July, it's Q3 revenue. In both cases, they're 2020 revenue. So, I have more confidence in the year than I do for Q2, in terms of making those deliveries in time to fit Q2 revenue. When we said that we're prioritizing the health and safety of our employees and our partners and our customers, we don't want to try and drive for too early delivery, and particularly, if we don't have physical access. We can't control if we don't have physical access to a customer site.On the IP side, the physical access is to our own Cadence sites, because that's where our labs are for IP. And an IP revenue is generally determined by just how much IP we can deliver in the quarter from our labs. We're already a little bit behind because we haven't had access to our labs. And it's not like a demand issue, it's one of timing in terms of the delivery of revenue. But -- and then, so like I say, Q2 is, I suppose, the paradox of having a predictable revenue stream, it's very predictable for the year, but it's just less predictable in terms of what we can get done in June versus July at the current moment. -- No. That's helpful. And then, Lip-Bu, maybe you can help me better understand, a lot of this out here are trying to figure out how the next several quarters might play out for the overall semi industry and for better or worse, we're kind of using the global financial crisis as a starting point, but there are some significant differences. But when I go back and look at Cadence's performance through the global financial crisis, you were going through sort of an accounting change, which I think heightened sort of the volatility through that. But you also saw a situation where things got bad enough where customers were cutting sort of R&D. And, I guess, just given sort of the magnitude of the economic impact we're all expecting from COVID, why shouldn't that be kind of a baseline assumption as we go into the back half of the year? Or are there enough sort of incremental drivers like hyperscale that really didn't exist back during the global financial crisis or China that didn't really exist that you think offsets that because right now, at least how you're playing out the year, is June is sort of the trough in revenue and it's a pretty shallow trough? And I understand the business is just a lot more predictable than the global financial crisis, but what other puts and takes do you see out there? -- Yeah. So couple of things, I think, clearly, the -- we are going through an unprecedented time and -- in terms of economy and unemployment and this virus across all the different [Technical Issues]. First of all, I think most important for us [Technical Issues] employee and customer safety and well-being. And on saying that, I think clearly the impact to the economy in the semiconductor is really range on product to products. Clearly, the hyperscale and a video conference-related area and then e-commerce and -- area, I think is really benefit and some of the sector will be a little bit harder and especially in the consumer area and also in terms of the automotive-related area will be more challenging. And so, I think it's not across the board. I mean, there are some very exciting area. And then clearly, I think we are more [Technical Issues] budget. And so, I think good news is all the market-shaping customers in various hyperscale player and in various high computing area, we see the benefit of it and especially that infrastructure side. And so, I think the part we continue to benefit and we took a little bit [Phonetic] down on it. And then clearly, you cannot look at quarter-by-quarter, some quarter may be a little bit more in China, some areas maybe geographically higher. Overall, I think we have a very, strong in the resiliency of our business and also the backlog [Technical Issues] that really put Cadence in the very well position for doing that. -- And then lastly, just as a follow-on. There was a couple of earlier questions that touched upon the strength in China and it was up nicely, albeit it seems to make sense relative to the ambition that the Chinese semiconductor industry has. But I'm just kind of curious, given the heightened rhetoric around US-China relations and the idea that the US might actually make foundries for licenses to ship to certain customers. Is there a risk that some of your Chinese customers are buying ahead and how would you handicap that risk or how would you help us think about that? -- Yeah. It's a good question. Overall, I would say that, China business remain quite good for us. And then I'd like John mentioned earlier, we assume the export restriction will remain and we comply to that and then meanwhile, we are doing everything we can to support the customer globally. And then for -- all their new innovating design. And so, I think overall, I think, we have a careful assessment of the situation. We felt that we can reaffirm the whole year because it's a ratable model and we have a very $3.7 billion of backlogs. And so, we can manage much better that way and again by partnering with customer deeply and then be their trusted partner and work with them, and that is the best way to really drive the success together. -- And John, this is John here. I'd just like to add to that, but 85% to 90% of our revenue is recurring in nature. So, any additional -- or kind of any pull forward buying wouldn't increase our revenue. But the revenue is time-based, that would occur maybe on IP and hardware and there was no evidence of that in Q1. -- Perfect. Thanks, guys. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Gary Mosley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question in the mix. And my congratulations on the strong results as well. Wanted to start out asking a follow-up question to John's line of question about what's different this time versus the financial crisis of '08 and '09? And just thinking about how you diversify your customer base to include system OEMs. I see your backlog metrics continue to grow about 15% year-over-year, much faster than revenue growth. Is it the new class of system OEMs who are taking control their own IC designs, the leading driver of that growth and as well are the average deal sizes for system OEMs materially different than what you would traditionally license to merchant IC customers? -- Okay. Gary, I think, good question. So let me touch on the first and then John can give you more detail on the deal size and others. And so, I think overall we are excited about this generation of technology drivers [Technical Issues] 5G is deploying. And then the hyperscale and the infrastructure is already deploying. And then the other part is also the high computing area for AI, machine learning, either it's a start-up or mature big company, they are all diving in big time into the whole -- or just semiconductor silicon also to the whole system level. So the packaging also we benefit from it. And so, I think all in all, I think we see strong design activity. It doesn't slow down at all. And then clearly, we continue to build the backlog because of the ratable business. And so, they will not be depend on quarter-to-quarter. So far their model have worked out very well for us. -- Guys, I had a follow-up question. -- Oh, sorry. Gary, just adding there, but I think the biggest difference between where we are now and where we were back in '08, '09, is that -- I mean, we have incredible visibility now into our backlog. I mean, we've got $3.7 billion worth of backlog, we're very, very diversified. And we have a lot of visibility into the second half of 2020. -- Okay. And in the last -- the last time you gave fiscal year '20 guidance, I believe you mentioned that the extra week in the fiscal year and the two acquisitions recently closed on were adding in some about 300 basis points to the 10% growth you were expecting. I presume the week -- extra week impact doesn't change, but are you still looking for the same amount of contribution from the acquisitions? -- Yeah. So, Gary, it's about $40 million. The extra week is worth about $40 million of additional recurring revenue to the year in 2020, and we're expecting about $20 million from the combination of AWR and Integrand, the two acquisitions we completed in early Q1. So, yeah, $60 million to the year. Yeah. I'm not expecting any more or less than that for the year right now. -- Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.Your next question comes from Joe Vruwink from Baird. Please go ahead. -- Great. Hello, everyone. Just in regards to some of the product discussion and the new product offerings. Is it possible to say with things like full digital flow or maybe the case of adding simulation to Allegro or Virtuoso workflows. How much this is increasing average contract value with the customer versus maybe a traditional measure, I'd say, wallet share with your customers? -- Yeah. It's very difficult to bifurcate. -- Okay. So, no sense other than like on simulation, it's hopeful to maybe define that as a $700 million opportunity between Clarity and Celsius but other than that, no sort of uplift guidance maybe you can provide? -- Well, I think it's too early to tell right now. But certainly, I mean, it's very welcomed by our customers and our customers are very happy with the products we've provided. But it's very difficult to kind of bifurcate the value of one product versus others in an arrangement where there is multiple products being provided to customers. -- Okay. -- But the only thing I'd add on to that is basically, with these two acquisitions, clearly give us a lot of more opportunity in terms of more comprehensive solution to provide to some of our key customers. -- Okay, great. And on your operating margin outlook for the year, I believe the second half is implied to be closer to the 34% level. Is that really just a reflection of the revenue guidance, and maybe the particular revenue mix that you anticipate for the back half of the year? Or are there may be some other opex items or costs that are more in your control that factor into this view as well? -- Yeah. There's two real drivers there, Joe. One is the M&A that we lost some of the revenue in the purchase accounting -- lost some of the deferred revenue and purchase accounting. It impacts the first half of the year more than the second half of the year. So kind of skew some profitability toward the second half of the year on the acquisitions we brought in at the start of the year.And then, I guess, the other impact is because we're assuming some deliveries that would normally happen in Q2 fall over into Q3, but you kind of have a slightly more back-end loaded margin profile for the year. I mean, originally, I was thinking it would probably work out something like 31.5% and 33.5% and now, I know we're guiding to 31% and 34%. -- Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you. -- Okay.Your next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. -- Yes, good afternoon. So, John, you talked about how access to customers provide a little bit of conservatism in your second quarter outlook. But I'm curious, what are you seeing on the actual manufacturing front with emulation. Are you seeing any supply chain difficulties? -- No, not right now. I mean, we have a strategic sourcing group that have been working closely with all our suppliers. We think we have ample inventory and we have good second source suppliers. The issue we have with revenue and predicting revenue for Q2 is really down to whether we can have physical access to customer sites to be able to deliver the physical product. I mean, that's where we've got some uncertainty and because of the uncertainty, I'm assuming some of that will naturally fall into the second half of the year. -- Yeah. That makes sense. And then Lip-Bu, I'm curious through this crisis, have you seen or do your customers talking about acceleration to the cloud. -- Yeah. So I think clearly, we will provide our team [Phonetic] multiple way and then cloud is one of the big areas that we focus on. We are delighted that we are clearly extending our leadership in the cloud offering, providing customers with compelling productivity, flexibility and scalability benefits. And so, we mentioned that we passed 100 customer mark. And so, I think we're continuing to make progress on that. -- Okay. Is that bigger on the emulation side or on the design tools side? -- I think that's across multiple different products and will depend on the product offering we will provide them. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. Congrats on some results and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on some of the comments that my peers have made on your China sales and how strongly they have grown. Can you talk about the availability of domestic substitutes in the region and how far behind China is an EDA in terms of being able to provide a complete competitive full flow suite of products? Thanks. -- Yeah. I think so far we -- and now we are monitoring closely. In China there is now a couple of small top point [Phonetic] tool solutions provider. And clearly, from Synopsys and Cadence we grew 25, 30 years of simulating and providing -- able to provide a full flow and the most advanced nodes. But clearly, we don't underestimate that because clearly they get a lot of government funding. And so, we keep a very close eye on that. And not only from their progress and also from their recruitment point of view and make sure that our team is committed with us and then we can continue driving the R&D China, Beijing, Shanghai side. -- Great. And my follow-up is on the Digital IC design and Signoff segment. I saw there has been a deceleration in year-on-year sales growth over the last three or four quarters. I don't know if that's just a rounding error with the percentage of sales that you give. But is the deceleration just a function of tougher comps or is it the timing of bookings? Do you expect that -- the trends in that segment to turn around in the near-term? Thanks. -- So, Adam, one thing I would point out is, certainly for Q1 and Q2 this year, we're lapping very tough comps because Q1 and Q2 last year were not impacted by the export limitations we currently have in China. -- That makes sense. And if I can sneak in one last question. You talked about the Q2 outlook and how it really reflects just a few different scenarios and how long you have -- or whether or not you have access to customer facilities. If these work from home orders were to be put in place longer than people currently think, is there a chance that customers might switch their consumption of these hardware products more to a cloud-based model? -- I think it's too early to tell. We were quite happy that we had a really solid bookings quarter in Q1 with particular strength in Japan. And I think we had 15 new Cadence customers in Q1, including several larger customers, but I think it's too early to tell right now. But, yeah, I don't think that's as much we can say. -- Okay. Thank you.Your next question comes from Jackson Ader with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. The first is, I realize that the impact on revenue is just about logistically getting on site. But what about the difficulties or maybe some execution challenges you've had on getting deals across the finish line maybe for software deals? I would expect or I think a lot of people would expect that there would be more moving pieces for larger deals, just moving around internally at your customers with everybody working from home. So I'm curious to hear whether you've seen any impacts on that side. -- So, Jackson, our ability to close business hasn't changed. But we have very, very close contacts with our customers, very customer-driven Company. We always stay close to our clients. But -- and also I think we got a little bit lucky. I mean, toward the end of last year, Lip-Bu and I talk with the management team and we looked at -- when there was a yield curve inversion back in August, we looked at the data for previous recessions and the data suggested that a recession often happens within eight to 14 months following a yield curve inversion. So, at the end of last year, we made our business to try and close as much strategic account business early in the year as possible and we managed to do that. -- Excellent. Thanks for the color. And then the follow-up question on, is it possible that there could be maybe any trickle down effects from the delayed either hardware or IP delivery? Would that change maybe activity later in the year if people aren't able to get their tools in time? -- So basically, the delivery -- I don't think we've had any problem with closing business. The challenge is being in executing and delivering the -- completing the delivery on the business, demand continues to be strong. The -- and it's just really getting access to a customer's facility to be able to deliver hardware. And in our case, in the IP case, getting access to our own facility into the Cadence labs to complete our IP deliveries that we've already contractually signed up to. -- Okay. Thank you.Your next question comes from Ruben Roy with Benchmark. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. John, you've had a lot of questions on China and I think I understand the near-term dynamics but I was wondering if you could refresh my memory on export restrictions. Obviously, there has been some chatter in recent weeks around potentially tightening rules for some sorts of high-technology product shipments into, not just current entity list companies in China, but potentially to a broader swath of Chinese firms. And I'm wondering if you can remind us what portions of your product line-up are subject to experts restrictions. Are the hardware and IP products some or all subject to those restrictions or if you've heard anything new on potentially tighter rules for your product specifically? Thanks. -- Well, most of our products are US origin. So, they're impacted by the export limitations. Our ability to deliver products and services to certain customers the entry list is limited. So, therefore, we would expect our revenue in China to be higher, if we didn't have those extra limitations. But for the purposes of guidance, we just did our assumptions that we assume nothing will change. And right now, like I say, because most of our technology is US origin, we are impacted by those export limitations across the board. -- All right. Okay. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, John, on sort of the assumptions. You walked through the assumptions on how to think about Q2 guidance flow into high-end on the potential of getting back to work. How are you thinking about your own operating expenses and margins? Obviously, you kept your clear guidance static, but do you have any embedded assumptions in sort of when you expect things to normalize if there will be a normalized coming up embedded in those assumptions for the year? -- Yeah. Sure. I mean, that effectively we're continuing to hire. The -- although, hiring had slowed because it's more difficult to complete the whole interview process and the onboarding process. But we're continuing to hire and typically, we hire after getting contractual commitments from customers. But Lip-Bu and I are very careful about adding investment dollars until we see the commitment from customers.So, in our guidance, the -- there is impact, of course, with -- if hardware falls into the second half from the first half, the cost of goods sold associated with those hardware products will also fall into the second half. Originally, I was expecting like 31.5% margin in the first half of the year followed by 33.5% margin in the second half, that's more skewed now toward 31% first half, 34% second half because of an unexpected shift of some hardware and IP revenue from Q2 into Q3 really. -- Got it. It's very helpful. Thanks, John. -- Okay.Your next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. In terms of operations in China, obviously, those were impacted from kind of the coronavirus first and global workforce. What types of learnings were you able to apply to your other segments in North America and Europe once you saw kind of those restrictions put in place? -- So one thing I learned is, I mean, last quarter I thought there would have been a bigger impact to our royalty revenue and as it turned out, it wasn't as big as an impact as I thought because in some cases some products do better and some products do worse. But -- and I think we benefit from the diversification across our products and platforms.Another thing we learned is that, there is a lead time, I guess, in terms of hardware orders that we were able to complete hardware orders in the latter part of the quarter in China because the hardware was already on site and being demoed by the customer. So, we didn't have any additional physical delivery to complete the revenue cycle to be able to take revenue. Whereas if we haven't got the hardware on site for the customer, we have to wait for the customer sites to open. So that was the learning that we had, and therefore, the impact to our Q2, you see that in our Q2 guidance. We're expecting that some revenue, we would normally be taking in Q2, we're expecting to fall into Q3 now. -- Got you. Okay. So from a progress standpoint, customer engagement standpoint, is there anything else that mirrors or differs from what you saw in China customers versus North America or Europe? -- I don't think so. I think we're a Company that operates in -- like in the technology industry and we can never predict the future [Phonetic]. But we always assume -- we are working in an industry where we always assume that tomorrow will be very different from today. And so, we operate very, very closely with our customers and that close client relationship allows us to be resilient, flexible and agile and very, very effective in times of change. I think we are also very diverse. We have people in 47 sites across 22 countries, all very, very close with our customers. So, we're able to navigate with change. We're able to move with change very easily. And I'm delighted with how effective the teams have been. -- Okay. Thanks, John. I appreciate it.Your last question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of them mainly for John. John, thanks for all the colors on the China sales. I was just trying to figure out, you said some of the outperformance was in IP in China. Within IP, can you say was it more on the could data center, was it mobile, was it auto, any color would be helpful? -- It was certainly on the IP side, but I don't think we give any further color in terms of which part of IP, but IP was very strong in Q1 and we were delayed with that. -- Got it. Go it. And then, obviously, some of your emulation and prototyping hardware is assembled and tested by the subcontractors. Which specific geographies are you subcons in right now? -- So, most of our hardware is made in the US, in the Americas. But, yeah, and we have very close relationships with our suppliers, we second-source suppliers. We also have ample inventory. I don't think we have any supply chain issues. -- Got it. Got it. And then just a final question, I'm guessing it's not an issue but if you look across your whole customer spectrum, if you look at some of the smaller customers, do you worry about potential payment issues for them in the second half or so if the economy goes into recession? -- That's a very good point. In our guidance we're anticipating some natural credit deterioration and particularly in the longer tail of customers we've said many times in the past that our top 40 customers we generate 55% to 60% of our revenue from those customers and thankfully, they're in a very strong position. Many of them really like a who's who have the strongest balance sheets in the world. But in the longer tail there, naturally, we would be concerned about some credit deterioration. So, we built in some anticipation for natural credit deterioration in the long tail. But now if the shelter in place order remains in place for much longer than the end of Q2 and we don't improvement in the second half, that could impact the businesses of our customers and our customer's customers and cause credit quality to deteriorate more than we're currently anticipating, I haven't got that -- I haven't anticipated a great depression or anything. But we have assumed that there may be some credit deterioration if this last through the end of June, and that's all. I mean, we can't predict the future. I can only share with you what's in our assumptions. -- Got it. Got it. Can you quantify that credit deterioration or... -- It's only slight -- like you say, it's may be kind of 5% to 10% slower payments because that could impact our revenue timing because you become more variable -- you have variable consideration. So, we have a typical recurring revenue pool, but -- and if you assume everyone is credit worthy, that's very even every quarter. If there's any credit deterioration, that can cause a little bit of a delay because you have to wait until you collect cash to recognize revenue. -- Got it. Thanks a lot, John. Thank you. -- No worries.There are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Lip-Bu for closing remarks. -- Thank you all for joining us this afternoon.

For more details on this strategy, About Peter Lynch: Perhaps the greatest mutual fund manager of all-time, Lynch guided Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund to a 29.2 percent average annual return from 1977 until his retirement in 1990, almost doubling the S&P 500's 15.8 percent yearly return over that time. Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (\"Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,\" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch's bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a \"stocks for the everyman/everywoman\", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.About Validea: Validea is an  service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

Three of SPHB's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (Symbol: HPE), Cadence Design Systems Inc (Symbol: CDNS), and Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS). Although HPE has traded at a recent price of $14.18/share, the average analyst target is 21.51% higher at $17.23/share. Similarly, CDNS has 17.26% upside from the recent share price of $74.73 if the average analyst target price of $87.62/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SNPS to reach a target price of $173.22/share, which is 16.00% above the recent price of $149.33.

Each has one more thing in common: they all require software to act as the engine keeping them ticking along. Take this idea one step further and it stands to reason that the companies providing software solutions to the tech pioneers will benefit from the new paradigm.Baird analyst  recently pulled the trigger on 2 software stocks, initiating coverage on both. As Baird is ranked second on the list of , it\u2019s worth taking heed when one of the firm\u2019s analysts gets the ball rolling on a new stock.Furthermore, we ran both tickers through the  at TipRanks to confirm that Baird is in the majority on Wall Street in recommending these equities. Here\u2019s what you need to know about them.Let\u2019s start off with Synopsys, a company that provides software and intellectual property solutions for the design and testing of chips (integrated circuits) and computer systems. The company\u2019s technology is present in self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT) consumer products.Synopsys stock has been on an almost constant upward trajectory since 2016, culminating in 2019\u2019s market beating 69% gain. The performance has stretched further into 2020, too; Synopsys\u2019 share price is up by 17% year-to-date.Last year\u2019s share price performance was reflected in its business operations, as well; in fiscal 2019, sales grew to $3.4 billion, compared to the previous year\u2019s $3.1 billion. The company expects revenue for fiscal 2020 to come in at around $3.6 billion.Synopsys is the largest provider of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools in the US. EDA is a major component in chip development and its workflows, with the EDA industry\u2019s growth closely aligned with broader semiconductor R&D growth. Following a lean year in 2019, R&D spending looks ready to ramp up again in 2020. As Synopsys is at the forefront of digital design and verificationand most of its clients are in the semiconductor industry, it stands to benefit from these development activities.Baird\u2019s Joseph Vruwink highlights the company\u2019s impressive 2019 and urges investors not to miss an \u201cencore in 2020.\" Additionally, the analyst notes accelerating EDA growth, broadening IP opportunity and rising margins are reasons to remain positive on the stock.Vruwink said, \u201cWith customers set to accelerate R&D spend during 2020-21 and product innovation creating more avenues for secular growth, Synopsys is positioned to deliver attractive combination of revenue growth (HSD+) and margin expansion (500bp+ opportunity). We believe Fiscal 2020 through 2022 should see operating margin expand from ~25% toward ~30% as Synopsys leverages the significant investment in headcount and personnel-related costs (both organic and inorganic) that took place during recent years.\u201dAll of the above led Vruwink to initiate coverage on Synopsys with an Outperform rating along with a price target of $190. Should the target be met, investors stand to take home returns in the shape of 14%. (To watch Vruwink\u2019s track record, )A full house of Buys \u2013 10, in fact \u2013 provides the software designer with a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street. The average price target comes in at $169.10 and indicates modest upside of 2%. ()Not to be outdone by Synopsys, fellow EDA software provider Cadence Design Systems has been beating the market, too. The company\u2019s share price is up by 13% year-to-date and continues last year\u2019s excellent performance (the stock rose by 63% in 2019). Investors were buoyed by Cadence\u2019s innovative tech offering, solid financials and long-term growth prospects. Having said that, investors are not the only ones impressed with the San Jose-based company. For the sixth consecutive year, Cadence made Fortune\u2019s list of 100 Best Companies to Work For.The company is also aiming for further expansion outside of its traditional EDA market. Using its technical capabilities, Cadence is pursuing solutions for hardware/software integration and system analysis, focusing on two areas in particular- simulation and embedded security. Vruwink points out that individually, each area has grown at a double digit rate this cycle and provides a multi-billion dollar TAM (total addressable market) opportunity. Add this to an EDA market expected to gain by high single digits, and the two form the basis for the company\u2019s TAM expansion strategy over the next 5-10 years.Vruwink sees targeted IP growth, TAM expansion and acceleration in its core EDA business as key drivers for Cadence this year.The analyst said, \u201cWe believe the company is well positioned to outperform in 2020 through a combination of accelerating customer development activity (+ for EDA tools), strong IP momentum (including AI/ML, auto, communications) and continued success in growing system-level tools. We view valuation as reasonable in comparison to other design peers with potential for further re-rating as company executes on secular growth opportunity/ TAM expansion while sustaining strong profitability.\u201dBottom-line, then? Vruwink initiated coverage of Cadence with an Outperform rating. In addition, the analyst set the price target at $93, indicating potential upside of 16%.Out on the Street, Cadence\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 7 Buys and 2 Holds. With an average price target of $86.89, analysts expect the next 12 months to provide investors with 9% upside.

For more details on this strategy, About Peter Lynch: Perhaps the greatest mutual fund manager of all-time, Lynch guided Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund to a 29.2 percent average annual return from 1977 until his retirement in 1990, almost doubling the S&P 500's 15.8 percent yearly return over that time. Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (\"Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,\" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.)

Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered a strong Q4, achieved excellent operating results for the year. For 2019, amid environmental headwinds, we delivered 9% year-over-year revenue growth and 32% non-GAAP operating margin with strength across our product lines. John will provide more details shortly.Macro uncertainty and geopolitical headwinds persists into 2020, but strong design activity continues at both advanced nodes as well as More and Moore front. This is being driven by generational technology drivers, 5G, AI and machine learning, hyperscale computing, industrial IoT and autonomous vehicles, which have all have semiconductors at our foundation and are propelling the need for next-generation computing, connectivity and storage.I believe these trends, in addition to system companies developing custom silicon, domain specific processing, computing, silicon start-ups and digital transformation of vertical segments like industrial, and aerospace and defense will continue to fuel silicon renaissance over the next few years.In 2019, we unveiled our intelligent system design strategy that will enable us to maximize these opportunities while tripling our TAM through proliferation in foundational Design Excellence segment and expanding beyond EDA into a system innovation and pervasive intelligence. We achieved strong growth in Design Excellence, which is comprised of core EDA and IP, fueled by the launch of several innovative products, as well as wide-ranging expansion of our solutions, particularly at market-shaping customers.Our digital and signoff business achieved double-digit revenue growth for the year as strong proliferation continued, driven by customer demand for solutions offering best -- best-in-class performance, power, area and time to market capabilities. A market-shaping global mobile company expanded their partnership with us through a large and comprehensive EDA software booking, which included a significant expansion of our digital footprint. Building upon successful 7-nanometer designs, Cadence and Broadcom expanded their collaborations to include the creation of 5-nanometer designs using Cadence Digital Implementation solutions. We have about 50 new full-flow wins in 2019, including a recent full-flow competitive win for new advanced node designs with a leading maker of FPGA chips.During the year, we are now successful -- successes in our digital business with customers such as MediaTek, Samsung, Socionet, Innovium, Mellanox and Uhnder. Verification is one of the top challenges of our customers, and our verification suite had several wins across multiple vertical segments in 2019. Our Xcelium Parallel Simulator with its innovative rocket tech technology continues to proliferate and recently had a noteworthy win at a leading US computing company.Our hardware family comprised of Palladium Z1 emulator and recently introduced Protium X1 FPGA-based prototyping platform provide a comprehensive solution across IP and SoC verification, hardware software regressions and earlier software development. Due to a common front-end compiler, these complimentary platforms when working in tandem deliver even more compelling value to our customers, and we are getting strong traction with Protium X1 being deployed at Palladium accounts.Hardware had a record year with significant expansion at several customers, while adding 19 new Z1 and 11 new X1 customers over the year, including a global marquee customer that placed one of the largest hardware orders ever for Cadence.2019 was a outstanding year for our IP business with 16% year-over-year revenue growth as our focus strategy and strong portfolio leveraged, the continuing IP outsourcing trend while enabling customer to accelerate the innovation and time to market. It was especially strong quarter and year for our Tensilica products with wins in audio, imaging, computer vision and machine learning. Loyalty growth was strong, particularly in the audio market where Tensilica Hi-Fi, DSP processor are increasingly proliferating in true wireless studio base earbox and in the next-generation smart speakers.Design IP had a great year as well with strength in DDR, PCIe and our 112-gig SerDes products as we proliferate with customers in AI, 5G and cloud computing. Early in the year, we augmented our partnership with a marquee US semiconductor company through our largest IP agreements -- arrangements ever, which included Tensilica processor IP, 112-gig SerDes IP as well as additional memory and interface IP products.Now, let us move on to the system innovation segment of our intelligence system design strategy. In 2019, we entered the system analysis market, an estimated $5 billion TAM opportunity, by introducing two exciting new products: The Clarity 3D Solver, a next-generation solution for electromagnetic field simulation, and Celsius Thermal Solver, the industry's first complete electro-thermal co-simulation solution.Increasing system complexity and time to market pressures are driving the need for far more engineering simulations, while underscoring the significant performance and capacity limitation of existing industry solutions. Both Clarity and Celsius are based on a proven, massively parallel architecture that delivers up to 10 times faster performance, while maintaining gold standard accuracy.We are extremely pleased with the ramp of these innovative products with well over 90 evaluations under way and more than 20 customers to-date, including Micron, STMicro, Kioxia, Realtek, and Ambarella. Generational industry trends are driving the need for increasing -- increased heterogenous integration, coupled with the slowing down of Moore's law, drove strong demand for our advanced packaging solutions, leading to double-digit year-over-year growth.There are growing challenges in design products designing products for complex high frequency RF application, especially in the 5G wireless, aerospace and defense, and automotive segments.To that end, we acquired AWR, a leader in high frequency RF solution. We also acquired Integrand Software, which provide leading RF solution for analysis and abstraction. Integrating these technologies with our Virtuoso and Allegro platforms will enable us to offer a comprehensive platform for RF millimeter wave products from initial design to simulation, implementation, verification and manufacturing. We entered into strategic alliance agreement with National Instruments, which is focused on the design to test flow, enabling customers to improve quality and reduce time to market.Lastly, we extended our cloud leadership in EDA providing customers with compelling productivity, flexibility and scalability benefits. Adoption of our cloud portfolio accelerated, and we passed the 100 customer mark.TSMC partnered with Cadence and Microsoft on the first TSMC IC layout contest. Cadence delivered CloudBurst space, Azuro environment that allows several hundreds of students to simultaneously compete using Cadence layout tools.With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook. -- Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our financial performance for Q4 and 2019. Despite some macro headwinds, we grew revenue across all business groups and our focus on delivering profitable revenue growth resulted in 9% revenue growth and 32% non-GAAP operating margin for the year.Turning to the numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L, total revenue was $600 million for the quarter and $2.336 billion for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 31% for the quarter and 32% for the year. GAAP EPS was $2.36 for the quarter and $3.53 for the year. GAAP EPS included a one-time GAAP-only tax benefit of $2.06 for the quarter and $2.05 for the year. This tax benefit related to intercompany transfers of certain intellectual property rights to Cadence's Irish subsidiary. Excluding the one-time GAAP only tax benefits, GAAP EPS was $0.30 for the quarter and $1.48 for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.54 for the quarter and $2.20 for the year.Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow, our cash balance totaled $705 million at year end. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $159 million and $730 million for the full year. DSOs were 47 days, and we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares during Q4 for a total of $306 million for the year.During 2019, we grew revenue by $198 million, with over $100 million of that incremental revenue growth dropping through into non-GAAP operating income. That means we have now grown our annual revenue by around $520 million since 2016, with around $280 million of that incremental revenue growth dropping through into non-GAAP operating income.Now, moving on to our fiscal guidance for Q1 2020. We expect revenue in the range of $610 million to $620 million, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.34, and Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.55.For the full year fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $2.545 billion to $2.585 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of 32% to 33%, GAAP EPS in the range of $1.46 to $1.56, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.40 to $2.50, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $775 million to $825 million, and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2020.Our guidance assumes that the export limitations that exist today for certain customers will remain in place for all of 2020. We recently completed two acquisitions and we've included the impact of those acquisitions in our guidance. And finally, please note that fiscal 2020 will be a 53-week year for Cadence. You will find guidance and additional items -- for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.In conclusion, Cadence delivered another year of strong revenue growth and expanding profitability. Our focus on delivering profitable revenue growth has resulted in a large portion of our revenue growth flowing through to operating income over the past three years. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week and recent acquisitions, our guidance assumes that trend will continue with approximately half of revenue growth in 2020 flowing through to operating income. I would like to thank our customers, partners and our hardworking employees for their continued support. And I look forward to updating you and our progress for 2020.And with that operator, we'll now take questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good evening and congratulations on a nice finish to the year. First question on your new system products. It sounds like you had some nice success there gaining some wins and wanted to maybe see if you could contrast or compare how the typical engagement with the system products compares with that in the digital space where you've obviously had some success doing it proliferating over the years? Do you think it could have the same type of pattern in terms of initial engagement one seat and then proliferation over time and just how you're thinking about the runway of these products as you continue to go after this market? -- Yeah. Rick, this is Lip-Bu. Let me try to answer your questions. First of all, we are excited about the system analysis space that we are going in on our system innovation strategy, and it's about $5 billion TAM market opportunity for us. And we're initially moving in with the two new products organically developed, Clarity 3D and also Celsius Thermal and one for the EM field solver simulator and the other one is the electro-thermal co-simulation software. And so, both are launching out in the later part of last year, and both are proven massive parallel architecture, 10 times performance, and we're excited and that the response has been very positive. More than 90 -- 9-0 evaluations, and we already have 20 customers, and I highlight a few. So I think this is just the early stage of entry, and these two products is addressing about $700 million of TAM market opportunity.And clearly, we are excited about it and is really back into our core competent [Phonetic] in terms of computational software and also related to our EDA and then expanding to the system level and also our customer requests us to move into that. And so that we can really provide a more compelling solution to the customer and answer to your question, would that be like digital. I know we take one step at a time, take one ending at a time, and then gradually we can proliferate in our customer-to-customer and then beyond that customer going to tell us what are the area will be interesting for them, what are the future performance they're going to have, will they continue to be humble learning from our customer, and then really drive innovation within the company to do that. So I think overall stay tuned, it's still very early in the in the game. -- Great. And then, John, a question for you on your acquisition of AWR. Can you say if there was much of a deferred revenue haircut as you blended that into the model? -- Yeah. Sure, Rich. Yeah, purchase accounting rules significantly limit the revenue we can recognize from both AWR and Integrand in 2020. Combined, we've added $20 million to annual revenue in our guidance for 2020, almost all of that from AWR. We expect both acquisitions to be dilutive to earnings in 2020, but we expect them to be accretive in 2021. -- Perfect. Thank you very much, gentlemen. -- Thanks. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mitch Steves, your line is open. -- Hey. Can you hear me OK? Hello? -- Yes, Mitch, we can hear you. -- Okay, yeah. Yeah, two questions for me. The first one is actually the more technical. You guys are talking a lot more about kind of going into RF space. Is it due to the fact that when you go to chiplet design architectures, in the future they're going to have more complex RFs. Am I thinking too complex about that or is that kind of what are the reasons you guys are pushing in that space? -- Yeah, it's a very good question. Clearly, we're listening to the customer. As you all know, 5G is deploying. And then, most challenging on the 5G and some of the other application market is the RF -- high frequency RF. And so, we have been looking what is the best way to address this in some of the heterogeneous integration and all the complexity to put it together. And so, we are delighted. We have been working with National Instruments, and we are delighted, able to acquire the AWR and then form a partnership with National Instruments in terms of a lion's partnership. And clearly, the high frequency RF solution they have, and then also we just add on another new acquisition called Integrand Solutions. And that give us a very compelling RF solution for the design.And then together with our Virtuoso and Allegro platform that we provide a very comprehensive platform for RF millimeter wave product development, all the way from design to simulation to verification. And so, we are really excited about this integration of the solution providing the really needed solution that the customer want to design and then to verify. And that's why we are very excited about this acquisition. -- Got it. Thank you, guys. Very helpful. And then, just for John, I'll be quick. Just for the half on half operating margin, you guys are starting at 30% where you're talking to kind of working pretty materially. So, does that imply that you're exiting kind of at 33%, 34% operating margin. Just trying to get any sort of help in terms of what the margin should look like half-on-half? -- Yeah. Sure, Mitch. The -- yeah, I guess, in terms of -- certainly in the back half of the year, it will have a higher margin profile than the first half of the year. Partly that's due to the impact of the 53rd week. 53rd week in Q4 will add about $40 million to annual revenue. But when you add the extra week of expense, to course, the upside to operating income is minimal there. And then, with -- like combined impact of the 53rd week and the acquisitions, basically the impact of the purchase accounting rules on the acquisitions kind of -- is bigger in the first half in the first quarter and kind of gradually reduces over time over the four quarters. -- Perfect. Thank you.The next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. -- Yes, good afternoon. A quick question on the IP side of the business. So I think it [Phonetic] grew 16% year-over-year, wondering if that was all organic growth? And then, was most of that driven by Tensilica and the wireless ear buds? -- Yeah. Tom, as I mentioned, we grew very nicely. It's an outstanding year for us for the IP business. About 16% revenue year-over-year growth. And pretty much across the board, I mean clearly the best of that is the Tensilica. And they have a strong quarter and also the full year, and especially in the audio imaging and computer vision. And then the other part of the light is that loyalty growth very strong and especially in the audio side. And I mentioned about the ear buds and also the smart speakers that we have a very strong footprint there.And then, the other part, the design IP also have a great year, and across the board from DDR PCIe and then our newly acquired not-too-long-ago the 112-gig SerDes, that is a must have for other hyperscale guy and the infrastructure rollout. And then that is for the AI, machine learning. And so, we're also delighted the marquee US semiconductor company with us in the largest IP agreement we have across different memory, Tensilica and 112-gig SerDes. And the answer to your question is all organically developed and nothing from acquisition. -- Great. Based on just the consumer component of that, would you expect that to continue to be more heavily weighted to the third calendar quarter or is it too diversified to make that call? -- Say again the question. -- Yeah. It's like I'm wondering if the IP if you expect from a seasonality point of view for it to be largest in the third calendar quarter or is it so diversified that it's tough to make that call? -- Yeah. It's quite diversified. But, yeah, we went through a period back in 2016 where we refocused our IP and went for a profitable revenue growth. Right now, we're only guiding Q1 and the year that -- but certainly IP has been doing very, very well. We're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing. -- Okay. And then for John when you look at the margins on a quarterly basis what's the biggest determinant of the range is that product mix or is it with specific customer mix.? -- It's probably more product mix. And of course like the first part of the year, we're impacted by the purchase accounting rules on the two acquisitions,. In Q4, we'll get the benefit of that 53rd week. Also I'm probably right now we'd probably should take a moment to acknowledge the dynamic situation our employees and partners in China and the Asia-Pacific region are navigating as health officials respond to the coronavirus. Our focus is on our employee safety working with the authorities in dealing with the crisis and on the potential business impact. Any impact of the coronavirus that we could quantify at this time is in our guidance but a large portion of our revenue of course is recurring in nature and the impact we've seen to-date is minimal and immaterial to our overall numbers. But even that impact is more kind of front-loaded to the early part of the year. -- Okay. That helps. Thank you.Your next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line open. -- Hey, guys. Congratulations to the strong finish to the year and strong start to this current year. Wanted to ask about your backlog, If I read correctly that you cited a backlog increase of about 20% from the conclusion of 2019 versus 2018, is that apples to apples comparison adjusting for the way you now count or IPAA commitments? -- Hi, Gary. Yes. Backlog was $3.6 billion at year end, which includes approximately $200 million of non-cancelable IP access agreements. That's up from $3 billion at the end of 2018, including $100 million of IP access agreements. Now that it's impacted by the timing of renewals and our weighted average duration for 2019 was slightly higher because we had really strong Q4 that weighted average duration between 2019 was 2.7 years.Now, if I look at the average for 2018 and 2019 together, it was in the usual 2.4 to 2.6 year range. And if I look at 2017 through 2019, that's also in our typical 2.4 to 2.6 year range. But Q4 was a strong quarter for us and it took the weighted average duration for 2019 up to 2.7 years. As you know IP is lumpier than software as is our hardware portion of functional verification and that had a slight impact also. -- Okay. Okay. Thanks. I appreciate that. I know you guys have always try to manage the business, new projects, acquisitions whatnot based on the below 40 some of the revenue growth in the non-GAAP operating margin. And you just concluded 2019 with about 41%. You're guiding for 2020 at 42%. I'm sure the extra week has some impact on that. And so, therefore, are you willing to step out of your prior long-term margin guide of 30% or should we as well also start to consider you know the Cadence business being a 10% top line grower. -- So I don't think we gave a long-term margin target to 30% in the past. And you're right to point out the Rule of 40, we kind of manage the businesses using a Rule of 40 metric. I think in 2018, if you go back we achieved 20% -- what is it, 10% revenue growth and 30% non-GAAP operating margin. In 2019, now the year we just closed, we just did 9% and 32%, so a combined 41% on the Rule of 40 metric. But and -- for 2020 guidance, I think you'll see that it's -- it's approximately 10% revenue growth in about 32.5% or in a range of 32% to 33% for non-GAAP operating margin. The piece that we've been focused on is driving profitable revenue growth. And that's why I called out the -- that's why I was calling out the impact in my prepared remarks of the amount of our revenue growth that's flowing through to our non-GAAP operating income line.I think if you take the combined impact of the 53rd week and the acquisitions, I mean, combined they had about $60 million of revenue to our fiscal 2020 but the impact of operating income is slightly negative in 2020, predominantly due to those purchase accounting -- the purchase accounting impact on those acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in the acquisitions. Our guidance assumes that approximately half our revenue growth in 2020 flows through to operating income. So, we're very happy where we are. But because we're adding so much incremental margin, you're seeing the operating margin increase year-over-year that there's no near-term ceiling that we can see because we have about 50% flow through to operating income, but we haven't put out a long-term target. -- Yeah. I think just add on to it, basically we continue to drive innovation, continue to delight the customer with the best products, and meanwhile drive the efficiency in terms of Rule of 40 and then we like to print that number. So we continue to execute and deliver the result to the shareholders. -- Okay. Last question on the cash, it looks like you repatriated some cash quite substantial amount. I'm just curious what the reasoning behind that is? -- Yes. We are just preparing to complete the acquisitions -- the two acquisitions we completed at the start of the year. At year end, worldwide cash totals just over $700 million -- $705 million, of which about $400 million of that within the US. -- Got you. Thank you, guys.Your next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good evening. A intermediate-term question and then a longer-term question. So, the first question is, in a long history of EDA, the requirement for applications engineers or AEs has typically been a pretty good co-incidental or a leading indicator of business conditions EDA. In your case starting in the second half of 2018 and through the first half of last year, you significantly ramped up your additions there, obviously connected, I'm sure, to they US marquee customer and others. But now, your openings there have tailed off. So the question is, have you largely filled much of your requirements for AEs and you're now back to a more normal run rate of requirements for AEs, and maybe just talking about your thinking on what is generally your second largest source of employment after R&D?And then, secondly, a longer term question on computational software, how is the company committing resources or the organization through that? Is it a dedicated group or structure within the company for that and then a practical question as a follow up on that? -- Yeah. Good question, Jay. Let me try to answer and then John will chip in. First of all, we are not guiding our hiring plan. But clearly, the AE, we always recording AE and add-on AE when we have a clear signal for the customer to drive success proliferation. So -- and we continue to drive efficiency. And so, now we looked at a clear balance in terms of the demand and also meanwhile we also drive the efficiency and see where we can really drive down the highest return for the shareholders. And so, I think we continue to monitoring that. And so, based on the project required and also continue to monitoring what the company commitment to us before we really roll out.And in terms of the system analysis space, so clearly customer interest in our product is very strong. We ran to proliferate this product and then buildout our roadmap. And along the way, we will augment our needs for the existing team. But so far, we continue to hiring top R&D and FAE when we see them, and we're very high bar. So we want to make sure that we pick the right one to really be able to really drive the efficiency and then to the whole system analysis market that we try to go after. -- And Jay, I mean, computational software is kind of Cadence's core competence. We manage the group across the five different business groups, or manage the employees across five different business groups. And then -- sorry -- yeah we managed the business -- the employees across five business groups, we've got functional verification in the digital IT group, custom IC, silicon package board and IP. Yeah, like you say, we're happy with the way we're ramping up innovative products on the system analysis size. I mean, as Lip-Bu said, we have over 90 evaluations under way and more than 20 customers today. -- Just a technical follow-up on that. Thus far, at least with Clarity and Celsius, you're taking very much of a point to all approach two computational software, at least for simulation and analysis use cases. But when you think about what customers do in simulation and engineering software more broadly. It seems to me that you're also going to have to have some kind of a process of data management capability to unify across the multiple solvers. So, how do you envision going beyond just a point tool by point tool product strategy toward a more comprehensive flow or process orientation? -- Yeah, good question, Jay. I think, first of all, when you started you had to address the point to a solution and then drive the best point to a solution. And then over time then you have an integrated platform able to drive the platform strategy, Liberate, our digital implementation. We start with our place and route universe first, then we start with the synthesis tool like Genus, then you have the Pegasus. And then along the way, then you can really push for the whole platform, and then same thing with our verification suite. We do that. So this is just a beginning. As I mentioned earlier, this is the intial move in and along the way we have a plan at other product lines and also through acquisitions so that we can really creating a platform that we can match in forward as a full-court press.And so, right now, we are taking very calculated and then addressing the tool, there's a big TAM market, $700 million we can go after. Then over that, we have our game plan where we are developing various other tools and stay tuned. And over time we will unfold it and then create a platform and then we can push the platform like with digital and verification. -- Thanks very much. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. First one just on the impacts in China from the virus. How are those impacts -- I know John you mentioned they were minimal, but how are they actually manifesting themselves? Are orders being delayed or conversations being delayed or are the conversation like you mentioned about the safety of your employees or are the conversations just not focused on business at the moment? -- Yeah. So let me start and then John can chip in. So, first of all, we acknowledge the dynamic situation our employees and partners in China and Asia-Pacific. We're navigating carefully and we're monitoring carefully also. And then, with health officials and make sure that we respond to that coronavirus. And then meanwhile the first priority is really focus on our employee safety and then working with the authorities to deal with the crisis. And then in Wuhan and also -- this week, a lot people coming back to work. And then how it is going to bed impacting, we're getting closing on the monitoring on the supply chain and also the whole factories reopen so at a different stage.And the good news is, our revenue is recurring in nature, and then meanwhile we're also monitoring the situation check with all our key customer and partners. And so far we already build into our, whatever we forecast in the budget. And then, clearly the impact is minimum and immaterial overall number. And that's what John has highlighted his assumption that we see if and then we're closely monitoring so far. -- Yeah. Jackson, I mean, we are closely monitoring the situation in terms of what we've seen so far. We're picking up some extra expenses as we try to support our customers from remote regions that we're paying some people over time. We have -- some of our revenue comes from royalties, we've ratcheted it down our expectations of royalty revenue in Q1 because some of that royalty revenue comes out of the China and Asia-Pacific. -- And also included in the guidance. -- Yes, everything's in our guidance. -- Okay. All right. Great. That's helpful. And then a more broad question on, on Clarity and Celsius are really just 3D Solvers in general. Is there any reason or is there anything structural that you see in terms of the margin profile that would be different from your core EDA business relative to the 3D Solver market? -- Yeah. I think, clearly the system analysis space is a good market, it's a good business and we are I again mentioned very early in the game and you know we continue to be driving the opportunity and proliferating with our customer. And I think the market is ready and a lot of our customer requests that. -- Yes,the profile is -- probably the profile is very similar to EDA and this probably our entry into system analysis is probably one of our drivers of increased top margin. I think if you look at our gross margin for 2018, it was 90%. In 2019, we achieved 90.6%. And in our guidance, we're targeting 91% because of the growth we're seeing and because of all the evaluations that are under way on the system analysis base. -- Okay. That's great. Thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Yeah. Good evening, guys. Thanks for letting me to ask the question. John, I just want to go back to the acquisitions and maybe understand a little bit better the impact they're having on op margins in the March quarter, and I appreciate that you've talked about the impact kind of diminishing throughout the year. But what kind of exit run rate should we think about on op margins relative to the acquisitions influences? -- Right. So like you say you know, combined the two acquisitions at about $20 million of revenue in 2020 and they're dilutive to earnings in 2020. I think if you look at the impact on the purchase accounting is kind of heavily weighted toward the first quarter and it kind of -- it bleeds off kind of as we go through each of the four quarters. There is still a little bit that bleeds into 2021, but we expect to be accretive in 2021. -- That's helpful. And then... -- Another driver. Sorry. Just another driver of the op margin profile for Q1 is that they want to kind of remind you that we've -- we've grown head count significantly during 2019. We entered 2019 with less than 7,500 employees. We were up to -- we were up to 8.078, so up about 8% in headcount by the end of 2019 as we're investing in proliferation with market-driven customers and these TAM expansion opportunities. -- That's helpful. And then maybe as my follow up. I'm kind of curious when you think about the organic growth for 2020, especially kind of in the core EDA business how should we think about kind of share gains that traditional customers versus sort of growth in new applications and new customers around AI? And I'd be curious as you answer the question clearly M&A has been a key theme in semis over the last kind of five to eight years and I presume as larger companies bought smaller companies, they perhaps had better pricing on EDA tools just by function of scale. I'm curious if you could look back over time whether or not that was a meaningful headwind to revenue growth and now that a lot of the big M&A is probably behind us, does that become sort of a tailwind to revenue growth? -- Yeah, John it is a good question. First of all, I'm excited about this industry because very unusual to have five major waves happening at the same time. You have the AI machine running wave, and you have 5G starting to deploy, and then you have the hyperscale guy in order to really massively scale the infrastructure, and then we have autonomous driving, and then the whole digital transformation of the industry group.And then, as I mentioned earlier you know clearly some of these big system companies and a service providers they are quietly building up the silicon capability. They are also reaching out to us to really expand beyond that to the system analysis space. And so, I think we're excited about the opportunity in front of us. And so far, I think the core EDA, I think, the proliferation from the leading customers, we still have a lot of opportunities in front of us and we're very excited and I'll pursue aggressively on that in term of share gain.And then the other part is clearly some of the new product that we are launching now. And if you recall that in one of the peaks achieved for Cadence is driving the innovation. So we have -- last year we have seven new organically developed products beside those system analysis tool. And we have the Protium X1, we have Spectre X product and then we have [Indecipherable] Go and CloudBurst. And by the way, some of the new product we tried to move into the cloud, we take the leadership in the cloud and then basically cloud native tool that really drive the performance and the scalability for our customer and they love it. And so I think in terms of pricing wise value about the value we don't want to price it and then we'd really drive quality. And now we want to be the trust a partner for the customer. They can call on us to really drive the performance. And then in return we get the value that we want. And when you move down to 5 nanometer, 3 nanometer, that's -- we've become very important to them to try some of these design success, and then we're exciting to be a partner and supporting them. -- Thanks, guys. Congratulations. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I just wanted to take a step back, and you're talking about this $5 billion market opportunity in system analysis, but I think in the past, you've talked about a $30 billion market versus the $10 billion market that you serve, and that's inclusive of EDA and IP. Can you help me reconcile the difference between the $10 billion EDA and IP market you serve, plus the $5 billion system analysis market? How are you guys getting the $30 billion? What am I missing? Thanks. -- Sure. So let me just draw the picture for you. Beside the -- now we have this, we call it, intelligence system design strategy. The first layer on the ground floor is we call it the design excellence that is the called EDA in IP. There's still a lot of room to grow in terms of proliferation of [Indecipherable] especially some of the innovating products that we are really driving.And then, secondly, we are moving into the next level I call the system and innovation. In term of system analysis and it's just a portion of it. And then you have embedded software security that is overlay on that. And then the third layer is, we call it a pervasive intelligence. And as we are applying the AI algorithm knowhow to really address our core business and also some of the specific vertical that we are going after and that total together is basically from the $10 billion from the design excellence. There's two other layer that we adopt another $20 billion to really drive in some of the vertical market that we are serving in the next five years. -- Okay. Next five years, got it. And then, following up on the Clarity and Celsius, good job with the customer momentum you've built so far. Can you give me an overview or give us an overview of the competitive landscape and what your differentiators are there? And in that $700 million TAM that you're addressing so far, is there a next point tool solution or market that you're looking to target perhaps in the near future? Thanks. -- Yeah. So, I think, we mentioned earlier about this $5 billion TAM market. Initially we were targeting on that $700 million that is in the EM server and also the thermal co-simulation area. And we're quietly building some other products and stay tuned when we're ready we will launch that. And so, initially we cannot get a feel, we call it a low-hanging fruit, clearly drives the completion software differentiation that we can show 10 times performance. And we're excited to validate that with 90 evaluation and 20 customers signed up, and more is coming. So we will keep you updated on that. Clearly I think people see the performance of 10x performance and they can really have their performance driven and they're excited to see that. They want to get the best tool.And then over time, they're going to tell us what are the new tools we have to go in. And we're going to build and acquire and then build up the platform to really drive the success in that system analysis. And again, I said that this is just the beginning. And so, we're in the early ending. -- Great. Thank you. -- Thank you.Your last question comes from Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson. Your line is open. -- Yeah, hi. Just a quick followup. John, when you look at that 53-week year, does it have a bigger impact on your cost structure than it will on revenues? -- Yeah. So essentially if you look at the 53rd week, it's a holiday week kind of between Christmas and New Year. It adds about $40 million to annual revenue because it's really the recurring piece of our revenue that is daily subscription-based that we get the extra revenue for. But for on the expense side we can pick up the full week of expenses. So the upside to operating income is minimal for that 53rd week. -- Yeah. Okay. I just wanted to make sure. -- No worries. Okay. Thanks.And I will turn the call back to Lip-Bu Tan for any closing remarks. -- Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Next phase of our strategy intelligent system design brings new opportunities in design excellence, system innovation and pervasive intelligence, and an expanded total addressable market. We are capitalizing on multiple technology trend and further proofreading our solution with a broader base of customers.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $68.00 (before broker commissions).

Copies of today's press release dated, October 21, 2019, for the quarter ended September 28, 2019, related financial tables, and the CFO commentary are also available on our websiteAnd now I'll turn the call over to Lip-Bu. -- Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the third quarter of 2019, delivering 9% year-over-year revenue growth. Based on our strong execution and strength of our technology and business, we are again raising our outlook for the year.Given the uncertainty of the ongoing trade situations with China, our outlook assume current export limitations remain in place for the rest of the year. John will provide more detail on our outlook, shortly. While global economy and geo-political uncertainty continues, long-term trends such as AI, 5G, Cloud and IoT continues to drive strong design activity.The move to domain specific computing and system companies building custom silicon, as well as a host of innovative silicon start-ups, are all pushing the technology envelope, and driving the need for high-performance, low-power computing, high bandwidth connectivity, and high density storage.Our Intelligent System Design strategy, focus -- position us well to maximize the resulting opportunities through building out our portfolio, and providing more capabilities and value to our customers. The foundation of our strategy is the Design Excellence segment, which comprise of our core EDA and IP business. I will now provide some of the key quarterly highlights in this area.A key element of our approach has been to closely collaborate with our ecosystem partners, and focus on market shaping customers. In Q3, we deepened our partnership with Samsung through our comprehensive agreement across our digital, custom, and verification product portfolio.Early this year, we had reported a breakthrough wide-ranging win with a marquee US semiconductor company. I am particularly pleased that we augmented that partnership with our largest ever IP order that included our Tensilica processor family and our design IP portfolio, including ultra-high-speed SerDes.At its recent open innovation platform event, TSMC recognized Cadence with four partners of the year awards, including an award for joint development of 6-nanometer design infrastructure. And one for joint delivery of cloud-based productivity solution. Our Cadence cloud portfolio has great momentum, with over 50 customers using our solution in the cloud. Cadence cloud-ready products in close collaboration with our cloud infrastructure and foundry partners are enabling our customers to realize meaningful scalability, performance and flexibility benefits from using the cloud.Our CloudBurst model is used for hybrid cloud infrastructures, where customer want to augment their on-premise infrastructure with best capacity from the public cloud to address pick load. Continuing strong proliferation of our digital and signoff solutions, especially with market shaping customers at the most advanced nodes have driven share gains and double-digit year-to-date revenue growth.In addition to numerous 7-nanometer tapeouts, there are more than 15 customer engagements at 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer using our digital flow. MediaTek has deployed our digital full flow in production for their 7-nanometer designs. At Mellanox, a leader in data connectivity solutions, Innovus replaced the incumbent solution for all of their production 7-nanometer designs. We also had a digital full flow competitive win for 7-nanometer design with a leading Japanese imaging company.Uhnder used Cadence digital full flow, which is based on common engines and includes Genus, Innovus, Tempus and Pegasus to achieve the best quality of results and the fastest convergence of their highly innovative and completely integrated first digital automotive radar-on-chip.Next, I will discuss highlights of our System Design and Verification solutions. Our Palladium Z1 emulator, and the recently introduced Protium X1 FPGA-based prototyping platform now provide a comprehensive solution across IP and SoC verification, hardware/software regressions, and earlier software development. Growing system design complexity and the high cost of failure continues to drive strong demand for our Palladium Z1. In Q3, the Z1 added eight new customers and had key -- and had eight key expansions.Rounding off our hardware family is the Protium X1, which is a perfect complement to our Palladium Z1. I'm excited by the strong customer interest in Protium X1. Our global marquee customer significantly expanded their existing hardware footprint with the additional Z1 capacity and Protium X1 as well, making it one of the largest hardware orders ever for Cadence.We had several full Verification Suite wins in Q3, including a major customer in Asia and an automotive semiconductor company in EMEA. In IP, our focused strategy and strong portfolio have enabled us to benefit from the continuing IP outsourcing trend. In Q3, we had our best ever quarter for IP with year-over-year revenue growth exceeding 20%. It was an especially strong quarter for our Tensilica products with additional wins in audio, imaging, computer vision and machine learning.In System Innovation segment of our Intelligent System Design strategy, we introduced the Celsius Thermal Solver, which joins the Clarity 3D EM Solver in the growing suite of our system analysis products.Celsius is the industry first complete electro-thermal co-simulation solution for the electronic systems from ICs to a system or to a physical enclosures. Based on the proven massively parallel architecture that delivers up to 10X faster performance with full accuracy, Celsius enables design teams to mitigate thermal issues at an earlier stage, thereby reducing system development iterations. Bosch and Arm have both endorsed this exciting new product, and we're in the midst of earlier discussion with several other customers.Clarity, which was announced earlier this year continued its strong momentum with four competitive wins during the quarter, and more than 30 active customer engagements under way.With that I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook. -- Thanks, Lip Bu. And good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to report we met or exceeded all of our key operating metrics in Q3. As a result of continuing robust demand for our solutions and strong execution across our business, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2019.Before we get into the Q3 results, I would like to take a moment and talk about the ongoing trade uncertainties. With more companies recently added to the Entity List, the situation remains fluid and we will continue to closely monitor it. For the purpose of providing guidance for 2019, we've assumed that the current export limitations remain in effect and the Entity List remains unchanged for the remainder of the year.Now, let's go through the key results for the third quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $580 million, up 9% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.7%. GAAP EPS was $0.36 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54.Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $655 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q3 was $139 million. DSOs were 43 days, and during Q3, we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares.Now, I will provide our updated guidance. For Q4, we expect the following results. Revenue in the range of $590 million to $600 million. Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%. GAAP EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.35. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.52 to $0.54, and we expect to repurchase $75 million of Cadence shares.As a result, our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is now as follows. Revenue in the range of $2.327 billion to $2.337 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5% to 32%. GAAP EPS in the range of -- in the range of $1.50 to $1.52. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.18 to $2.20. And operating cash flow in the range of $700 million to $740 million.You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO Commentary available on our website. In summary, I am pleased with our execution in an uncertain environment. Our strong dependable results reflect the broad diversity of our global customer base. We remain focused on driving growth in our core business, highlighted by the proliferation of our digital full flow, and we continue to invest in growth opportunities with market shaping customers, and new product areas.In closing, I would like to thank our customers, partners and of course our employees for their continued support.And with that operator, we'll now take questions.[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Yeah, Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong results. For the first one, I'd like to focus on the IP business. I know IP can be a little bit volatile from rev rec standpoint. But can you help us understand how sustainable this large boost you saw in Q3 is? Should we expect a little bit of a reversion in Q4? Does Q3 kind of represent an inflection? And if the latter, can you walk us through what the sustainable drivers are? Thanks. -- So Adam, yes. As Lip-Bu mentioned in his prepared remarks that Q3 was our best ever quarter for IP business with impressive revenue growth exceeding 20% year-over-year. I mean if I look back over the last four quarters, the trailing four quarters, we're also up 20% year-over-year on IP. But we always say that revenue for IP can be lumpy in any single quarter, half or even year. But we do believe that it's -- it's relatively sustainable over the long term. -- Got it, thanks. For my follow up, I guess can you just give us an early view on 2020 growth based on the bookings momentum that you're seeing today? -- Can you repeat the question? -- Just if you have an early view on what 2020 growth could be directionally, if not an absolute value just based on the momentum that you're seeing today for the overall business. -- Oh, we're not giving any guidance on 2020 right now. Like we say, it's, it can be -- it can be lumpy in any one quarter, half or even year. We'll provide that guidance at the end of the year. -- Got it. Thanks.Your next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. And congrats on another strong quarter. I realize that you're probably going to be filing your 10-Q in about three hours or so, but can you give us a preview into what the remaining performance obligations were at the conclusion of the quarter? -- Yeah, I think it's, I think it's filed already. The contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $3 billion at the end of Q3, including approximately $200 million of our IP Access arrangements. Those IP Access arrangements are non-cancelable commitments from customers, where product selection and quantities are determined by customers each quarter. -- Okay. So it's about $200 million sequentially, if I'm not mistaken. All right. I have multiple question on your Systems Analysis business, Lip-Bu you mentioned four wins for Clarity in your prepared remarks. In relation to those four wins in the early activity, in the 30 engagements that you have, how successful are you in your ability to separate these licensing deals from existing EDA customers? In other words, monetize them above and beyond your existing revenue run rate, existing customers. And can you share with us what your typical deal size maybe for these types of wins and as well, perhaps when you can start to recognize some revenue from these four early Clarity wins? -- Yeah, thank you for your question, Gary. I think couple of things. First of all, I think we have our approach of the -- you know the System Analysis space. That's something is really our core competent of computational software. And we can apply into this complex System Analysis space and then we have these two new products. Initially, we announced Clarity that is a 3D EM Solver. We are delighted. We have four competitive wins. And this is a very new product for us, and we have more than 30 active customer engagements going forward. And so we are excited about that. And then, meanwhile, we just announced our Celsius Thermal Solver. And again, back to that computational software strength that we have, and we clearly demonstrate that up to 10X performance and customers are delighted to see our performance especially Bosch and ARM. They both endorse our new products and we are in the middle of earlier discussion.So it's still in the very early stage of our emerging into the System Analysis, and more and more our customer love that because you know besides the EDA, besides the IP, they want to look at the total system solution simulation with [indecipherable] the whole system, power in our thermal envelopes, and something that we can really demonstrate and provide the best solution for the customer. So it is still very early. And in term of our pricing, again, it's not part of our EDA. And so and now we do it differently, and they are basically close to the market competitive pricing, but in a very early stage of winning. Stay tuned. Over time we will unfold and give you a progress update. -- All right. Thank you guys. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can we just start with hardware? So it looks like Verification was the segment that probably struggled the most year-over-year. And we've seen inventory balances pick up in the last couple of quarters. So I'm just curious, is this maybe a building of some hardware ahead of pipeline? Or are we seeing any kind of struggling close rates in that hardware business? -- Now, let me start first Jackson. And then John will give you more detail about the inventory. And so I think first of all, I think function Verification remained a fastest growing challenge for our customer. And I've mentioned in Q3, we are delighted to deepen our partnership with Samsung to a comprehensive agreement across not just digital custom and also Verification products. And then Palladium Z1, have been doing great and the customer love it on the hardware emulation, but now we have the Protium X1 FPGA-based prototyping that we can provide a comprehensive solution across IP and SoC verification especially for hardware/software regression and earlier software development, that combination using the same front end software and make it easier for the customer.And then, so I think we clearly see that in our -- in new customer and its key expansions. And so I think we are just delighted and are very pleased. Protium is giving a lot of opportunity for us. And we also highlight a global marquee customer significantly expanded their existing hardware footprint with additional Z1 capacity and add-on the Protium X1 as well because that one is a larger one or the largest hardware orders for Cadence. So I think all in all, we see strength. And then I think John can highlight the reason of building up the inventory. -- Yes, yeah, Jackson. As Lip-Bu says, I mean our hardware solutions are proven to be very robust in the marketplace and cost demand is good. Q3 results were slightly up on Q3 '18 but we were building inventories heading into Q4 because we have a strong pipeline going into Q4. -- Okay that makes sense. And then one quick question, a follow-up on the 30 customers at Clarity engagement. Can you give us any kind of industry sense for those or is it significantly different from the Cadence customer base in EDA? -- Yeah, I think you know both and not just on semiconductor, many other system companies and because this only see the value of the -- up to 10x performance and also tie in very well with the from the system simulation down to the silicon emulation. That fully integrated, it's a complete that customer love. -- Okay, thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Co. Your line is open. -- Thank you. First just a clarification. Congratulations on the large IP order that you mentioned was from the marquee customer you had referenced previously. Just wanted to clarify, is the significant hardware order as well from the same marquee customer, or was that a different one? -- Yeah. So I think what we mentioned earlier, is that IP deal is with a global US semiconductor company -- marquee US semiconductor company. And then the hardware you know clearly is a marquee global marquee company and they are already our customer, but they are increasing their hardware capacity plus the Protium that they like a lot. And so that they are fully integrated and make it one of the largest hardware orders. -- Got it. So they are different customers so as that just to be perfectly clear. -- Yes, yes. Yes. -- Okay, thank you. And then moving on to the system products. First, just wanted to understand, you mentioned that Bosch and ARM had endorsed and I think you said both of these products, and I just wanted to clarify that that was in fact an endorsement of both Celsius and Clarity. And then, if that's the case have either of them actually purchased Clarity? Or are they among those four competitive wins you have for Clarity? -- Yeah, I think we mentioned Bosch and ARM and all they are Celsius product and the current year, we mentioned about four competitive wins and then plus another 30 active customers. So there is a differentiation here. -- Got it. Understood. And then I know this is a tough subject. But I just wanted to see if you're willing to say sort of anything about China, as we look into next year. This year you've had a number of customers put on the entity list and you had the benefit of getting revenue from them for, in some cases, three quarters of the year, in some cases maybe a couple of quarters. And as we head into next year if the Entity List sort of stays the same, either kind of a full year in essence headwind from those customers, but I guess recently, there's also been some policy put in place in China whereby they are actually providing incentives for companies to purchase both EDA tools and IP, which could conceivably be a tailwind for you in the country.So just wondering if there's anything you can say about sort of China as we look into next year. There's a lot of sort of factors at play. And I know you don't want to give numbers, but just any thoughts there, Lip-Bu would be helpful? -- Sure. So let me just touch on, first of all, I think clearly Cadence has and will continue to comply with the United States Department of Commerce export control. And as I mentioned, the situation is fluid and we are monitoring carefully and even with this uncertainty, but we assume our current export limitations remain in place for the rest of the year. So our guidance has already provided everything we know in this and we are not. And so I think this is kind of where we are. John? -- Yes, yes. And clearly when we're not going to speculate in terms of how that plays out for next year, but you're correct in your assessment that in some cases for some customers, we had revenue in the first half of the year and the second half of the year is quite different, now we do have some headwinds. If there is no change, those headwinds will persist into next year. -- Okay. Thanks for taking the questions, gentlemen. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Tom Diffely with DA Davidson. Your line is open. -- Yes, good afternoon. Another question on the IP. Just curious, is the sequential growth solely due to the one large customer or did you see a broad based increase in IP demand as well? -- Yeah, let me start first. And I'll clearly the -- you know our focused strategy and strong portfolio and IP and in fact we keep on adding more IP portfolio beside the Tensilica and the memory, connectivity and then we are excited of our high-speed SerDes that we bought from new semi and that 112 gig SerDes is a must-have from a lot of data center infrastructure build up and the hyperscale guys really like it. And so I think we have a very -- we are very pleased with our portfolio, and we are laser focused on our strategy, focused on the leading customer and then focus on the advanced nodes and then focus on something that we can scale. And then so far I think, we have a very broad portfolio. But meanwhile, we are very delighted, and I mentioned earlier, this marquee semiconductor company. besides we have a wide-ranging win and now we add on this largest IP not just include Tensilica family. Also include the design IP portfolio. We are excited about it. Just add on top of it and we're pretty pleased with the progress. And our IP is like building block of the system, you really need to -- start recording the star IP that are must have, and we are really focused on the star IP. -- Yeah, we're very pleased with the consistent execution there in IP and they had a very strong finish to last year. They had a very strong Q1, Q2 was kind of flat on Q2 last year and then we had a strong Q3. But as with all these things, of course, it creates a tough compare going forward. -- Yeah. Do you see any natural seasonality in that business or is it purely project-based? -- It's purely project-based. I mean there is, it is kind of random from a seasonality standpoint. -- Okay. And finally John, in the press release you mentioned kind of a reorganization in international offices that you had -- -- Yes. -- The impact of taxes going forward, just wanted if there is something you can say on that? -- Yeah, I mean that's a GAAP only thing, I mean in October 2019, we initiated a series of transactions involving an internal realignment of our international operating structure. And that realignment may significantly increase our foreign deferred tax assets. As you know, deferred tax assets are recognized when the depreciation of the asset is expected to offset future profit. So there is a lot of calculations that go into trying to estimate the value.We've not completed our analysis and cannot yet estimate the impact, but we expect to complete the analysis and record the income tax impact in the fourth quarter of 2019. We wanted to highlight that in our CFO Commentary because our current GAAP guidance in the -- basically doesn't account for this change. So we just wanted to highlight that that piece is open. -- Okay. But no non-GAAP impact going forward? -- That's right. -- Okay, great. Thank you.Your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just two from me. Just regarding China in terms of historical, last quarter you guys kind of had a pull [indecipherable] quarter with it being up 68% and now it's up about 21%. Is there any way to confirm, there is potentially some hardware pull just given the Huawei dynamics last quarter that and that's the reason why it's down sequentially or am I reading too much into it? -- Overall, China was 10% of revenue in Q3. Now, that's down from 12% in Q2, but flat from kind of Q1. It was, I think it was 10% in Q1 as well, but we've seen variability in our China revenue mix over the last six quarters. It's ranged from a low of I think 8% back in Q2 '18 to a high of about 13% in Q4 '18. Back in Q4, '18, we did experience a hardware pull-in and we did see the first half was quite strong for hardware, Q3 has been a little bit lighter for hardware and not shown up in gross margin. But like I said the hardware pipeline is strong for Q4 and hardware can be lumpy in any one quarter. -- Okay, that makes lot of sense. And then secondly I mean EDA is probably one of the better ways that's placed I mean over the next five years to 10 years. One thing I'm noticing here like your employee count is actually increasing pretty significantly going from like 4% growth to 8%. I just want to be clear here. If I look out over the next, let's call it three years to five years that your opex is still going to under grow the revenue line, is that a fair assumption? Because it looks like it's actually pretty close now at this point? -- Yeah. We're not guiding anything on 2020 right now. But you're right to point out that the headcount has grown because we're investing in opportunities for proliferation of market shaping customers and new products. -- And in some way, we are very excited about the environment, because you know, as I mentioned the couple of big driver AI, 5G, Cloud and IoT and then the whole data infrastructure, is because of AI and all this driver, there is a very big changes requirement needed. And so we have a suite of start-up and system company, they all try to meet the new requirements. So there is a lot of innovation happening. And so we see design activities increase and that's why I think also we have proliferation of our digital flow and also some of the key market shaping customers that were being adopted. And so we're building up the engineering and also the FAE support to win some of these accounts and then proliferating and that's why John and I, we only increased headcount when we see the deployment and also the commitment from the customers. -- Got it. It's very clear. Thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Yeah, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess my first question is just on the relatively new North American customers clearly added to the September quarter. I wonder if you could just help me understand how we should be thinking about sizing that business over multiple years and how that business scales for you as that customer continues to move down nodes? -- Yeah. So, I think clearly we don't guide any 2020 outlook. But we are excited about. I don't know quite sure, new North America, but we only mentioned about marquee, the US semiconductor company. We're excited about the partnership and we're expanding besides the tool expanding the IP proliferation and that part we will continue, we're excited about it. -- That's helpful. I mean just going back to your comments about AI, I think I'm kind of curious if you could size how big that business is either as a percent of overall revenue or maybe of the growth? And I guess specifically the semiconductor industry went 10 years or 15 years without a lot of venture capitalist money and that's clearly changed around AI. There are somewhere between 40 to 60 potential AI start-ups that are getting funded. I'm just trying to get a sense of how important that is to your growth in the near term? And kind of do you think that all these companies are going to be viable or is it more likely that this consolidates and if it's the latter, how do I think about kind of the AI revenue stream unfolding from here? -- Yeah, I think the AI implication to the whole industry can be quite significant. If you look at the university like MIT, there is a school called -- new School of Computing, they just raised $1 billion for that. Same thing with CMU, Carnegie Mellon, and I'm on the Trustee and now they are just offering the AI degree for undergrad and then you can see the SoftBank, the Vision Fund tool is focused on AI. So you can see that AI implication. And in fact you are correct, if you look at the semiconductor growth recently in term of funding a lot is driven by AI. AI is not just semiconductor, it's applied into all the different vertical industries. So the impact can be quite huge. And we are excited by this opportunity that design activities increase a lot.And so I think all in all, I think clearly we have a very good position. We have the AI machine learning application to our tool. So, we see significant improvement in term of our various tool in terms of PPA run time and verification. So we are embarking on improving our tool. So that we can get the best product to meet the customer requirement and the AI development is not just the start-up, all the big hyperscale guy and all the big system company, they all have various degree of investment into AI. And then we also, our Tensilica, it is a very clear good engine for some of the AI application like, audio, video and various others and then we are trying to build a software stack on top of the AI platform, so that we can provide a solution to our customer for the various vertical market they try to address. -- So if I could just do a quick financial one in for John. John just given what you guys do in the September quarter and in the year ago quarter, I'm just kind of curious, your op margin sort of guidance for the December quarter. Can you help me understand why it would be down sequentially year-over-year rather than just an abundance of conservatism on your part? -- Yeah. So we haven't changed how we guide. I mean we guide the same way all the time but essentially it's the same as where we were at this time last quarter. Last quarter we guided Q3 at 30% for our margin and Q4 for 30%. In Q3, the beat was mainly on the gross margin side, I mean we assume gross margin comes out at about 90% in our estimates and we did better in Q3, it came out I think was 91.6% and we landed at 31.7% for op margin. So most of the -- but most of the beat on the op margin side in Q3 was a result of gross margins. My expectation for Q4, is that we have a significant hardware pipeline heading into Q4, it was kind of similar, it reminds me of where we were this time last year.And last year, our gross margin ticked down I think 200 basis points from Q3 to Q4. So we're expecting about 30% and that's because you've got a combination of things happening, right? You've got Q3 and Q4. We're assuming that but there is no change in export limitations right now. We're also investing in proliferation opportunities, market shaping customers and in new product areas. So that's what's -- that's what's driving the numbers. -- Thanks.The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good evening. Question for you, John, first, you noted in your prepared remarks $200 million or $212 million to be precise in IPAA commitments. This is not a metric that I think you disclosed before until tonight's 10-Q. Was that amount to do mostly, if not solely due to a single customer? Or is it fairly broadly based in terms of numbers of IP customers comprising that? And then secondly just on longer term EDA market question for Lip-Bu. -- Yes, Jay, thanks to point that out. Yes that was an issue we had with how remaining performance obligations were calculated in the past. We reported backlog under the old rules and we would have include our IP Access arrangements and then under the new rules, the remaining performance obligations didn't include IP Access arrangements and they didn't seem to be consistent with how we reported in the past. So we worked with our auditors just to say that we wanted to disclose it because as you say now as of Q3, it's $212 million is the exact number, but there is $3 billion that we have in contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations is more comparable to the backlog that we had at the end of last year. -- Okay, thank you for that. For Lip-Bu maybe a two part technology or market question. First, you often use the term market shaping customer and it frankly a somewhat odd expression. How do you define customers that fall into that category and more specifically, how do you dedicate resources to those customers in terms of commitments, and so forth?And then a growth question. We've seen a number of categories in EDA have extended periods of consecutive growth. For example in the industry data, of course your numbers, the custom category has had more than 30 consecutive trailing 12-month period of growth, IC implementation more than 16, PCB is 12. So that's all very good of course, but historically EDA growth cycles for a particular category don't last for more than three years to four years -- three years to four years each, but we're now seeing multiple categories that are meeting or beating historical periods of consistent growth. So what you're thinking in terms of sustainability or what's different now, vis-a-vis the different categories? -- Yeah. So Jay, thank you for these questions. And let me address one each time. So first of all, our market shaping customer the definition is that they are clearly the leaders in their sector. And so they are the most demanding customer but because they are leader, they are driving the innovation, they are driving the performance and we want to be the partners for them, the trusted partner to enable our innovation to continue our leadership in the marketplace in the various different vertical market or the platform that they create, we want them, we want to be the partner for them, and that is how we define the market shaping customers.In terms of growth, I mentioned, you can hear my passion clearly in a way, we are not creating the changes, we are right with the wave. And you know the beauty part in this particular junction of the industry that's of five different wave are driving the growth and they are changing the landscape of the requirement. I just mentioned one example is AI and now we are moving into I call it the data centric economy. It's all about data.And then today, only 2% of the data are being analyzed and being utilized. So there is a humongous opportunity and then this is applying to across all the different vertical. And if you are really driving a change to the memory, driving the churn of the storage, driving the domain specific process. So in a way it's workload specific depending on different workloads. Different market require different rather than just CPU, GPU our FPGA, there is a new class of workload that require different type of processor and then we're also driving the memory, the storage, the infrastructure in term of able to cope with the data, massive, massive explosion of data and then so all this is going to require new innovation in order to support that and for example the programmability the scale out the storage and network and then scale out the top of the rack all the way to topping on the spy in term of the infrastructure 12.8 TB per second to 51.2 TB per second switch and all the high-speed interconnecting and that's why the SerDes is so important for high speed. And that's why Cadence bought it, and then we're going to triple down to really drive the requirement that the hyperscale and a big infrastructure player needed.I think this is going to be driving a lot of new innovation and semiconductor side and we are learning and we are trying to be the trusted partner to fulfill some of these requirements and that's why I mentioned earlier that design activity increased a lot and we're excited about it and it's just a beginning of it. -- Thanks very much. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just two from me today. The first one, with your Q4 pipeline for your hardware business. You talked about more modest growth this year following a tough comp from last year. But if the pipeline holds, could we see some upside to that modest growth commentary that you've provided previously? -- Yes, Jason, It's kind of hard to move the needle in one quarter, I mean if you look over the total year, we're expecting kind of low to mid single digit growth for Functional Verification for the year. Although if you do look over like the trailing four quarters to the end of Q3, I think Functional Verification is up kind of high 00 high single-digits. But the challenge this year has been tough comps and like we said, we enter into Q4 optimistic with a strong pipeline. -- Okay, great, thanks. And my next question has to do with your system analysis business. So you announced the electromagnetic solver in April timeframe and then you came out with your second solver, the thermal solver in September. I'm not necessarily looking for specific timing, but can you just remind us what other solvers we could expect? -- Yeah. So I think this is just our initial entry to the system analysis using our core competence on computational software and stay tubed, I mean we are just beginning. We have first product came out in April as you correctly point out we good tractions and now the second product came out, people love the performance. They are excited about it. We are continuing to investing and its high-end also very well with our PCB business and that the whole system modeling system simulation will be a really exciting area for us. So stay tuned and we will update you when we announce any new products. -- Okay, thanks Lip-Bu. That's all from me. Thank you. -- Thanks.Your next question comes from Joshua Tilton with Berenberg. Your line is open -- Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my questions. It appears as if the drivers of design starts today address a broader set of companies relative to previous drivers such as maybe mobile. I'm just curious how does having a broader set of addressable companies benefit pricing? -- So yeah, having a broader set of companies benefits us because Cadence revenue growth generally tracks design stocks, but the more design stocks are there the better it is for Cadence business. -- Yeah. So I think we like to broaden the customer and applications, so that we can really find new opportunity and new solution to support them either in the automotive or 5G or AI and Cloud, our huge opportunity in industrial IoT and providing the solution for the system infrastructure player and so that we can broaden the customer requirement and that greater diversity to our customers is always good. -- Okay that makes sense. And then just as a follow-up, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned customers were adopting a full digital flow. It was my understanding that companies tend to build their flow using products from both you and other competitors. So we're just starting to see customers standardizing their flow from one vendor? -- Yeah. So I think you know when you move down the geometry you know to seven to five to three, try to integrate different products, different tools from different customer that mean that you have to build an internal team to do all the integration and also you have a lot of opportunity to fail because the different tools will have different methodology. And so the customers are starting to really focus on getting a full flow the best -- I think it's very important, our focus first of all, is to have the best of breed for each product line like the Innovus we mentioned earlier for place and route right now is a majority in over 70% of the customer topping it in the most advanced nodes. And then now we have the Genus come out very strong and then Tempus come out and Pegasus. The customers are starting to see that not only the best of breed of product and also how to integrate them, how to optimize them and correlations among all the different flow that we have been talking up our last few years. And so right now we can not only at the best of breed for each product now we can integrate and that's why you're starting to hear that we mentioned a lot about digital full flow that our customers depend completely on us on the most advanced node in the seven and five and three and that's the way we are going to continue to support the customer. -- Thank you. Those are helpful.Our last question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Lip Bu, I had two of them. One is you guys are definitely getting a good traction with your hyperscale customers, I'm kind of curious as your hyperscale customers build their own silicon, how is their requirements for EDA different than the traditional semiconductor customers? Do they see one way to -- one way toward IP blocks or whatever it is? Any color on that would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up. -- Okay. Clearly, we are excited about the hyperscale players. They are going to be very important for our industry, because they are quietly building up. As I mentioned earlier, their workload requirement have changed and it's more about data and then so that domain specific processing development and also in the server into the data storage network, scale out going to be even more and more important for them and great partners for us and great customer and we love them. And then first of all, they are bit different on our semiconductor players, time to market is more important to them and also performance scalability is most important to them and that part, I think we worked very from the early days. We are already working on partner with them and we are also very excited about the cloud infrastructure that we also support the cloud infrastructure using some of our tool to do that and we continue to leadership on that. So I think in multiples, expect we're working with our partners in the cloud, and we're excited about the opportunity. -- That's very helpful, Lip-Bu. And then a follow up to either you or John, is there a way you can size the hardware market this year. How big is it? And this is that the different segments like FPGA apps, how big are they? Any color that would be helpful. -- Yeah, I don't have any break down in terms of the market data that I can share with you today, but we're very, very happy with -- with how our year is going. And with the strong pipeline that we have leading into Q4. -- Thanks, John. Thanks Lip-Bu -- Thank you. -- Thanks.There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to Lip-Bu for closing remarks. -- Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Next phase of our strategy, Intelligent System Design brings new opportunities in Design Excellence, System Innovation and Pervasive Intelligence and an expanded total addressable market. We are capitalizing on multiple technology trends and further proliferating our solutions with a broader base of customers. And in closing, I would like to thank all our shareholders, customers and partners, the Board of Directors and our hardworking employees for their continued support.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDNS options chain for the new May 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $55.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDNS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.40/share today.\n\nBecause the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.00% return on the cash commitment, or 10.97% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.50.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CDNS stock at the current price level of $64.40/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.02% if the stock gets called away at the May 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDNS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CDNS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 44%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.09% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.81% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 35%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 34%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $64.40) to be 32%.

Thank you for joining us today. Cadence achieved strong operating results for the second quarter of 2019, delivering 12% year-over-year revenue growth on broad base strength across our product lines. Based on the strength of our business, we are raising our outlook for the year. John will provide more details shortly.While there's a ongoing global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, we remain confident about the multiple long-term trends that continue to drive strong design activity. Driven by strength and driven by trends such as artificial intelligence or AI, 5G, autonomous driving and IoT, design activity is being fueled by workload specific computing, system companies building custom silicon, new silicon start ups, and digital transformation of industries, such as automotive, aerospace, medical and other industrial applications.Our intelligent system design strategy will enable us to provide more capabilities and value to our customers, while also expanding our current total addressable market from about $10 billion to estimate $30 billion over the next five years. The foundation of the strategy is design excellence, which is comprised of our core EDA and IP business. In addition, we are building upon our core competency in computational software to expand into two new areas.The first one is system innovation, where we are expanding into new system domains with products like Clarity, our new 3D EM solver that was launched last quarter. Clarity has received considerable customer interest with numerous evaluations under way. And second new area is pervasive intelligence, where we are beginning to apply AI and our algorithmic knowledge to our core business and specific verticals.Now, let us turn to our quarterly highlights for our core business. Our innovation engine continued to deliver as we introduced four significant new products in the quarter. We grew revenue in digital and signoff by double-digit year-over-year through both ongoing proliferation with market shaping customers and adoption by new customers at advanced notes. Samsung Austin R&D Center, a leader in high-performance design has selected Cadence digital implementation solution for a next generation high-end mobile CPU core design. Cadence state-of-the-art Innovus base flow delivered the best quality of results for that design, enabled Samsung Austin R&D Center to meet its advance process note objectives.Innovium, a leading provider of innovative data center switching solutions adopted Innovus for its highly scalable Teledyne TERALYNX Ethernet switch design. There were more than 40 tape-outs at 7-nanometer and below using our full digital flow in the first half of 2019. And Innovus, our digital implementation solutions has over 18 active customers for 7-nanometer and below designs, including 10 at 5-nanometer.Next, I want to discuss highlights of our system design and verification solutions. For this [Phonetic] revenue grew 7% year-over-year. Our hardware assisted verification products, which are an integrated part of our verification suite had another good quarter. With the addition of Protium X1, we also provide a comprehensive solutions across IP and SoC verification, hardware, software regression runs, system validation, and earlier software development.Palladium Z1, our flagship emulation platform added six new customers, and had nine repeat orders. Habana Lab, a leading AI processor start-up say that Palladium was instrumental for the development of Gaudi, the industry first AI training processor that natively integrate Ethernet and RDMA, and for their Goya inferencing chip. [Indecipherable] a pioneer in data centric computing use a combination of Palladium Z1 and Protium S1 systems in the development of their DPU family of products. The DPU is a new type of microprocessor that will revolutionize the performance, reliability and economics of data center at all skills.We introduced the Protium X1 enterprise prototyping platform, which is the first data center optimize FPGA-based prototyping system, and provide multi megahertz speed for billion-gate designs, accelerating earlier software development and hardware, software convergence. Customer reception of Protium X1 has been very positive with early adoption from some market shaping customers, including Nvidia. Protium S1 and X1 also added three new customers and receive -- received seven repeat orders.We also delivered the smart JasperGold formal verification platform that delivers an average of 2 times faster proofs out of the box, and 5 times faster regression runs by leveraging new machine learning-enabled Smart Proof Technology. STMicro has been able to significantly boost its verification productivity with smart JasperGold. Custom analog grew a strong 11% year-over-year.In the quarter, we introduced an important new product, Spectre X Simulator, which is next generation massively parallel circuit simulator designs to provide up to 10 times performance gain, while solving 5 times larger designs, and while maintaining the golden accuracy customer expect from 25 years or Spectre industry leadership in analog, mixed-signal, and RF applications. Spectre X was endorsed by MediaTek, Mellanox, Renesas, and Silicon Works.Now, let me make a few comments on the geopolitical situation. We have and will continue to comply with the United States Department of Commerce export control regulations. The situation is fluid and we will continue to closely monitoring it. While there is a ongoing uncertainty, thanks to our strategy, continue innovation, and operation -- operational execution, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities arise from the longer-term trends, driving strong design activity. While we do not provide details about any specific customer, I do want to emphasize that we have a very broad diversified and global customer base.With that I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook. -- Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our results for Q2 and our updated outlook for fiscal 2019. Q2 was a little unusual due to the export limitations that were imposed during the quarter. The export limitations that took effect on May 16, and June 24, in respect to certain customers remain in place today. We're aware that this is a very fluid situation, so for the purpose of providing guidance for the second half of 2019, we've assumed that these current export limitations remain in effect for the remainder of the year.Now, let me walk you through the key results for Q2, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $580 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%, GAAP EPS was $0.38, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.57.Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $633 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q2 was $246 million, DSOs were 38 days, and during Q2, we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares.Now, I will provide our updated guidance. For Q3, we expect the following results. Revenue in the range of $570 million to $580 million, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.34, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.52.Our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is now as follows. Revenue in the range of $2.315 billion to $2.335 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%. GAAP EPS in the range of $1.44 to $1.50. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.11 to $2.17. Operating cash flow in the range of $680 million to $720 million. And for the year, we continued to expect to use approximately 50% of free cash flow to repurchase Cadence stock. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.In summary, I'm pleased with our execution so far this year. We are living in uncertain times and I am proud of how we are adapting to a fluid environment. Our improved outlook speaks to the diversification of our customer base, the underlying strength of demand for our technology and solutions, and the continued focus of our employees throughout the Company, on achieving our key financial metrics. I would like to thank our customers, partners and of course our employees. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the second half of 2019.And with that operator, we'll now take questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. -- Yes. Good afternoon. I was wondering, if there is any way you could do more of a quantification of the impact from the different export controls in China right now; kind of the relative size of that or the impact to earnings, or anything what you can give it would be great. -- So Tom, we wanted to provide clarity in relation to second half guidance and expectations without speculating on what may or may not happen with regard to current export limitations. While we don't provide details on what that speculation might be, we don't -- we do want to emphasize that we have a very broad diversified and global customer base. -- Okay. But no way to size in case it does come back to give us a sense of what the upside potentially could be to your guidance? -- It's very hard to say. We don't want to speculate. -- Okay. And then moving on, maybe you could talk about the margins in the quarter versus the guided margins about 10% lower. Is it just mix or is it more going on there? -- Yes, certainly, Q2 was a -- there was a more profitable mix in revenue. We were happy with the performance in functional verification. We continue to expect modest growth for 2019, even considering the impact of those export limitations. The -- we expect gross margins, of course, like Q2 was a little unusual to see export limitations, we'd expect the gross margins for the second half to return to more typical levels. We're investing in opportunities to expand our business with market shaping customers and investing in TAM expansion opportunities. So we'd -- that's why the op margin is -- for the second half is forecasted approximately 30%. -- Okay. And then finally, when you look at the growth in intelligent system design over the next several years, is that meaningfully change the model for either a margin or cost structure point of view versus traditional EDA? -- Well, we're not guiding out beyond 2019. Everything we know is included in our guidance for 2019. We take a longer-term view over things and again wouldn't focus on any one quarter. I tend to like compare current results against our current midpoint of guidance against 2016. And I think I would expect the model to be pretty consistent. -- Okay, thank you.Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. -- Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my [Phonetic] question. John, just a follow up on the gross margin, I want to make sure I understand. What was unusual about the June quarter.I thought I heard you say from the last question, it had to do with the export tariffs. But then you're saying that the gross margins to return back to normal in the back half of the year, despite the fact that it looks like you're still excluding some business related to the tariff issues. -- Well, Q2 was a little unusual in that -- the export limitations took effect on May 16, and again on June 24, in respect to certain customers, and like you say, those remain in place today. The -- and then, I mean we had a few things in terms of hardware results. Hardware results is a little bit more profitable than we expected. Services revenue was a little bit more profitable than we expected. And just generally, like I say, I wouldn't -- it was great. It was a profitable quarter for Q2, but I wouldn't extrapolate that into any kind of future guidance that we expect non-GAAP gross margin to return to more typical levels in the second half of the year. -- That's helpful. And then maybe as kind of a follow-up for Lip-Bu. Well, clearly, China is going to continue to be a long-term strategic customer for you. I'm just kind of curious, given the heightened tension U.S.-China trade, is there any concern that we should have that China might try to do EDA on their own? Or the very attention [Phonetic] to that business just so high, it will be difficult for them to kind of generate domestic sources for what you provide. Any sort of longer term color on that would be very helpful. -- Sure. So I think now clearly they have a number of Chinese -- China-based EDA companies offering 0.2 solutions. And clearly, we are not going to speculate in the broader hypothesis. But clearly, we focus on the -- to be the best partner for our customer in globally, include China. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. -- Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me all right? -- Yes. -- Yes. -- All right, good. John, I wanted to ask you a question about your fiscal year '20 outlook. I know you're not going to say anything with respect to revenue growth or margins or anything at all relating to 2020. But as you enter your budget meeting, whatever that is, are you still going to use the guiding principle of the Rule of 40 is in terms of looking at the revenue growth, the some of the revenue growth in operating margin? -- Yes, Gary, certainly. I mean the model we have, we expect to apply consistently. And Rule of 40 has been something we've looked at across the different business groups. So with that we're guiding for 2019; no, we're [Phonetic] not guiding beyond. -- Understood. And with respect to your market shaping customer, I presume that you're still in the investment mode with this customer. Is it fair to assume that you haven't been able to recognize any revenue from the relationship at this point? And if that's the case, when would you expect you to bring the product to full fruition and be able to recognize revenue ? -- Yes. So I think, Gary, now we mentioned quite a few market shaping customers, that's a quite a few important one. They are the leader in the industry. And I think I assume that you refer to this marquee U.S. semiconductor company; clearly, we have a breakthrough and wide-ranging win with this U.S. based semiconductor company, where we have a breakthrough and wide-ranging win. We are in the early stage of partnership. We're not very heavily engaging with them across the product line, the breadth of our engagement. So we're excited about it, but we continue to stay on cost and focus. -- Got you. Okay. Thank you for taking the questions. -- Sure.Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. -- Thanks. Good evening. Lip-Bu, let me ask you a competitive question regarding Mentor. That is -- it's becoming recently apparent to that -- since the acquisition 2.5 years ago, they've been doing quite well with renews well when [Phonetic] they last reported in 2016, and particularly in the areas for which they were always the market leader, including physical verification and PCB, and it looks more recently also in hardware. The question is, have you encountered that or -- and have you had to make competitive adjustment, let's say, to the fact that Mentor is in fact doing somewhat better than they were pre-acquisition? And then a couple of follow-ups. -- Yes, Jay, first of all, we respect Mentor tremendously, and run -- part of the Siemens is a very big $100 billion company. So we don't take them lightly and meanwhile we respect them a lot. And then clearly, there are some products are competing with us, I think you mentioned earlier at the hardware verification in Malaysian site, and of course they are callable products. So I think clearly we continue to respect them, but we effectively competing with them and so we treat then a business as usual. -- All right. And you've grown your headcount pretty substantially year-to-date and also for Q1. Could you talk specifically about how well you've been able to bring on applications engineers? We've talked about this that for I believe the last half year, going back to last fall, that you've had a significant increase open reqs for your AEs, particularly domestically. Where you're now looking for AEs well beyond the number of that I think Synopsys or Mentor are looking for. So I imagine you've been able to onboard some, but can you talk about how you're doing in terms of bringing those kind of people on?And then lastly for John, you've talked for the last number of years about deep quality, price optimization and so forth. When you think about your base of customer contracts in cohort terms or aging of the cohort of the contracts, how do you think you've done so far in terms of optimizing the base of contracts or how much is left to be done in terms of add any [Phonetic] contracts that at renewals you can optimize? -- Yes. So Jay, let me answer the first question, and then John will answer the second question. So on the headcount and we pretty much -- that is pretty much on plan in terms of [Indecipherable] to bring on board. In terms of the talent and also the FAE, and engineering talent, we continue to bring in. And then John and I, we have very thoughtfully tried to bring in the talent with our executive team to really drive and our focus on customer success.And so clearly, we have a lot of multiple market shaping customer we are proliferating. And we need the FAE to support the customer success and that's something that we're very focused on that. In terms of the AE resources increase, clearly not just domestically, also internationally to support our customer. So I think all-in-all, I think it's pretty much on plan and we continue to drive that. And then the -- as we always say, only when we see the green life on the customer in term of commitment, in term of proliferation with us, then we add AE and engineering talent to support that. -- Yes. And Jay, in respect to your questions about deal quality and optimizing pricing, I mean we're very disciplined and value-driven. And we believe the best way to drive value for our products is to collaborate deeply with customers and deliver innovative and clearly differentiated solutions. And as Lip-Bu highlighted, we're investing in opportunities to expand our business with market shaping customers, and we're investing in TAM expansion opportunities that results from our intelligent system design strategy. I mean, in the end, it's all about innovation, which means attracting, retaining and incentivizing top talent. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. -- Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. I want to start off by circling back to the export control the quantification. I understand you don't want to speculate on what might come back in. But is there a way to look backwards and just give us some quantification of how much contribution we've gotten from these customers in the past? -- Okay. It's -- Sterling, I mean. -- So let me start first, I think, John? -- Yes. -- First of all, I think, Sterling, we're clearly complying the regulation and limit some of relationship with some of the -- any customer that may be on that entity list. And clearly we review all the products portfolio to determine which are the products and related support subject to the limitations. So I think this is something that we really focus on what are the maintenance and support we can provide, and we want to the best customer and we want to do the best we can. But meanwhile, very important is to comply with the regulation. -- Yes. We're not going to speculate on if and when either the regulations may change our ability to service those customers under the existing regulations may change. But our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 assumes no change, either positive or negative to current export limitations. But we would want to highlight that and emphasize that we have a very broad diversified and global customer base. -- Okay. And then on the margin guidance for the back half of the year, you talked about the gross margins. But is there anything else that would kind of dictate why the operating margin would be? I mean the sort of an operating margins has been kind of down for the third quarter or even in the second half since the beginning. And usually that's kind of counterintuitive when we think about when your FICA rolls off, and some other timing of investments we've usually thought about you guys like most enterprise software is being more profitable in the back half than in the front half. So just looking at the margin guide for next quarter, other than gross margins, is there anything else that we can look to describe why the operating margins will be down sequentially? -- Of course, Sterling, yes. And like you said -- like you pointed out, most of the expectation of a reversion to mean kind of for the gross margins. But on the op margin side, we're investing in opportunities with market shaping customers, and in our time expansion opportunities. We also have the annual pay increases for employees are effective in July here at Cadence, so that kicks in for the second half of the year. And that's what's taken us to an expectation of 30% for the second half. -- All right. Perfect. Thank you.Your next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. -- Thank you. Lip-Bu, you referenced geopolitical tension in your prepared remarks, which I think most would agree has increased probably over the last quarter or so. And notwithstanding the fact that your business remains obviously very healthy. Have you seen any change in any customer buying patterns or demand due to this increased tension, or any products, [Phonetic] unexpected customer attrition? -- Yes. So far, we -- no, we don't see that. But clearly, when the process prolong and then clearly we'll see some impact. But clearly right now, so far we don't see any impact. And then we have a very broad based customer, as John mentioned, and we are happy in serving those customers. -- Got it. And then the custom analog was particularly strong this quarter, I think 11% was the growth rate you provided. Is there anything you can point to sort of justify why that was I think sort of above trend? And should we think of this as somewhat anomalous, or do we think that this business might be growing at a faster rate than it has historically? -- Yes. We are very delighted with that 11% growth with a big base we have. And then clearly, it reflect our the leading products that we have and the tools that we have, and the customer really counting on us to delivering the design. And then meanwhile, a lot of application that I mentioned earlier in the 5G and some of the IoT and autonomous driving, and they are all mixed signal. And so that is really a strong combination of our strength in the analog, and now very strong portfolio that we have in digital, and then make it very compelling to grow that -- the mixed signal RF area. -- And as always, we'd encourage you not to focus on any one quarter that you kind of have to look at the results over a longer period. And certainly, I wouldn't focus on -- if you're picking one quarter, I wouldn't extrapolate Q2 given the unusual nature of the impact of export limitations imposed during the quarter. -- Got it. And then, just to follow up on the Q2 gross margin, just a little confused. It sounds like you're suggesting that the export limitations bumped up the gross margins and just trying to understand why that would be? Did you ship less hardware than you expected to and that helped your mix? Or just -- if there is any color you could provide on why the export restrictions would actually helped gross margin? -- Certainly, it's not just the export restrictions. Essentially it's a combination of events in the quarter. Like we say, the quarter was a little bit unusual in that respect. But hardware is a little bit more profitable than we originally anticipated. Services revenue was a little bit more profitable than we originally anticipated. And then just Q2 was a unusual in itself given the export limitations imposed during the quarter. That's what I'm saying, I wouldn't focus on extrapolating Q2, but focus on any one quarter. But you look at the year, really. -- Got it. Okay. Thank you.Your next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. -- Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So if I look at your China revenue growth, you guys are up 20% -- 21% sequentially. And then in your prepared remarks, you don't really say that you couldn't ship. So when you say that there is a anomaly in Q2, was that a actual negative in the quarter, or did it actually not impact the revenue volume? [Phonetic] -- So you see, China is up -- yes, of course, yes. Yes, China was up. It was up -- it was 12% of our revenue in Q2 in comparison to 10% in Q1. But of course that's down from 13% in Q4. The nature of hardware and IP is a bit lumpy in nature anyway. But like I said, we wouldn't lead into any one quarter. But -- yes, our forecast for the second half of the year assumes that the export limitations that are in place today remain in effect for the rest of the year. -- Sure, yes. So just to clarify that. So I realize that you're assuming a neutral environment as of today. But was a negative for Q2 results? -- Yes. I think our results would have been higher if there were no limitations. -- Okay, perfect. Thank you.Your next question is from Gal Munda with Berenberg Capital. -- Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just to follow up on the China argument. So it's up to 12% of overall [Phonetic] revenue today versus a year ago 8%, and it was kind of trending between 8% to 10% except for the Q4, which probably was hardware heavy. And can you just talk a bit more about the overall growth there? Is it the big players that are driving it, or is it a lot of the smaller players that are basically trying to ramp up their semi space there? Where do you -- where are you seeing demand if we kind of ignore the trade restrictions for a particular customer for now? -- Sure. Like you say, I mean our China revenue mix over the past five quarters has ranged from a low of 8% in Q2 '18 to a high of 13% in Q4 '18. So I'm not inclined to attribute motivation. Our China business has been strong over the past several quarters. But for now, our ability to deliver products and services to certain customers that are on the BIS entity list is limited. So we would expect the percentage of revenue in China to be lower for the second half of fiscal 2019 than the first half. -- Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, if I think about -- and without thinking about a particular number, but just for margin outlook in the future. Recently, we've had this bump in gross margin helping and the mix helping. But going forward, would you expect the gross margin to start contributing to the operating margin improvement as well? Or do you think it's mostly based on the continued operating leverage in the business as you think about it? [Phonetic] -- Yes. I'd expect non-GAAP gross margin to return to more typical levels in the second half of the year. And then the reason we expect operating margin to be 30% is because we're investing in new employees for -- as we invest in opportunities to expand our business with market-shaping customers, and the TAM expansion opportunities we have, and also because the annual pay increases for employees were effective in July. That's impacting our Q3 and Q4 op margin. But I wouldn't -- I expect gross margin to return to more typical levels in the second half of the year. -- John, if you look maybe a year or two ahead and I'm not asking for the guidance, but just kind of trend-wise, is there a potential in gross margin for this [Phonetic] to contribute to operating margin improvement in the future, is it mostly going to be from operating leverage? -- Again, everything we know is in our guidance for 2019 and we're not guiding beyond 2019. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. -- Hey, guys, can you hear me OK? -- Yes. -- Loud and clear. Yes. -- Yes. Just a quick one from me. So I appreciate your comments around kind of the investing in your market-shaping customers and your TAM expansion opportunities. But as you think about these investments, over the next second half and longer term, is there a one area that you feel is going to be more investment near term, and then one area to be more investments long-term, or is it going to be kind of equal? -- We assess that -- I mean we assess that regularly as part of our normal review of annual operating expenses. But -- and really back to Gary's comment earlier in terms of Rule of 40, our approach is to invest in the areas where we think we have the highest revenue growth. I'm not saying 40 is the right number because -- and actually, we're not guiding beyond 2019. But essentially the whole premise on the Rule of 40 is, you add your operating margin to revenue growth. So basically the -- where we have areas of more revenue growth, we'll invest a little bit heavier there. Where we have less revenue growth opportunities, we look for more profitability. -- Okay. Thank you.Your final question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen. -- Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them for either Lip-Bu or John. Number one is on your IP business, especially with the hyperscale customers. Are you guys doing any more customized projects, or is that all mostly done behind those at this point? And then the second question is, on the PCB business, have you seen any incremental design activity in PCB over the last few months? And if so, do you think is that just a short-term blip, or do you think there something else interesting in the horizon longer term on PCB? Thank you. -- So I would add. Krish, let me address these two topic and then John will add some color. First of all, IP is a very lumpy business. And clearly if you look at first half is a double-digit growth for us and we like that. And then secondly, we just announced our Tensilica Q7. We are excited about that whole double vision, and then AI performance for automotive, AR, VR, mobile, and civilian [Phonetic] applications. And so with just product release on that, and we have couple of design wins in the data center, mobile, and automotive application.And then the other part we like a lot is this SerDes -- high-speed SerDes, 120-gig SerDes at 7-nanometer. And we have very strong customer demands and then we're working very intensively with them. So overall, we like the IP business and we continue to build that as part of our whole, we call it the design excellence in core EDA and IP, that is the -- our strategy.In terms of the PCB, interconnect side, also a very good -- solid business. And clearly, the whole system interconnect and a system analysis side, and we have double-digit growth in that area. And so clearly the whole system analysis that will increase $4.5 billion TAM market. And then our Clarity 3D Solver very well received by customer. We have numerous evaluations and our strong customer engagement and interest. So all-in-all, I think we are pretty solid on that. -- Yes. And I would just add that IP as Lip-Bu says, is can be lumpy in any single quarter. But looking at the first half for IP, we had double-digit growth there and we're happy with that. But -- and then with regard to system interconnect, it was a strong quarter for our PCB IC packaging and security analysis products. And again as Lip-Bu said, we had double-digit growth there, so we're very pleased with the results there. -- That's it. Thank you, Lip-Bu and John. -- Thank you. -- Thanks.As there are no further questions at this time, Mr. Lip-Bu, your closing remarks, please. -- Yes. Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Next phase of our strategy intelligent system design brings new opportunities in the design, excellence, system innovation and pervasive intelligence, and then expanded the total addressable market. Of course, Cadence will complying with all export regulation and will continue to access and adapt to the situation.In summary, we are capitalizing on the multi-port analogy ways and further proliferating our solutions with a broader base of our customers. In closing, I would like to thank, all our shareholders, customers and partners, Board of Directors, and our hardworking employees for their continued support.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But, you also would\u2019ve been right. We are now at the halfway mark of 2019, and the \u00a0is up more than 17% year-to-date, marking the biggest year-to-date gain for the index through June since 1997, when stocks were up 21% year-to-date at this point in time.In other words, the stock market is having its best year in over two decades.As has been the theme of markets for the past decade, tech stocks are leading the 2019 rally. The  index is up more than 21% year-to-date, versus the 17% gain for the S&P 500. But, that 21% number doesn\u2019t really do justice to the tech stocks which are truly leading the record 2019 rally.Indeed, in that Nasdaq-100 index, there are eight stocks which are up more than 45% year-to-date. That means 8% of the Nasdaq-100 index has rallied more than 45% over the past six months.That\u2019s a big chunk making big gains. So which are those eight stocks, and will they keep rallying into the end of 2019? Let\u2019s answer those questions and more by taking a deeper look at the market\u2019s top tech stocks of 2019. 110%The top tech stock from the Nasdaq-100 through the first half of 2019 is Latin American technology giant  (NASDAQ:).Often dubbed the  (NASDAQ:) of Latin America, MercadoLibre is Latin America\u2019s largest online commerce and payments system with 280 million registered users across 18 countries. In 2018, MELI stock struggled as investors worried about forthcoming  (NASDAQ:) competition in the company\u2019s core Latin American markets. But, the stock has more than doubled in 2019 as the company has reported back-to-back quarters of robust gross merchandise value, buyer and revenue growth, largely putting those competition risks to rest. As those risks have been put to rest, MELI stock has flown higher.Although the secular growth narrative supporting MercadoLibre is very healthy, the rally in MELI stock seems to have come too far, too fast, and MELI stock will likely trade lower into the end of 2019. The company has managed to grow at a healthy pace despite Amazon competition. But, Amazon is still aggressively expanding throughout Latin America, specifically in Brazil and Mexico, and that expansion will eventually catch up to MercadoLibre and weigh on the growth trajectory. At the same, MELI stock now trades at 13-times forward sales, which is a huge multiple for an online retail marketplace. Most online retail marketplace stocks trade around 3- to 9-times forward sales.Thus, MELI is a richly valued stock that is staring at a potential slowing growth trajectory over the next several quarters as Amazon competition ramps. That isn\u2019t a great recipe for success. Instead, it\u2019s a recipe that implies that the best of the MELI stock rally may be over.63%The second-hottest tech stock in the Nasdaq-100 through the first half of 2019 has been electronics design giant (NASDAQ:).In simple terms, the secular bull thesis supporting Cadence Design Systems has gained traction, credence and visibility in 2019, and as it has, CDNS stock has rattled off a 60%-plus rally. This has all been powered by a back-to-back double-beat-and-raise earnings reports in the first half of 2019. Both reports comprised double-digit revenue growth, healthy margin expansion and strong profit growth. Analysts raised estimates, hiked price targets and sounded the bull horn after both of those reports. In response, investors celebrated and the stock rallied.This big year-to-date rally in CDNS stock does not look sustainable into the end of the year for one simple reason: valuation. Over the past six months, beat-and-raise earnings reports have converged on a relatively discounted valuation to produce out-sized returns in the stock. Now, that relatively discounted valuation (25-times forward earnings, or below, for most of 2018) has been swapped out for a relatively premium valuation (32-times forward earnings today). Thus, even though the growth narrative will likely remain healthy, valuation friction will probably short-circuit the big 2019 rally in CDNS stock.59%Slotting in as the third-best performing tech stock in the Nasdaq-100 in 2019 is small-but-growing chip company  (NASDAQ:).AMD was actually the S&P 500\u2019s top stock in 2018, and has followed up that record performance with another near 60% year-to-date gain in 2019. The theme of this extended rally has remained consistent: market share expansion. Long story short, AMD is the David in the CPU and GPU worlds.  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) are the Goliaths. In this David vs Goliath story, David is finally starting to land a few punches. Over the past 18 months, AMD has consistently and gradually gained market share on both Intel and Nvidia through better-than-peer chip product innovation. These market share gains have driven robust revenue growth, margin expansion and profit growth, which has led to a hockey stick rally in AMD stock.Can this big rally persist? In the long run, yes. It does appear that AMD is positioned to become a permanently more important player in the huge CPU and GPU industries. But, in the near term, market share expansion upside is fully priced in. Prices above $30 require unnecessarily aggressive assumptions to be supported by long-term profit growth potential. As such, while AMD stock will maintain a long-term uptrend, the near-term outlook for this stock to head higher into the end of 2019 isn\u2019t great.50%The fourth-hottest tech stock from the Nasdaq-100 through the first half of 2019 is semiconductor and electronics giant  (NASDAQ:).The big 50% year-to-date gain in SNPS stock can be attributed to this company\u2019s impressive resilience to a broader semiconductor and IT market slowdown in 2019. Growth across the semiconductor and IT markets has slowed meaningfully in 2019 amid escalating trade tensions and growing geopolitical uncertainty. Against that shaky backdrop, Snyopsys has reported not-so-shaky numbers. First-quarter numbers topped expectations and included an upside guide. Same was true for second-quarter numbers. This impressive operational resilience to broader IT market noise has propelled SNPS stock meaningfully higher in 2019.At current levels, though, the stock seems unnecessarily stretched given its relatively muted growth profile. There are multiple secular growth tailwinds at play here through AI, automation, cloud and IoT. But, this company has been, still is, and continues to project as a mid-single digit revenue growth company with solid margin drivers. Ultimately, that implies roughly 10-15% profit growth per year over the next several years. That magnitude of profit growth on the stock\u2019s average forward earnings multiple of 20 has historically produced strong returns in the stock.But, SNPS stock today trades at nearly 30-times forward earnings. A 30-times forward multiple on 10-15% profit growth won\u2019t work. As such, it looks like the best of the 2019 rally in SNPS stock has already happened.48%Rounding out the top five tech stocks of 2019, we have leading veterinary medical equipment company (NASDAQ:).The big 48% year-to-date gain in IDXX stock can be attributed to the company\u2019s continued operational momentum. In 2019, IDEXX has reported back-to-back strong earnings reports. The numbers in each report came in ahead of expectations. Both reports comprised 10%-plus organic sales growth and 20%-plus constant currency profit growth. Management also maintained a healthy full-year guide in each earnings report. They\u2019ve continued to pound on the table about the long-term opportunity in pet care, too. Net net, IDXX stock has soared almost 50% higher in 2019.The secular growth narrative supporting IDXX stock is really good. You have favorable demographic value and consumption trends that imply that the pet care industry will continue to grow at a robust rate over the next several years. That robust market growth should continue to underpin 10%-plus revenue growth at IDEXX. Lack of competition and value expansion will ultimately drive margins higher. That\u2019s why management is targeting 15-20% EPS growth over the next five years. That seems entirely doable to me.But, IDXX stock trades at nearly 60-times forward earnings. A 20% annualized EPS growth rate is more than fully priced in at 60-times forward earnings. Thus, while IDXX stock is the type of stock you want to own for the long haul, the current price tag is not the price at which you want to own this secular winner.47%The sixth-best performing tech stock in the Nasdaq-100 is innovative athletic apparel giant  (NASDAQ:).The story behind Lululemon\u2019s big 47% year-to-date gain is pretty simple. Lululemon jumped onto the athletic apparel scene by becoming a high-quality producer of women\u2019s yoga apparel. In that niche, Lululemon fostered strong brand equity and developed a reputation for second-to-none quality. The brand then leveraged that favorable equity and reputation to horizontally expand across the athletic apparel space. Today, Lululemon services the entire women\u2019s athletic apparel market, parts of the men\u2019s athletic apparel market and part of the footwear market. As Lululemon has horizontally expanded, the company\u2019s revenues have run higher, while margins have remained robust due to the company\u2019s strong brand equity and high-quality reputation. Net result? Profits have surged higher, and so has LULU stock.LULU stock will continue to run higher in the long run. In the big picture, this is a relatively small player in the very big athletic apparel market. Lululemon\u2019s revenues this year are projected at $3.8 billion.  (NYSE:) and  (NYSE:) are $5 billion revenue companies.  (OTCMKTS:) is a $25 billion-plus revenue company.  (NYSE:) will eclipse $40 billion in sales either this year or next year.Thus, this robust growth narrative in Lululemon is still in its first few innings, meaning the big rally in LULU stock isn\u2019t over just yet.46%The seventh hottest tech stock in the Nasdaq-100 through the first half of 2019 is American biotech giant  (NASDAQ:).Unlike the other seven stocks on this list, the big year-to-date rally in CELG stock can be traced to M&A. In early 2019,  (NYSE:) announced its intention to acquire Celgene for $50 per share in cash, plus one share of BMY stock. At the time, the deal represented a $95 per share takeover value for Celgene. The stock rallied toward $90 in a hurry. It has since rallied close to $95 as shareholders of both companies have overwhelmingly approved the deal.Further upside in CELG stock looks unlikely, mostly because all the acquisition upside has already been realized. The present proposed takeover value for CELG stock stands around $95. The current price tag on CELG stock is $93. Thus, if the deal does get through regulatory hurdles, there is some upside left here. But, not much.45%Last, but not least, on this list of top tech stocks of 2019 is social media giant  (NASDAQ:).After a brutal 2018 in which shares collapsed from $180 to $130, Facebook stock has staged an impressive turnaround in 2019 thanks to two things. First, almost everyone has moved past the 2018 data-privacy scandals which plagued the company. Users are using the company\u2019s platforms as much as ever. Advertisers continue to pour money into the ecosystem. And Wall Street is back to its bullish stance. Second, Facebook has pivoted aggressively into commerce, which dramatically expands this company\u2019s addressable market and lengthens the long-term growth runway.Those same two catalysts will keep Facebook stock on a winning path for the rest of 2019. The advertising business will improve in the back-half of 2019 as user growth remains steady, ad dollars continue to flow into the digital channel and margins improve as big data-security investments scale back. Meanwhile, the commerce business should start to gain traction, and as it does, investors will become excited about the long-term revenue growth opportunity therein.All in all, then, Facebook\u2019s continued dominance in the digital ad world and recent pivot into commerce should keep FB stock on a winning path for the rest of the year.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long EBAY, AMZN, INTC, NVDA, LULU, SKX, NKE and FB.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["The stock market is partying in 2019 more than it has in over 20 years. We are coming into the end of June, and the  is up more than 17% year-to-date. That\u2019s the biggest year-to-date gain through June for the S&P 500 since 1997, when stocks were up 21% year-to-date in mid-June.For what its worth, that first half 1997 rally in stocks continued into the back half of the year. Through the last six months of 1997, the S&P 500 rose another 8%, finishing the year with a record 30%-plus gain.In other words, we are a little over halfway through 2019, and stocks are on track to have their best year in over 20 years. That\u2019s pretty wild, considering in late 2018, financial markets globally were grappling with recession fears.Nonetheless, now feels like an appropriate time to take a look at the stocks which are leading this record 2019 stock market rally. Which S&P 500 stocks have notched the biggest year-to-date gains through mid-June? As is always the case, it\u2019s not who you would guess.With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the top seven performing S&P 500 stocks of 2019 thus far. Source: Shutterstock\n\t105%Beaten up global beauty giant  (NYSE:) has staged a huge turnaround rally in 2019 \u2014 a rally big enough to make COTY stock the S&P 500\u2019s best performing stock year-to-date through mid-June.The recovery rally was kick-started in early February when the company reported a surprise double-beat quarter that caused shares to rally in a big way. A few days thereafter, German conglomerate  offered to purchases 150 million shares of Coty at a purchase price of $11.65. That pushed COTY stock \u2014 which was trading below $10 at the time \u2014 even higher. Since then the company has reported another \u201cgood enough\u201d earnings report, which has kept COTY stock in rally mode.Can COTY stock stay in rally mode? Most signs point to yes. The global economic situation is starting to improve after a late 2018 slowdown.Coty\u2019s numbers and operational trends are also improving. Insiders are buying the stock. The valuation remains reasonable at 19 times forward earnings. Big turnaround plans are due to be announced on July 1. Broadly, there\u2019s still a lot to like about COTY stock, and all those favorable conditions should keep this stock in rally mode.Source: \n\t78%The second-best-performing S&P 500 stock of 2019 thus far is another dark horse turnaround company,  (NYSE:).Document management systems company Xerox has been stuck in a multi-year decline. Now, management is finally doing something about it. They are reorganizing the company, looking to shed non-core assets, driving cost savings throughout the business, stabilizing top-line trends and putting the focus back on innovation. Most of these initiatives are working. The company has topped profit estimates in a big way in each of the past two quarters as margins are substantially improving. Investors have rallied around these profit improvements, and XRX stock is up nearly 80% year-to-date.Will the rally continue? Not until revenue trends reverse course. The valuation is cheap at about 9-times forward earnings. But that low multiple has been the average valuation for this stock over the past several years. Margins are improving, so that warrants a higher valuation. However, revenue trends remain depressed, and depressed revenue trends do not warrant a higher valuation. Thus, until they reverse course, it\u2019s tough to see XRX stock staying on a winning trajectory.Source: Shutterstock\n\t71%Coming in third is Mexican fast casual eatery  (NYSE:).The huge 70%-plus year-to-date gain in CMG stock can be attributed almost entirely to new management. The new team came to Chipotle in 2018 and implemented a series of growth initiatives ranging from expanding the digital delivery business to revamping the menu to rolling out new marketing strategies. All of those initiatives have come together to spark a healthy recovery in Chipotle\u2019s traffic, sales, margin and profit trends.The result? A huge bounce-back rally in what was a very beaten up CMG stock.Can the stock keep marching higher in the back half of 2019? I\u2019m not convinced. I still think the macro-trends aren\u2019t as good as they used to be for Chipotle. Namely, the health food craze has shifted from Mexican-style burritos and bowls in the mid-2010\u2019s, to acai bowls, superfood cafes, poke, and various other non-burrito-related meals in the late 2010\u2019s. Thus, I doubt unit performance levels and margins will return to peak levels, and the inability to do so will ultimately short-circuit this big rally in CMG stock.   65%Slotting in at fourth, we have electronics design giant  (NASDAQ:) with a 65% year-to-date gain through June.CDNS stock has rallied in a big way in 2019 as the secular bull thesis has gained traction, credence, and visibility through back-to-back double-beat-and-raise earnings report, both of which comprised low double-digit revenue growth and healthy margin expansion. Analysts raised price targets in response to both reports, and the stock has consequently been in rally mode all year long.Will Cadence stock stay in rally mode for the rest of the year? I\u2019m not convinced. Valuation is now an issue for this stock. At 32-times forward earnings, CDNS stock is trading at its biggest forward earnings multiple in several years. Throughout 2018, the stock traded at or below 25-times forward earnings. To be sure, growth is good (low double-digit revenue growth with steady margin expansion). But that good growth profile seems fully priced in here and now. As such, further upside seems limited by an already stretched valuation.Source: Shutterstock\n\t65%Last year, chip company  (NASDAQ:) was the best-performing S&P 500 stock. AMD is following up that record 2018 performance with another strong year in 2019.With a 65% year-to-date gain, AMD stock is the fifth-best-performing S&P 500 stock in 2019 thus far. The driver of the out-performance? The same thing that drove out-performance in 2018: relentless market share expansion.The global central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) markets are huge \u2014 big enough to support a $210 billion market cap for  (NASDAQ:) on the CPU side, and a $100 billion market cap for  (NASDAQ:) on the GPU side. AMD is a small player in this market, with a market cap just under $32 billion. But through faster-than-peer product innovation, it is rapidly winning share from Intel and Nvidia, and in so doing, becoming an increasingly large and important CPU and GPU company.Will AMD stock stay in rally mode? In the long term, yes. The present outlook is for AMD to continue to steal market share from Nvidia and Intel over the next several years. That share expansion, in a market supported by healthy growth drivers, should drive robust revenue and profit growth at AMD, the sum of which should drive AMD stock higher. But, in the near term, valuation friction is a problem for AMD stock, and prices well above $30 .   62%The sixth-best-performing S&P 500 stock of 2019 is investment analysis solutions provider  (NYSE:), with a 62% year-to-date gain.The big rally in MSCI stock in 2019 can be attributed to the company\u2019s continued success in its transformation to a high-margin, recurring revenue subscription business. MSCI has reported back-to-back strong earnings reports in 2019, both of which underscore that the subscription business is growing nicely and that margins have potential to move higher in medium-to-long-term. Investors have celebrated those results and pushed MSCI stock materially higher over the past six months.Is MSCI stock due for another big run in the back half of 2019? Unlikely. This is a good growth company that is benefiting from big data and analytics tailwinds. But, the growth trajectory isn\u2019t that robust. Organic revenues rose less than 10% last quarter, while subscription revenues rose just 10%. Margins have potential to move higher, but they are already pretty high, and further upside is fairly limited. As such, you are probably looking at a mid-teens profit grower here. MSCI stock trades at 33 times forward earnings. That\u2019s a big multiple for mid-teens profit growth \u2014 almost too big \u2014 meaning valuation friction will prevent MSCI stock from heading much higher in the near term.Source: \n\t61%Last, but not least, on this list of the S&P 500\u2019s best performing stocks of 2019 thus far is  (NYSE:), with a 61% year-to-date gain.The driver behind APC stock\u2019s big 2019 gain? A bidding war between  (NYSE:) and  (NYSE:). Chevron came in and offered to buy Anadarko for $65 per share. Given the huge premium and obvious synergies, it seemed like a done deal. Then news broke that prior to that buyout offer being announced, Anadarko and Occidental had been in mergers and acquisitions talks, with the price tag in those talks hovering in the $70\u2019s. Shortly after those reports, Occidental pulled the trigger on a cash-and-stock deal for Anadarko which, at the time, valued APC at $76 per share. Net net, a bidding war between Occidental and Chevron drove APC stock up more than 60% this year.Will APC stock stay in rally mode? Probably not. The latest update is that Anadarko management views the Occidental offer as superior to the Chevron offer, and that Chevron won\u2019t boost its offer. The Occidental offer, which is a cash and stock offer, pegs the takeover value of APC stock at about $70. That\u2019s where APC stock trades today. Thus, further acquisition-driven upside in APC stock seems muted.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long INTC and NVDA.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["op Tech StocksMSFT\t+1.21%\tAAPL\t+1.36%\tIBM\t+0.96%\tCSCO\t+0.39%\tGOOG\t+1.16%\tTechnology stocks held on to their solid gains this afternoon, with the shares of tech stocks in the S&P 500 adding over 1.0% in value while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index also was rising about 0.9%.

The former figure was $2 million higher than the high end of its revenue outlook, and the latter came in at $0.02 above the high end of its EPS guidance.Image source: Cadence Design Systems.In fact, following that stronger-than-expected start of the year, management revised its full-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS outlooks.

And its guidance range for non-GAAP EPS became $2.04 to $2.12, up from $1.97 to $2.07. Unsurprisingly, the shares rose 3.6% at one point in the session following the earnings release, extending the stock's year-to-date gains to nearly 54%.To better understand what's going on with Cadence Design Systems, here are three insights management had to share on its most recent .Cadence has an intellectual-property (IP) licensing business, which made up 12% of its revenue last quarter. To understand what that business does, think of a computer chip as being made up of many different individual pieces, known as IP blocks. While many companies develop in-house IP blocks for certain functions, they also look to companies like Cadence for ready-made IP blocks to integrate into their designs for many other functions.According to Cadence Design Systems CEO Lip-Bu Tan, the company's IP business \"showed double-digit growth year over year,\" with the company's Tensilica IP increasingly finding homes in \"sockets for machine learning, vision, and audio applications in the automotive consumer and civilian segments, adding eight new customers in the quarter.\"Moreover, Tan said that \"in the design IP space, our 112-[Gbps] Long-Reach SerDes IP was adopted by a marquee semiconductor company, and we launched the [industry's] first complete silicon-proven LPDDR5 silicon.\" (LPDDR5 is a type of next-generation low-power memory that'll be used in smartphones, embedded applications, and thin-and-light PCs.)It's becoming increasingly common for companies that build finished computing products -- say, smartphones or advanced cars -- to also build their own chips. Electric-car maker , for example, just announced that its latest cars are now equipped with a chip that it designed in-house to handle autonomous-driving tasks.In addition, we're seeing major cloud and internet companies design their own chips in a bid to accelerate their workloads. , for example, is already on the third generation of its Tensor Processing Unit, which is used to accelerate certain machine-learning calculations.Tan explained that although there \"is some uncertainty in the overall macro environment, we are confident about the multiple trends that are [continuing] to drive strong design activity.\" In particular, Tan said that, in addition to the work happening to support AI and 5G wireless, \"design activity is being fueled by workload-specific computing; systems companies building custom silicon; new silicon start-ups; and digital transformation of industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical, and other industrial applications.\"On the call, analyst John Pitzer wanted some additional insight into why Cadence Design Systems is \"bucking some of the uncertainty trends out there.\"Tan reiterated his comments about how \"domain-specific\" computing is helping to drive design activity, and also said that innovations in computer memory technologies are driving innovations (and, presumably, the need for additional chip design activity) in things like NVMe storage controllers.Beyond that, he cited the increasing need for high-speed connectivity technologies by hyperscale data center customers. \"So, all this [is] going to be driving a very strong design activity, and we are in the middle of it,\" Tan said. \"We are well-positioned to capture that, and that's why I think ... from our point of view, the design activity is increased substantially.\"Cadence Design Systems turned in solid results for the quarter, and the company's outlook for the rest of the year is certainly compelling. While there is, indeed, uncertainty out there, it looks like semiconductor companies, as well as systems companies with semiconductor design efforts, are still hard at work on developing new products. For a company that licenses tools and technologies to help companies craft chip designs, that's good for business.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That selloff was a good start to that effort, even if it didn\u2019t actually touch that all-important April 22 low of $64.27.The gap still hasn\u2019t been filled either, as CDNS bounced a bit on Tuesday, and Wednesday\u2019s lull wasn\u2019t terribly devastating. The tendency to fill in gaps, however, may have done some other technical damage to Cadence Design Systems that will lead to more downside anyway.At first glance, Wednesday\u2019s big stumble from Nordstrom would be alarming.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $58.85 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDNS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.01/share today.\n\nBecause the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the first quarter of 2019, delivering 11% year-over-year revenue growth and 32% non-GAAP operating margin with broad-based strength across our product lines. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the year, and John will provide more details shortly.While there is some uncertainty in the overall macro environment, we are confident about the multiple trends that are continue to drive strong design activity. In addition to technology trends like AI and 5G, design activity is being fueled by workload specific computing, system companies building custom silicon, new silicon start ups and digital transformation of industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical and other industry -- industrial applications.Our business is mission critical to silicon development, which is cornerstone of all design activity. As we have stated, our System Design Enablement or SDE strategy drives growth in our core EDA and IP business, broadens our reach in system companies and targeted verticals and guides our expansion into newer adjacent areas.We executed well on this strategy and today I want to highlight its next phase, which we're calling intelligence system design. The foundation of this strategy continues to be delivering design excellence via our core EDA and IP business. In addition, we are building upon our core competency in computational software to expand into two new areas. System innovation, where we are expanding into new system domains and pervasive intelligence, where we will apply AI and our algorithm know-how to our core business and specific verticals.Our intelligent system design strategy will enable us to provide more capabilities and value to our customers, while also expanding our current total addressable market from about $10 billion to estimated $30 billion over the next five years.To highlight some of this -- some of our recent activities in the system innovation space, in Q1, we announced strategic partnership with Green Hills Software, which opens new opportunities in the estimated more than $3 billion embedded system, safety and security space. And earlier this month, we entered the system analysis market and estimated $4.5 billion total addressable market opportunity. By introducing our first product, Clarity 3D Solver, our next-generation solution for electromagnetic field simulation. Clarity is a true 3D solver, which delivers up to 10x faster simulation performance, while virtually unlimited capacity without compromising accuracy. Clarity use state-of-the-art distributed multi-processing technology, making it uniquely optimized for the cloud and on-premise distributed computing and has been endorsed by Teradyne and HiSilicon.Turning to our core business. Our Digital into -- Digital and Signoff business achieved 12% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong adoption by new customers, and perforation of by existing customers at advanced nodes. Today more than 100, 7-nanometer designs have tape-out using our digital solutions. And multiple 5 nanometer designs are under way using our solution as well. Our hardware-assisted verification products, an important part of our verification suite had another good quarter.Palladium Z1, our flagship emulation platform added two new customers that are doing machine learning designs, including SambaNova Systems. We also had 13 repeat orders including three significant expansions, one of which was at Annapurna Labs, an Amazon company. Our Protium S1 prototyping platform, which enables earlier software development also added two new customers and received seven repeat orders. Palladium Cloud continued its steady momentum and now has more than 10 customers, several of which have make repeat orders.Our IP business also showed double-digit growth year-over-year. Tensilica continue to win sockets for machine learning, vision and audio applications in the automotive consumer and civilian segments, adding eight new customers in the quarter. In the design IP space, our 112-gig long-reach SerDes IP was adopted by a marquee semiconductor company and we launched the industry first complete silicon-proven LPDDR5 silicon.As I had to say earlier, our strategy broaden our reach in system companies and targeted verticals. One of our most successful targeted verticals is aerospace and defense, where we recently announced that we are working with Northrop Grumman, where our EDA IP solutions has supported a shorten product development cycle and advanced notes tape-outs.Lastly, I want to highlight the new Cadence CloudBurst Platform, the latest addition to our cloud portfolio, which extends our cloud leadership in EDA and provides customer with very compelling productivity, flexibility and scalability benefits. CloudBurst enables hybrid cloud environments, and its idea for serving peak demand. It provides fast and easy access to pre-installed Cadence design tools in either AWS or Azure cloud environments. It was used by Barefoot Networks to achieve a 10x productivity improvement running Cadence Tempus Timing Signoff Solution on their 7-nanometer networking chip.With that, I want to turn over the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook. -- Thanks Lip -Bu, and good afternoon everyone. Cadence achieved broad-based growth across all lines of our business during Q1, with demand for hardware and IP exceeding our original expectations. Revenue, operating margin and cash from operations were all strong in Q1, and as hardware and IP have become a larger part of our overall business, a recurring revenue mix percentage is now in the high 80s.Now let's go through the key results for the first quarter starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $577 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, GAAP EPS was $0.43 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54.Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, cash totaled $539 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $400 million. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $185 million. DSO were 42 days. And during Q1, we repurchased $81 million of Cadence shares.Now we will provide our updated guidance. For Q2, we expect the following results. Revenue in the range of $575 million to $585 million. Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%. GAAP EPS in the range of $0.34 to $0.36. And non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.52 to $0.54.Our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is as follows. Revenue in the range of $2.305 billion to $2.335 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31%. GAAP EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.47. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.04 to $2.12. Operating cash flow in the range of $665 million to $705 million. And for the year, we expect to use approximately 50% of free cash flow to repurchase Cadence stock. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.In summary, I'm pleased with our performance in Q1. We achieved strong operating results highlighted by 11% year-over-year revenue growth, 32% operating margin on a non-GAAP basis and the generation of $185 million of operating cash in the quarter.And looking at our revised outlook for the year, I'm pleased to see improvements in operating income consistently flowing through to cash, as illustrated by the increase in our operating cash flow guidance for the year.We'd like to thank our customers, partners and of course our employees, for a solid start to 2019 and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.And with that operator, we will now take questions.(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Rich Valera of Needham and Company. -- (Technical difficulty) interesting comments on your foray into the system analysis market and obviously you started there with -- an electromagnetic based Solver. But there are obviously many solvers that you could potentially roll-out there to have a complete portfolio for that market. I'm just wondering how aggressively you plan to go after that market? Will you go after the mechanical and static side of it, as well as sort of the more electronic-centric solvers? Just any sort of sense of your real aspirations in that market? Thanks. -- Yeah, Rich, Lip-Bu here. And we didn't hear the first portion of your question, but I guess it's about the 3D Solver that we announced. And we are delighted and this first product Clarify is a truly 3D Solver and is a next-generation solution that is for the electromagnetic field simulations. And this is our first entry to the system analysis and clearly we have other product well in the working on development.We're excited because couple of things; one, clearly we look at our core competence. The core competency that we have in the computational software and that's what our EDA background from and also our 3D, there are some of our packaging technology that we have that combination that give us a very unique opportunity to really drive in our next-generation disruptive that's why we can claim, up doing a 10-time the performance. And then this is a very cloud-enable and then so that we can really provide a truly next-generation uniquely optimized for cloud and on-premise distributed computing. And so that we have something unique to offer. And then stay-tuned and we're going to have more product coming out. This is our first entry to the system analysis market. -- Great. Thank you for that. And if I could just circle back to your last earnings call, you referenced the major win with a marquee semiconductor customer and mentioned that you were pretty aggressively ramping up your AE hiring support this customer. So, given that you've kind of gave us some hint on the expense side for that customer, is there anything you're willing to say about your revenue expectations that when you might expect to generate incremental revenue from this customer? Whether it would be this year, next year, any color at all you could give on that? Thank you. -- Yeah, I think we're excited about this marquee US semiconductor company, as I mentioned in the last earnings call, is a breakthrough and wide-ranging win. And we are very excited is the early days of partnering with this customer to expand the breadth of our engagement, it's across all of our different tools and we are excited about it. And clearly everything we know is already built into our guidance for that year. But overall clearly to support a very important customer, where (inaudible) to be our AE and R&D support and to really perforate across the requirements. -- Understood. Okay thank you, Lip-Bu. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. -- Yes guys, thanks. Let me ask the question. Lip-Bu maybe first to you, in your prepared comments you did talk about some pockets of uncertainty out there in the environment, which makes sense, given what some of your traditional semi customers are putting up. I'm just kind of curious to the extent that you guys continue to do better than expected and beaten raise. What do you think it is about your business it's allowing you to buck this trend? Is this just your ability to address non-traditional customers? Is it the new large win that's offsetting this? Maybe you can just help us, give us a sense as to why you seem to be bucking some of the uncertainty trends out there? -- Yeah, John it's a very good question. So, let me just talk about this uncertainty, I think we all know from the marketplace, geopolitical and also somewhat the slowdown in some segment of the industrial and automotive and others. But we're excited on couple of drivers and especially AI and 5G and autonomous driving and also the industrial edge that something that I'm very passionate about and because we are moving into call it a Big Data environment is all about data and Data Analytics. So, in a way it's driving a lot of new requirements for the semiconductor.So, one I mentioned about the workload specific or you call it domain-specific process computing, general purpose CPU, GPU that's a good place for them. But right now the workload have changed so the -- we call it the workload specific more application related and that also driving not just a computing and also the clearly a lot of more exciting about the memory. There's some new innovation on memory. There is new innovation of storage and some of you didn't hear about the NVMe controller, that is aggregation of the storage and because the massive, massive data that you need to be this aggregate, the storage and network.And on also the other part is the high-speed connectivity that able to scale. And the connectivity speed that require in the hyperscale. So, all this going to be driving a very strong design activity and we are in the middle of it. We are well-positioned to capture that and that's why I think the -- from our point of view the design activity is increased substantially. We are excited about to supporting some of our customers to really embark on some of this opportunities. -- That's helpful. And then John, just maybe the follow-up on the op margin guidance both for the fiscal second quarter and the full fiscal year. It's a slight down tick from what you just put up in the fiscal first quarter. Is that nothing more than the expense of onboarding the new large North American customer? Or, can you talk -- talk about some of the other puts and takes that might have op margins going down throughout the fiscal year? And what's going to be rising revenue? -- Sure John. Great question. That I mean for the year -- looking at the year, our annual merit increases go into effect in July. So, that impacts the second half of the year. And of course, over the course of the year, we're investing in R&D and field resources to support proliferation of our solutions with market shaping customers. And I say customers plural, it's not all for one -- one customer. -- Well, great. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I have two. So, the first one is kind of on the operating margin long-term target. I know you guys historically talk to 30%. Do you guys are above that for three quarters in a row. And I'm wondering if you guys may provide sort of high level commentary on where you think that could go in three to five years?And then secondly I noted, again in your prepared commentary, you guys are now breaking out China as a separate geography. And it seems like the numbers there have a lot more volatility, I mean, that used to be kind of 8% of revenue, but then that was 13%. In December, now it's back down to 10%. So, you could talk about a little bit of why you guys are disclosing China now as a separate geography? -- Hi, Mitch, I take the second part of that question first, if you don't mind. I mean in terms of calling out China separately, yes, you'll see that in our revenue by geography table in the CFO commentary and in our 10-Q. Here generally any lumpiness in the percentage of revenue was probably caused by our IP and hardware businesses that's -- that will -- our IP and hardware revenue is generally more lumpy than the rest of our business.And then in relation to your first question, we're not really ready to put out a long term targets right now. We're always looking at how to improve operating performance and you mentioned like over the next three years -- why we're not giving guidance over the next three years? If you take a look over a longer time period and compare our current guidance for 2019 with say, our 2016 results, you'll get a perspective on how we've been able to scale the business in recent years. -- Yeah, just to add to what John talking about on the China side, and if you look at historical 2016 about 8% and then in 2017 about 9%. And then the last year is about under 10% and this year is 10%. So, overall we have done well in China and now clearly China is very committed to build the domestic semiconductor industry and they're making great progress and we are very well positioned to support, not just China, I mean, globally in Asia and other places and we want to be the trusted partner for them. -- Operator?Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. -- Thank you. Good evening. Lip-Bu, a technology question first for you, regarding what you've called now your intelligent system design strategy. And the question is, over the last number of years, perhaps the most important thing you've done particularly in digital, is to pursue your parallel architecture with a common data model across the portfolio and that's obviously help you on the digital tool side.The question is, with respect to the new intelligent system design target, how extensible or leverageable is that, that platform or architecture of the last number of years for that new strategy? Or is there some additional rework or new technology you have to insert into the portfolio to pursue that? And in any case in the meantime, what additional opportunity do you have to further integrate the tools? For example, we've read some, what you're doing to better integrate Innovus from Genus? Is that something you could comment on as well. -- Yeah, good question Jay, let me try to answer your question. So, I think that intelligence system design will break down into three pieces. One is that design excellence and that is our core EDA and IP. So, we are very laser-focus on make sure that our foundation are solid. We are best of two in every category and that's why we inspire to do. And so that we are delighted on the digital and the Signoff sector we grew in the last quarter 12%. Clearly in a way, we're continue to succeed in the new customers. And then right now in the some of the big proliferation on some of our current customer in the most advance note in the 7 to 5, we are moving on 3-nanometer. And so I think we're excited about continue to drive that.And then we move on to the system innovation, that is moving to the system domain. And as I mentioned earlier, it really using our -- and we ventured into our soul searching, we found out our core competency and the computational software and the digital implementation that we have and it can be scale into the system level. And that's why we're excited I think to embark on that into this high quality first mover is basically is the embedded this system safety and security space we finished here. We are very delighted in that strategic partnership with that, so that we're starting to move into that space and that's about $3 billion market that we're excited about.The next thing that we're looking at is the whole, we call it a system analysis space and that's about $4.5 billion. And then it's about time to have some innovation solution able to provide -- that provide a cloud enable and it's scalable. And then using our strength to apply because, if you recall we also had the PCB business and also the 3D technology, so that we can really apply that into this 3D Solver and that is just a beginning on EM, electromagnetic field simulation area. And then stay-tuned, we have continued the development and investing in this space and is a big market $4.5 billion and customer love it. And so far the initial feedback from our potential customer and we highlight, too, that I endorse our approach and then to see the benefit of the performance and we're excited about it.And then finally, we're going to use that to the pervasive intelligence using the AI and machine learning. And then basically we're going to apply into, we call it the inside and outside. And inside basically using AI machine learning to drive performance improvement, productivity and performance improvement across all our product lines in term of EDA tools. And we already see significant improvement on that. And then finally we also working with our leading customer that using AI to optimize the flow and methodology, so that the customer can really drive the performance by machine learning, deep learning and other application and that's kind of our approach. -- Lastly, geographically, there's been some interesting trends in Japan, which for years as you know was quite weak and lost share in terms of total EDA. But for you, you've now seen a few quarters in a row of sequential improvement in Japan and year-over-year improvement in Japan on both a quarterly and trailing 12 basis. The question therefore is, are you beginning to redirect or grow your investments in Japan to sustain that growth, either with sales or AE or anything else? -- Yeah, good question. I think Japan is important market for us. In a couple of area, Japan is very strong and I just name a few, automotive they are very, very strong. And also I mentioned earlier that edged to industrial IoT, the microcontroller and there is a lot of controller collecting data. And then couple of key player in Japan that we are really excited to team up with them. And now also the whole videos surveillance consumer related area. And that AI machine learning can really play a role in it. And so I think that is a very important market and they are recovering very nicely. And then we're right now, we are engaging heavily with couple of key customer that we want to be the trusted partner going forward. -- Thanks, Lip-Bu. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. -- Hey guys. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling today. A couple of questions from our side. The first would be, so looking at the outperformance here in the quarter, seems like it's coming from the two areas that you called out were IP and hardware, which are typically the two more volatile areas for revenue. So, what is giving you the confidence then to raise the full-year guide above just this quarter's upside? That there's something in time based licenses that came in ahead of what you thought? Or, is the pipeline building better than what you thought? -- Yeah, I think Jackson, let me start first and then John will fill in. First of all, I kind of highlight that it's a very broad base strength across our product lines. And even though we highlight the hardware, we highlight the IP, we also highlight the digit growth 12%. And the other part is also very exciting for us is the custom analog system connect area and also it's a nice growth about 8% percent. And then we are excited about that we're investing in this whole system analysis is part of this analog custom interconnect system level and that area have been doing well. And so I think overall, I were to say that is across the board and then also some of the new -- newly developed products and that we already built into our guidance for the year. -- Hi, Jackson this is John. Yes, we had a very pleasing Q1 performance for IP, but of course IP is lumpy and probably benefits against a better compare against Q1 2018. On the hardware side, if you recall our functional verification revenue grew in the high teens in 2018. And the last time we spoke to you, we were expecting functional verification revenue in 2019 to be approximately flat year-over-year, with Q1 now behind us and with better visibility into the hardware pipeline, we are now expecting modest growth in our functional verification segment, despite the difficult compare we saw a pickup in demand in Q1 for our hardware products and we expect that to continue into Q2. -- Okay great. That's helpful. Follow-up question is kind of a two parter. So, the first being you've mentioned though the $30 billion TAM over the next few years, right? An expansion from the $10 billion that you've seen kind of in the past, what would you say, you currently I guess address of the incremental 20?And then, secondly obviously part of this is going to be the Clarity 3D Solver that was announced a couple of weeks ago, what do you see as the main or who I guess would you see as the main competitors for this Clarity 3D Solver? Thank you. -- Good questions. And we're excited about this TAM expansion that's one of the very important focus for Cadence. And so that's why we have this strategy on the -- that we call it the intelligent system design. And first of all I think clearly, our foundation continued to grow in term of design excellence all our EDA tools continue to drive the growth with the semiconductor company and also system company to drive differentiation.And then second part, we're starting to address, begin to address is that system innovation and so now clearly the opportunity in front of us is not this whole embedded system safety and security and our partnership with the Green Hill is very important part of our strategy. And then now we're starting to move into this system analysis space, so embedded space about $3 billion and market analysis is above now the -- clearly is a system analysis is about $4.5 billion. And so I think overall, we continue to marching forward, stay tuned and we're going to be -- over time, we're going to be highlight to you some of the success we have.And then clearly on the competition side, on the system analysis, there are a couple of them, I think, you're quite well-known. They have the more legacy solutions. And then but the customer over time, require increase on the system capacity and also ship less approach that mean that doing more simulation. And then larger design and that will require solutions that need more capacity and also higher performance and that really play into our strength in term of algorithm, expertise and massive distributing multiprocessing capability. And so I think those are the things that really we find a unique opportunity, a unique qualification we have to play in this market. -- All right. Thank you. -- Thank you.(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Jason Celino of KeyBanc. -- Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you hear me, right? -- Yeah, quite well. -- Yeah. -- Yeah, so good raise to the full year -- first half of 2019 guidance assumes kind of 11.7% growth and then decelerates kind of to the 6.7% for the second half. I appreciate your comments on kind of the updated hardware outlook. But how conservative is guidance still for 2019? -- I Jason, this is John. I mean everything we know is in our guidance. You're right, that the first half does look kind of flat compared to the second half. And that's mainly because of functional verification, which includes both software and hardware products. But that's quite lumpy and our visibility into demand for Q2 looks good, Q4 is a very tough compare though. -- Okay. And then as far as IP revenue for the quarter, I mean, you guys did post strong quarter. I mean how should we think about IP, as a whole growth wise for the full year? -- Well, we're very pleased with our IP results in Q1. But IP in Q1 benefits from a relatively easy compare versus Q1 2018. We're not guiding the individual product groups, but we're very pleased with our IP results for the first quarter. -- Yeah, couple of things we kind of positive about is Tensilica. The perforation adoption for the machine learning, vision, audio and also automotive consumer surveillance. We add new -- eight new customer. On the design IP said, clearly we have the 112 gig long-reach SerDes IP and this is a must have for the hyperscale infrastructure and we are just at the beginning of it and we are delighted marquee semiconductor company adopted. And then more to come and stay tuned and we'll have more update for you. -- Okay, thanks. Yeah, that answers all my questions. -- Great. Thank you.Your last question comes from Gal Munda of Berenberg. -- Hi, guys thanks for taking my question. Fhe first one is just, John maybe to clarify in terms of the guidance, one thing that has kind of change is the recognized revenue that's kind of estimated come over time the rateable revenue you're saying that it's the new guidance it's 85% to 90% versus previous around 90% is the main delta in the hardware products the way that this you've seen Q2 demand kind of turn out that the reason for it? -- Yes, Gal. Our often revenue comes predominantly from two main sources IP and the hardware part of our functional verification group. The expectation for better functional verification growth leads directly to that revision of our outlook for the recording revenue mix. We're now expecting high 80s for 2019. -- And then the second question is just linked to your cloud offering, you know, in the past your customers kind of like to mix and match different parts of the process. And when you move to the cloud, especially when you start doing design in the cloud, my question is, can tools still be matched as easy as previously promised? And if not, does that mean that potentially tools can -- can be more sticky? Or do you not expect any change in the workflows the way that have been managed in terms of the vendor side? -- So, Cadence cloud does not change our business model. It just offers our customers another way to optimize their investment in Cadence tools. We're not really expecting any, any difference in how our customers use our tools. -- And in some way we try to drive, you know, the performance and productivity for our customers by moving to the cloud, so that you can address the peak load and also you can parallel the distributed to the unlimited server that the cloud infrastructure provides and that is a tremendous value to our customers. -- Perfect. And just as a follow up on that, would you say that when you're seeing the adoption of the cloud in the future, would you expect that majority of it coming from adverse capacity like you mentioned from existing customers that potentially will invest less in their own infrastructure. What do you think that the new customer in the system companies or even the start-ups will account for a larger portion of that adoption in the future? -- It really depend on the customers, and they can use a hybrid, using their on-premise. And then when they address a peak load with the cloud, or they want to from scratch some other start-up, they want to be all cloud, we're also open to that. So, I think that's a lot of different models. And then we basically want to make it available to our customer, whatever they choose and make sure that is secure. And then make sure that can drive performance and productivity for them, that is our main driver for using the cloud. And basically, we are supporting them and they have option either customer manage, or you know, using the Cadence manage or the Palladium cloud. -- Okay. Thank you so much. -- Thank you. -- Thanks.We will now turn the call over to Lip-Bu Tan for closing remarks. -- Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. In summary, our business is mission-critical to assist to silicon development, which is a cornerstone of all these high activity. Through our strategy, we are capitalizing on multiple technology waves and further proliferating our solution with a broader base of customers. Next phase of our strategy, intelligent system design brings new opportunities in the design excellence, system innovation and pervasive intelligence, and an expanded total addressable market.In closing, I would like to thank all our shareholders, customers and partners, Board of Directors and our hardworking employees for their continued support.Thank you for participating in today's Cadence's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cadence Design Systems wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors in Cadence Design Systems Inc (Symbol: CDNS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the February 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 235 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDNS options chain for the new February 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $64.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDNS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $73.17/share today.\n\nBecause the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.43% return on the cash commitment, or 11.54% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $70.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.60.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CDNS stock at the current price level of $73.17/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $75.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.52% if the stock gets called away at the February 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDNS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CDNS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $75.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.02% boost of extra return to the investor, or 14.01% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 33%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 31%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $73.17) to be 30%.

This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount.The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the \"#1 site for screening stocks\" by Money Magazine. But powerful screening tools is just the start. That is why Zacks created the Screen of the Week to highlight profitable stock picking strategies that investors can actively use.Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar. They're virtually unknown to the general public. Yet today's 220 Zacks Rank #1 \"Strong Buys\" were generated by the stock-picking system that has more than doubled the market from 1988 through 2016.

This solution has been adopted by industry leaders such as NVIDIA  and IC provider Aquantia.The IC Validator NXT runs on the Design Rule Checking technology just like the previous generation validator and enables five times faster run-time with equally fewer CPUs during SoC (system on chip) integration among other key offerings.Dan Page, vice president, Design Group, Synopsys, said: \"As designers adopt 7-nanometer and newer technology nodes, physical verification closure within schedule is becoming a major challenge, and tapeout delays can have a significant impact on our customers' product lifetime revenue and profitability.\"Notably, IC Validator NXT has already been successfully deployed in the cloud by multiple customers to address their dynamic tapeout schedules.The IC Validator is an important component of Synopsys' Fusion Design Platform, which is witnessing a strong adoption among clients and is driving the company's top line. The platform contributed majorly to the 5% year-over-year increase in the company's Semiconductor & System Design revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.The IC Validator is a key product in Synopsys' core electronic design automation (EDA) family. A solid progress in fusion technology and platform roll-out is driving EDA revenues.However, the company faces tough competition from EDA vendors, such as Cadence Design Systems  and Mentor Graphics Corporation, now belonging to Siemens AG  . These companies offer products, focusing more on distinct phases of the IC design process and providing a range of services to companies throughout the world to help optimize respective product development processes among other things. The players' facilities could intensify rivalry, inducing soft prices and depleted profits for Synopsys.Nonetheless, we believe that the technological expertise and a strong hold in the market will help sustain the company's leadership and enable it to withstand stiff contest.Moreover, per a recent Technavio report, the global EDA market size is expected to grow by more than $3.67 billion during the 2019-2023 time period. This projection bodes well for Synopsys, a leading player in this space.Synopsys currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance.

We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance.

It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For CDNS, shares are up 1.75% over the past week while the Zacks Computer - Software industry is down 1.76% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 18.06% compares favorably with the industry's 1.64% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Cadence Design Systems have risen 46.75%, and are up 56.06% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 9.13% and 4.73%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to CDNS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. CDNS is currently averaging 2,217,723 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CDNS.Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CDNS's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.95 to $2.04 in the past 60 days.

This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount.The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable  .

The company recently inked two power purchase agreements (PPA) with EDP Renewables North America LLC to work on a wind energy project based out of Paulding County, OH.The two new deals, each spread over 15-years, bring in a total 125-megawatt (MW) of wind energy to Microsoft's renewable portfolio, which is now estimated to have reached 1.4 gigawatts.The Timber Road IV Wind Farm project is anticipated to commence operations in 2019. The facility is estimated to create around 200 jobs in the course of construction. The wind farm is also expected to generate local state economic income of $1.1 million annually.EDP Renewables North America LLC, a subsidiary of EDP Renewables SA (EDPR) is primarily engaged in developing sustainable energy solutions which involves operating wind farms and solar parks across North America. Notably, the latest Timber Road IV Wind Farm marks EDPR's fourth wind farm project based in Ohio.Strength in EDPR's sustainable energy solutions favors the prospects of the deal. The latest contracts are in sync with Microsoft's strategy to promote the usage of renewable energy in a bid to keep operating expenses under control and reduce carbon emission.In fact, Microsoft intends to achieve early 60% dependency on renewable energy for its power requirements by the end of 2020. Notably, the company has set an ambitious target to fuel 100% of its global energy needs through renewable resources like solar, geothermal & wind power, biogas and hydro power.Coming to price performance, shares of Microsoft have returned 16.3% in the past year outperforming the  's rally of 14.2%.Cloud computing is gradually gaining traction among the masses, given the convenience and security features it provides to the end user. Per an IDC report, global public cloud services' spending is estimated to reach $370 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 22.5%. Per the report, public cloud services' spending is expected to reach $210 billion in 2019, up 23.8% over 2018.In order to operate a cloud infrastructure, data centers are required, which in turn need steady and unwavering power supply to function properly.Given the growing demand for cloud, demand for datacenters and power is likely to increase in the future. To meet the power requirements, many major cloud players are turning to renewable sources of energy and Microsoft is no exception to the trend.Microsoft is one of the many notable companies that are undertaking significant investments in renewable energy. In fact, reports suggest that Microsoft's cloud platform Azure \"has been carbon-neutral since 2012.\"Moreover, the company has completed quite a few large-scale corporate PPAs to buy renewable energy. Notably, the Timber Road IV Wind Farm marks the company's fifth green energy focused venture in the larger PJM region in the United States.Further, the company recently entered into a 15-year PPA with Invenergy, by which it will be the single off-taker of the solar energy produced by Wilkinson Solar Energy Center.We note that dependence on renewable resources to cut down on operating costs is just another way to be more competitive and profitable, and Microsoft's decision to do so augurs well for the company in the long run.Other companies like Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Walmart, among others, are also seeking greater use of renewable energy in their operations. Notably, Apple and Alphabet owned Google have achieved 100% renewables target and are powered by green energy. Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") attained 50% dependency on renewable energy in January 2018, and has plans to hit the target of 100% in the longer haul.Going green initiatives by the big companies are expected to benefit overall environment with reduced global warming and fossil fuel consumption. Furthermore, the renewable project aids economic development of the states involved, which is like a cherry on the cake.Currently, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems, Inc  , Synopsys, Inc.  and Symantec Corporation  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

These additional notes once placed will be an unsecured senior liability of Qorvo. Notably, interest for these additional notes will be paid semi-annually.The notes have been offered to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A, which is exempted from registration requirements under the United States Securities Act of 1933. The company intends to utilize the proceeds of additional notes to address general corporate purposes.

Free cash flow during the quarter came in at $261 million.Notably, the company repurchased shares worth $152 million under the share repurchase program during the las  ed quarter.Qorvo has an excellen  surprise history. The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the prior four quarters, recording average positive surprise of 17.82%. We expect the company to record earnings growth of 5.2% and 3.5% in 2019 and 2020, respectively.Qorvo is benefiting from robust adoption of its wireless connectivity and base station solutions. Further, solid demand for Gallium Nitride (GaN) integrated front end modules for high-power applications bode well over the long haul.However, weakness in flagship smartphone product volumes and softness in China domestic market is an overhang at least in the near term. In fact, Qorvo anticipates Mobile Products revenues in the fourth quarter to be down roughly 25% sequentially, primarily owing to seasonal declines.Further, customer concentration, particularly from Apple  on account of lesser-than-expected demand of latest iPhones is a significant headwind for Qorvo.Currently, Qorvo carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems, Inc  and Symantec Corporation  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This combination is expected to deliver robust storage solutions to accelerate enterprise applications on cloud platforms.Reportedly, Matrix software offers \"the world's fastest parallel file system\", which strengthens the prospects of the alliance. Together with Western Digital's low-latency and high-performance NVMe platforms, the collaboration is well poised to deliver scalable and durable cloud storage solutions.Further, the companies aspire to provide cloud object storage solution with petabyte capacity to accelerate high performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) processes.Notably, Western Digital Capital, the company's investment arm, has made an investment in WekaIO for the project. The amount has been kept under wraps.We believe new initiatives to enhance its data center storage portfolio are likely to aid the company in reviving its fortunes and improve its competitive position against other storage players in the market. Notably, shares of Western Digital have returned 17.1% in the past three months, outperforming the  's rally of 11.8%.IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 175 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes), from 33 zettabytes in 2018. This exponential growth of data bodes well for Western Digital's enterprise storage solutions due to growing demand for faster processing of data.Per ResearchAndMarkets data, the global data center storage market is projected to increase at a CAGR of 11.8% from 2018 through 2022. Per MarketsandMarkets report, the non-volatile memory market is projected to witness a CAGR of 9.5% to reach approximately $82 billion by 2022.The aforementioned reports reflect robust demand for NVMe cloud storage systems in data centers, which in turn strengthen the prospects of the to-be-developed collaborative solution.Western Digital has not been doing well financially, of late. Uncertain macroeconomic environment, declining trend in PC shipments and softness in NAND flash pricing trends are adversely impacting financial results. Ballooning debt levels add to the woes.In second-quarter fiscal 2019, Data center devices and solutions segment revenues plummeted 25.1% year over year to $1.074 billion, owing to weakness in end-market. Moreover, the figure was down 25.7% sequentially. | The new collaboration on data center storage is anticipated to perk up adoption rate of company's NVMe solutions, consequently aiding top-line performance in the longer haul.Western Digital currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems, Inc  , Synopsys, Inc.  and Symantec Corporation  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Consequently, it enables Arm to develop processors (utilizing LPDDR5 technology) with reduced time to market.Notably, shares of Cadence have returned 48.2% in the past year, substantially outperforming the  's rally of 20.1%.Cadence is benefiting from robust adoption of the company's PCIe (peripheral component interconnect express) and DDR products in the IP segment. Moreover, the company is leaving no stone unturned to assist its customers in reducing time-to-market by accelerating their system-on-chip (\"SoC\") design processes.Furthermore, growing clout of Cadence's IP solutions particularly in the automotive end-market holds promise given the significant growth prospect of the advanced driver assistance systems (\"ADAS\") market, which is estimated to be worth $91.83 billion by 2025, according to data from MarketAndMarkets.Notably, in the las  ed quarter, the company had announced its latest DDR5 test chip.

Notably, the change in the guided range reflects unchanged mid-point of $1.327 billion.Per the press release, management notes that it is revising the range of revenues, as it is skeptical of whether there will be an addition or reduction in inventory levels at its distributors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.33 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 32.6%.Non-GAAP earnings per share have now been forecast in the range of $1.30-$1.49 per share, compared with the previous guided range of $1.26-$1.53. In this case as well, the change in the guided range reflects unchanged midpoint of $1.395 per share.Notably, in the past couple of months, analysts have become increasingly cautious on Microchip's financial performance with estimates moving south and no movement in the opposite direction.In fact, in the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earningsmoved down 10.9% to $1.31 per share. The consensus estimates indicate decline of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.Microchip's CEO, Steve Sanghi believes that excluding further negative developments pertaining to trade war between the United States and China, \"the March 2019 quarter will mark the bottom of the current cycle for Microchip.\"Coming to share price performance, Microchip stock has plunged 7.1% in the past year, compared with  's decline of 4.4%.The company provided no other updates on the remaining financial metrics. Per the previous guidance, management anticipated non-GAAP gross margin in the 61.2-61.8% range. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of sales, are projected at 25.8-26.5%, and operating margin is expected at 34.7-36%.Microchip's inventory days in the impending quarter are expected between 123 and 133 days. Capital expenditures are estimated in the range of $50 million.Microchip delivered third-quarter fiscal 2019 non-GAAP earnings of $1.66 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $1.57 per share. The figure was also above the higher end of management's guided range of $1.49-$1.64 per share and surged from $1.36 per shares reported in the year-ago quarter.The year-over-year upside was driven by higher net sales, increasing 42.4% from the year-ago quarter to $1.416 billion on a non-GAAP basis. The figure also marginally outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.402 billion and was toward the higher end of management's guided range of $1.362-$1.438 billion. The company benefited from robust demand for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers.Microchip's strength in microcontroller business holds promise in the longer haul. We believe the company is well poised to capitalize on Microsemi's growth catalysts. Apart from a robust portfolio, the buyout is likely to expand Microchip's total addressable markets.However, management remains cautious over few emerging concerns. Increasing lead time, slim demand trends in ZTE and Bitcoin business domains are headwinds. Further, significant exposure to Asian markets amid imposition of tariff owing to trade war between the United States and China remains an overhang.Furthermore, unfavorable movement in exchange rates continue to adversely impact the top line of the company and undermine its growth potential to some extent.

GARP investing employs popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio - to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the \"#1 site for screening stocks\" by Money Magazine. But powerful screening tools is just the start. That is why Zacks created the Screen of the Week to highlight profitable stock picking strategies that investors can actively use.Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar.

GARP investing employs popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio - to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable  .

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 6 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cadence Design Systems Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $50.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $54.00. The standard deviation is $1.505.But the whole reason to look at the  CDNS price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CDNS crossing above that average target price of $51.33/share, investors in CDNS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $51.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

The results marked a year-over-year improvement.For the fiscal first quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the $775-$810 million range. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected within 95 cents to a penny.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings per share is pegged at $796.7 million and 97 cents, respectively.Let's see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Synopsys is gaining traction from a solid uptick across all product groups and geographies. Its sustained focus on introducing products, acquisitions and deal wins is likely to continue boosting results.Robust trends in the core electronic design automation (EDA) market, driven by a consistent chip and system complexity, is a positive. The company's digital design tools, aided by a strong performance across its Fusion design platform, are helping it generate solid revenue growth.Demand for Synopsys' hardware-based Zebu emulation system is also encouraging. Also, sturdy growth in both the IP and Software Integrity segments is setting the stage for further expansion. The company is looking into both organic investments and key buyouts to diversify its customer base, thus expanding its total addressable market.Management noted that the company's purchases of Cigital and Black Duck are establishing tactical quality relations with clients, leading to higher demand creation, cross-selling and a substantial rise in brand recognition.However, U.S.-China trade tensions and slowing smartphone demand are a major threat to semiconductor market, which makes us grow anxious about Synopsys's near-term results.Further, increasing costs and expenses are an overhang on the company's margins.

The all cash deal is expected to close by Jan 31, 2019.The latest deal is in line with Autodesk's strategy to offer end-to-end construction management solution. The addition of BuildingConnected's bid management platform improves the company's visibility into new construction projects and bidding phase. Autodesk's customers can use the tools to save time and money.Moreover, BuildingConnected's network of more than 700,000 construction professionals' helps general contractors to find and hire qualified contractors for their projects. Further, the company offers TradeTapp, a subcontractor risk analysis platform, and Bid Board Pro, a platform that helps subcontractors manage and win more bids.The addition of these solutions expands and strengthens Autodesk's construction portfolio. The company's focus on connecting construction processes across designs, buildings and operations is a major long-term growth driver.BuildingConnected will be integrated into Autodesk's construction solutions team that includes Autodesk BIM 360, Revit, AutoCAD, PlanGrid and Assemble Systems. The deal will help Autodesk further penetrate the construction market, which is currently worth $10 billion.BuildingConnected is expected to have no material impact on fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. For fiscal 2020, Autodesk expects immaterial contribution from BuildingConnected toward annualized recurring revenues (ARR). However, it is expected to be slightly dilutive to profitability and cash flow.Notably, in the last reported quarter (third-quarter fiscal 2019), total ARR jumped 33% from the year-ago quarter to $2.53 billion. Cloud business ARR increased 36%, driven by robust BIM 360 sales that added 53,000 subscribers. Moreover, subscription plan ARR surged 108% year over year to $1.93 billion, driven by growth in enterprise business agreement (EBA). | For fiscal 2019, Autodesk maintained its earlier guidance for subscription additions of 500-550K. Total ARR growth is still expected to be 30-31%.Acquisitions like BuildingConnected,  and Assemble Systems expand Autodesk's portfolio. The company is also benefiting from rapid adoption of the BIM 360 product that is rapidly replacing legacy document management tools and preconstruction planning software. In fact, Autodesk expects BIM 360 to encompass the entire construction process from start to finish over the next five years.Moreover, Autodesk is benefiting from solid growth in product subscriptions and the surging maintenance-to-subscription program.

Copies of today's press release dated February 19th, 2019 for the quarter ended December 29th, 2018, related financial tables and the CFO commentary are also available on our website.Now I'll turn the call over to Lip-Bu. -- Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for 2018, delivering 10% year-over-year revenue growth and 30% non-GAAP operating margin with broad-based strength across our product lines. While the overall macro environment remain mixed, we remain confident in the technology trends including AI machine learning, cloud data center and 5G that continue to drive strong design activity.Our System Design Enablement strategy is to continue growing our core EDA and IP business; broaden our reach in system companies and targeted verticals; and importantly expand into newer adjacent areas. I'm delighted to report that we have continued to make significant progress in all these areas. We achieved strong growth across our product lines in our core business, which included a breakthrough while wide ranging win with a marquee US semiconductor company.In Q4 we expanded our relationship with Samsung, through their broader adoption of our digital, custom and verification products. We expanded our long-term partnership with analog devices for their development of mixed-signal solutions for IoT, automotive, medical and industrial applications, including the adoption of several of our new digital and verification products. We made good progress in vertical segments, such as the data center cloud, automotive and particularly in aerospace and defense.We have won business with some of the top companies in this space, including GE Aviation and BAE Systems. And we finish the year with major core EDA and IP contract with a major aerospace and defense contractor. Earlier in the year we won a significant research contract with DARPA and have made very good progress developing advanced machine learning technologies to enhance automation and productivity. And as we look at expanding beyond EDA, I'm very excited about our new strategic partnership with the Green Hills Software.Cadence invested about $150 million in Green Hills, representing a ownership interest of approximately 16%. Our investment is important because safety and security are some of the greatest concerns in the increasingly hyper-connected world, especially in the critical industries such as aerospace and defense, automotive and medical.Green Hills is the leading player in the embedded safety and security software space with its INTEGRITY-178B real-time operating system, having been certified to EAL 6 plus the highest common criteria security level achieved for an operating system. Green Hills products are broadly deployed across multiple application domains, particularly in aerospace and defense. With customers include Boeing and Lockheed Martin and in automotive, with many top OEM and Tier 1 customers, including Toyota and Ford.We expect to leverage the strength of both companies to drive embedded system security and safety. Open up new market opportunities and accelerate growth for both companies. I will review other highlights for Q4 and 2018 beginning with functional verification which remains the fastest growing challenge for our customers. Cadence verification suite had a good 2018 with revenue growth in the high teens, led by strong demand for Palladium Z1. Palladium Z1 won 22 new customers during the year with significant expansions at several existing customers.And Protium, our FPGA based prototyping solution also grew steadily. Growing adoptions of our Xcelium simulator was highlighted by several market shipping customers, expanding their commitment to our technology during the year. The IP outsourcing trend continued, and strong execution of our refined IP strategy delivered double-digit growth for our IP business in 2018.Tensilica had a good year with strong loyalty growth and we maintained our lead in audio applications with growing adoption in vision and key wins in automotive surveillance and augmented reality applications. We have engaged with several customers for our new Tensilica DNA 100 processor which is ideal for embedded inferencing applications, and will be generally available to customers in the first half of the year. For the cloud data center market, earlier in the year we announced the first DDR5 test chip. And in Q4 we begin selling our new 112-gig long-reach 30 IP in 7-nanometer technology.On digital and finance, we're particularly pleased with the growing proliferation of our solutions at the most advanced nodes, with market-shaping customers. We grew our relationship with MediaTek to include the full digital flow from synthesis through Signoff. Customers tape out more than 80 7-nanometer designs in 2018, using our digital solutions and we had 23 full flow wins.We are actively engaged with very early adopter customers on their 5-nanometer designs. And we delivered two 3-nanometer test chips in 2018. On the custom analog front we have growing adoptions of both our Virtuoso RF and photonic solutions. And one of the very last remaining large customers that was not using our flagship Virtuoso Layout solution committed to adopting it.Last June we introduced Cadence Cloud in collaboration with major cloud industry players; Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. We are pleased with the adoption momentum as we continue to lead the industry transition to the cloud. Now before turning it over to John let me quickly summarize my comments.Continued execution of our System Design Enablement strategy, led to a broad strength across our product lines and particularly in aerospace and defense vertical. I'm very excited about our new strategic partnership with Green Hills Software, the leader in embedded safety and security software. And it was a good year for our verification suite products and as well as our IP business.With that, I will now turn the call over to John, to review the financial results and provide our outlook. -- Thanks Lip-Bu and good afternoon everyone. Cadence exceeded all of its key operating metrics and delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018. Before we get into Q4 results, let me remind you that Cadence adopted the new revenue accounting standard known as ASC 606 for fiscal 2018. The numbers I present today for our fourth quarter and 2018 are based on these new rules unless otherwise stated. 2018 was our transition year to ASC 606. And to provide a more direct comparison against our 2017 results we show our quarterly and annual results under both sets of rules for 2018.Now let's go through the key results for the fourth quarter and the year starting with the P&L. As reported, total revenue was $570 million for the quarter and $2.138 billion for the year. Q4 and 2018 both benefited from the shift in timing of revenue recognized on some hardware systems that we previously expected to deliver in 2019. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was just over 31% for the fourth quarter and just over 30% for the year. GAAP EPS was $0.35 for the quarter and $1.23 for the year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.52 for the quarter and $1.87 for the year.For the old rules which can be directly compared to 2017, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $579 million and $2.146 billion for the year. And also benefited from the earlier-than-expected delivery of hardware systems in Q4 2018. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was just over 30% for both Q4 and the year. GAAP EPS was $0.36 for the quarter and $1.25 for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.51 for the quarter and $1.88 for the year. The recurring revenue mix for the full year was approximately 90%. The mix for Q4 was approximately 85% slightly lower than usual, due to the extra hardware systems delivered in Q4.Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash totaled $533 million at year-end. Toward the end of December we drew down $100 million on our revolving credit facility to fund the investment in Green Hills Software. As a result, debt outstanding at quarter-end was $450 million. Operating cash flow in Q4 was $132 million and $605 million for the full year. DSOs were 48 days. Under the old rules, DSOs were 46 days. Our DSO target for 2019 remains 45 days. And during Q4, we repurchased $100 million of Cadence shares.Now for our guidance, note that we had completed the transition to the new revenue accounting rules. So going forward all numbers will be reported on an ASC 606 basis. For fiscal 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.31 billion representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint compared to 2018. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31%. GAAP EPS in the range of $1.33 to $1.43, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.97 to $2.07.We expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $640 million to $690 million, and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence common stock during 2019. For Q1 we expect revenue in the range of $565 million to $575 million. Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.36 to $0.38; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.50.You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available in our website. In conclusion, I'm pleased with our execution, financial performance and progress across all of our businesses. Our investments are paying-off and our System Design Enablement strategy is driving results and creating value for customers and shareholders.And with that operator, we'll now take questions.(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Congratulations on the solid results. Gentlemen, I just want to go through the gross margin for December and then how we should think about it in March? For the December quarter was that all just the impact of having higher hardware sales or was there anything else going on in there? And as you looked at the mix toward the March quarter, I know you gave us, up margin guidance but how do we -- we think about gross margin sequentially in the March? -- Yeah, John, gross margins consistently being like 90% or 91% every quarter and it dropped to 88% for Q4. That was entirely due to the shift in Palladium Z1 hardware shipments that shifted from 2019 into 2018. For Q1 and for 2019 we do expect to go back to normal. -- That's helpful. And then Lip-Bu, maybe I can ask you the question you guys continue to put up solid results. And I think one of the strength of your model in the EDA industry is just the lack of volatility, despite some of the volatility that your customers are enjoying or going through right now. If you look at the guidance for growth for this fiscal year of about 7% year-over-year, how do you think that's being impacted by the macro, by some of the uncertainties in China? What could it be, if you think some of these (technical difficulty) kind of resolve themselves? And what end markets that you participate -- you think, you being most impacted by the macro backdrop right now? -- Thanks, John for the questions. And clearly we have less volatility because we are very focused on the design, front-end of the development. And even though the environment kind of mixed but we remain confident that in some of these AI machine learning, cloud data center, 5G autonomous driving, they are driving a very strong design activity and especially we are very focused on the market-shaping customer and then also in other STEs strategy that we put in place, that provide not only the opportunity into the system and the vertical markets that we serve and that open up a tremendous opportunity for us, so that we can drive better success and engaging with our deep leading customer.And in term of the end market impact, clearly Asia Pacific is a very good opportunity and good growth for us. We can continue to benefit that. And then so some of these challenges that we see, we're much more in the design front-end. So we don't see some of this manufacturing impact -- some of the company we have. -- And John, it's John Wall here. You'll see some revenue mix by geography information on Page 4 of our CFO commentary. On that, you'll see that Asia ticked up to 28% for 2018. Of that 28%, just under 10% of that was from China, I know you asked that in the last call. -- Perfect. Thanks guys. Congratulations. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just really had two. The first one is actually just focusing on the hardware. So obviously you guys gave out a very, very good full year guide but what is embedded in terms of hardware assumptions there? I'm not looking for exact numbers, but I mean it's been kind of three or four years in the cycle now, and so what's kind of the expectation of that business relative to the rest of core EDA? -- Yeah, so let me get started first. Clearly the functional verification is very challenging for our customers, as I mentioned. And then we really providing the Cadence verification suite and that providing a very nice platform for our customer, providing the whole verification suite, not just the hardware and also the Xcelium, the Jasper, the VIP, for the whole package, turn out to be very compelling for customer. And on the hardware side, we have a great 2018 and we won 22 new consumers. The demand is very strong from our existing customer to increase the capacity.And for the advanced node design, customers just love that scale and more predictable and find the but earlier and that's critical for their design. -- And Mitch, in related to your question with regard to what's included in guidance for 2019 -- I mean 2018 was a very strong year for functional verification. And of course it benefited from that shift of hardware revenue that we thought -- we were originally expecting to deliver in 2019 and we delivered it in 2018. So that's going to give, make 2019 a tough compare for functional verification. -- Got it. And then secondly in terms of the margins here, I mean you guys have been above 30% now twice in a row. I guess you kind of had a longer-term target being around this range, so I mean, is it essentially coming up now, if you guys get a higher revenue base, let's say three or four years out? -- Yes, Mitch, we are very pleased with our results for 2018. I feel very confident and happy with our guidance for 2019. And actually there was an operating margin impact of that shift in hardware revenue from 2019 and into 2018 on both years, but we're very pleased with the progression we're making. -- Got it. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Valera from Needham & Company. -- Thank you. Understanding Lip-Bu that you've seen really good demand in the AI and I think autonomous electrified vehicle areas. Both of those areas have had a lot of start-ups that have emerged over the last few years. I'm just wondering with some of the market turmoil and weaker demand particularly in China, have you seen any of those start-ups experience stress or potential attrition in the current environment? -- Yeah. So I think, Rich, it's a good question. AI machine learning is very near to my heart, because I think we're moving into this data-driven economy. And its very broad application to medical, to the data center, to the intelligent and energy management and across all the vertical. And so the impact is significant. And we addressing not just for the start-ups. I think start-up, I think you saw some of them raise a lot of money, the (inaudible) and many others. And so I think they're continue to do well.We haven't seen any shakeout yet, and then -- because the application market is so big. And on the other hand some of the very big company, that in the hyperscale player and also some of the system player, they are deploying massively into the AI machine learning R&D development, we're delighted to support them with our tool and IP. And clearly we have a lot to offer. Beside our two EDA tool, we actually apply the machine learning into our tool. We see significant improvement on that and customer love it, and encouraging us continue to go (ph) down on it. And other part is clearly our Tensilica, they turn out to be a very, very important for the embedded inference applications and also for the augmented reality applications. So the DNA 100 have been very well received. We're excited about it. So I think overall stay tuned, I think this AI machine learning impact is going to be a new compute, not only the training and also the inference side. -- Got it. And then maybe this if for you John, I wonder if you could give us the growth rates for the functional verification and IP segments in 4Q? And then if you would be willing to say, with respect to 2019 where you'd expect them to grow relative to the 7% that you put out as sort of the corporate bogey? -- Sure, Rich. Yeah, I mean for functional verification, it was high-teens that -- for actually it was high-teens for functional verification and mid-to-high teens for IP for the year-end 2018. Let's see for the -- and then in relation to next year, I think keeping the point out here is that, we pretty much in inline quarter for Q4, with the addition of that hardware shift, that came out of 2019 into 2018 (ph). So therefore for 2019, I think the knock-on impact there is, we think it's a tough compare for a functional verification, but we think the rest of the businesses should all perform strongly to get us to average at 7%. -- Got it. Okay. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good afternoon. So first quick question for John. When I look at the guidance, the non-GAAP guidance it looks like there is an unusually high impact from taxes going from GAAP to non-GAAP. Curious what was behind that? -- I'll have to get back to you, on that Tom. -- Yeah. Okay. All right. And then maybe Lip-Bu, it sounds like you had some nice wins in the aerospace/defense market. How big is that market for your core products? And what is it behind your products? Or what enabled you to gain some share in that space? -- Yeah, so I think clearly we are excited in aerospace and defense space area. This is a vertical that we had targeted. And we don't have the breakdown in term of the market potential, but you can see that there is a lot of activity, especially in the AI machine learning development. That's why we are excited about our contract with DARPA and also we have couple of very significant customer, they are working with us. And we mentioned a couple of them that we have successful. And then also we signed a very big major aerospace and defense contract with a full significant EDA and IP contract. So I think overall we will be excited about this vertical. We kind of focused on three verticals; car data center, automotive and aerospace and defense. And so this is the one that we have a very good 2018. -- And Tom, just come back to you on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP tax impact. It's mainly to do with share-based compensation, but with the share price doing so well this year we picked up a lot of share-based comp expense that we could use in our tax return. But that's not in our non-GAAP results but it's in our GAAP results. -- Okay, that is helpful. And finally when you look at the Green Hills acquisition, and it sounds like their initial focus is on the aerospace/defense market as well. It sounds like, it's your belief that, with this technology, kind of developed for this really security critical space that you're moving over into the cloud and to their automotive sectors, is where (inaudible) goes eventually? -- Yeah, Tom I think first of all, this is not an acquisition and this is a strategic investment, that we're making of $150 million investment for 16% of the company, and I'll join the Board. And I think this is something that we are very excited. First of all, it tie in very well with our system design enablement strategy. And that we now, we try to expand beyond our core business. This embedded software is the nearest adjacency and this is a next level up to the system stack being close tied to the underwriting hardware. And then this is exploring the new opportunity for us, that's above $3 billion estimate, $3 billion embedded system safety and security.And then with this hyper-connected wall, this safety and security become a critical challenge for many of the industry, especially the critical industry like the aerospace, automotive, industrial and medical. They are very well positioned, as I mentioned in my script that they have been certified at the highest EAL 6 plus security level. And so we are very excited. This will open up a lot of door for us, in term of combining the Green Hills and Cadence expertise and that providing that very unique differentiating value to our customer and shareholders. -- Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it. Thanks. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Good evening. Lip-Bu, could you talk about the evolution of your mix of semiconductor and systems customers over the last couple of years? And perhaps more importantly talk about any discernible differences in, how you serve those customers or how they behave as customers in terms of buying patterns? What they select in terms of their total mix, one versus the other? We also noticed that over the last year you have been significantly increasing your openings for AEs which is suppose the case in EDA, but especially so for you over the last year, would that for instance be largely connected to your systems business, particularly domestically? Or is that a broader requirement for AEs globally? And then I had a follow-up. -- Yeah, thanks so much Jay for the two very important questions. So first question you have about the semiconductor to the system company and even service provider, the differences of supporting them. Clearly they are all demanding customer. We love them. And in terms of system companies there are some differences. They are looking at the total performance, power envelope and a system modeling and requirement. And we are very well positioned for providing that. Beside the EDA tool, we also have the packaging PC board layout and system modeling and system simulation. That is very, very compelling for them to come to us.And then the other part, we also understanding their requirement better in terms of how to serve them and support them. And then they are very much time-to-market is more important to them. And then we able to meet their schedule, meet their timetable and then deliver the product from the system level they're more comprehensive and that they are satisfying the requirement that is critically important to them. And then also as you can tell, many of our service provider, they also building up their silicon and subsystem ASIC model to meet their requirement. And we're excited about doing that.So I think overall, we have both semiconductor and systems side we are doing very well. The semiconductor side, I highlight a couple of them. Samsung, clearly broader adoptions of our tool. MediaTek adopting our full digital flow from synthesis to Signoff. And of course we are very, very excited about our marquee semiconductor US company. And that explain to you why we have increased of the rec (ph) for the AE, because the demand requirement to support this iconic game changing opportunity for us, we have to support them. And then in a very timely fashion, we have to meet their requirement on performance and then scalability. And that's why we increasing our AE support that we need to drive the success here. -- As follow-up you mentioned Protium and Xcelium but could you speak more broadly about the momentum you're seeing would be (inaudible) portfolios for instance Genus, Pegasus, Tempus, Voltus. Is the momentum you're seeing in digital largely Innovus (ph) for PNR? Or are you in fact seeing broad adoption of the other newer products in digital that you've introduced over the last few years? -- Yeah, so I think it's a good questions. And clearly we mentioned earlier the hardware emulation and the Protium also it steadily are increasing adoptions. We're very pleased with that. In terms of the digital flow, clearly I think you had point out our Innovus place and route is very successful. Very many leading market-shaping customer are adopting them. And then we also excited about, for example MediaTek from Synthesis Genus, to all the way to Tempus and also same thing with Samsung, broader adoption for our full digital flow and that we are excited about.So I think in that, we kind of want to be the best of tool in every category and beside the place and route, sometimes it take time, to the maturity and now our Synthesis Genus, I think to take-off. And then, now our Signoff starting to take-off, because that is a very critical in terms of production. Signoff is very critical, it take a little bit longer time. Finally, I think we'd turn the corner. We have 23 full flow win for 2018, stay tuned. We are working very hard on 2019. We have more to exciting to share with you as the time go by. -- Thanks very much. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Gal Munda from Berenberg Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, I'd just like to expand a bit on what Jay said and be a bit more specific just in terms of the contribution in the growth of each, semi versus systems. How have you seen that developing in 2018? And maybe if you can kind of share maybe, John, what proportion of revenue today represents versus maybe last few years? -- Yeah. I think as I mentioned earlier both are doing very well for us. The semiconductor side as you can tell, over time we will share with you some of the marquee and market-shaping customer. They are the leader in their sector and we are winning and we are broadly proliferating in the most advanced notes. Clearly because of the performance, the scalability, the PPA and runtime, and they are very happy to see the performance we have, using the parallelism and also using our AI machine learning approach. And now moving to the cloud, and that they can see significant improvement in the scalability to look for.On the system and service provider, we are very excited. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us and we are engaging heavily and stay tune from time-to-time we will highlight our success. Stay tuned. -- And Gal, the mix of our business that comes from systems companies is approximately 40%. That's been pretty consistent over the last two or three years. That's because the system's business is growing but so is our semiconductor business. -- That makes sense. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up I'd like to focus a bit on the cloud obviously which is growing probably very fast. If you can maybe help us from a lower base and just like to understand what the base is now? And how do you think this opportunity to grow maybe in the mid-term, how big the addressable market is? Thank you. -- Yeah. We mentioned earlier, last June in that deck, this is the largest industry conference and exhibition. And we launched our Cadence Cloud with three major leaders; Amazon, Microsoft and Google. We are excited about that partnership in collaboration. We have adoption momentum and we are very pleased with that. And clearly we're taking the lead in terms of industry transition to the cloud. And it's not just for the sake of cloud, it's really focused on driving the performance and the productivity for our customers. And we work very close with our customer with the selected cloud enabler and so that we are providing and really focused on driving the performance and productivity of our customer, and provide them the security that it can scale within the organizations (ph). -- Okay. Do you maybe have an idea of what proportion of the workloads in the future kind of move on to the cloud for those customers? Or is that kind of we'll have to wait and see? -- I think you have to wait and see, because it's still early, only last June. And we have growing momentum of adoptions. And we want to make sure that we really drive the performance and productivity from the customer. And then clearly the simulation characteristics work load is now quite broadly adopted by some of the customer to the cloud. And then the Palladium Cloud is also happening. So we kind of doing, two-by-two and then driving the performance and just make sure that our customers see the benefit of having that. -- Thank you very much. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Mobley from Benchmark. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions about your IP business. The first one relates to, well it's just really more of a verification of growth in the IP business. That roughly $8 million revenue haircut from ASC 606 was almost all of that in the IP business and hence with the growth of the IP business has been more like 13% versus 12%? -- So Gary, the IP business grew 16% in 2018 -- approximately 16% in 2018. And in terms of the shift from 605 to 606, that's the $8 million, the reason that it's $8 million and not $40 million as we talked earlier in the year, was because we kind of underestimated our ability to write business under the new rules, in a very, very consistent revenue timing way. So we ended up with very much the same revenue timing. So the $8 million difference was kind of spread across all businesses, it wasn't all IP in the end. -- Okay. Alright, that's helpful. And with respect to the proliferation of open source process or IP, how is that impacting the ability to license it in Tensilica course with RISC-V and midst now being open architected options out there? How from a strategic standpoint do you guard against or invest in this adoption of open source? -- Yeah, I think clearly, Tensilica is a very strong position in the audio, as I mentioned. And I now moving into vision and also automotive, so variance and augmented reality. So it really depend on the applications. And in some cases we coexist, and in some cases, we shine. And so, clearly we are excited about our IP, it is a double-digit growth plus, and then the Tensilica DNA 100 is very well received for the embedded processing. And then RISC-V is another architecture, and our tool support all the different architecture. And so we are coexisting very well. We support them.And then, the IP is, we embrace open source and then clearly we support any different architecture. But more really, right now we are moving toward, I call it, to remain specific workload-specific processor and application. And so we open with that. And also I think the other big opportunity is this high-speed connectivity. So the high-speed SerDes 112 gig SerDes, at the 7-nanometer for the long reach that is very well received. And in the data center and cloud this is a must-have and it's silicon proven. We're excited about that opportunity also. -- Okay, alright. Thank you guys. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Monika Garg from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking my question. First I'm looking for more details on your partnership with Green Hills. What are you looking to achieve with the partnership? Could you talk about products what you're looking to develop with them? And when do you expect revenue contribution from this? -- Yeah, so Monica first of all, I'm very excited about this and I call it a world-class toward the security and safety embedded system. And clearly they have a lot to offer. These are real-time operating system and also software development tools. And either way and then with this very proprietary partitional (ph) architecture that protecting what you already need to protect in a very highly reliable security and performance. And we're excited about it, and we take ownership in it.I just joined the Board and we are exploring a couple of area of collaborations. First of all, is the go-to-market. This is a very good software and then how do we proliferate into some of the different vertical, defense and aerospace clearly is their stronghold. And besides that clearly in the automotive and medical there is many area that we can explore how to go-to-market. And then secondly, the technology collaborations in term of clearly we are the industry leader in providing the end-to-end EDA and semiconductor IP solution. They are very strong in embedded safety and security software solution, that denote -- that each one bringing something really unique and we can leverage our respective strength and collaborate in multiple fronts.In terms of the technology collaborations, clearly we can explore a collaboration with our verification suite, our IP and others, so that we can serve our system vertical markets together in a more effective way. And also we can also look at some of the joint core marketing activity in the future. So all this is now, we just have this agreement finalized and we have a multiple meeting to explore how can we do and how do we prioritize that, so that we can really increase the revenue from both companies. And I'm excited about it. And then the consumer that we exposed to, can't wait to get us together to work on it. And so something that we stay tuned and then we will be report as we go. -- Alright. Thanks. Then John, you just posted 10% goal for 2018, but you're guiding 7% midpoint for 2019. Are you being conservative? I mean even if I adjust for $15 million revenue from emulation from 2018 to 2019, you're still in kind of there like 9% less than 2018 and guiding like 7.5%-ish for 2019? -- Yeah, Monika, I think the thing to remember there is that a shift in hardware revenue from 2019 to 2018 while it benefits 2018, has doubled the impact on 2019. Like I say, it was an inline quarter with the exception of that so you're talking about a $20 million shift from 2019 into 2018. It's got a 1% impact to revenue growth for 2018. So without it we'd be closer to 9% revenue growth in 2018, but has double the impact, it's like a $40 million swing on 2019. 2019 would be 9% revenue growth, if that $20 million of hardware revenue had fallen into 2019 instead of 2018. -- Got it. And then if I look generally CapEx for Cadence has -- is somewhere around $60-ish million range but you are guiding to $90 million 9-0 for 2019. Kind of any specific hard expenses for 2019, you're thinking about? -- Yes, that's correct Monika. That we are investing in R&D and field engineering resources to support expansion of our footprint and market-shaping customers. And that's what you're seeing flow through there on the CapEx side. -- Does it should normalize back to $60-ish million range by 2020 then? -- Well it's hard to say. We're not guiding 2020 right now. -- Got it. Then the last one, I mean we have seen very strong operating margin improvement last two years, almost 400 bps. You are guiding to 50 bps to 100 bps for 2019, is that the way to think about longer-term margin expansion? Thank you so much. -- Again we're not guiding beyond 2019 and everything we know is included in our guidance. -- Alright. Thank you.Thank you. Our final question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, thanks. Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of questions here. One of the questions I still get a lot from investors is helping them understand as they go through the earning season and see the differing results whether it'd be AMD on one end or Nvidia on the other end. Can you help give a sense as to your exposures across the semi-landscape? And how they should put that into context? -- Sterling, that's a good question. And as I mentioned earlier, it is a very mixed environment. Clearly we are supporting the customer and we are clearly the leader in the industry. And so far we are very happy with our engagement with them. And they are the leader in their sector so we kind of highlight to you, that is our high priority to support that. In terms of the exposure, I think we heavily engaging with some of these leading sector. AI machine learning that I mentioned earlier, the cloud data center, infrastructure that we are very well positioned there.And clearly in automated driving on the Tier 1 and OEM, and then also the 5G, some of the leading customer and we are engaging and ranging from cellphone all the way to the infrastructure provider. And so overall, I think we are well positioned, we are very diversified, very broad in term of our customer base. And clearly -- the new area that we are excited is the whole FTE System Design Enablement, that we are increasing our system companies and also some of the vertical market, like aerospace, defense. And then clearly the automotive side we have a lot of success there. And then also clearly one thing that over time we're going to be also expanding is a medical related, that's not a big area of opportunity for us. So overall I think we are very broad, we don't expose to any specific sector or specific company. And then the design activity remain very strong across semiconductor system and vertical market. -- Alright, great. The other hot topic in terms of conversations, is what synopsis reported their fourth quarter, they came out and gave a three-year margin target. And I think one of the earlier questions on the call was alluding to. I just want to hit it head on. You guys were one of the first ones to give a margin target back when you started your subscription transition all the way back in 2008. Given the success that you've had and over 30% operating margins as you pointed out is there a thought in -- when if you decide to might we expect you to come out and kind of give an update to a new long-term target whether it would be three years in the future or five years et cetera? -- Yeah, Sterling very good questions. If you are following me for the last 10 years, I will continue to guide you at the time that we see it. And if you'll recall we initially guiding you from a very disaster year 2008 and 2009. And then -- then we starting to point to 13 and then point to the mid-20 and then now we are reaching 30. And then stay tuned. And at the right time we will highlight to you where we are going. We continue to drive efficiency, R&D, G&A in every sector and then meanwhile we also continue to invest for the success for the long-term shareholder. And clearly you can see that we have been investing in the right place and you can see that our digital implementation has lot of success right now. Our custom analog continue to be at the leadership. And we're investing in the future in the 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer with a leading customer.We are moving to the cloud and we're moving to the SDE and then we also focus on some of the vertical systems and service provider and those big investment. And so we continue to drive efficiency and drive success. And then with the AE support, stay tuned, when the right time comes we will guide you the longer-term operating margin that we like to shoot for. -- Excellent. Just one little housekeeping question for John. The Green Hills investments I didn't catch, how does this actually get accounted for? What will we actually see in the non-GAAP income statement in terms of where it's accounted? And I think just general sense of the revenue run rate at Green Hills at the moment? -- Sterling, we're not disclosing anything about our revenue run rate at Green Hills, they're a private company. But we'll account for the investment in Green Hills using the equity method of accounting. So you'll see our portion of Green Hills results flow through the other income and expense line for GAAP only. So it won't be in our non-GAAP results. Green Hills is profitable as a broad based to top customers and especially proliferate -- and is especially proliferate in industries where the highest levels of safety and security are required which is aerospace and defense and automotive. But, yeah, there will be nothing in our non-GAAP results, it will show up in GAAP only, on our other income and expense line. -- Got it. Thank you guys. -- Right. Thank you.Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys, thanks for putting me back in. Just really quickly, one of the other topical items has been the kind of the US-China trade dynamics. Have you guys seen any change in terms of your sales there or any sort of, I guess different negotiations? Or is it still essentially business as usual? -- Yeah. I think Mitch, good question. We have been well in China and we continue to representing, continue to representing a growing opportunity. And China remain committed to build out on domestic semiconductor industry. And so we are well positioned there and we are supporting our global customer throughout. So I think stay tuned. Business as usual, and we continue to support our customers. -- Mitch, we've seen steady growth in revenue in China. If you -- I'll refer you to Page 4 of our CFO commentary. There you'll see in Asia, Asia drove 24% of our revenue in 2016, 27% in 2017, 28% in 2018 but of that roughly 8% of 2016 revenue is China, 9% of 2017 revenue was China and now it's just under 10% in 2018. -- Perfect. Thank you.Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Lip-Bu Tan, CEO for closing remarks. -- Thank you. In closing, through continuous innovation and execution, our System Design Enablement strategy has positioned us to capitalize on multiple technology ways and further proliferating our solutions with the broader base of consumers. We are proud of the innovative and inclusive culture we are building at Cadence. The strength of our culture is highlighted by the recognition we've received from Fortune Magazine a few days ago, as we are proud that for the fifth year in the row, we make the list of Fortune Top 100 Best Companies to Work For.I would like to thank all of our shareholders, customers and partners, Board of Directors and our hard-working employee globally for their continued support.

In this regard, the company's frequent product launches and enhancements bode well.Cadence recently unveiled Tensilica HiFi 5 DSP solution featuring accelerated neural network (NN) and audio processing. Advanced speech recognition processing enables voice-controlled UIs suitable in automotive infotainment devices and smart home assistants.The company's Cadence Tensilica DNA 100 Processor IP offers both high performance and power efficiency across a full range of compute from 0.5 TeraMAC (\"TMAC\") to 100s of TMACs.The significant number of customer wins and other repeat orders are expected to bolster the top line. Notable demand from aerospace and defense sectors remains a tailwind.Recently, MaxLinear leveraged Cadence Quantus Extraction timing signoff solution to offer MxL935xx Telluride offering, a 400 Gbps PAM4 SoC (system on chip) by utilizing 16FF process technology.Notably, the company's Legato Reliability Solution is being leveraged by Infineon to accelerate simulation significantly.The company's Palladium Z1 Enterprise Emulation Platform is enabling Taiwan-based Global Unichip Corporation (\"GUC\") to accelerate its SoC design processes.Growing adoption of Cadence Verification Suite which reported revenue growth of 9% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter of 2018 is another catalyst.Traction witnessed by Palladium Z1 on the back of strong demand for growing hardware capacity is notable. In fact, two customers expanded Palladium Z1 installation in the third quarter. Five new logos were also added in the third quarter.Cadence recently unveiled GDDR6 memory IP offering comprising controller, PHY and Verification IP (\"VIP\") solutions enabled for Samsung's 7LPP process for emerging applications.Further, Cadence's DDR5 test chip achieved 4400 mega transfers per second data rate in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's  7nm process.The company's strong collaborations with Samsung and TSMC augur well in the longer haul, enabling it to attain important verification milestones.However, stiff competition in the simulations market from ANSYS (especially after it acquired 3DSIM and OPTIS) is a concern.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments?

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 19, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of hardware and software products for validating chip designs is expected to pos  of $0.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.1%.Revenues are expected to be $550.82 million, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Cadence, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cadence will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Cadence would pos  of $0.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.49, delivering a surprise of +19.51%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cadence doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 312 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDNS options chain for the new December 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $47.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDNS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $51.16/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CDNS stock at the current price level of $51.16/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.61% if the stock gets called away at the December 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDNS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDNS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company's capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash.A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to provide higher returns as liquidity drives growth. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners. : It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. : Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. : This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.In order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary  to the screen.

That is because CDNS recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom.A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.Plus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 4 estimates have gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon.

This batch of imports will surely include laptops and Apple's flagship iPhone that has so far been successful in avoiding tariffs.Per Reuters, which quoted Trump's  with The Wall Street Journal, the president is most likely to increase tariff rates from 10% imposed in September on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from Jan 1, 2019.Notably, Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to meet at the G-20 summit this week in Buenos Aires to resolve the eight-month old trade dispute between two of the world's largest trading nations.China has a $37-billion trade surplus with the United States and the trade imbalance is one of the primary reasons behind the ongoing trade war. Consumer goods like smartphones and televisions were top items imported from China in 2017. Per Financial Times, the United States imported mobile phones and computers worth more than $100 billion in the last year.Notably, iPhone has been blamed to increase the trade imbalance between the United States and China. | Apple assembles iPhone in China primarily to take advantage of the country's abundant low-cost labor. While the company buys components from suppliers based in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the United States, the final assembling is done by contract manufacturers like Foxconn at a significantly low labor cost. Per Reuters, assembling only  an estimated 3-6% of the manufacturing cost of an iPhone.However, the whole value of the assembled iPhone (including components procured from outside China) is attributed to China (due to an outdated trade deficit measurement process), which adds to its export numbers.Per Reuters'  , 61 million iPhones were shipped from China to the U.S. in 2017 and a single model, iPhone 7, accounted for $15.7 billion of the trade deficit due to the outdated measurement.Apple is already plagued by concerns over lower  for its new iPhones, which, reportedly, has compelled the company to cut production targets. Apple may also offer  to Japanese carriers to encourage iPhone XR sales in the country.Hence, the imposition of tariff will make iPhone more expensive, thereby dragging down the demand. This is also expected to hurt Apple's market share.Moreover, Apple's strategy to assemble iPhone in China helps it offer the device at a competitive price, which, however, will be hurt by imposition of tariff.Notably, nearest competitor Samsung has significant manufacturing operations in Korea and Vietnam and is more insulated to the U.S. imposed tariffs on China imports.Apple currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Intel  , Cadence Design Systems  and Microsoft  are stocks worth considering in the broader Computer & Technology sector.

The company's focus on making the utilization of AI easy and available for enterprises is in sync with the acquisition of XOXCO. However, the financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.XOXCO which is based out of Austin, TX was founded in 2008. In 2015, it reportedly raised $1.5 million in a bid to focus on chatbot development. XOXCO created the first bot, named Howdy enabling Slack's chat app users to schedule meetings. XOXCO's Botkit is one of a kind development kit enabling developers on GitHub to design bots.With the XOXCO acquisition, Microsoft attempts to craft a new bot development tool to assist enterprises in building conversational bots.With the increasing integration of cognitive thinking process into machines, artificially intelligent voice assistants are slowly becoming part of regular life. The company is striving to gain competitive edge in the conversational AI market, in particular either through innovation or inorganic additions.In fact, per Gartner, conversational AI is projected to sustain customer experience for approximately more than 50% of consumer-centric businesses by 2020 as revealed by Microsoft. Moreover, Gartner predicts that by 2021, approximately 50% of businesses will spend more on bots and chatbot development compared with traditional mobile apps.Microsoft Bot Framework service, available on Azure and GitHub, boasts of more than 360,000 developers. Per VentureBeat, the figure was around 130,000 as of May, 2017. We believe that the company is well poised to expand its bot framework service with XOXCO buyout.Additionally, per Fortune, Microsoft intends to support Slack's Howdy bot post acquisition. Notably, Slack's app competes with Microsoft Teams. This keeps us optimistic about the company's increasing inclination towards open-source projects.In fact, XOXCO capabilities are expected to enable Microsoft to devise robust bot apps particularly for Teams app, eventually boosting its adoption rate. Per the last-reported quarter data, Microsoft Teams is used by roughly 329,000 organizations, including 87 of the Fortune 100.The company also issued guidelines to assist developers in building responsible AI chatbots. We may note that the company has come a long way since March 2016, when its experimental conversational chatbot, Tay, had to be pulled down in two days after it was plagued with racist, misogynist and anti-Semitic Twitter conversations.Microsoft also announced that its virtual assistant accelerator solution is in preview. The accelerator is aimed at enabling businesses to design personalized conversational assistants to customers.We believe these initiatives will aid the company in capitalizing on a rapidly growing AI market. Notably, per MarketsandMarkets, the AI market is projected to reach $190.6 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 36.6% in 2017-2025 time period.Notably, the buyout marks company's fourth acquisition this year, aimed at strengthening portfolio by expanding AI capabilities, followed by Semantic Machines, Bonsai and Lobe buyouts.These strategic buyouts (including GitHub) are enabling Microsoft to add features on a regular basis to various applications. Apart from strengthening cybersecurity features of Microsoft 365, the company infused new AI-driven features, including automated slide design, Cortana reminders, enhanced search experiences and real-time meeting transcription, among others.In Microsoft Teams, the company is adding automated translation support for meetings, shift scheduling for firstline workers, and new industry-specific offerings for healthcare and small businesses.Moreover, Microsoft is well-poised to gain on strong growth in no-code app building and business analytics in the cloud, driven by the company's investments in Power BI, Power Apps and Flow.The company added almost 100 new capabilities to Azure in the last reported quarter, with focus on existing workloads like security and new workloads like Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge AI.The new infused capabilities enhance the features of company's portfolio, consequently bolstering user engagement.

Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company's capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash.A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to generate higher returns as liquidity drives growth. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, the efficiency level of a company should be considered in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination indicates underlying financial strength. : It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. : Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. : This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the \"#1 site for screening stocks\" by Money Magazine.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - November 5, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article include: Core-Mark Holding Company, Inc.  , CACI International Inc.  , Amedisys, Inc.  , Cadence Design Systems, Inc.  and WNS (Holdings) Limited  .Investors who have the tendency to take a high level of risks can choose momentum stocks as an investment option. In this context, we have focused on Driehaus strategy which has used the \"buy high and sell higher\" principle to select the best momentum stocks. The success of this particular investment approach eventually helped Richard Herman Driehaus get a place in Barron's All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII's portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% gains registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: \"I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.\" In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus' philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator - positive relative strength - has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

This compares to earnings of $0.35 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 19.51%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of hardware and software products for validating chip designs would post earnings of $0.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.45, delivering a surprise of 12.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Cadence, which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry, posted revenues of $532.47 million for the quarter ended September 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.81%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $485.40 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the .Cadence shares have lost about 4.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.5%.While Cadence has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cadence was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see  .It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.42 on $530.17 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.69 on $2.08 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 22, 2018, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of hardware and software products for validating chip designs is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.1%.Revenues are expected to be $517.90 million, up 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Cadence, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cadence will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cadence would post earnings of $0.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.45, delivering a surprise of +12.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cadence doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

I'm very pleased to report that broad-based customer demand across our cloud EDA hardware and IP product lines enable Cadence to achieve excellent operating results and financial performance in the third quarter.We live in data driven world that is propelled by key technology waves such as cloud datacenter, 5G and machine learning. AI machine learning fueled by big data and sophisticated data analytics algorithm along with the move to domain specific accelerators is transforming many industries, including transportation, healthcare and manufacturing.Although this lead to increasing demand for high-performance -- high-speed connectivity and then storage, which in turn drive strong design activity and broad demand of our innovative system design enablement solutions. Our FTE strategy continues to open up new growth opportunities as we expand our focus beyond semiconductors to systems and customer in newer verticals. As a result of this factors, we are increasing our outlook for the year. John will say more on this in a moment.I will now review the Q3 highlights starting with IP business. Our IP business had a strong quarter with double digit growth, driven by increasing royalties for Tensilica and robust demand for our memory products. Additionally, we launched two important new IP products. First, earlier today, we announced the industry first silicon-proven long reach 112G SerDes IP in 7 nanometer technology. This innovative SerDes technology based on new semi acquisition is essential to enable next generation cloud connectivity to move to 200 gigabits and beyond in the hyper-scale datacenter. We have been working closely with early adopting customers and are already taking orders as we begin to engage broadly with customers.Along with our leading DDR and PCIe solutions, we now offer the most compelling portfolio of essential IPs for the hyper-scale datacenter. Second, we also significantly enhanced the Tensilica product line with the DNA 100 processor, which is a deep neural-network accelerator. Its innovative architecture enables the DNA 100 to deliver leading performance and power efficiency, while scaling across a broad range of compute needs. The DNA 100 is ideal for embedded inferencing applications where latency and (inaudible) connectivity may be an issue, such as the surveillance, drones AR/VR and automotive sensor fusion.Next I will discuss highlights of our System Design and Verification Solutions. The Cadence Verification suite had another strong quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 9%. Palladium Z1 also had a strong quarter as demand for increasing hardware capacity continues. Two customers significantly expanded their installation of Palladium Z1 and overall we added five new logos. Our new Palladium cloud offering, which provides on-demand cloud-based emulation capacity is ramping up nicely and contributed meaningfully to orders in Q3. Adoption of our Xcelium simulator continue to grow as we added several new customers, including a large commitment to our technology from a market shaping customer.Digital and Signoff continues to perform well with revenue up 9% year-over-year. Proliferation of our Digital and Signoff solutions continue with existing market shaping customers as well as wins with the new customers. We added 19 new logos in Q3 for our Digital and Signoff products. Customers tape out more than a dozen 7 nanometer designs in Q3 using Innovus.In total, more than 50 customers are using Innovus for implementations at the 7-nanometre node. We are actively engaged with very early adopter customers on their 5-nanometer designs and have started work with partners to get ready for 3-nanometer. We won four Partners of the Year Awards at the TSMC Open Innovation Platform, including on 5-nanometer design infrastructure collaborations.Last quarter, we introduced Cadence Cloud in collaboration with major cloud industry players. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Our offering has already been deployed in production with customers and interest in using cloud for semiconductor design is growing. We are pleased with the customer reception and have a healthy pipeline of opportunities. In October, Cadence collaborated with TSMC to launch their virtual design environment. Cadence Cloud was certified as a (inaudible) for mutual customer desiring to develop SoC using TSMC IP in the cloud. The endorsement is further evidence of the growing interest in using the cloud for semiconductor and electronic systems design.Now before turning it over to John, let me quickly summarize comments. Cadence achieved excellent results through consistent execution of our system design enablement strategy across our core EDA IP and Hardware businesses. IP had an excellent quarter and we announced two new exciting IP products. Important market shaping customers expanded their use of both the software and hardware-based products in our verification suite. And our Digital Signoff Solution continue to proliferate with market shaping customers and we actively engage with customers and partners on 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer development.With that I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook. -- Thanks, Lip Bu and good afternoon, everyone. As Lip Bu you said, broad-based customer demand across our major product lines enabled Cadence to achieve excellent operating results and financial performance in the third quarter. I am pleased to report that we exceeded all of our key performance metrics. We expect strong demand and cash flow to continue into the fourth quarter and as a result, we are raising our outlook for fiscal 2018 and increasing stock repurchases to $75 million for the fourth quarter.Before we get into Q3 results, I'd like to remind you that Cadence adopted a new revenue accounting standard known as ASC Topic 606 for fiscal 2018. These new rules, as we often refer to them, are now GAAP for Cadence. The numbers I present for our third quarter are based on these new rules unless otherwise stated. Please also keep in mind that this is our transition year to the new rules and our results under the new rules are not directly comparable to those of 2017, which we reported under ASC Topic 605 or the old rules. To provide a more direct comparison against our 2017 results, we will show our quarterly results as reported under the old rules for all four quarters of 2018.Now, let's go through the key results for the third quarter starting with the P&L. As reported, total revenue was $532 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, GAAP EPS was $0.35 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.49. And under the old rules, for direct comparison against Q3 2017, total revenue was $526 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, GAAP EPS was $0.34 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.49.Next, let us turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash in short-term investments totaled $550 million at the end of Q3 with approximately $135 million of that cash here in the US. Debt outstanding at quarter end was $350 million. Operating cash flow in Q3 was $110 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of Cadence shares and paid off our existing $300 million term loan. As reported, DSOs were 42 days. Under the old rules, DSOs were 39 days.Looking ahead, we expect strong demand to continue into the fourth quarter. And as a result, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2018. For Q4, we expect the following results. Revenue in the range of $545 million to $555 million. Non-GAAP operating margin of 29% to 30%. GAAP EPS in the range of $0.27 to $0.29 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.46 to $0.48. For fiscal 2018, we now expect revenue in the range of $2.113 billion with $2.123 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin of 29.5% to 30%. GAAP EPS in the range of $1.15 to $1.17. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.80 to $1.82 and operating cash flow in the range of $550 million to $580 millionOur Q3 results and outlook for the second half are significantly better than we expected this time last quarter. Design activity is healthy, and we experienced broad-based customer demand across our core EDA, Hardware and IP product lines. Upside in our Hardware and IP product lines are the primary contributors to the upside in our revenue guidance for 2018. Some of our customers requested earlier delivery of hardware systems and we saw an uptick in our IP royalty revenue. Our second half also has upside resulting from a number of one-time benefits on the expense side. Almost all of which fell into our third quarter. The upside in our expenses for Q3 was primarily due to timing of new hires and one-time credits to professional services expense.For fiscal 2018, we now expect the difference in revenue under the new and old rules to be approximately $12 million, most of which is due to IP. This means that under the old rules, our implied 2018 guidance at the midpoint is now expected to be revenue of approximately $2.13 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%, GAAP EPS of approximately $1.18, non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.85 and operating cash flow in the range of $550 million to $580 million.We expect our operating cash flow to be the same under both the new and old rules.One thing I'd like to point out is that our fourth quarter earnings release will be scheduled for February 19, 2019 due to the additional work required to complete our year-end accounting for the first time under both the new tax law and the new revenue accounting rules.To sum up, I'm very pleased with our progress in 2018. It is shaping up to be a great year for Cadence and I would like to thank the entire Cadence team. Their operational discipline and their drive and passion to make our customer successful are truly inspiring and have played a large part in allowing us to raise our guidance throughout the year.On an apples-to-apples basis, we are now expecting annual revenue to increase by more than 9% and on the back of that revenue growth, we now expect non-GAAP operating margin on the basis of the old rules to improve to approximately 30% for the year. And with that operator, we'll now take questions.(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Gary Mobley from Benchmark. -- Let me first extend my congratulations to Lip-Bu for your 10-year anniversary. -- Thank you. -- I want to start off by asking a question about Cadence Cloud. Can you give us a sense of what percent of your fourth quarter revenue outlook might be generated from Cadence Cloud? And then as well maybe kind of a preview into fiscal year '19? And John, last time we had this call and asked the question, you mentioned you don't expect a material difference in revenue recognition with Cadence Cloud versus traditional customer delivery. Is that still the case? -- Yes, I think you have two questions, let me answer the first one. So first of all, last quarter, we introduced the Cadence Cloud with collaboration with Amazon, Google Cloud and the Microsoft Azure and we are very delighted that by now our offering (inaudible) already deployed into production by customer interest using the cloud for design is growing. We are very excited up by the customer reception and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunity. And I just have to say that we are in the very beginning of the inning for the -- baseball (inaudible) so we are still in the beginning of the inning. And then early October, we are delighted to collaborating with TSMC launch their virtual design environment and I should note -- moving to the cloud foundry partners is important. So that makes sure that the IP are also in the cloud, at TSMC Cloud offering so that now customer can use that and using our tool in the cloud to developing the SoC, this is very exciting. So overall, we are excited about the opportunity by (inaudible) beginning of the inning. -- And Gary, just to address your second question, there's no material impact from the Cadence Cloud on Cadence revenue although Cadence Cloud is a valuable addition to our product portfolio for both customers and Cadence. It's not a material impact to our revenue in Q3 or expected to be a material impact in Q4. -- Okay. As a follow up question, I wanted to ask about the memory IC industry, I think it's widely known that we've seen some pretty steep drops in NAND flash pricing and maybe a stagnant DRAM market, and I know historically memory has not been a heavy user EDA tools. But can you give us a sense of what percent of your revenue comes from memory IC companies? -- Yes, I don't think we disclosed memory IC percentage of our revenue, but I think clearly in this data driven world, it's all about big data and then also how to do the data analytics beside the compute because the workload have changed. So I think this memory and in-circuit memory, some of this application become very critical. So we have a very strong footprint with the memory IC player and we are delighted to work closely with them for their next generations design and then some of this, I should note that (inaudible) memory side is taking off in the hyper-scale side and also all -- it's all about data. I mean, from the IoT to the Edge to the automotive driving, the ADAS and all the different IoT for the industrial 4.0, data become very essential. And then how to address the latency and speed of time to get the data and then able to make some intelligent decision. Those are critical. So I think there's a lot of disruptive innovation R&D is working on and we are very well positioned with the memory key players and we're delighted on the tool and the IP front to work closely and close collaborating with them. -- Okay. That's it from me. Thanks guys. -- Thank you. -- Thanks.Our next question comes from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Market. -- Hey guys, great quarter and thanks for taking my question. I had two. First one is actually kind of on the ASC 606. So I remember at the beginning of the year, you kind of expected like a $40 million impact. Now it sounds like it's like a $12 million difference and it seems like the total impact is almost positive for you guys. Maybe you can help us understand what happened there and what changed throughout the year? -- Yes, so Mitch, this is John. Yes, the difference is down to $12 million it's mainly due to how IP revenues recognized under 605 and 606. Under 606, the new rules, we recorded IP revenues, we deliver the IP to the customer. Under 605, the old rules, some IP cannot be recognized until all of the IP committed in the contract are delivered to the customer. As a result, we recorded IP revenue during Q2 and Q3 under the new rules that will show up in Q4 revenue under the old rules. And just for clarity, that -- we expect the revenue under the old rules to be $12 million higher than revenue under the new rules, but just wanted to make that clear. -- Okay, got it. Thank you. And then the second one is actually on the overall macro, I mean, we've seen some negative news about semiconductor volumes. And I wanted to see if anything has changed in terms of the R&D you guys are seeing or in terms of the engineering hires you're seeing in the space, just probably from a macro perspective? -- Sure. Mitch, let me answer the question (inaudible) environment . And so clearly, you know the design activity is quite healthy and basically driven by couple of things that I mentioned earlier, the data driven and with the big data and the machine learning, dip learning that using the big data and then do the data analytics. And then -- and also kind of moving toward this, I call it domain specific application, that's very broad application to the very multiple industry from transportation to healthcare, drug discovery, manufacturing and of course, the automotive related area. So I think this all driving more and stronger design activity from the big companies and also the small company from the service provider. They want to optimize and differentiate their service. So they are starting to quietly building up silicon development. So we are embracing and partnering, collaborating with them deeply and of course our FTEs strategy starting to really play big time in somewhat addressing some of this new growth opportunity so that we can really focus on helping the customer to design that. So, I think overall, answer your question, all these are driving the design activity we see a very nice increase on the -- our collaboration with our customers. -- Perfect, thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Monika Garg from KeyBanc. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, if you look, you're guiding almost 10% growth on 6 of 5 basis, how to think about growth next year? -- Yeah. First of all, I think, Monika, as you know that we don't provide guidance for next year, wait for next January and we will provide that. John? -- Yes. And Monika, I wouldn't focus too intensely on any one quarter, I mean, revenue growth should be strong in Q4 but in Q3, we had a number of one-time benefits that don't follow through into Q4. Expenses in Q3 benefited from the timing of new hires and some one-time credits to professional services expense. But that said, I mean, I'm very pleased with the -- with what we were expecting in non-GAAP operating margin of approximately, 29.5% to 30% for this year. -- And could you maybe talk about how do you see impact of tariffs impacting semi industry and could you see EDA industry, any impact from that? -- Can you repeat your question again? I missed the first part. -- We are seeing you kind of tariffs between US, China and other geographies, your comments regarding how could that impact semi industry and in turn could you see any impact on the EDA industry from that? -- Yes, I think it's a very important topic (inaudible) the tariff landscape is a very fluid and very difficult to predict with our guidance is everything we know and also reasonably estimate. Clearly, we watch very carefully. Overall, we have done well in China and then China is a very growing opportunity for us and we have a big team over there to support our customer. At the end of the day, I think we are just really laser focused on supporting our customer globally in their design activity. -- And then just the last one, John, operating margins very strong at 30% close to 30%, where do you think operating margins could be next 2 to 4 years? Thank you. -- Nice try, Monika. But we're not guiding beyond this year for 2018. -- Thank you so much. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Rich Valera from Needham & Company. -- Thank you. Let me add my congratulations for the strong results, gentlemen. So I think this question for John around, you mentioned you had some one-time benefits and expenses in Q3. And also I think you mentioned early hardware shipments, which may have contributed to the strength in Q3, but I wanted to just say if you look at the year as a whole, including Q3 and Q4, is there anything we should think of as one-time that wouldn't make for a clean comparison to 2019, even though I know you are not guiding, guess is there anything we should sort of back out as we're looking at 2019? -- Yes, good question, Rich. But what I would highlight is that we delivered hardware in Q3 for which we won't collect payment till the following quarter. And if you have a look at our CFO commentary, we're expecting that to happen again in Q4. But in our CFO commentary, we've called out that we expect DSOs to rise to about 45 days at year-end, and that's mainly because some customers have requested delivery of hardware in 2018, for which we don't expect to get paid until early 2019. But yes, taking the year as a whole, that's what I've been trying to point out. -- So if you look at -- coming into this year versus last year, because you actually had a really strong, I think bookings hardware quarter at the -- in the fourth quarter of last year. Did you have that same effect where you had kind of deferred hardware revenue coming into the year that was recognized early this year and now you kind of have that same impact likely going into '19, is that fair? -- Well, what we saw at the end of last year was an acceleration of hardware bookings into the end of the quarter -- at the end of 2017. But -- and like you say, well that contrast with 2018, this year some customers are requested earlier delivery of hardware in Q4 2018, for which we are not expecting to get paid until Q1 2019. But with all that, say we're not guiding beyond the end of 2018. -- Okay. But you will see some revenue and presumably the first quarter of '19 from hardware that you will ship in the fourth quarter of '18, is that fair? -- We trigger revenue on delivery of the hardware, so if we ship hardware in Q4, we will recognize revenue on the hardware in Q4. -- Okay. Thank you for the clarification. Appreciate it. And then Asia-Pac seem to show up as a notably strong geography in this quarter. Is there anything there that we should be aware of is there or is that just kind of noise in the numbers? -- Yes. I mean we continue to see strong growth in Asia but -- and for the quarter, the growth, if you look across the business groups, it was mainly in most of the revenue upside for the second half is in Verification and IP. And that's merely because those segments benefit from upfront revenue recognition on delivery of the IP and hardware. We had strength across all product lines. -- Got it. Okay, thank you for taking my question, gentlemen. Appreciate it. -- Okay. Thanks.Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. -- Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask some questions. Congratulations for the strong results. John, I apologize if I missed this, but relative to the one-time benefits of OpEx in Q3, did you quantify them across the SG&A and R&D? I'm trying to figure out relative to your initial guidance of Op margins being down over a couple hundred basis points sequentially, they were up and I'm just trying to figure out what drove the difference and how I should think about sequential Op margin growth in the fourth quarter? -- Yes, fair question, John. I mean what can I say that -- the second half is just really strong for us, that I mean, is there's been no change in how we did -- how we do our guidance or anything, it's just the design activity as healthy. But I wouldn't read too much into any one quarter, even one half, a lot of the things that are going in the right direction for this year, especially in the second half on both the revenue and expense side. We're operating the business for the long term, Q3 in the second half, does include as you said, a number of one-time items. But even adjusting for those, I'm very pleased with how the second half of the year is playing out. -- So John, is it fair to say that's actually the adjustments that may be gross margin -- operating margin would have been about half as strong relative to guidance? So if there were 500 basis points above, about half is one-time, half was operational or can you (inaudible) there? -- So yes, of course, yes. Sorry, John. Yes , that's correct. About half was due to the one-time expense items and half due to the revenue growth. -- Perfect. That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, just going back to the Cadence Cloud, if you think about the long-term potential for this distribution channel, how big do you think it becomes as a percent of revenue? Is this something that you think your traditional customers exploit or is this really an avenue to kind of grow the customer base -- the design activity and you talked about RevRec not being changed by Cadence Cloud, is the dollar of opportunity different between (inaudible) versus cloud and you think about project-based revenue? -- Yes, so let me answer the first question and then John can answer the second question. So on the first question, as I mentioned earlier, this is kind of an early inning but we're very excited with the customer reception. And also we have a healthy pipeline of opportunity. And then, clearly our partner with industry leader in the hyperscale cloud have been very, very good and we are very happy with the collaborations. And then clearly, if you look at from the design point of view, if you can partition and then over the multiple unlimited server that cloud infrastructure offer, clearly the PPA at one time improvement is substantial. And we already see that in benefit on that and the customers see that. And so in some way, we can make the faster and better performance for the customer and so I think stay tuned, we're going to continue to drive that especially with the TSMC virtual design platform and using our tool and also the IP in the cloud that can be very exciting and we are going to do that also for other foundry partners. So that make it available to our customer whichever way they (inaudible) on the hype of scale, whichever they (inaudible) on the foundry, we will be there to support them and our tool will be optimized for their solution design. -- And John, to take the second part of your question, Cadence Cloud doesn't change our business model, it offers customers another ways to optimize their investment in Cadence tools. But in saying that the Palladium Cloud is probably the best opportunity in the near term for incremental revenue because it taps into customers who traditionally have not had the capital budgets to purchase emulation hardware. And we had some revenue contribution from Palladium Cloud in Q3. -- And John, if I could squeeze one more quick one in, Lip-Bu, what percent of your revenue today is domestic Chinese? And I guess just relative to trade war concerns, do you see any evidence of those customers perhaps ordering more than they need for fear that the trade war escalates? -- Yes, I don't think we breakdown on the percentage of the customer from China domestic customer, but clearly, we are engaging quite heavily, our philosophy is to support the leading customer in their most complicated design globally. And then China is included and there are some world-class company from China, we went collaborating closely with them. (inaudible) our true partnership trusted arrangement and then with the best design on the tool and IP and so we're going to continue doing that and so far have been OK.Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. -- Yes, thanks. Hi guys. I think the strength in the upside in the quarter, as you mentioned was both Verification Emulation as well as IP. On the Verification Emulation side, can you give us a little bit more color, is this existing customers buying more? Is this new customers, what was the balance? Just what's the source of the strength that you saw in the quarter? -- Yes. Let me start it first, Sterling, and a couple of things, one, clearly the customer increasing the demand on the hardware capacity continue, we mentioned two large customer and significantly expand their installation of Z1, purely multiple factor, but one of the key reason is a lot of complex design, they need more capacity for verification. And I'm talking about that and clearly also driving our verification suite and then we are delighted on the Xcelium side, now we have one large commitment to our technology from a market shaping customer. So I think all in all, I think is a good quarter across Hardware Emulation Z1 and also Xcelium and then we continue to drive in a large-scale design, this is a must have. And (inaudible) able to scale and then clearly, it's a good balance between the existing customer and also our new logos that we highlight that we have five new logos, the customer that are new customer to ask they see the benefit of the usage of Z1. -- And when looking at the fourth quarter, I want to make sure I'm clear, the guidance that you gave is the driver for the new guidance again more kind of the Emulation IP, so things that have upfront revenue recognition that's driving the fourth quarter changing guide or am I missing that? -- So Sterling, this is John. Yes, revenue exceeded internal expectations across all our major product lines. But yes, most of the revenue upside is in Verification and IP, when you look at the half and that's because those segments benefit from upfront revenue as you said -- as you just said. -- And then Sterling, just to add on, I think we mentioned the broad base EDA hardware and IP and by the way, the Digital and Signoff had a wonderful quarter, 9% growth and then we have mentioned about 12 more than 12 7-nanometer design win on the Q3. And then clearly, we go deep into the 5-nanometer with our partners and customers and then we are getting ready on the 3-nanometer. So continue driving the improvement on the various different tool, so it's very broad based. -- Okay, great. And then last question just to clarify the previous caller, John, you mentioned Palladium Cloud, I thought there would be a difference in revenue recognition going from upfront when you ship a box under current model versus I thought the cloud model would be more of a ratable or transaction based (inaudible)? -- Yes, that's a good clarification, Sterling. Yes. Revenue contribution from Palladium and the Cloud would be ratable, yes. -- Perfect. Thank you guys. -- Thanks.Our next question comes from Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. -- Yes, good afternoon. First, let me go back to an earlier question on the memory side (inaudible) we've seen some pricing declines in the memory. I know you had really strong relationships with the customers there, but since we've seen them push out some capacity has delayed a few project, just curious, have you seen any delays or any slowdown in there, this design activity because of that? -- Yes. Good question, Tom. And so far in other feedback is in (inaudible). Our partnership with some of the key customers, we don't see any delay in the design, actually they increased because there's a lot of new requirement they need and I highlight, the (inaudible) related area and then the aggregation of the storage that a hyperscale guy needs, and so there's a lot of innovation and a new material is happening. And then -- so that you can really squeeze more bits into the memory cell. And so I think there's a lot of new development while heavily engaging with other key players. And I think we don't see the delay. -- Okay. I guess, that being said, would the pricing decline be good for your business in the sense that would open up new opportunities or new use cases for memory? -- Possible, but hard to tell. But so far, we are more related to the design activity. And we see increase in that design activity and memory is so essential on the whole big data and the whole AI machine learning. And then latency is -- the scale out the storage is significantly required because such a big massive data from autonomous driving, IoT to the Edge and the requirement is significantly increased. So in some ways, put a lot of more pressure for the memory innovations and that should be good for us. -- Yes, OK. And then, John you talked several times about the onetime OpEx benefits from the quarter, was there ever a discussion not to include those in the non-GAAP numbers? -- No, but -- we didn't discuss not including them. -- Okay. It was more of just a timing issue than kind of --? -- That's all, like I say -- yes, it was just the timing issue, like even when I look -- if I look at the second half without those, we're still very pleased how the second half of the year is playing out. -- Okay. And then just based on the really strong operating margin improvement this year versus the revenue growth of 9%, was that projected or predicted based on just the leverage in the model or was that a much stronger operating margin improvement than you would have thought? -- Well, approximately half of the operating margin improvement in the third quarter came from the revenue upside and about half of it came from expense benefits like the primarily, due to the timing of hires and those one-time credits. Yes, those with the major impacts, but like I say, I wouldn't focus too intensely on any one quarter, let's -- like I said, when you look at the second half of the year, we're very pleased how that's playing out. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Thank you.Our final question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. -- Thank you, John. Let me start with you with a couple of questions regarding pricing and separately expenses. Then a follow-up for Lip-Bu. So on pricing, since you assume the role of CFO, what kind of the things that you've been focusing on, is what you call deal quality metrics and relatedly improving in areas of suboptimal pricing where it exists. Could you give us an update on how you think you're doing it in terms of those metrics? And then (inaudible) to what extent do you think that new technology is helping you with either bookings or incremental pricing like for example, Voltus Xp as a source of incremental business? -- So Jay, on the pricing front, yes. And we will continue to focus on pricing, we're always disciplined and value-driven. Typically -- and we get pricing improvements from add-on contracts from customers, but we typically do renewal with the customer every approximately 2 years to 3 years. And then throughout the duration of the contract, you'll get add on opportunities and that's where we often see the pricing improvement. -- Just to add onto the what John is saying, I think clearly, Jay, I think the customer are paying for the value that we provide. And then -- that's why we do a lot of innovations, every year, I think you can see in our 6 to 8 new products organically, developed and then clearly it's driving the tool performance and so that we can really focus on the value to the customer. And then running the PPA, the run time and then in the early days and over that last few years, we've been very focused on rewriting some of our tool on parallelism and then the (inaudible) we're using AI machine learning across applying into all our different tool and products whether we can drive better performance and throughput for the customer. And then lately, as we highlighted to you, we're moving quite a bit into the cloud so that we can use the unlimited server to begin partitioning properly in to scale the perform and run time. So, I think clearly, the customer willing to pay for the value that we provide. -- With regard to expenses, in doing our monthly spot checks, your job openings, as well as for your principal competitors, across the board for the EDA big three, there has been a substantial increase over the last number of months in terms total openings, yourselves (inaudible) mentor, in your case your current number of job openings, as we've looked at today is up by about a third from 6 months ago and more than double a year ago. And we see similar trends again, Synopsys and Mentor, could you talk about where you're looking to add and given the broad demand within the industry for (inaudible) and the like, could you talk about your ability to in fact bring people on at the rate that you want given the competition for a headcount? -- So, Jay, I'll start and I'll let Lip-Bu then chime in with where we're adding. But, yes, you're correct that's if you look at our CFO commentary you will see there was an uptick in keeping tight count, I'm much of that from the beginning of September, that which was part of the delayed hiring that's what benefited Q3. And then on the expense side, that was a one-time benefit to Q3 , but of course, we ramped up hiring, so that expense turns up in Q4. And then I just wanted to refer back to why didn't non-GAAP out the one-time credits for professional services, that's -- and that was because we need to be consistent with the use of non-GAAP definitions and they won't change on a quarter-to-quarter basis, -- Yes, just to add on John's description, I think clearly we are hiring more in toward the R&D and FAE side and then FAE clearly we want to make sure that we support our customer and then have a deep collaboration with them. On the R&D front, we see a great opportunity for further innovations basically more into the data signs and into the machine learning, deep running and also somewhat our new tools that we have some new idea how to drive more success in term of PPA and run time to serve our customer better. -- Lastly on technology, since used the word rewrite, Lip-Bu, earlier at a Cadence customer event at DAC 4 months ago, there was a very interesting panel discussion where customers such as Nvidia in particular talked about their need for substantially greater capacity in the tools and I know this is a 30-year issue an EVA never ends, but customers like them and others on the panel, we're talking about multiples of increase in block capacity within the tools , and I'm wondering where you stand in terms of being able to deliver against those kinds of substantial increases in capacity that they are now talking about? -- Yes. So, I think clearly the design complexities increased substantially based on the various application I just mentioned earlier, big data and data analytics. And so the capacity requirement, how to address the interconnect high speed and also some of this memory (inaudible) and all these are going to be critical and (inaudible) our tool how to scale it and also some of the compact design how to use the crowd to address some of this requirement. And then the other part is also in our emulation, hardware emulation and are clearly we're developing the next generation, too early to give you the guidance, I mean, so far, we're making good progress on the next products. And then going to be continued to increase the capacity to meet the customer. Same thing with our FPGA prototyping, stay tuned, we're going to have more announcements in term of increasing the capacity and that scale out to provide the customer need in our like the company like you mentioned earlier, NVIDIA and any large-scale design like massive parallelism and AI machine learning application in some of the big infrastructure switch -- network switch related require great capacity increase and also developing the design is getting a lot more complex and also meanwhile pushing into the 5-nanometer and 3 -nanometer. So I think this is all exciting for us and we work closely and listen very closely with the customer and collaborating with them and supporting them. -- Thank you very much. -- Thank you.And there are no further questions at this time. -- And so let me start. First of all, in closing through continuous innovation and execution, our system design enablement strategy has positioned us to capitalize on multiple technology waves and further proliferate our solution with a broader base of customers. We are proud of the innovation and inclusive culture we are building at Cadence.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17.5% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $66.03 in the previous session. Bottomline Technologies has gained 88.4% since the start of the year compared to the 13.4% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 27.3% return for the Zacks Computer - Software industry.The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 9, 2018, Bottomline Technologies reported EPS of $0.35 versus consensus estimate of $0.29 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 5.33%.For the current fiscal year, Bottomline Technologies is expected to post earnings of $0.73 per share on $429.78 million in revenues. This represents a 14.17% change in EPS on a 9.05% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.93 per share on $478.38 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 16.9% and 11.31%, respectively.Bottomline Technologies may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Bottomline Technologies has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 90.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 34X versus its peer group's average of 32.1X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Bottomline Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Bottomline Technologies fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Bottomline Technologies shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.Shares of Bottomline Technologies have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Avid Technology (AVID), Magic Software Enterprises (MGIC), and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 19% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Bottomline Technologies, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

One interesting put contract in particular, is the February 2019 put at the $40 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 70 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.8% return against the $40 commitment, or a 4.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CDNS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $40 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cadence Design Systems Inc sees its shares decline 11.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $39.30 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 70 cents from $40), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.3% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $40 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the February 2019 put at the $40 strike for the 4.3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cadence Design Systems Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $45.45) to be 23%.

Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the second quarter, with revenue increasing 8% year-over-year, and on GAAP operating margin of 30%. John will provide details in a moment. Our system design enablement strategy is perfectly positioned to enable the data-driven economy, and the multiple key technology waves driving it. We are increasing our footprint with system companies and tailoring our solution to vertical market segments. Not only is the cloud data center one of the most significant technology drivers, it also enables us to bring innovative design solutions and increase productivity to our customers.This past month, at Design Automation Conference, we introduced the Cadence Cloud, the industry's first broad cloud portfolio for the development of the electronic systems and semiconductors. Benefits from using Cadence Cloud include improved productivity, intelligent scalability, optimized security, and flexibility. We collaborated with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to deploy our cloud-ready products in customer-managed cloud environments. We also launched Palladium Cloud, which is a cloud-based emulation solution that easily addresses peak requirements of existing customers and brings emulation to new customers and markets.Finally, in conjunction with the Cadence Cloud, we launched Liberate Trio, the first unified library collectivization solution that employs machine-learning techniques and optimized for the cloud. Cadence Cloud is endorsed by our close partners, ARM, and TSMC, and more than 20 customers are using Cadence Cloud, including Annapurna Labs, an Amazon company, and CNEX Labs.Additionally, the aerospace and defense vertical had another strong quarter. A major aerospace and defense company selected Cadence as the primary vendor for SOC design and verification, including our software and hardware products. We also won a significant research contract with DAPA to develop advanced machine learning technologies that speed up and optimize power, performance, and area results. Watch for more announcement on this exciting project tomorrow.Now I will review a few additional highlights from Q2. Momentum continues to build up for our IT business. It was another strong quarter for our flagship DDR and PCIE products. We prototyped the world's first DDR5 test chip, achieving a data grade of 4,400 maker transfers per second in TSMC's 7-nm process. We had significant wins for DDR with a major semiconductor company for PCIE, with the leading storage company, and while working with our mobile customers on a 7-nm sensor application. Tensilica added five new models -- new logos, with wins for applications in IoT, wearables, phototonics, and crypto mining.Moving on to our system design and verification solutions, in Q2, our broad base renewal with LG Electronics included adoption of our Xcelium parallel simulator. Other key Xcelium adopters included a large Chinese customer and an AI processor start-up. Palladium added six new customers, with nine repeat orders. Two of the new customers are using Palladium Cloud. NCA Computing chose Palladium Z1 for the development of their next generation ARM-based server chip. Palladium Z1 was chosen for its scalability, for the launch design, state of the art debugging features, stability, and availability over the cloud. Digital signoff -- digital and the signoff continue to be very -- continue to do very well, with 8% year-over-year revenue growth. Our digital and signoff solutions continue to proliferate with existing market shipping customers and win new customers. More than 20 customers adopted our full digital floor in the first half of 2018.Continuing over innovating in signoff, we enhanced our Voltus IC Power Integrity Solution with the extensively parallel algorithm that provides up to five times better performance, with gigascale capacity and cloud reading. HiSilicon verified that the new Voltus Solution can deliver improved performance results for their future 5G silicon development. Cadence also played an important role in enabling modern technologies, such as RF, MEMS, and Sensor through providing advanced tooling and packaging solutions. We launched a comprehensive new Virtuoso RF Solution, partnering with National Instruments to streamline the line and verification process of analog and RFICs and modules. In advanced packaging, we already support TSMC info and co-ops chip integration solutions. And we've now added support for the new TSMC Wafer-on-Wafer stacking technology.Reliability also becomes more critical as semiconductors proliferate in new vertical segments like automotive, medical devices, industrial, and aerospace and defense. This quarter, we introduced the Legato Reliability Solution, the industry's first software products that meet the challenges of designing high reliability, analog, and mixed signal IC. Infinien successfully used this solution to speed up simulation runtimes by a factor of more than 100. Like reliability, function safety is very important to automotive, industrial, and aerospace and defense. ROHM used their Cadence Automotive Solution for safety verification, which is a critical component in its ISO 26262 compliance to change for automotive chips. Hitachi used our JasperGold platform to develop and receive certification for an industry safety controller.Before turning it over to John, let me quickly summarize my comments. We drove excellent results through consistent execution and broad-based proliferation an adoption of our solutions to meet the needs of the data-driven economy. We introduced the Cadence Cloud, the first broad portfolio of cloud-based EDA technologies. Our growing aerospace and defense business had another strong quarter. Our flagship IP products are doing very well in the marketplace. Adoption of our Xcelium parallel simulator is growing. Our digital and signoff solutions are proliferating with market-shaping customers and winning new customers. And Cadence Solutions are helping enable continued innovation in electronics through modern technology.With that, I would now turn over the call to John to review the financial results and provide the updated outlook. -- Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report we met or exceeded all of our key operating metrics in Q2. And as a result of strong execution across our business, we are increasing out outlook for fiscal 2018. Before we get into Q2 results, I'd like to remind you that Cadence adopted a new revenue accounting standard known as ASC topic 606 for fiscal 2018. These new rules, as we often refer to them, are now GAAP. The numbers I present for our second quarter are based on these new rules unless otherwise stated. Please also keep in mind that this is the first year we are reporting under the new rules, which are not directly comparable to those of 2017, which were reported under ASC topic 605, or the old rules. For all four quarters of 2018, we will show our quarterly results as reported under the old rules to allow comparison to 2017 on an apples-to-apples basis.Having covered that, let's now go through the key results for the second quarter, starting with the P&L. As reported, total revenue was $518 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. GAAP EPS was $0.27, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.43. And under the old rules for direct comparison against 2017, total revenue was $515 million, up 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. GAAP EPS was $0.26, an non-GAAP EPS was $0.44.Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, cash in short-term investments totaled $825 million at the end of Q2, with approximately $475 million of that cash here in the U.S. Cash outstanding at quarter end was $650 million. Operating cash flow in Q2 was $205 million. During the quarter, we used $50 million for share repurchases and $45 million to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As reported, DSOs were 39 days. Under the old rules, DSOs were 36 days.I will not provide our updated guidance. For Q3, we expect the following results. Revenue in the range of $510 to $520 million; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 27 to 28%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.22 to $0.24; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.42, and DSOs of approximately 40 days. For fiscal 2018, we now expect revenue in the range of $2.07 to $2.09 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.95 to $1.01; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.64 to $1.70; and operating cash flow in the range of $535 to $565 million. We now expect the difference in revenue under the new and old rules to be approximately $25 million. As a result, under the old rules, our implied 2018 guidance at the midpoint is now expected to be revenue approximately $2.105 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29%; GAAP EPS of approximately $1.06; and non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.74. And our operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $550 million.Please note that we expect our operating cash flow to be the same under both the new and old rules, because our transition to the new rules in 2018 is just an accounting change. And as a result, there is no impact to our cash flows or how we operate our business. For more details on the impact of the transition to the new rules on our financial statements, please see our CFO commentary, which was included with our 8-K filing today, and is available on our website.To sum up today's call, I want to highlight that I am pleased with our progress. On an apples-to-apples basis, we are now expecting annual revenue to increase by more than 8% compared to the 7% revenue growth we achieved in 2017. We expect non-GAAP operating margin on the basis of the old rules to improve to approximately 20% for the year compared to 27.5% last year. And it's pleasing to me to see so much of the improvement in profitability flowing through to operating cash, which we now expect to land at a midpoint of $550 million for 2018, an increase of approximately $80 million over last year.Before I finish, I'd like to thank the extended Cadence team for their operational discipline, their drive and passion to make our customers successful, and for the very large part they have all played in allowing us to raise our guidance for the year. And with that, Operator, we'll now take questions.At this time, I'd like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press *, then the number 1 on your telephone keypad now. We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from the line of Monika Garg from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. First thing, if I look, I just see is 605 equal operating margins, as you highlighted, John, particularly at 29%. Where do you think operating margins could be in the next two to four years? -- Hi, Monika. Yes, we believe there is still room to grow operating margin. We're confident in our model and believe that our system design enablement strategy opens up additional growth opportunities for us. -- All right. Then, you know, if I look at the guidance, the first half revenue is going like 8.5% kind of less -- 8% less year-over-year, while the back half is close to 6%, looking at the guidance. Any reason why we would see deceleration in growth in the back half? -- Well, overall, business is good. I wouldn't focus too intensely on the result of any one individual quarter or one half or the other. Our focus is more on improving year-over-year. Business is very strong for all the reasons that Li-Bu talked about. I mean, for 2018, we're now looking at over 8% revenue growth, and almost all of that is organic. And like we said, on GAAP operating margin, I mean, that's up to 29% compared to 27.5% achieved last year. The other thing to note, on cash, the first half was particularly strong for operating cash flow due to the timing of the collections. And that's just a shift between quarters within this year. -- All right, thank you. The last one here is for Lip-Bu. Lip-Bu's synopsis entered the software security market about four years back. Would that market be interesting for Cadence, and could you talk about your views on Cadence M&A strategy? Thank you. -- Sure. So, I think there are two parts of the question. Once is on the security side. Clearly, we are also looking at that and then how to provide really high quality design for our customers, including stronger in verification and security is part of it, and then to drive the success to our customer. So, that's one. And then the second question, regarding the -- can you repeat the second question again? -- Yes, just wanted to understand your views, how you look at the M&A strategy for Cadence. -- Yeah, M&A, we have a very disciplined approach to the M&A. And clearly, we want it to fit into our overall strategy, and also providing the customer with a difference in technology, and also recruiting to bring in the top talent, either in the managerial or technical side. And at the end of the day, it's really focused on the shareholder return. -- Thank you so much. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Benchmark. Your line is open. -- Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me OK? -- Yes. -- I wanted to start out asking about the strength of the IP licensing in the second quarter. Can you speak to what drove the strength, the repeatability of the second quarter strength? And then conversely, it looks like your emulation business was weak during the quarter. And we know that's an upfront revenue recognition product line. And so, can you confirm that emulation was weak in the quarter, and what's your outlook for the balance of the year in emulation? -- So, let me start first, and then John will fill in. So, overall, we really like our refi IP strategy, and it's working well for us. It's another strong quarter for us in the DDR and PCIE. We mentioned a couple of key ones. The first DDR5 test chip is working at 7-nm at TSMC, and I highlight a couple of key success with the customer, DDR, with a major semiconductor company, PCIE with the leading storage company, and also working with the leading mobile customer on the 7-nm sensor application. So, overall, I think the IP business is doing well, and like I also mentioned, find new logos, and then going up over 10% of the revenue. And so, I think we're quite happy with our leadership and also our IP portfolio. And as you know, we recently just added the acquisition of new semi. Even though will be minimum impact for this year, going forward, that will be exciting for us. It's very critical for the hyper scale; the infrastructure, I think, is an exciting one for us.In terms of emulation, I think clearly, we're also quite pleased with our performance. We mentioned our six new customers, and nine repeat orders, and then two for the Palladium Cloud. And so, we're excited about that. But I just want to highlight it's a very lumpy business. Quarter to quarter may change. But overall, we are -- we like what we have. This is the third full year of continue to do well. And overall, we really focused on the verification suite that consists of Jasper, Xcelium, Palladium, Protium, and VIP. Overall, the verification suite is coming up nicely. -- Okay. I just had a follow-up question about your SaaS model, or Cadence Cloud. Should we assume that there's really gonna be no change to revenue recognition, average license duration, and perhaps no change to the operating expense model to Cadence? And should we view it really as more of a point of differentiation vis-a-vis your larger competitor? -- That's a fair assumption, Gary. Cadence Cloud offers customers another way to optimize their investment in Cadence tools. It's a valuable addition to our product portfolio for both customers and Cadence, and it's too early to say more than that. -- Okay. But no -- you don't expect a change in the revenue recognition or the average license duration? -- I don't, but it's too early to say that definitely. -- Okay, fair enough. Thank you, guys. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open.Thank you. Good evening, Lip-Bu and John. Lip-Bu, let me start with you regarding the overall EDA landscape in the following sense. We've seen more and more examples of partnering in the industry. Answers with Synopsis, answers with Mentor, and then earlier this month, quite interestingly, Synopsis with Siemens. And also, in the parallel universe of technical software, we've seen examples also of more and more partnering. And it's becoming a little more evident that Cadence hasn't really been participating in these kinds of relationships. And I know you're very much focused on your own internal development, and Anirudh's done a great job with that. But do you think that it's become increasingly important for you to participate in some of the kinds of relationships that we've seen more and more around you in the industry? -- Yeah. So, I think you have two parts of the question. So, one is about the overall EDA. And I think overall, I have to say that the EDA is very good, driven by the strong design activity, especially when we drive the whole data-driven, and also the whole technology wave in terms of machine learning, deep learning applications. So, we see the increase in the design activity, and we are very pleased to see that. So, overall, from the EDA say, we are excited. And then the other part is also the broad-based demand for our innovative system design enabled solution has been quite well received. So, overall, we are excited about the overall EDA environment.Regarding the partnership, we mentioned a couple of them, and clearly, we are also working on that. And so, I think it's important to really focus on what customer needs. And we partner in some cases with our peers and also ecosystem partners. We're working together to support the customer success. And a couple of them that we highlight in the past, partnership with the Metworks, and a partnership with National Instruments, and many others. And so, we continue to do that. And then we have our great success also.With respect to technology, let me ask you about three products that, if they succeed, might stimulate some incremental growth for you. But you haven't really talked about them. Number one is Pegasus, which you announced over a year ago at DAC. What's the status of that? I know it's hard to share shift in that market, but it is an important new product for you. Secondly, Synthesis. They're clearly at under 10-nm from incremental requirements for Synthesis, so do you see that as perhaps a source of incremental business for you? And then lastly, you've just launched Sigrity 2018. Could that stimulate some resurgent growth in PCB for you, as we saw six years ago? -- Jay, these are good questions. Let me address one by one. Pegasus, as you know, this is the -- for the manufacturing-related area. We're excited about the design we have with the massive parallelism and also cloud-enabled, so that we can really addressing all the cloud requirements. And then the other part is, clearly, when we are very focused on the certifications from some of the foundry partners. And we are excited about that, and stay tuned. And then on the Synthesis side, Jay, we are making great progress with multiple customers in the most advanced nodes. And then the Sigrity, in terms of the product, and then so far, we have great success, and tied in with the Voltus approach, I think is very good. But so far, we are not guiding any specific product line. And clearly, with respect to the Sigrity 2018, we have a new 3D capability that help the PCB that is quite unique.So, overall, I think all this already built into our guidance for 2018. But just back to your point, just truly, we are making great progress. Stay tuned.Thanks very much. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Rich Valera from Needham & Company. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Lip-Bu, question for you on the macro environment you're seeing with your customers. There's been some noise in the semiconductor industry around kind of where we are in the cycle, concerns about particularly in the memory side of the market. And as well, there's been some issues on the semi cap side, with some push outs of expected capex, none of which I would expect would affect your business. But I just wanted to get your sense on the demand trends within EDA, how they are now versus, say, a couple of quarters ago, and just how you see it as far as the strength of the industry and your customer base. Thank you. -- Yeah, good question. So, I think on the macro side, clearly, as I mentioned earlier, we've seen design activity increase. And due to a couple of factors I mentioned earlier, the next decade could be the big data, data analytics, and they change the whole workload and become a more data-driven economy. And we are very well positioned for doing that. And then also, some of the new technology, like 5G, the machine-learning, deep learning, and some of the new photonics and related, silicon photonics-related area, and we are very well positioned for that. So, I think overall, EDA is more related to the design activity. And we really see the increase of that. So, I think overall, I'm cautiously optimistic on that.Regarding the memory, clearly, the memory related to data, memory, and storage will be critical for us. We are delighted. We have making great progress on the memory player and the customer we highlight in the past two quarters. We continue to make progress on that. And we also have very good progress on some of the storage related. We just highlight some of the IP engagement with the storage player. And so, I think overall, the demand trend is continuing to look good. And regarding the semiconductor cycle, as we all know, there's a cycle, but I'm very cautiously optimistic because we see the design activity has increased a lot. So, we are excited, and we are very well positioned for that. -- Thank you. I appreciate that color, Lip-Bu. And one more on China, if I could. You've talked really sensibly in the past about your knowledge of that market and your, I think, penetration of that market. I just wanted to get your sense on the opportunity there, but also how you see that market potentially being affected by the current trade situation with the U.S. Do you think that they may be driven to actually do more internal development of all types of technology, including EDA? And what are surely just the opportunities and risks for cadence in the China market, if you could? Thank you. -- Good question. So, overall, we have done well in China. It's a growing opportunity, and we pay a lot of attention on that. And China, as you know, the government is very committed to build their own domestic industry to be self-sufficient. And we continue to be -- and I think most important for us is really to be the best trusted partner to our customers globally, including China customers. And we make sure that our tools and our IP are supporting them for the developments. And that's something that's a high priority for us. And then overall, we paid a lot of attention about the trade war. And then clearly, we hope for the best. But meanwhile, we really make sure that we are well positioned to support our customers. -- Okay, that's helpful. And one final one. And I'm assuming this is still the case, but last quarter, you had talked about IP likely being the segment of your business, all your segments, that was likely to grow the fastest this year. I think you were looking at that maybe as another double-digit growth year. Is that still the case? I would assume so from the commentary, but just wanted to confirm that. -- Yes, Rich, the -- yeah, I mean, when I look at the results, we're not guiding revenue by individual product groups. But what I can say is that, yeah, we continue to expect IP to be our fastest-growing product group for 2018. Yeah, that's true. -- Perfect. Thanks very much, gentlemen, appreciate it. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I really have two. The first one's a bit nuanced. So, I know you guys kind of benefit when the U.S. dollar strengthens. Is there any way to quantify what the tailwind of that was this quarter? -- There was a tailwind, Mitch, but it was minimal. -- And is that gonna be the same case next quarter as well, assuming the rates are the same? -- Assuming the rates are the same, it would be already embedded in our guidance. -- Okay. Perfect. And then the second question is just more of kind of a thematic one. So, the semi cap guys are all talking about how kind of EDA design is more integrated with what they're doing. So, is there reason why I guess you would integrate both a semi cap company and an EDA company in the future? -- Yeah. So, I think, Mitch, first of all, I'm not gonna speculate. And so, clearly we work closely with all our ecosystem partners, and ranging from the IP to the foundry, and including the semi cap equipment. And so, I think this is a whole ecosystem. And we focus on what we do best in terms of providing the tools in IP to be the best partner for the customers. -- Got it. And then again, just one last one. At DAC, there was a lot of private companies on the automotive side specifically that I noticed. Is that market still fragmented, or how do you guys view the automotive space, specifically for design? -- Yeah, we're very excited about automotive vertical, and clearly, we are very well positioned on that. As you can tell, the automotive might now have a lot more electronic components, and then also, everybody from tier one to the automotive maker, they're putting a big effort into the aiding the income of machine learning, deep learning, to thrive in a crowd-connected device. And we are very heavily engaging with them and are thinking of adding these great platforms. We have great opportunity in terms of the IP and also the tool, and we are well positioned for supporting them. -- Perfect. Thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from DA Davidson & Company. Your line is open. -- Okay, good afternoon. Maybe first, to follow up on Rich's question on China, do you have more exposure on the printed circuit boards side of your business there or is it more on the chip design side of it? -- Can you repeat the question again? -- Yeah. Your exposure in China, is it more exposed to your PCB design tools or to your chip -- actual chip or semiconductor design tools? -- I think we are more -- we don't have that breakdown. But I think clearly more on the chip design activity. And then the PCB side, clearly we have some engagement from Allegro, and then the packaging related area. But overall, it's a good opportunity for us, and we continue to support our customers. -- Okay, great. Just a couple questions, then, on the cloud. The industry for several years has been talking about moving to the cloud, and there's been some small little movements here and there. But what do you think it is about the increases or the advances in security that make now the right time to be more aggressive on moving toward the cloud? -- Yeah. I think you have a good question, and clearly, cloud datacenter and Cadence Cloud is a high priority for us. We are delighted. We're collaborating with Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to provide cloud readiness to our customer-managed cloud. And that's something that is exciting. And we highlight a couple of offerings on Palladium Cloud to Liberate Trio that is cloud available, and Pegasus on the cloud available. And we have great traction in terms of customer adoptions and endorsement by ARM and TSMC. So, overall, I think the securities issues that the last two years, we have been working through with our foundry partner and our IP partners. And more importantly, to make sure that our customers are satisfied and then really feel comfortable to deploy in their customer-managed cloud. And that's something that's exciting. And we have rolling out product by product available in a very broad way to provide the cloud to really drive productivity, scalability, and optimized security and flexibility to the customer. And we're very focused on the customer success here. -- Okay. So, when you talk about customers, is it mainly the smaller customers that can really benefit from the economics of the movement to the cloud, or are you also seeing some of the larger customers move there, so it's more of an individual capacity overflow point of view? -- And to answer your question, both. And so, very excited to see some of the major customers really want to be in the cloud. And that can really drive the -- at the end of the day, it's driving the productivity and the performance of their design. And when you can able to position all your design into spread over the vertical, unlimited server, and that can be really, really drive the performance, and they see the benefit, that that is really the key thing for us, for Cadence to really embark on it. And them some of the smaller companies also benefit from it. So, in the end, either the small company or big company is really the bottom line is drive the performance, and then the scalability and the productivity for their design. -- Okay. And then finally, when you look at three to five years, what percentage of your business, or what is your vision as far as how big the cloud becomes as a percentage of your overall business? -- It's a little bit too early to give the guidance. And then clearly, we are excited about this new Cadence Cloud, and we are focused on that, and then focused on customer success. And we are delighted the leading hyper scale web service cloud guy is partnering with us. And we are also very excited TSMC and ARM are endorsing and supporting us. And this is a major effort, and we are clearly the leader in this. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Thank you.Our final question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. I wanted to continue the line of questions on the Cadence Cloud. Can you help us understand, what is the pricing structure for your solution in the cloud versus the traditional on-premise solutions? -- Hi, Sterling. This is John. A key part of our strategy is to become increasingly mission critical to our customers. And Cadence Cloud offers customers another way to optimize their investments in Cadence Tools. We believe that Cadence Cloud will make our product portfolio more valuable. -- Okay. But does that mean, are you pricing on a per user, some sort of per process, or metered pricing, like traditional Amazon, just to understand how this opportunity will grow? -- Again, it's a valuable addition to the product portfolio, and customers will pay for the value they receive. I mean, generally, operationally, we focus on three keys things, which I believe creates a virtuous cycle. We lead with innovation, which makes us become increasingly mission critical to our customers, and then we drive operational excellence across the company. That virtuous cycle creates gains for Cadence that improve cash flow, and then we use that cash flow to reward employees, return value to shareholders, and invest in product development and new innovations to continue that virtuous cycle. And as Lip-Bu said earlier, when our customers look at Cadence Cloud, they'll focus on productivity, scalability, security, and flexibility. -- And in some ways, I think, Sterling, the feedback from our customers is really divided, because they see clearly performance improvement, productivity improvement, and that means that we can really support the pricing that we want to support the customer success. -- Yeah. And when you looked at -- obviously, the first solutions here seem to be in the verification and then emulation area, which makes perfect sense, given the elastic capabilities of those cloud platforms. Wondering what the gross margin impact as that particular set of products? Is it actually better for you gross margins, given the low margin hardware that you typically have to ship with it, or is it actually maybe neutral to the gross margins? -- Yeah, Sterling, I think a little bit too early to tell, but so far, we are very encouraged in some of the customers' feedback, and also a very strong partnership with TSMC and our hyper scale partners, and to scale out and really be able to provide that unlimited service that the customer can enjoy, and the scalability and the productivity and the time to market for their benefit. And hopefully, that will really drive the success of the cloud. -- Got it. And then very last question on the cash flow and collections, John, you mentioned just this was collections that you expected, so it sounds like some of the collections perhaps came earlier in the year than we would have expected, anyway. Can you just walk through what drives the change in the timing of those collections? Was it anything to do with either early renewals or other things that maybe allowed further upsell into those customers? -- No, it was mainly on the IP and hardware side. We received some IP and hardware payments in the first half that would normally have fallen more evenly across the year. And that caused the first half to be particularly strong for operating cash flow. But this is just a shift between quarters within this year, though. -- Understood. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. -- Thank you.I will now turn the call over to Lip-Bu Tan, Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks. -- In closing, through continuous innovation and execution, we are well positioned with our system design enablement strategy to leverage the multiple technology waves that further proliferate our solutions with a broader base of customers. We are proud of the innovative and inclusive culture we are building at Cadence. I would like to thank all our shareholders, customers, and partners, board of directors, and hard-working employees globally for their continued support.

At Design Automation Conference (\"DAC\"), the company collaborated with Microsoft's  Azure, Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") and Alphabet's Google Cloud platform to enable smooth design development of electronic systems and semiconductors.In the Digital IC Design and Signoff segment, the company reinforced its collaboration with Imec to tapeout the industry's first ever 3nm test chip. The chip complemented company's innovative digital implementation tools with Imec's development infrastructure. It is designed to aid digital transformation of mobile architecture at advanced nodes.Moreover, 7 nm design of Cadence has been adopted by notable companies. A major defense contractor will leverage Cadence's digital flow for its in-house chip design.Going ahead impressive adoption of flagship - DDR and PCI - products remains key catalysts. The company unveiled Tensilica Vision Q6, enhanced processor for embedded vision for on-device AI applications.Further, Cadence Tensilica Vision P5 DSP enabled GEO Semiconductor's (\"GEO\") GW5400 camera video processor to run company's in-camera computer vision.

The chipset is enabled to support safe autonomous driving level 4 and 5 via capturing a detailed image of the size, location and speed of any object within a range of 300 meters of the vehicle.The company has adopted Synopsys' \"DesignWare ARC EM Safety Island, EV6x Embedded Vision Processor with Safety Enhancement Package (SEP), Ethernet Quality-of-Service (QoS) Controller IP, STAR Memory System, STAR Hierarchical System and STAR ECC Compiler for its new 4D high-resolution imaging radar system-on-chip (SoC).\"The ASIL D Ready features of Synopsys' IP are suitable for the strict safety requirements of ADAS. Additionally, \"safety documentation, including failure modes, effects, and diagnostic analysis (FMEDA) reports\" are anticipated to quicken the pace of the chip's ISO 26262 Certification.Notably, in May, Synopsys unveiled the industry's first ASIL D Ready embedded vision processor IP for applications in ADAS and autonomous vehicles. It provides critical hardware features for safety along with maintenance of high performance. We believe this will provide the company with first mover's advantage in the market, eventually driving revenues. | Discussions regarding ADAS and autonomous vehicles often veer toward the reliability and safety-oriented issues of the vehicles. In March, one of Uber Technologies' autonomous vehicles killed a pedestrian in Arizona, while undergoing test driving.Following this incident, the governor of Arizona suspended Uber from test driving autonomous cars in the state for an indefinite period. Reportedly, this mishap led NVIDIA  , the manufacturer of hardware for Uber's technology, to stop testing of its own self-driving vehicles on roads.Notably, NVIDIA is currently using NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, a virtual reality (VR) based autonomous vehicle simulator that enables the virtual testing of autonomous vehicles in diverse conditions. Hence, safety remains a major concern for the companies dealing with autonomous driving and ADAS.Synopsys' IP solutions are equipped with self-checking safety monitor, error correcting code (ECC) and programmable watchdog timer. Also, the lockstep feature enables rapid detection of runtime faults and system failures and addresses the need for real-time networking between the connected devices.We believe that such initiatives on Synopsys' part will eventually increase its client bases, thereby boosting its top line in the long run. These will also aid the company in competing against peers like Cadence Design Systems Inc  .Synopsys currently has a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold).A better-ranked technology stock is Citrix Systems, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The company has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.8%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10% and a current market cap of $13.3 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio right now.Let's take a look at the factors aiding the company's performance.Increased adoption of Synopsys' products, as well as strength in hardware segment and IP are aiding the company's growth, as evident from its second-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues that jumped 14.2% year over year to $776.8 million. | Notably, the company is gaining traction from acquisitions. In January 2018, Synopsys acquired Kilopass Technology, a provider of one-time programmable (OTP) non-volatile memory (NVM) IP with applications in automotive, mobile, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) areas. The buyout is expected to help Synopsys in offering a wide portfolio of efficient IP solutions.Synopsys is also reaping the benefits of acquiring Black Duck Software, a provider of solutions related to security and management of open source software. Black Duck's brand recognition as well as cross-selling options are proving to be accretive to the company's top line.Nevertheless, the company's escalating costs and expenses, which are thwarting margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the timeline for realization of acquisition synergies remain headwinds.Moreover, the company faces stiff competition from peers like Cadence Design Systems  , which might result in lower prices and profits for Synopsys.Furthermore, the company has customer-concentration risk, as a small number of customers account for significant portion of its revenues. This could be risky, as loss of a single customer could affect its operating performance significantly and thereby jeopardize results.However, Synopsys' improving top line along with shareholder-friendly initiatives like the recent announcement of buying back $165 million worth of common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program make this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock worth retaining in the portfolio.Some better-ranked technology stocks include The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.  and Citrix Systems, Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The stock has outperformed its  in the year-to-date period. Intuit has rallied 32.6% in the said period, while the industry has gained 17%.The company's results in the last reported quarter benefited from a number of reasons. Management was particularly positive about a successful tax season backed by performance of the DIY category and higher average revenue per return. The company also managed to gain some additional share in the DIY market. Additionally, the shift in its product mix toward the higher end of the company's product line was also a positive.Intuit has an impressive earnings surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 37.8%. Backed by the impressive results, the company issued upbeat outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal.The company has two main products - QuickBooks which offer financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses, and TurboTax which offers income-tax preparation products and services. Notably, Intuit has been witnessing solid year-over-year growth for the past several quarters in its QuickBooks subscriber base, which is driving Small Business segment revenues.It should be noted that about 29 million small businesses in the United States depend on third-party companies to deal with their financial and accounting related preparation. With its rich product portfolio, Intuit has capitalized well on this opportunity which is well reflected in its previous quarterly results.For fiscal 2018, the company expects QuickBooks online subscriber base of 3.27-3.37 million. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will end the fiscal fourth quarter with a subscriber base of 3.223 million, marking 45.2% year-over-year improvement.The year-over-year increase in online subscriber base will continue to drive revenues, going forward. The innovative features being launched by the company will also aid the top line.The company's Consumer Tax segment revenue has been benefiting from strong adoption of its Turbo Tax products.Intuit's continued focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it add new customers.

The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and Internet of Things (IoT), consequently setting the stage for strong growth in the software industry.Moreover, continued enterprise investment in big data and analytics along with the ongoing adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) presents significant growth opportunity for industry players.Notably, the cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform to develop and test new applications and the deployment time is also much shorter as compared with legacy systems.Additionally, the increasing need to secure cloud platforms, amid growing incidences of cyber attacks and hacking, continues to drive demand for cyber security software.Further, as enterprises continue to move their on-premise workload to cloud environments (emergence of hybrid cloud), application and infrastructure monitoring have gained utmost importance. This is creating more demand for performance management monitoring tools that are not only scalable but also suitable for cloud-based environments.Robust demand for software and continuing innovations have been the key catalysts to consistent earnings and impressive sales growth. These are mainly behind investor confidence instilled in the Computer Software industry's growth prospects.The  , within the broader  , has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 34.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 13.7% and 19.2%, respectively.We believe the near-term growth prospects are bright given increased spending by enterprises on software procurement.However, the Computer Software industry's valuation looks stretched at the moment. One might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings.Notably, a lower P/E ratio is always better.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 26.65, which is close to the highest level over the past year.The space also looks expensive when compared with the market at large, as the forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.14 and the median level is 18.28.Moreover, a comparison of the group's P/E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium. The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector's forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.71 and the median level of 20.50 for the same period are way below the Zacks Computer Software Industry's respective ratios.Nevertheless, strong industry fundamentals and expectations of solid top-line growth should help Computer Software stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.Investors would also be eager to watch whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry's prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company's earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company's earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year's reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry of $3.13 per share reflects solid year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 2.6% upward since Mar 31, 2018.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #63, which places it at the top 25% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry appears promising. The group's mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has remained steady since March 2018 to reach the current level of 11.89%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Computer Software's long-term growth prospects are alluring. Growing adoption of hybrid cloud computing models, rapid usage of AI and machine learning tools, the proliferation of wearables & self-driving vehicles and increasing automation of the application development process bode well for the industry.Moreover, the growing usage of Internet of Things (IoT) at home, in office, for cars and every other conceivable place is also an incredible business driver. These factors are expected to drive top-line growth that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016.Another indication of solid long-term prospects is the improvement in the group's gross margin.The role of software is evolving. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage is expanding in managing infrastructure. Moreover, the industry is significantly benefiting from the ongoing cloud transition.SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth due to a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate. Moreover, strong spending by enterprises is a positive.Moreover, software companies are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. This enhanced liquidity is expected to boost their appetite for strategic acquisitions.Despite stretched valuations, investors can build positions in the Computer Software industry based on the above-mentioned factors as well as strong earnings outlook.Here, we list four stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).(You can see  .) ,  .: The stock of this Pittsburgh, PA-based engineering simulation software and services provider has jumped 45.1% over the past year.

Robust adoption of company's digital and signoff, custom and analog, and IP solutions along with an expanding customer base remains a positive. Significant demand from aerospace and defense sectors is a key catalyst.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the February 2019 put at the $40 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.5% return against the $40 commitment, or a 5.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CDNS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $40 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cadence Design Systems Inc sees its shares fall 10.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $38.60 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.40 from $40), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5.3% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $40 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the February 2019 put at the $40 strike for the 5.3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cadence Design Systems Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $44.68) to be 23%.

Symantec has witnessed a significant price decline in the year-to-date period, and negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the fiscal. Further, the company's Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.Notably, the stock has lost 24.4% of its value in the year-to-date period, substantially underperforming the 17% rally of its  it belongs to.Let's take a look at factors behind this plunge.The plunge particularly came after the company, during the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 , reported that its board's audit committee is making an internal investigation into the concerns voiced by an ex-employee. The company did not divulge details on the nature of the investigation, however, Symantec stated that it isn't related to any security breach or concern regarding products and systems.Lack of clarity on the probe announced, along with executives' refusal to take questions post the , has resulted in a plunge of more than 27% in Symantec's shares since May 10 to till day.Later, on May 14, this cyber-security provider held another press meet and stated that the probe relates to the reporting of certain non-GAAP accounting measures, which includes executive compensation too, public disclosures including commentary on the company's historical financial results, certain forward-looking statements, stock trading plans and retaliation.We believe this information is inadequate to gain investors' confidence. The ongoing investigation may throw light on some serious issues which might severely cost the company in the near future. Therefore, it is wise to wait and watch for some time for better visibility of the stock.Symantec's weaker-than-expected outlook for the first quarter as well as fiscal 2019 makes investors cautious about its near-term performance. Also, the company expects non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2019 in the range of 30-32%, which reflects a substantial decline from the fiscal 2018 level of 34.7%. The reduction in margins is mainly due to continued shift of business model to ratable revenues, and increased investment in sales and marketing capacity.Following the company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results and investigation revelation, the stock has witnessed sharp downward estimate revision. For fiscal 2019, we have seen 14 estimates moving south in the past 60 days. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend downward from $1.82 to $1.57.Additionally, for the current quarter, Symantec has seen 11 downward estimate revisions, dragging the consensus estimate down to 33 cents per share from 41 cents per share, in the past 60 days.Some better-ranked stocks from the computer-software industry space are Cadence Design Systems, Inc.  , Aspen Technology, Inc.  and Citrix Systems, Inc.  , all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Here are the details-Microsoft's $7.5 billion GitHub purchase is a very big deal because open source prospects have increased hugely in the last few years. And GitHub is the platform hosting the largest open source community of 20 million members with its storage, collaboration and communication tools.The platform functions through three processes: forking, which allows any user to copy a repository to his own account to develop the idea (GitHub has 57 million repositories); pull request, which is a request to the original owner to accept the change if desired; and merge, which allows the owner to accept the change by the click of a button after also checking the member's credentials and past work done on the platform.GitHub charges through a subscription model that includes unlimited public repositories for all plans. Private repositories cost $7, $12, $22 and $50 a month for Micro, Small, Medium and Large plans including 5, 10, 20 and 50 private repositories, respectively (for individuals). Teams are charged $25, $50, $100 and $200 for Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum plans that include 10, 20, 100 and 200 repositories, respectively. Users can add additional storage and bandwidth, each at $5 for a 50 GB pack.Businesses are charged $21 per user per month. GitHub Enterprise (hosted on a company's own servers, AWS, Azure, or GCP) starts at $2,100 per 10-user seat pack per year, which includes maintenance, upgrades and technical support at no extra cost.And still, GitHub has yet to make a profit, which is why it needs a bigger partner that can provide it with funds and additional resources, while also helping it to market the business and enterprise segments.That's where Microsoft comes in with its deep pockets, huge sales team and enterprise focus. CEO Satya Nadella was very clear about the rationale for the deal. He said that software was increasingly getting into non technological sectors at an unprecedented rate such that these sectors were hiring 25% more developers than the technology sector.Microsoft wanted to capitalize on this trend. It isn't hard to understand that these people would need a platform on which to communicate and collaborate. Microsoft could merge some of its tools into the GitHub platform and market them jointly to its huge enterprise customer base.There are some trust issues as some older developers remember Microsoft's past, when it was the bitterest critic of the open source platform and used its might to ensure that its own paid platform continued to dominate. But as the new GitHub CEO Nat Friedman has said, the company is determined to regain that trust. As developers understand that the success of the acquisition depends on its remaining open source and as independent as it is today, these problems will be automatically resolved.Microsoft is sinking a data center called Northern Isles into the North Sea off the Scottish coastline in an attempt to lower cooling costs in the second phase of trials as part of what it calls Project Natick. Natick is a research project studying the efficiency of data centers. In the first phase, a smaller data center was put on the sea floor off the California coast for 105 days with the goal of seeing whether it was possible to operate such a submerged data center.In this phase, Microsoft is going to study the logistics and cost of operating such a data center, as well as its impact on the environment, including the effect of heating up the waters and disturbing surrounding wildlife. A data center uses just 2% of the energy it receives with the rest dissipated as heat that because of its nature, can't be transported or put to other use.The experimental data center is medium sized at 12.2 meters in length and 3.18 meters in diameter, containing 12 racks housing 864 servers. It has a capacity of 27.6 petabytes, which Microsoft says is as much storage space as five million movies and packing as much power as thousands of high-end PCs. Some of the servers will be kept as standby because repairs won't be possible during the 12 months it is intended to remain underwater.Microsoft says that once submerged, the data centers can be moved with relative ease to the places where it's most required and since most people live by the coast line, this will mean faster games and lower latency for all operations, including self-driving cars.E3 for Microsoft was a statement that the company remains as determined as ever to make good on the ground it lost with the last game console.First, it announced 52 new video games including 18 exclusives, which is a big deal given that exclusives are what differentiates a gaming console. This year, the exclusives included Halo Infinite, Gears 5, Gears Tactics, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Forza Horizon 4 and Battletoads.Second, it announced that some games that had been exclusive to Sony's  console, such as the Disney-themed adventure Kingdom Hearts 3, Activision's (ATVI) Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Capcom's Devil May Cry 5 are now also available on Xbox.Third, indicating its focus on exclusives, Microsoft announced the acquisition of a number of gaming studios, including Seattle-based Undead Labs, Montreal-based Compulsion Game, and UK-based Playground Games and the BAFTA-winning Ninja Theory. It is also forming a new gaming studio called The Initiative in Santa Monica, California, headed by industry veteran Darrell Gallagher.Microsoft also said that the next Xbox was in the works and that it was in the process of developing a new streaming service that would enable gaming on Xbox, PCs or phones. carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Liquidity indicates a company's capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.Liquid stocks have always been in demand as these are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength. It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

The company is continuing with its investments in high-speed SerDes IP to address the needs of \"data-intensive applications such as machine learning, cloud computing and networking.\" The acquisition of Silicon and Beyond is a testament to the fact. Management is also positive about the recently completed acquisition of PhoeniX, which will enhance the company's photonic design capabilities.Management stated that the company's total addressable market has increased largely due to the Software Integrity group that deals with software security.

It primarily indicates a company's capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners. : It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. : This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  , which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in SYMC.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 13 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.82 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.60.Also, for the current quarter, Symantec has seen 11 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 33 cents a share from 41 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 20% in the past month. | So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Computer - Software industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Cadence Design Systems, Inc.  .

The newly acquired company is set to join Collaboration Technology Group (\"CTG\") of Cisco. Accompany's robust enterprise AI capabilities will strengthen Cisco's collaboration portfolio.We believe that company's expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security market holds promise. Security solutions of Cisco are likely to witness traction, going forward. The company's extended partnerships with the likes of Aon, Allianz and Rackspace are likely to boost security segment growth.However, weakness in the switching and routing is a headwind.

Recovery in the automotive industry aided the region's performance.ANSYS is rebuilding sales organization and improving operational execution to enhance go-to-market strategy in the EMEA region which will aid growth to rebound in 2018.Asia-Pacific revenues benefited from strong performance in China and South Korea. China's investment in infrastructure programs and domestic energy generation benefited the energy industry.Further, the industrial equipment industry gained on the back of strength in India and South Korea, but was marginally hurt by weakness in Japan and China.Direct and indirect businesses contributed 77% and 23%, respectively, to quarterly revenues.

But not so much the Dow. After the bell, Apple announced that it sold 52.2 million iPhones during its second quarter, which was right about in-line with expectations. The market had been very worried about weak sales after warnings from Morgan Stanley and Taiwan Semiconductor last month, so this result is a bit of a relief. Earnings of $2.73 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.69, while revenue of about $61 billion matched our expectation. As of this writing, shares are up more than 3% afterhours.Expectations for a strong report helped the NASDAQ to gain 0.91% to 7130.7, while the S&P made a late dash to the green with an advance of 0.25% to 2654.8. Both indices spent much of the day in the red before mounting comebacks. The Dow couldn't make a complete reversal, but it's slump was only 0.27% (or about 64 points) to 24,099.1.

Of course, there are many other things happening right now that could divert attention.The market's biggest concern is likely rising rates, which means the two-day Fed meeting that started today will be of interest. The Committee is not expected to raise rates this time, but everyone loves to try and decipher their language for hints on their future plans.And let's not forget about all the trade issues. Tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum were to begin on some top allies today, but the President pushed it back a month. While the idea of tariffs is not popular, this delay promises to keep such uncertainty in the news for a while longer. said Dave in  It may not seem like it right now, but Brian Bolan thinks this corrective period is coming to an end. Therefore, it's a good time to get a little more aggressive, which the editor did today by adding Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC). The company seems ripe to be taken over. In fact, it agreed to be bought by a Chinese company, but the deal was nixed by President Trump. In addition, LSCC reported a strong quarter just last week, which included better than expected results on both the top and bottom lines along with an encouraging guidance.

Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as they are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners. It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

I'm very pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the Q -- the first quarter. Based on the strength of our Q1 business and continuing momentum, we are raising our guidance for the year.John will provide details in a moment. The data-driven economy is being propelled by key technology waves of mobile, cloud data center, edge computing, automotive, and, most significantly, machine learning. These technologies create massive amount of data which need to be processed, analyzed, transmitted, and stored. These require power-efficient processing, high-bandwidth transmission, and high-density storage, which, in turn, are driving an increase in design activity and broad-based demand for our innovative system design-enablement solution.Now I will review some of the highlights from Q1. Our system design-enablement strategy enables us to increase our footprint with system companies and tailor our solution for vertical market segments. One of these vertical segments is aerospace and defense, where in Q1 we expanded our business with large orders from these companies. Turning to products.Our digital and sign-off business continued its strong market momentum in Q1. We collaborated with Imec, an international research and innovation hub, on the industry-first 3-nanometer cache chip tapeout using Cadence Innovus implementation systems and Genus Synthesis Solution. We continue to proliferate our digital solutions within market-shaping customers. And we broadened adoptions among other customers, including a major defense contractor that would use our digital flow for in-house chip design.Both a leading networking company and a top communication processes company adopted our digital flow for 7-nanometer designs, continuing our momentum at the most advanced process nodes. We achieved strong performance with our system design and verification solutions in Q1. The Cadence verification suite marked a strong quarter as the business grew over 20% year over year. Palladium added five new customers, and we booked 17 repeat orders.And Protium S1, targeting the prototyping market, continued to ramp as customers realized faster design bring-up due to common front end with our Palladium Z1 platform. During the quarter, we added four new Protium customers and booked five repeat orders. Our hardware products nicely complement the software solutions in our verification suite: Xcelium for parallel simulation and JasperGold for formal verification. Thirty additional customers adopted Xcelium in Q1.Our custom and analog design business continued to do extremely well, and we lead the market with our flagship Virtuoso product line. We introduced major enhancements to our Virtuoso custom IC design platform that improve electronic system and IC design productivity. A new set of innovative methodologies and technologies, including support for 5-nanometer nodes led to more than a 3x reduction in FinFET layout effort. One of our automotive customers, Bosch, endorsed the new system, saying that their long-term collaboration with Cadence has led to crucial innovation in both electrical ware and a new electrical-driven layout design.Customers, including defense contractors, analog semiconductor companies, and mobile chip makers, are adopting our Virtuoso system design platform, especially for products using heterogeneous multidie integration. Our IP business, with its refined strategy and augmented road map, is well-positioned to take advantage of continuing outsourcing trends. Momentum for our flagship DDR and PCIe products continued with significant wins, especially for 7-nanometer designs. We announced a new Tensilica Vision Q6, our latest processor for embedded vision and on-device AI applications built on a new faster processor architecture.The Vision Q6 builds upon our highly successful Vision P6 that is used in many leading application processors, including Kirin 970 SoC from HiSilicon. Finally, I want to talk about the culture we are building at Cadence that underlines all our success. We are committed to driving an innovative and incisive culture that embrace the diversity of our global workforce. The strength of our culture is highlighted by the recognition we received from Fortune.We earned the No. 38 spot on the list of Fortune's Top 100 Best Companies to Work For and are proud to make the list for the fourth year in a row. Our commitment to innovation can be seen in more than 20 significant new products the Cadence team has developed in the past three years. We are also focused on supporting our global community and have been recognized by the Fortune as a Best Workplace for Giving Back.When I joined the company, one of my top priorities had been building a culture that differentiate Cadence. We can be proud of what we have accomplished. I am encouraged by the progress we are making, and we will continue to make our culture central to our business strategy. Before turning it over to John, let me quickly summarize my comments.We drove excellent results through consistent execution and broad-based proliferation and adoption of our solutions to meet the needs of the data-driven economy. We are raising our guidance for the year on the strength of our business. Our growing aerospace and defense business had a strong quarter. We continued to grow adoption of our digital flow for 7-nanometer designs, and we introduced a major upgrade of our flagship Virtuoso platform product line for custom/analog designs and a new higher-performance Tensilica processor for Vision and AI applications.With that, I would now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook. -- Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report we exceeded all of our key operating metrics in Q1. As a result of strong execution across our business, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal year 2018. Before we get into Q1 results, I'd like to remind you that Cadence has now adopted the new revenue accounting standard known as ASC Topic 606 for fiscal 2018.These new rules, as we often refer to them, are now GAAP for Cadence. The numbers I present for our first quarter are based on these new rules, unless otherwise stated. Please also keep in mind that the numbers for 2018 under the new rules are not directly comparable to those of 2017, which were reported under ASC Topic 605 or, for ease of reference, the old rules. Cadence used a modified retrospective transition method on adoption of the new rules.Under this transition method, rather than recast prior periods, we are required to dual report our 2018 results. So alongside our new GAAP rules, we will also provide you today our first-quarter results for 2018 as reported under the old rules. These results under the old rules are directly comparable to 2017. Having covered that, let's go through the key results for the first quarter, starting with the P&L.As reported under the new rules, total revenue was $517 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 27.8%, GAAP EPS was $0.26, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.40. Under the old rules, for direct comparison against our Q1 2017 results, total revenue was $525 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 29.5%, GAAP EPS was $0.30, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.44. Please note that approximately $0.04 of the year-over-year improvement in our non-GAAP EPS is directly attributable to the reduction in our effective tax rate resulting from the recent U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Please also note that $6 million of the $8 million difference in revenue for Q1 between new rules and old rules is attributable to changes in revenue recognition for IP. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and short-term investments were $752 million at quarter-end, of which approximately 30% was onshore. Day sales outstanding at quarter-end was $695 million.Operating cash flow was $158 million. During Q1, we used $50 million for share repurchases and $40 million to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As reported, DSOs were 41 days. Under the old rules, DSOs were 38 days.I will now provide our updated guidance. On the heels of strong execution in our first quarter and continuing momentum for our business, we are raising our outlook for the year. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 8% for 2018 on an apples-to-apples basis under the old rules. For Q2, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $510 million to $520 million, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 27% to 28%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.20 to $0.22, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.39 to $0.41, and DSOs of approximately 40 days.Our updated guidance for fiscal 2018 is revenue in the range of $2.055 billion to $2.085 billion, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 27% to 28%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.86 to $0.94, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.57 to $1.65. We are increasing operating cash flow to a range of $510 million to $$550 million, an increase of $25 million at the midpoint, and we expect to continue to repurchase Cadence common stock at the rate of $50 million per quarter during 2018. Please note that we expect -- revenue under the old rules will be approximately $30 million higher than under the new rules, with $20 million of that difference attributable to changes in revenue recognition for IP. There is no impact to our cash flows or to how we operate our business.As a result, our implied 2018 guidance at the midpoint under the new rules -- or under the old rules is now revenue of approximately $2.1 billion, representing growth of 8%, compared to the previous estimate of 7%; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28.6%; GAAP EPS of $1.01; and non-GAAP EPS of $1.70. This quarter, I especially urge you to read through our CFO commentary, which was included with our 8- K filing today and is available on our website. There, you will find additional information and comparisons and reconciliations for the new and old revenue accounting rules, and you can see how all of our lines of business performed throughout the first quarter of 2018. Functional verification had a particularly strong quarter with great momentum across the entire verification suite, we continue to see strength across all lines of our core software business, and our IP business is performing in line with my expectation that it will prove to be the fastest-growing part of our business for 2018 on an apples-to-apples basis.To sum up today's call, I want to highlight that I am pleased with our performance across all lines of business. I'd like to thank the extended Cadence team for their financial discipline and for their drive and passion to make our customers successful. A very large part [Inaudible] our revenue growth projections to 8% for the year. The hard work is starting to pay off.With that, operator, we'll now take questions.[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Gary Mobley with Benchmark. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats to a good start to the year. I want to start with a question about capital allocation.You mentioned that you raised your cash-flow outlook for the year. You have 10 percentage points more of your cash in the U.S. now versus at end of the year. I'm just curious why you're not getting more aggressive on your share buyback.And with respect to capital allocation, how would you characterize the M&A environment out there with respect to valuation expectations from some of the targets and whatnot? -- That's a good question, Gary. I'll take the first part, and then I'll ask Lip-Bu to take the second part on M&A. But board and management at Cadence are laser-focused on creating shareholder value. And as you know, we regularly review capital structure and capital allocation to balance investment needs, risk, liquidity, and capital return.Also, as we said in the last call, in the first half of this year, we plan to review our overall tax position in light of the new tax act, including our options for the use of repatriated cash. But -- so that's all in focus right now. -- Yes, on the M&A front, Gary, I think the board and the management are laser-focused on creating shareholder value, strategic-driven and disciplined approach. And our M&A philosophy has always been very disciplined and -- to tie into our EDAs' SDE strategy and also focused on customers with differentiating technology products and then attracting the best talent in terms of managerial or technical talents and also able to provide a compelling return on investment and acquisition. We, with our board, with our management, hold ourselves accountable for all the key acquisitions. And so that had been our discipline for doing that.So I think we're going to continue, laser-focused on our internal development and using M&A to supplement our organic growth. -- OK. A quick question about the mix between systems companies and merchant IC companies. I know you probably get asked the question a lot, and I don't know if you have an exact figure you can state from your Q1 results, but what do you estimate your mix between systems companies and merchant IC companies was for the first quarter? And I guess, even more specific, what would you estimate your non-IC design revenue contribution in Q1? -- So, Gary, I can tell you that we haven't drilled into the mix for Q1. But the last time we measured the mix, it was around 40% system companies. I know that hasn't changed in a while, but that's because we've seen growth from both the systems business and also our semiconductor business. -- Gary, if I can add, is our system and IC business are doing well. And we, first of all, focus on our tool in [ph] IP supporting our IC customers and then, meanwhile, with approach to system design-enablement to tailor some of our solution in IP to meet the customer in the systems side in terms of driving some of the success, especially in the PCB and the system integrity analysis side. And then now we're starting to really pursuing the automotive, and then we have great success this quarter and last quarter, same thing with aerospace and defense that we highlight this quarter that we received multiple large orders from several of these defense and contractor and aerospace companies. We are delighted some of these vertical markets we are pursuing.And same thing with automotive. And the last quarter, we highlight a very strategic relationship with a market-shaping automotive maker in terms of software and hardware IP service solutions. And then the other part, we also signed last year in the beginning, a large design IP with a major semiconductor customer, automotive customer. And then the other part, we're also very pursuing the cloud/data center, the optimization and -- in terms of driving some of the success and solution for them.Clearly, nusemi is a great acquisition for us so that we can really provide that ultra-high-speed connectivity for them. -- OK. Thank you for that. I'll turn the floor over to somebody else.Your next question comes from Monika Garg with KeyBanc. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. First on the IP, so if I just look -- I know ASC 606, IP is kind of down $10 million year over year. Could you maybe give us an idea how much of it is just due to accounting ASC 606? And what would happen in the revenue otherwise? -- Monika, thanks for the question. Yes, in Q1 of 2017, if you remember as part of our transition to the new revenue-accounting standard, we recognized an extra quarter of royalties. That added about $5 million to IP revenue back in Q1 2017, so you have to allow for that when you're considering growth. Also, IP revenue recognition was impacted most by the 606 revenue transition; $6 million of the $8 million difference between 605 and 606 revenue for Q1 was related to IP.So on an apples-to-apples basis, IP was actually up year over year, but -- and I made a point in my script to call out the fact that I still expect that to be the fastest-growing part of our business for 2018. And that's despite the fact that in our 10-K, we highlighted that the acquisitions that we did in 2017 are not expected to generate significant revenue in 2018. -- And then, Monika, I think just to add on, clearly, this -- we're excited about the IP business and the outsourcing trends continue. And clearly, we have some of the most differentiating IP under this new, refined, augmented strategy and then focus on the most advanced nodes. And then the other part is some of the -- Tensilica, we highlight this new -- the Q6, and then also the nusemi acquisition for the high-speed SerDes, and then also the DDR and PCIe. So we have a very good portfolio to drive some of the success for our system and semiconductor customers. -- Lip-Bu Tan, as a follow-up, I think you talked in your comments about Tensilica processor for vision and AI. Maybe could you give details on interest you are seeing from customers regarding this product? -- Yea, we just announced recently, and so far the response from customer is very positive. Because clearly, this is based upon the success of the Vision P6. They are very well [Inaudible] adopted for the application processor, and meanwhile, this is a higher-performance, and also we are quietly tuning up our software capability, the algorithm capability, and that we can providing the overall solution for, not just for vision, not just for audio, now we can really drive some of the embedded vision in an on-device artificial intelligent application that will be broadly, hopefully will be broadly adopted. -- All right. Just the last one. After the muted performance in emulation [ph], of course given a very strong performance in '16, Q1 seems very strong in functional verification. Maybe could you provide more details? Thank you. -- Sure. So I think as I highlighted that clearly, we are very pleased with our system-verification suite. And that grew 20% year over year. And with that, clearly our hardware business, as John highlighted, we have a strong backlog from last year.And then Q1, also a very strong quarter both for Palladium and Protium. We highlight the five new customers and then 17 repeat orders for Palladium. And then for Protium, that is a prototyping, we are also very delighted with four new Protium S1 customers and five repeat orders. And then Xcelium, if you recall, is the integration of Rocketick and Incisive and then we complete integrated together.We are delighted this quarter, we have 30, 3-0, new customers adopting it. So we -- overall, I think verification is critical for all the complex design. I think we have an entire suite from hardware and software able to provide to customers the most compelling. And also clearly, customers see the benefit of the quicker design using the same front end as the Palladium Z1, that is very attractive for them. -- Thank you so much. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good evening. For John first, a couple of questions, and then finish up with Lip-Bu on the end market. John, were there any unusual increments to upfront or perpetual revenues in the quarter besides hardware, which, obviously, did quite well.And it looks like, just doing a quick inference, that you might even have had a record quarter for emulation. But you mentioned A&D a number of times and strength from that end market. And historically, in EDA, aerospace and defense has tended to prefer upfront licenses, unless that's changed. So perhaps you could comment on any increments of that kind in the quarter from upfront licensing.And then for Lip-Bu, you highlighted some advances in sub-10-nanometer. And I'm wondering if the deal -- sorry, the flows of -- from prior contracts carry forward into sub-10-nanometer. In other words, were the implementations done for 14 and 20 and so forth extensible down to under 10? Or are we going to see a whole new round of selections for 7 and below that you're going to have to compete for? -- Jay, I'll take the first part of your question, but I was certainly pleased with the performance of all our lines of business in Q1. Approximately 90% of our revenue is recognized over time, and that was no different for Q1, so there was nothing unusual. The -- and as you know, with our ratable model, the strong Q1 tends to have a bigger impact on the entire year, but -- so you'll see that the Q1 -- the strength in Q1 has carried through into a strong guidance for the year. But -- and we continue to see strength in our custom IC and digital software business, too.But I'll pass it over to Lip-Bu. -- Yes. So I think, Jay, a couple of points. And one, I think I highlighted with Imec collaborations, we announced 3-nanometer quadruple patterning test chip and successfully taped out. We are very pleased with that.And then clearly, our volume business is in the 14-, 16-nanometer in terms of from a customer point of view, but we're moving very rapidly into the 7- and 5-nanometer. A lot of our design activities, a lot of our IP engagement is in the 7- and 5-nanometer. And so far, every new process node, there's opportunity for us to help our customer to win in the marketplace so that it can proliferate. And so clearly, we are excited about the opportunity in front.The tool with the distributed -- the processing and then the massively parallel, that have been our advantage, and right now we're using machine learning, deep learning, to even drive further advantage in terms of PPA runtime type and also some of the verification, we are applying our machine learning, deep learning capability into our tool. At the end of the day, it's supporting our customer to faster design and verify so that they can go for production and win in the marketplace. -- Just to finish up with John, could you talk about your philosophy on pricing? Specifically, as part of your management of what you call deal-quality metrics, are you looking at pricing or let's -- to be more specific, suboptimal pricing, in the case of any specific customers, more than a count level? Or are you thinking in terms of pricing more broadly in terms of how you might apply price increases or less discounting and so forth? -- Jay, yes. We're very disciplined and value-driven and very focused on pricing here at Cadence. But EDA is a competitive business and pricing can vary from sector to sector and product to product. But we believe the best way to derive value from our products is to collaborate deeply with customers and deliver innovative and clearly differentiated solutions that make our customers successful. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- [Inaudible] for taking my question. Can you just talk about the division and guidance for the year from last quarter to this quarter? What are the specific parts of the business that you think are stronger now compared to three months ago? -- Farhan, this is John. Yes, strength in the quarter was broad-based. Functional verification had a particularly strong quarter with great momentum across the entire verification suite, as Lip-Bu mentioned earlier. But we continue to see strength as well in our custom IC and digital software business.And our IP performance -- our IP business performing in line with our expectation, so that's going to be the fastest-growing part of Cadence on an apples-to-apples basis. So it's pretty broad-based. -- Sorry, I meant for the year, not just for the quarter -- Similarly, it's pretty broad-based across the year. We expect -- I think we said last quarter that we expect all of our businesses to grow this year. -- Got it. And then in emulation, Mentor Graphics recently claimed that they have taken leadership and market position in emulation. Can you just talk about the competitive dynamics in the -- within the emulation market? And how are we in terms of the product introduction cycle? -- Yes. So Farhan, this is Lip-Bu. And clearly, the hardware business, we are very pleased with our performance and in terms of Z1 and also our Protium S1, this is on prototyping side. And clearly, in the verification, this is very important for their verifying -- for their design.And we are excited, our hardware and software really complement the full suite to really providing our customer. So I think overall, we are very excited about what we have, and we've made great progress, 20% year-to-year growth. And we respect our competitors and -- in what they are doing, and so we continue to compete in the marketplace. -- Got it. And then one last question, on the opex linearity through the year, can you just talk about how we should model opex for the year? -- Right. So with the transition to the new revenue rules, if you're using the 606 numbers, that you'd expect the commission expense to be more flat throughout the year. But -- so I think that will probably take away some of the expense profile. It should be reasonably flat throughout the year. -- Got it. Thank you, that's all I have. Thank you.Your next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Your line is open. -- Yes. Thank you. Would just like to follow up on the emulation question. It seems like it's a pretty dramatic turnaround that the whole category of verification was down about 5% year over year last year, I believe you said in your last call.And presumably, hardware was down meaningfully more than that given the relative stability of software. And now it seems like hardware is probably up quite sharply in the first quarter. So just wondering if you can give any color on what might account for that dramatic turnaround year versus year. Was it simply a matter of just really difficult comparisons in '17 off the real strong '16? Or was there anything else you could point to in the product or the marketplace for that pretty dramatic turnaround? -- Yes, this is Lip-Bu, Rich, and thanks for the questions. And as I mentioned multiple times, hardware is a very lumpy business. And we have -- last year, I think the first half had a little bit soft start, but we have finished very strong in Q4, and that momentum carried us in the Q1. As I mentioned, we have in hardware, Palladium Z1, we have five new customers and 17 repeat customers and then orders.And then the Protium, we have four new Protium customers and five repeat customers. And so overall, I think it's not just the hardware. And also, our software, Xcelium, we have 30 new customers in this quarter. Finally, we put it together with the Rocketick integrations and for the parallel simulation.And then the other part is the formal verification for JasperGold. So overall, I think it's -- like John mentioned, across the board, the whole verification is strong, and we are very delighted to provide that entire verification suite for our customers. -- Got it. And then you specifically, in 4Q, called out I think real strong bookings, real strong hardware bookings. And clearly, that's translated into a nice Q1. Anything you'd say specifically about bookings? I know you've said numbers of customers, new customers and repeat customers.But would you say that you had another strong bookings quarter for the hardware business in Q1? -- I would say that -- and again, we don't talk about bookings on a quarterly basis. And hardware is a very important component of our entire portfolio. We typically view it as a complete verification suite. But I would say that we've been very disciplined and value-driven on pricing to ensure that we get the value that we believe the hardware is worth. -- Great. And then just one more if I could on digital. I don't know if you said specifically how fast digital grew, it looks like it was kind of a double-digit number. But did you say that specific number, John? -- No. It was 9%. -- Nine percent, OK. So -- yes, I know that was double-digit last year. Would you be willing to hazard whether you think that might be a double-digit growth business again this year or not willing to go there at this point? -- No. We're generally not going to guide or comment on individual product line growth rates for 2018 other than to say that we thought IP was likely to be the fastest-growing group. -- Yes, if I can add, it's just we are excited about our digital flow. And as I mentioned, a couple of very successful ones we have, the leading networking company adopting us and then the top provider of the communication process adopting us on the 7-nanometer. Last quarter, we highlight a premier hyperscale and moving into the 7-nanometer, they're using our entire suite. And overall, I think it's just continue the proliferation with the market-shaping customers and that we continue to expand that footprint. -- Got it. Thanks very much and a very nice quarter, gentlemen. Thanks. -- Thank you.The next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. -- Yes, good afternoon. Another question on the IP front. So it sounds like 606 has about a 10% impact to IP this year. Wondering, does that reverse next year? Are there additional one-timers in the out-year that would impact that as well? -- So last quarter, we talked about the -- our expectation for the difference in total revenue between the two sets of rules was $40 million. We thought in 2019 that that would drop into about $25 million in 2019. But now we think it's $30 million and a similar proportion for the out-years. And I think, if you look at IP, we think 20 of the 30 SiP for this year haven't drilled into the impact in 2019.But all we're saying is that we expect the impact between 606 and 605 as slightly smaller than we thought it would have been last quarter. -- OK, you said that same ratio roughly holds then for the out-year? Was that... -- I think so, yes. -- OK. And the same ratio of IP as a percentage? -- That's a good guess. -- OK. So I guess when you look at the new kind of refined IP strategy in the markets that you're serving now versus before, are you -- do you believe you're growing in line with a double-digit market growth? Or are you going slower or faster than that at this point? -- We're not giving specific... -- Yes, I think clearly -- so we mentioned that is refined strategy and augmented growth map, just want to highlight to you, we are pursuing more scalable and more profitable focus. And we are focusing on the most advanced nodes, and we are focused on customer success and we are focused on the star IP, like the Tensilica, like the nusemi ultrahigh-speed SerDes, so we're going to continue to build on that. The high-differentiating IP, they are the most leading edge, and then we really focus on scalability. We don't do that kind of one-off type of things and we're really focus on the quality. -- OK. And then just looking broader at the IP market, what is the penetration of outsourced or merchant IP? And what percentage is done in-house? And where do you think that percentage goes over time? -- Yes, I think as I mentioned, the outsourcing trend continues. I think clearly, from the -- our customer point of view, unless they really need to have that IP to differentiate their product offering, some of the industry standards and as long as reliable -- that's why we want to position ourselves as a reliable, trusted, high-quality IP provider. I think over time, there's a lot of room for growth. And we are excited.That's why John said this will be our highest percentage of growth in terms of our product line, and we are excited about this IP, and especially applying to some of the key verticals, either that hyperscale data center, the distributed data center, vertical data center, the automotive, and then in terms of mil/aero related area, that's a lot of very unique IP that, over time, we can build and acquire to do that. -- OK. So at this point, do you think we're at the halfway point then from an outsourcing trend line? -- Yes, I can't put out where we are. All I can say is, like the baseball terminology, still in the early round. -- OK. All right. Thank you. -- Thank you.The next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with J.P.Morgan. Your line is open. -- Just want to follow up on that line of questioning on IP. And I apologize if you said it earlier, I'm bouncing between calls. But I get lots of questions around the autonomous driving, artificial intelligence, etc., what is the core IP that you've built at this point? And what kind of demand traction are you seeing for those elements within the IP franchise? -- Yes, so I think, Sterling, first of all, we are focusing on some of this, we call it, high-speed connectivity side and either the USB or PCIe or high-speed SerDes, addressing some of that data storage-related requirement, and then using the Tensilica to drive some of the AI autonomous driving and how to work with vision, sensor related. So I think we have 2 parts. One is providing our tools and IP to help our customers to design some of these ADAS and then some of this requirement for autonomous driving. And like last quarter, we highlight the premier automotive maker adopting some of our key IP for doing that.And then the other part is really addressing some of the AI on the vision, audio and then on this on-device AI application and beyond. And so there's a lot. AI, machine learning is so broad. You can move into -- beside the data center, beside the mobile automotive -- autonomous driving, and even some of the medical genomic sequencing, that's a lot.It's fascinating, and we are just touching the surface. And so there's a lot of room to grow there. -- And on those types of opportunities, has anything changed in terms of the mix of contract structure you're getting in terms of upfront versus annual subscription versus kind of a perpetual payment for that capability? -- No, not much. I think pretty much the same and there are requirement for their design. And so clearly, there's a lot of opportunity, as I mentioned earlier. I just want to add on to it the whole silicon photonics, the whole quantum computing and with AI, and so there's a lot of new compute architectures that come out on the hardware and software, and we are fascinatingly excited they're going to drive the semiconductor development growth.We see the design activity increase a lot for us. -- That's great. One last question, we talked about digital and your growth and kind of the improvement in that space. We don't talk as much about the analog side where you guys have been so dominant through the years. Have you seen anything changed on the competitive landscape in the analog franchise? -- Not a lot. Clearly, we doubled, tripled down on our leadership. And then that's why we highlight this Virtuoso custom IC new platform. It's a significant major enhancement that's able to drive all the way down to 5-nanometer process nodes and then with our leading partners in the foundry.And also, I think we drive some of the new innovative methodology and technology that drive more than 3x reduction in FinFET layout effort. That is huge. In terms of customers, love it. And then we just highlight one of the customers, Bosch, and they see tremendous value for that.And we also see different contractors, analog semiconductor company, mobile chip makers rapidly adopting our Virtuoso new tool that we just announced, and the response has been overwhelming. -- Great. Thank you. -- Thank you.Your last question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to touch really quick on the systems side. So I know you guys can't disclose customers, but is there any way to maybe give us some information on how they spend? Meaning that when a systems company spends to kind of create their own chips, do they spend any differently than kind of the standard semiconductor customer? -- In general, pretty much the same. They all want to design the silicon or their system. And then we have a very unique position. Beside our tool, we have IP and we also have the PCB side and the system simulation, especially the power are critical for them.And then the only difference on the system guide, and time to market is more critical for them. Because they want to win in the marketplace, first-mover advantage is critical for their success, and they are more focused on the time to market and also they are focused more on the quality of the products. And clearly, they appreciate the value that we provide. And so I think we are delighted to work with them.Our job is basically make sure that our tool and IP may help them to design the most complex chip, the most complex system they have. And in some way, we partner with some of our partners, like MathWorks. And we are delighted to work with them. Clearly, with our PC -- PSpice and with their tool, we make a more integrated solution from the system-level design all the way to the chipboard implementation.That is really a [ welcome ] from an automotive and some of the new aerospace, and we are delighted. And so -- and we also, last quarter, we did an acquisition, on SFM, and really driving the ECAD-MCAD library creation. And this whole mechatronics is really taking off. So we are excited about all this opportunity in front of us. -- Got it. And then just one small one. A couple of years ago, you guys have talked about systems essentially increasing as a percentage of revenue, but it sounds like that's stayed the same. So maybe I guess what happened over the last couple of years that essentially caused that to be essentially the same versus the original expectation of growing as a percentage of revenue? -- Yes. So far, I think overall, our revenue growing and so our semi growing and our system also growing very fast. And so we are delighted. I think both engines are growing nicely.And then, John, you may want to highlight. -- Yes, just to highlight, that we haven't updated the analysis and the mix for Q1.

One example of this trend is  (CDNS), which has sold off significantly after a dramatic rise to all-time highs earlier this year. If this tech volatility sticks around, it could be best to avoid these stocks right now.Cadence Design Systems offers products and tools that help customers to design electronic products. For example, the company's core electronic design automation software and services enable engineers to develop different types of IC design blocks to electronic systems and semiconductor customers.CDNS has slumped more than 21% since touching a new peak in late January, but the company's valuation still seems stretched. Meanwhile, the stock is sporting a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and recent analyst estimates might cause further hesitation.Cadence is expected to release its latest quarterly financial results in late April. Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect the company to post adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share and total revenues of $505.8 million.These results would actually represent respectable year-over-year improvements of 19% and 6%, respectively. However, analyst sentiment for this period-and future fiscal periods-has been less optimistic recently.When looking at the Most Accurate Estimate, which only considers the most recent analyst estimates, we see that Cadence's earnings projection is one penny lower for the soon-to-be-reported quarter and three cents lower for the upcoming quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is also a penny lower for the company's full-year and next-year earnings estimates.Since earnings estimates and analyst sentiment have such a profound effect on a stock's momentum, this worsening outlook is not a great sign.As mentioned, CDNS has slumped more than 21% over the past two months, but the company's valuation is still stretched. Based on Friday's close, Cadence was trading at 23.5x forward 12-month earnings, which is a premium compared to the broader technology sector.The stock also has a P/S of 5.4, which means its shares are looking overvalued based on the company's revenue picture too. Investors love to look at the P/S ratio for these smaller software and tech firms because having a strong customer base is precious in this space, so it is discouraging to see this valuation metric at this level too.The bottom line is that investors have been quick to ditch these companies with stretched valuations in the recent tech selloff, and stocks with sluggish earnings outlooks are likely to be punished even further.Last year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

However, Synopsys is not obligated to buy back any specific number of shares and the program may be terminated depending on the company's decision.In fiscal 2017, Synopsys repurchased stock worth $380 million. At the end of fiscal 2017, the company had $400 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization of $500 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company bought back $180 million worth of its common stock, following which the fund was refilled.According to the company, accelerated share repurchase (ASR) arrangements are an integral part of its overall efforts to enhance investors' worth. In fiscal 2017, the company either initiated or completed $325 million worth of ASR. Prior to that, in December 2015, it initiated a $200 million ASR program while in December 2014, it started a $180 million ASR program that was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.We believe that apart from strategic investments, the company's continuous focus on such shareholder-friendly initiatives will help the company's shares rebound going forward. Notably, Synopsys has rallied 16.1% over the past year, underperforming the 30.4% surge of the  it belongs to.NVIDIA and Western Digital have long-term expected EPS growth rates of 10.3% and 19%, respectively.Additionally, the company's raised fiscal 2018 guidance is encouraging. The company's recent acquisitions of Black Duck Software and Kilopass Technology are expected to boost the top line in the long run. Moreover, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to consumers.However, escalating costs and expenses, which have been dampening margins, remain headwinds.

Further, the company's Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) only highlights its innate weakness.Cadencehas gained just 18% of its value year over year, underperforming 23.4% growth of its  .Let's delve deeper and find out what is taking this company down.Cadence provided not so encouraging first-quarter guidance. For first-quarter 2018, the company expects total revenues to be in the range of $500-$510 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of 36-38 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues and earnings are pegged at $505.8 million and 38 cents, respectively.For 2018, revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $2.015-$2.055 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are guided in the range of $1.50-$1.60 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues and earnings are pegged at $2.05 billion and $1.57 per share, respectively.Cadence faces stiff competition from other EDA companies like ANSYS and Siemens AG (post the acquisition of Mentor Graphics). Intensifying competition negatively impacts pricing power, which keeps margins under pressure.The company generates a significant portion of its revenues from the International market. Consequently, we expect adverse foreign currency exchange rates to impede revenue growth in the near term due to fluctuation in the U.S. dollar against the Japanese Yen, Euro and other foreign currencies.Acquisitions have also negatively impacted its balance sheet, as high indebtedness adds to the risk of investing in the company. As of Dec 30, 2017, the company had total debt of $644.4 million. We also note the high level of goodwill and intangible assets, which totaled $944.8 million or almost 39.1% of total assets at the end of fourth-quarter 2017.So, it may not be a good decision to retain this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't intend to wait for a long time.Few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.  , NVIDIA Corporation  and Seagate Technology PLC  , all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA  , Micron  and Centene  .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Tech's recent volatility has some investors ditching the sector altogether, but with demand for many key products-including memory storage solutions-still on the rise, one needs to maintain some exposure to this growth. One great option is scooping up shares of the memory giants themselves, including the likes of  .Seagate manufactures a portfolio of hard disc drives, solid state drives, and solid state hybrid drives. The company develops solutions for both the enterprise and consumer markets.Secular trends are driving growth in the memory market, and Seagate certainly stands to benefit. Meanwhile, an improving earnings outlook has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while several key valuation metrics remains attractive.Seagate most recently reported financial results on Jan. 29. The company posted adjusted earnings of $1.48 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by eight cents and improving about 7.2% from the year-ago period. Revenues were also up slightly year over year, with net sales of $2.91 billion surpassing our consensus estimate of $2.83 billion.Seagate is expected to report its latest quarterly financial results in late April. Analysts are expecting the company to report adjusted profits of $1.30 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of more than 18%. Revenues are projected to be up 2.4% to hit $2.74 billion.But these estimates have been trending higher over the past few months, suggesting that analysts are warming on the company's prospects for both the near and long term.Fresh volatility in the tech sector over the past two months has seen investors start to ditch previously-hot stocks with stretched valuations. One example of this trend is  , which has sold off significantly after a dramatic rise to all-time highs earlier this year. If this tech volatility sticks around, it could be best to avoid these stocks right now.Cadence Design Systems offers products and tools that help customers to design electronic products. For example, the company's core electronic design automation software and services enable engineers to develop different types of IC design blocks to electronic systems and semiconductor customers.CDNS has slumped more than 21% since touching a new peak in late January, but the company's valuation still seems stretched. Meanwhile, the stock is sporting a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and recent analyst estimates might cause further hesitation.Cadence is expected to release its latest quarterly financial results in late April. Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect the company to post adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share and total revenues of $505.8 million.These results would actually represent respectable year-over-year improvements of 19% and 6%, respectively. However, analyst sentiment for this period-and future fiscal periods-has been less optimistic recently.When looking at the Most Accurate Estimate, which only considers the most recent analyst estimates, we see that Cadence's earnings projection is one penny lower for the soon-to-be-reported quarter and three cents lower for the upcoming quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is also a penny lower for the company's full-year and next-year earnings estimates.Since earnings estimates and analyst sentiment have such a profound effect on a stock's momentum, this worsening outlook is not a great sign.As mentioned, CDNS has slumped more than 21% over the past two months, but the company's valuation is still stretched. Based on Friday's close, Cadence was trading at 23.5x forward 12-month earnings, which is a premium compared to the broader technology sector.The stock also has a P/S of 5.4, which means its shares are looking overvalued based on the company's revenue picture too. Investors love to look at the P/S ratio for these smaller software and tech firms because having a strong customer base is precious in this space, so it is discouraging to see this valuation metric at this level too.The bottom line is that investors have been quick to ditch these companies with stretched valuations in the recent tech selloff, and stocks with sluggish earnings outlooks are likely to be punished even further.A first week of a month is always the most active for market-moving macro data.Bond market economists and stock strategists alike consider the huge flow of macro data out in the first week of a month -  - to be catalysts for changes to their quarterly and annual outlooks, on rates and on stock prices, respectively.In turn, their updates become a big focus for informed traders and investors on their subscriber lists, in the Global Week Ahead.There were a number of top ranked global themes to choose from; a mixture of Reuter's in London, Scotia Bank in Canada and the Financial Times everywhere.The headlines I wrote down, though, will look very familiar to you.I put my five themes for the week ahead in a rank order. The most important is first.On Friday, the release of the U.S. March nonfarm payroll report will be on traders' and investors' radar, in the wake of Fed Chair Powell's first rate hike.With inflation pressures brewing, wage growth figures will be important for world financial markets. Economists polled by the Financial Times have payrolls rising by +150K jobs in March and the U.S. unemployment rate falling to 4.0%.Average hourly earnings are expected to increase 0.3% in March. The U.S. economy added a hefty +313K jobs in February. But a slowdown in wage growth pointed to only a gradual increase in inflation this year, which eased investor concerns.The background to all of this will be the interest rate market. As longer-dated bond yields rise, banks which borrow short-term money and lend it on longer-term benefit.Spring is coming to large parts of the northern hemisphere. It seems fitting that so much global data is coming out.World stock markets have just seen their first quarterly fall in two years. This will feed the view on how Q2-18 might play out.On Wednesday, March inflation data from the Eurozone is expected to creep up and bolster bets on the end of ECB \"QE\" this year.ISM and unemployment/jobs numbers in so many countries -- from the United States to India -- which most economists need, arrive all week long.Whether or not the world's biggest tech and social media firms can bounce back from the more than $400 billion wipeout of the last couple of weeks is going to be one of the big things to watch. top brass might reveal when they will appear in front of lawmakers in the United States and Britain to answer questions about the misuse of 50 million users' private data.The heat is also likely to stay on online retail giant  . President Trump is not happy. Its growing dominance is sending many small businesses to the wall.U.S.-China trade frictions will remain a central focus. There are hopes there will be negotiations that end with everyone looking happy for the cameras. But for the time being everything remains uncertain.The U.S. administration is expected to announce tariffs on China's so-called  that are new growth sectors such as robotics and artificial intelligence applications, alongside limits on Chinese investments in U.S. companies and technology transfers.One background issue over the last couple of weeks has been a sizable appreciation of the Renminbi. In trade-weighted terms, the China currency has now risen more this year - 3% - than it did in the whole of 2017.The Renminbi has been closely hugging the daily benchmark fixing set by the central bank. Markets are speculating that allowing the Renminbi to rise might be part of China's conciliatory offerings in the trade spat.Markets have largely reversed improved odds of a NAFTA deal this week.Scotiabank in Canada says there is a high bar set for being able to deliver upon U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's earlier quest for at least a handshake agreement on NAFTA next week. Incredibly, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) semiconductor chip company is now a $230 stock with a $140B market capitalization. With a Zacks Value score of F, this is all about the seemingly unlimited potential for future growth, set by equity strategists that cover the stock. I find it easier to like this $60B market-cap stock as a strategist, and own it for any number of portfolio objectives. The Zacks Value score of A, Zacks Growth score of A, and Zacks momentum score of A are much more palatable. If you don't want to be in the hot chip plays, you may want to consider this HMO-Medical stock. It carries a Zacks VGM of A, with an A for Value and a B for Growth. It has a $19B market cap at the moment.For major stock like these three, there are lots to look out for, in a busy first week of the month.Every day, the analysts at Zacks Equity Research select two stocks that are likely to outperform (Bull) or underperform (Bear) the markets over the next 3-6 months.Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous analyst coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

These additions have also contributed to revenues.Notably, the company's recent acquisition of Kilopass Technology has strengthened its one-time programmable (OTP) intellectual property (IP) portfolio. Synopsys also completed the acquisition of Black Duck Software in December 2017. These acquisitions are anticipated to boost Synopsys' top line.Also, Synopsys' time-based license revenue model is impressive. It ensures effective renting of the software rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee. Notably, this revenue model provides better visibility and predictability.However, escalating costs and expenses, which are dampening margins are headwinds. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies and increasing competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics are concerns. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

The results also marked year-over-year improvement.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share (excluding stock-based compensation expenses and all one-time items) of $1.10, which came in 17% higher than the year-ago quarter's non-GAAP earnings of 94 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was pegged at $1.00.Following the better-than-expected result announcement, shares of Synopsys gained 4.4% during yesterday's after-hour trade. Nonetheless, Synopsys has underperformed the  to which it belongs to over the past year. The stock has rallied 24.2% during the same time frame, while the industry has gained 33.8%.The company's fiscal first-quarter revenues jumped 17.9% year over year to $769.4 million and came ahead of the previously guided range of $740-$765 million. Reported revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $751.4 million.On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by increased adoption of Synopsys' products, strength in IP and hardware products, as well as the Black Duck acquisition. Apart from this, an extra week during the reported quarter also helped the company in generating more revenues. Excluding the extra-week effect, the company's top line grew 11% year over year.Aart de Geus, chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys, noted, \"Propelled by the evolving age of 'Smart Everything,' semiconductor and systems companies, along with software developers across many industries, are driving digitization and machine learning, which require more and more advanced chips, sophisticated hardware/software interaction and high levels of software security. As the Silicon to Software partner, our unique combination of leading technologies positions us well to participate in this dynamic wave of opportunity.\"Segment wise, License revenues (including time-based and upfront) came in at $662.5 million, up nearly 16.4% from the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues jumped 27.5% year over year to $106.9 million.Total non-GAAP costs and expenses flared up 21% on a year-over-year basis to $573 million. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, the same expanded 200 basis points (bps) from the year-earlier quarter to 74.5%. The increase in total cost and expenses were primarily due to elevated employee compensation and cost of goods sold.Synopsys' non-GAAP operating income rose 11.7% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $195.9 million. However, operating margin shrunk 140 bps year over year to 25.5%. Higher operating expenses impacted the operating results.The company's non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter came in at $169.6 million, marking year-over-year growth of 16.9%. | Synopsys exited the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $605.9 million compared with $1.048 billion reported at the end of the previous quarter. The decline was mainly due to the funding of the recently-completed acquisitions of Black Duck and Kilopass Technology. Accounts receivables were $499.4 million compared with $451.1 million recorded in the last quarter.During the quarter, the company used $59.4 million of cash for operational activities due to the aforementioned acquisitions. The company repurchased $180 million worth of its common stock during the quarter. It has remaining $200 million for its current authorization.During the quarter, Synopsys completed the acquisition of Black Duck Software - a leader in automated solutions for securing and managing open source software - which opened up opportunities for generating additional revenues in the reported quarter. The addition of Black Duck's Software Composition Analysis solution will enhance Synopsys' product offering and expand customer reach, consequently boosting the top line.Apart from this, in the first quarter the company also acquired Kilopass Technology - a provider of one-time programmable (OTP) non-volatile memory (NVM) IP with applications in automotive, mobile, industrial, and Internet of Things (IoT) areas. This buyout will help Synopsys offer a wide portfolio of efficient IP solutions. The customers are anticipated to gain from the combined force of the two companies, while the robust portfolio is expected to be a top-line booster for Synopsys in the near future.Buoyed by splendid quarterly performance, Synopsys raised its fiscal 2018 outlook. The company now expects 2018 revenues to be in the range of $2.92-$2.95 billion (mid-point $2.935), up from the earlier guidance range of $2.88-$2.91 billion (mid-point $2.895). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.90 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $3.76 and $3.74 (mid-point $3.705 per share), up from the prior projection of $3.46-$3.53 (mid-point $3.495 per share). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.51.The company noted that the acquisition of Black Duck will be dilutive to its earnings initially but will be accretive over the long run. Chief financial officer of Synopsys, Trac Pham stated that, \"We expect it to be $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS, reach breakeven in the second half of 2019, and be accretive thereafter.\"Operating cash flow is projected in the range of $500-$550 million.In addition to these, the company initiated guidance for the fiscal second quarter as well. It estimates revenues in the range of $765-$790 million (mid-point $777.5 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $716.2 million. The company expects non-GAAP expenses within $575-$585 million. Management predicts non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.06 and $1.05 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 83 cents.Synopsys started fiscal 2018 on an impressive note. Revenues as well as earnings improved year over year, mainly due to strength in hardware and IP products and benefits from the Black Duck acquisition. Additionally, the company's second-quarter and fiscal 2018 guidance are encouraging.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results in the near term. Furthermore, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company are likely to drive its near-term performance. Additionally, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to consumers.However, escalating costs and expenses, which have been dampening margins, remain headwinds. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies and heightening competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics are other concerns.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation  and Intel Corporation  , both sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

Moreover, the firm estimates AR/VR spending to accelerate at a CAGR of 198% over the same period to reach $143.3 billion in 2020. This presents significant growth opportunity for semiconductor chip makers as well as electronics sensor developers. We note that these two industries make the majority of customer base. We believe that the company's expanding product portfolio will help it to win frequent orders as well as new customers from these emerging markets going ahead.The company has also introduced a broad portfolio of interface and memory design IP solutions for automotive applications using TSMC's 16-nanometer FinFET Compact process. We note that the expansion of Renesas agreement reflects the company's growing influence in the autonomous vehicle market. Of late, the company has won orders from well-known companies like MobilEye and Infineon who are developing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) related technologies. This is a prudent step given the significant growth prospect of the ADAS market, which is estimated to be worth $42.40 billion by 2021, according to data from MarketAndMarkets.We also note that the company is focused on augmenting footprint in the aerospace and defense segment. Apart from having a dedicated team for the sector, Cadence has expanded systems business through partnerships with established sector players like Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems and GE Aviation. We believe that these partnerships will help in driving the company's market position in the long run.Notably, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.9% in the last quarter. Further, the company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 12%.However, intensifying competition, currency volatility, leveraged balance sheet and stretched valuation remain major headwinds.We note that Cadence currently has a trailing 12 month P/B ratio of 12.17, which compares unfavorably with what the industry observed to some extent, in the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 11.38 and is closer to the high end of the valuation range.

Black Duck is a provider of solutions related to security and management of open source software. The deal was valued at $547 million net of cash acquired.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. Black Duck's flagship product, Software Composition Analysis is anticipated to enhance Synopsys' solutions as well as broaden its clientele, thus boosting the top line.Synopsys' Software Integrity Platform combines testing technologies and automated analysis for detection and remediation of defects and vulnerabilities at the beginning of the development process to ensure minimal risk and optimum profit levels.Notably, the rapid increase in the use of open source software (OSS) that comprises almost 60% of the underlying codes in current applications has lowered development costs but is plagued by security breach issues. The addition of Black Duck's software solutions will detect known security vulnerabilities affecting open source code and also generate alerts for the same. This will improve the effectiveness of Synopsys' solutions. | Acquisitions are central to Synopsys' growth strategy and are helping it to gain access to newer markets and technologies. Intense competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corporation has made the EDA market tougher to penetrate. Synopsys' acquisitions have helped it to boost revenues.Most recently, Synopsys acquired Forcheck, which offers static code analysis tools in Fortran applications. These tools meet the industry coding standards and compliances. Prior to that, the company had added Cigital, Codiscope and Simpleware to its kitty.The acquisitions have expanded the company's product suite thereby driving the company's top line. This is evident from the company's fourth-quarter revenues that jumped 9.9% year over year to $696.6 million.Synopsys stock has gained 52.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 35.3% rally of the  it belongs to.We believe unique intellectual properties and global support provided by Synopsys are likely to drive near-term performance of the company. The company's recent product launches and deal wins will boost results, going ahead.However, a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines. Moreover, escalating costs and expenses, which are putting pressure on margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability.Further, customer concentration risk remains a huge concern for the company. Additionally, a substantial portion of the company's revenues are generated from outside the United States. This might adversely impact the top line due to unfavorable currency fluctuations and an uncertain macroeconomic environment.Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some top-ranked stocks worth considering in the sector are Intel Corporation  and Lam Research Corporation  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 5 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cadence Design Systems Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $32.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $48.00. The standard deviation is $6.442.But the whole reason to look at the  CDNS price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CDNS crossing above that average target price of $43.00/share, investors in CDNS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $43.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Cadence Design Systems Inc:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

The stock has gained 31.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 5.2% rally of the  it belongs to.The outperformance can be attributed to expanding customer base as well as strong execution over the last four quarters. It was also driven by Genpact's solid domain expertise in business analytics, digital and consulting businesses.Genpact's pipeline continues to grow on the back of increasing adoption of its transformation services. The enthusiastic approach of the C-level of different companies in transforming business models through digital, data and analytics is turning out to be a positive for the company.Moreover, the recently announced Genpact Partner Plus program will help the company better serve its clients. The plan includes partnerships related to Consulting, Digital Technology and Industry Solution that will help in delivering scalable and sustainable offerings. | Its recently launched artificial intelligence (AI) platform - Genpact Cora - is helping the company to provide related offerings to industries like consumer packaged goods, industrial engineering, life sciences and high tech.Acquisitions like Rage Framework and design thinking based companies such as Tandem Seven have also expanded the company's AI product portfolio.Per an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems and AI is estimated to go past $47 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 55.1%. Given the huge scope the segment has to offer, it is not surprising to see a number of companies flocking to the scene.We believe that Genpact's robust product portfolio will help it to gain significant market share amid intensifying competition.Genpact has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Across nearly every industry of the technology sector, shares have soared on the back of increased demand and shifting consumer habits. Interestingly, one of the most in-demand segments of the tech market this year has been enterprise software, largely due to widespread adoption of new technologies by large businesses and corporations.As we head into the New Year, enterprise software companies look poised for another strong run. Cloud computing is continuing to get more affordable, and the advent of artificial intelligence presents new uses for large chunks of data. This could help enterprise tech firms become the hottest stocks in the tech sector throughout 2018.With that said, check out these three enterprise software stocks to buy now:Cadence is a leading designer of electronic design automation software and produces solutions for semiconductors, computer systems, and consumer electronics, among other things. Cadence shares have been on a strong two-year run, including a 73.5% surge in 2017 alone.

The company's earnings are projected to swell an additional 7.9% next year. The stock's P/E of 31.31 is a bit bloated, but it actually comes in lower than the \"Computer - Software\" industry's average, so investors could be getting a comparatively decent price for CDNS right now.Red Hat is a leading provider of open-source software and enterprise IT solutions, including cloud computing. The company has a strategic partnership with Amazon's  Web Services unit and is rapidly growing its cloud offerings. Red Hat just surpassed earnings estimates again and remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of the software firm actually slipped in the wake of the company's earnings and revenue beat, but we think this could be an opportunity to buy on the dip. Subscription revenue for app development and emerging tech, a key growth catalyst for the company, was up 44%. And guidance for the upcoming quarter was higher than analyst expectations.Splunk provides a software platform, which collects and indexes data and enables users to search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on this data, all in real time.

It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.7%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company's sustained focus on introducing new products is expected to continue boosting revenues. Moreover, its unique intellectual properties and global support are likely to drive forthcoming results.Also, Synopsys' time-based license revenue model under which customers effectively rent the software rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee is impressive. Notably, this is a much more predictable revenue model, providing better visibility through a steady and recurring revenue stream.Additionally, acquisitions are central to the company's growth strategy and are helping it to gain access to newer markets and technologies as well as diversify and broaden product portfolio. In fact, the company's continued acquisitions are expected to make a good contribution to its revenue stream.In September, Synopsys had completed the acquisition of QuantumWise. This buyout has not only enhanced the company's capabilities but has also gained it QuantumWise's customers. Therefore, we expect the acquisition to boost the company's fourth-quarter revenues.However, a challenging technology spending environment, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies, and competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp., remain near-term headwinds. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Synopsys' has an Earnings ESP of -1.22%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Pure Storage, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +18.52% and a Zacks Rank #3.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

Ever since Symantec reported its  on Nov 1, the company's shares have lost more than 13%.The downtrend stemmed from the company's dismal second-quarter results wherein its top and bottom line both fell short of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Furthermore, revenues were in line with the mid-point of the company's guidance range, while non-GAAP earnings came in at the lower end.In addition to this, the cybersecurity company issued disappointing guidance for the next quarter's revenues and earnings, as both fell short of the respective consensus estimates. Moreover, the company's dismal outlook for the full fiscal makes investors worried about its near-term performance.Notably, Symantec has underperformed the  to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. The stock has returned 17.1%, while the industry recorded growth of 36.1% during the same time frame.Following Symantec's dismal performance, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed a downtrend as analysts decreased their estimates. Analysts polled by Zacks are convinced that this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock may witness a lackluster performance in the future as well. Over the past 30 days, the Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2018 moved down by 6 cents and 11 cents, respectively.Analysts covering the stock are cautious about Symantec's future performance due to the factors highlighted by management during the fiscal second-quarter . The company noted that its booking mix is shifting faster than expected toward more ratable revenue recognition, which resulted in lower-than-expected revenue growth in the quarter.Per Symantec, \"Adoption of our Integrated Cyber Defense platform is leading to an increase in the number of larger and multi-product deals, which is a strong validation that customers are designing Symantec into their future security architectures. These trends are however also affecting our in-period revenue recognition. The mix of our bookings is shifting towards more ratable revenue recognition as customers are increasingly adopting our cloud, subscription and virtual appliance products in multi-product deals.\"The company expects the aforementioned factors will continue to impact its near-term results. Therefore, it lowered its revenues and non-GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal 2018.Apart from the booking mix issue, there is another factor which makes us increasingly cautious about Symantec's near-term performance. It should be noted that last month the company announced accomplishing the sale of its Website Security and related PKI business to privately owned DigiCert Inc. This move is believed to be Symantec's effort to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet's  Google, which has accused it for mis-issuing over 30,000 of web certifications.However, we believe that although the sale of the company's certified authority business will avoid conflicts with Alphabet, the loss of high-margin business might hurt Symantec's near-term profitability.Therefore, we suggest investors to stay away from investing in this stock till we find a better visibility on the company's growth opportunities.Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry space are Blackbaud, Inc.  and Cadence Design Systems, Inc.  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Long-term expected EPS growth rates for Blackbaud and Cadence Design are 15.9% and 12%, respectively.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 5 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cadence Design Systems Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $32.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $48.00. The standard deviation is $6.442.But the whole reason to look at the  CDNS price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CDNS crossing above that average target price of $43.00/share, investors in CDNS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $43.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

The figure surged 46.2% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $795.5 million increased 13.2% on a year-over-year basis and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $785 million.The year-over-year growth was driven by 10.5% increase in the average number of paid worksite employees. Revenues per worksite employee per month were up 2.5% to $1,421.The increase in worksite employee can be attributed to new client sales that were driven by a 12% jump in the average number of trained business performance advisors. Client retention averaged 99% in the third quarter. | Moreover, corporate leads, social media followers and unique visitors to insperity.com increased more than 30% in the reported quarter.Insperity's stock has returned 38.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 18.2% rally of the  .Gross margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 17.6%. Gross profit per worksite employee per month increased 7.8% to $250.Adjusted EBITDA increased 37.5% year over year to $43.1 million, which surpassed management's guidance of $37.5-$39.5 million. EBITDA per worksite employee per month increased 16.7% in the quarter to $63.Operating expenses rose 15.9% year over year to $110.2 million due to increase in the average number of trained business performance advisors. Continued investments in the company's technology infrastructure, security and development also led to the upside.Insperity exited the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $285.9 million compared with $243.8 million as on Jun 30, 2016.To-date, the company has repurchased 349,000 shares at a cost of $27 million and paid $18 million in cash dividends.For fourth-quarter 2017, Insperity projects adjusted earnings in the range of 91-95 cents per share.

Average WSEEs are anticipated in the 182,800-183,200 bracket, representing growth of 10-10.5%, but down from previous expectation of 11-12%.We believe Insperity is well poised to benefit from the booming professional employer organization (PEO) industry. Management claims that its flagship co-employment solution, Insperity Workforce Optimization, has been the most comprehensive business service in the marketplace for many years. Additionally, the launch of Insperity Premier in the third quarter is anticipated to be a key catalyst.Moreover, improved client retention, diversified product portfolio, growth in worksite employees and strength in ancillary products are the other positives. Further, management stated that competitive positioning, gross-profit contribution, and operational excellence will drive future growth.However, an increase in health-care costs does not bode well for the company as it is one of the major components of operating expenses.

Of these, approximately 71.3% of the companies posted positive earnings surprises, while 70.1% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies grew 9.4% from the comparable period last year, while revenues were up 7.3%.The trend this earnings season indicates that we will finally witness back-to-back five quarters of earnings growth after five straight quarters of decline. The report projects that earnings for the S&P 500 index will improve 2.6% from the year-ago period, while total revenues will be up 5%.Technology is one of the four sectors expected to report impressive earnings growth. The other three are Oil/Energy, Industrial Products and Construction. Various technology giants, including Alphabet  , Microsoft  and Amazon  , are scheduled to report their numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 9.9% on 7.1% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Though the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company's earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management's ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.The world's largest semiconductor company,  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results. We expect this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to post earnings of 80 cents per share and revenues of $15.71 billion. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter's actual figures, represent almost flat growth. You can see  | Intel's earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector, but the stock has struggled to gain momentum as investors have become increasingly concerned with the chipmaker's competition. Of late, the company has been sensing the pressure from the likes of NVIDIA and Avanced Micro Devices. Nvidia's artificial intelligence processors are already at the forefront of the booming AI industry, while AMD has doubled down on its server chips. And both of these companies compete with Intel in the ever-important gaming segment. (Read:  )However, we anticipate the company's strong growth at the data-center group segment to cushion its top- and bottom-line results. Increasing demand for data storage and high-performance networks has been propelling this segment's growth. As the number of smartphones and Internet-connected devices escalates, along with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing, Intel's Data Center business will expand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment's revenues is pegged at $4.82 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 6%. As Intel's data-center business accounts for nearly half of the company's operating margin, the benefit of increase in segment's revenues will trickle down to the bottom line as well.We expect  's third-quarter 2017 results to benefit from strength in paid clicks, solid advertising revenues, mobile search ads and increasing momentum in the Other Bets segment. Also, increasing use of machine-learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos will drive top-line growth.We expect paid clicks to grow in the to-be-reported quarter, driven partly by growing volumes of mobile and TrueView ads on YouTube. YouTube remains a strong contributor, benefiting from the heightening online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged in the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.The company's advertising revenues will likely be driven by healthy growth in its mobile search ads, YouTube ads and programmatic advertising. Furthermore, given an encouraging performance of the Other Bets segment during the second quarter, we estimate the segment to continue its momentum this quarter as well.In addition to this, the increasing use of machine-learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos will continue to drive top-line growth in the upcoming quarter. (Read:  )The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's revenues is pegged at $21.94 billion for the quarter under review, up 20.1% from third-quarter 2016. Moreover, the Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $8.39 per share and the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). | Let's take a sneak peek at  which is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Microsoft's cloud computing service - Azure - has been the major growth driver in recent times. In the last quarter, Azure revenues soared a whopping 94% at constant currency on a year-over-year basis. We believe robust adoption of this cloud computing service will continue to drive the company's top line in the soon-to-be reported quarter. According to data from Synergy Research, Azure  only Amazon Web Services (AWS) in terms of market share and revenue growth in the cloud infrastructure services market.Also, Microsoft now leads the enterprise SaaS market that gained almost 31% year over year to reach $15 billion in quarterly revenues. The outperformance was attributed to the buyout of LinkedIn that contributed revenues of $1.1 billion in the last quarter. Microsoft projects approximately $1.1 billion of revenues from LinkedIn in the fiscal first quarter.Additionally, we note that strong Office 365 and Windows 10 adoption are other growth drivers for the quarter. (Read:  )The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's revenues is pegged at $23.53 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, up 15% from the year-earlier quarter. In addition, the Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 73 cents and the stock has a Zacks Rank #3. | Another tech company,  is also set to report its quarterly numbers. We expect this Zacks Rank #3 company to post earnings of 98 cents per share and revenues of $291.78 million, marking year-over-year growth of 5% and 1.5%, respectively. | VeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). We note that the company continues to benefit from strong demand in the United States as well as international markets. Reportedly, in the last quarter, new .com and .net registrations were 9.2 million compared with 8.6 million in the year-ago quarter. VeriSign reported that .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD, followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).Thus, strong gTLD growth, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results, in our view. We believe increasing domain name registration, along with price hikes for domain names, will drive the top line.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and escalating operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds. (Read:  )Lastly,  is another company scheduled to release earnings numbers. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, this Zacks Rank #3 company is likely to report earnings of 34 cents on $482.39 million revenues. Earnings and revenue estimates represent year-over-year growth of 14% and 8.1%, respectively.We believe Cadence's third-quarter results will be driven by a number of projects won during the period.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDNS options chain for the new October 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $41.00 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $41.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $40.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDNS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $42.02/share today.Because the $41.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of CDNS stock at the current price level of $42.02/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $43.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 2.45% if the stock gets called away at the October 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDNS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDNS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $43.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $43.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

On a non-GAAP basis (excluding all one-time items), earnings came in at 92 cents per share, up from 76 cents posted in third-quarter fiscal 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was pegged at 69 cents.The robust year-over-year bottom-line performance was mainly driven by strong revenue growth and efficient cost management. The company's third-quarter revenues jumped 13% year over year to $695.4 million and came toward the higher-end of the previously guided range of $685-$700 million (mid-point $692.5 million).Reported revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $690 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys' products, and strength in IP and hardware products. About 90% of the revenues came from the backlog in the beginning of the quarter and the remaining 10% was contributed by a customer.Despite reporting strong quarterly results, shares of Synopsys were down as much as 3.3% during yesterday's after-hour trade, before settling down at 1.4%. This may be due to the fact that the company's non-GAAP earnings came in toward the lower-end of the previously provided guidance range of 91-94 cents.Nonetheless, Synopsys stock has gained 34.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 22.6% rally of the  it belongs to.Segment wise, License revenues (including time-based and upfront) were $603.8 million, up nearly 10.5% from the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues surged 32.7% year over year to $91.6 million.Non-GAAP gross profit was $544.4 million, up approximately 8.9% from the year-ago period.

Operating margin expanded 220 bps on a year-over-year basis to 24.1%.The company's non-GAAP net income for the quarter came in at $141.6 million, marking year-over-year growth of 21.9%. | Synopsys exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.302 billion million compared with $1.131 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivables were $411.3 million compared with $373.8 million in the last quarter.During the first three quarters, the company generated $449.7 million of cash flow from operational activities. The company repurchased $300 million worth of its common stock during the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The company has remaining $500 million for its current authorization.Buoyed by better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results, Synopsys raised its fiscal 2017 outlook. The company now expects fiscal 2017 revenues to be in the range of $2.670-$2.685 billion (previous guidance $2.650-$2.670 billion).

Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 55-58 cents, while GAAP earnings are projected between 26 cents and 33 cents.Synopsys posted impressive fiscal third-quarter results.

The idea of frequent trading for smaller profits per trade might seem like there isn't enough gain to justify the potential pain. However, that overlooks the risk-reduction benefits offered by swing trades. What if you could take nearly the same gains with less pain?Taking small profits helps avoid corrections or even long periods where a stock doesn't make progress. Every day you own a stock adds risk of unforeseen events causing a loss of capital. Own a stock for fewer days and you've already reduced your risk. If you can capture the bulk of gains in those fewer days, even better.Take  (  ), a stock that has been on IBD's  multiple times this year. When it was added July 11 at 25.07  , it quickly made a 5% gain. We took half profits the next trading day  and the stock inched up from there, riding its five-day moving average line.It was nearly at the 10% profit level when it sliced through the five- and 10-day moving averages intraday. In order to preserve profit, the remaining shares were removed  to keep the final result on the trade at 5%.While the stock did hit its 10% profit level a couple days later, it quickly retreated after that and formed a base over the next 34 trading days. Being out of the trade avoided a lot of potential pain without gain. We didn't sit on dead money. And while the correction was mild at just over 13%, the breach of the 50-day moving average in a weakening market could have easily shaken you out near the lows of the base.What's more, the money from selling Square on July 24 was available to put into  (  ) on July 25.

The $2.3 billion fund topped 64% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the 12 months going into Wednesday. It improved to 84% outperformance year-to-date and 91% in the past three months.Up 15.52% this year vs. 12.45% for its peer group and 9.47% for the big-cap bogey, manager Paul Gordon pins the improvement on the market rotating back toward the types of growth stocks favored by him and fellow managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel. \"Last year as people started to gain additional confidence in the economy, a lot more cyclical lower valuation companies started to rally,\" Gordon said. \"They had an extreme rally after the Trump election. But that's typically not an area we invest in. We look for long-term, not short-term, valuation opportunities. This year has been a reversal of that trend, back toward secular growth companies.\"Holdings that have notched nice gains this year include graphics chip maker  (  ), which is up 38% so far this year; chipmaker  (  ), which is up 23%; and design-automation-software maker  (  ), which is up 40%.Nvidia is a member of the  of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect second-quarter profit to rise a very good 90% to 93 cents a share.\"They have a nice market share within a niche market, Gordon said. \"They recently purchased an asset called (GetGo, whose products include GoToMeeting and related offerings) from  (CTXS). I think they have an opportunity to improve that business. For Citrix, it was not part of their core business, so it did not get (maximum) attention within a bigger company. Now it is very complementary to what LogMeIn knows and does.\"Software maker  (SSNC) is up 36% so far this year. Gordon said, \"They provide back-office software for financial companies. They're taking share from in-house and other third parties. This company sold-off last year at the height of (investors') fear about a decline in hedge-fund growth. But this stock has recovered.\" (FIVE) offers trendy, high-quality brands that sell for $5 or less in its 500-plus stores. It plans to open 100 more in 2017-2018.\"What we like about Five Below is that it is a bit of a combination of Dollar Store and off-price store, so it sells low-priced items that change seasonally and are attractive to customers because they (require) a bit of a treasure hunt. They're a fun place to shop for fairly cheap, consumable items. The total store opportunity for the company is fairly large. The returns on new stores are very high. So they are able to get great footage growth at high rates within their cash flow, and we think they should continue.\"Shares are up 30% this year. IBD readers would recognize that on Wednesday afternoon they were trading a shade below their 52.80 entry point.Gordon summarizes the fund's strategy as \"focusing on secular growth companies in which we have high confidence of long duration of above-average earnings growth.\"If the market is performing a Trump Dump - rotating away from lower valued cyclical stocks that could benefit from Trump policies - that should provide the fund with only a small additional tailwind. Gordon said, \"It might provide some opportunities, but only on the margin to find additional names to add to the portfolio.\"Over the past 10 years the fund's average annual return of 6.13% topped only 31% of its direct rivals.

Adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation) increased 14.3% from the year-ago quarter to 32 cents per share.

Management noted increased variability in quarter to quarter results due to growing portion of hardware and IP in the business mix. Moreover, weak U.S. dollar was also expected to hurt profitability as almost 30% of the company's costs are in foreign currencies. | Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.We note that Cadence has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry on a year-to-date basis. While the stock returned 40.1%, the industry gained 23.4%.The outperformance can be attributed to improving penetration of its newly launched products like Xcelium and Protium S1 as well as strong adoption of Palladium Z1 and Pegasus Verification solution. During the first quarter, the company won a number of customers including Xilinx, Mellanox and Texas Instruments  .We note that Cadence's digital, signoff and custom/analog tools are now enabled on Samsung Electronics' 7LPP and 8LPP process technologies. Moreover, the company has received certification for its 28nm FDS reference flow by Samsung. We believe that the recognition will aid Cadence to win new customers.Moreover, the company's expanding product portfolio boost its competitive position.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  . (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Many companies say they are working on cutting costs, and improving operations, but not all of them achieve their goals in a shorter time period than expected. This is the case with our Bull of the Day,  (NASDAQ:  -  ).This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is a regional, integrated solid waste services company that provides collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services, generates steam and manufactures finished products utilizing recyclable materials primarily throughout the eastern portion of the United States and parts of Canada. The Company also markets recyclable metals, aluminum, plastics, paper and corrugated cardboard all processed at its facilities and recyclables purchased from third parties.In the second quarter 2016, Casella Waste saw year over year improvements in Revenues (+0.6%), Operating Income (+37.5%), and was able to decrease Cost of operations by -3.6%.Casella Waste announces Q3 16 earnings on November 3 after the markets close. Leading up to the earnings announcement, on 9/26, management made two big announcements. First, management stated that they planned a debt refinancing, which looks to save about $11-$12 million in annual interest expenses. Second management increased FY 2016 EBITDA guidance from a range between $113-116 million to a range between $115-117 million. This is the second increase in EBITDA guidance in the last three months. Management also reaffirmed revenue guidance for Q3 16 in the range of $550-$560 million.According to John Casella, chairman and CEO, \"  .\" :Distribution channels are key to many companies and when those lines are severed or blocked for any reason it always negatively impacts the company's bottom line. This is the case for our Zacks Bear of the Day,  (NASDAQ:  -  ). While several of the channels have been reopened, and a few are in the process of meeting compliance issues, getting back to where they were before the issues arose will take a bit of time.This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company is a provider of prepaid and financial payments products for consumers and businesses. The company distributes gift cards, prepaid handsets and prepaid financial services products. Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. is headquartered in Pleasanton, California.Blackhawk reported Q3 16 earnings data on October 11th, and they saw year over year losses in the following areas; Net Income -42%, Diluted EPS -29%, Adjusted operating revenues -5%, Adjusted EBITDA -7%, Adjusted net income -20%, Adjusted diluted EPS -18%.According to Jerry Ulrich, CFO, \"  .\"With the Q3 earnings season underway, we can't help but remain a bit more optimistic than the last season. This is because per our  report (Oct 19), the 81 S&P 500 members that have reported their quarterly results have seen consolidated earnings improve 3.8% from the prior-year period on 3.6% rise in revenues. Moreover, of these stocks 80.2% have surpassed earnings expectations while 63% beat sales estimates.The next two weeks will see results pouring in from a large number of technology stocks. In sync with the trend so far, results from this dynamic sector are expected to be better than Q2. According to our model, this time consolidated earnings from the sector are expected to be down 0.4% year over year on 1% fall in sales. But if we exclude Apple (NASDAQ:  -  ), earnings for the rest of the sector are expected to surge a healthy 4.5%. This is because despite the possibility of a beat this season, Apple's results will still be muted compared to the prior-year quarter.But it's important to note that not all companies in the tech space have placed themselves well enough to gain.Let's have a look at three tech stocks that are set to release their quarterly numbers on Oct 24: .

The shares have been particularly buoyant in recent times, jumping 11.4% over the past one month. The closing share price also represents a decent one-year return of 6.4% and a year-to-date return of 17.2%.The price increase was supported by a significant rise in share volume. Average volume of shares traded over the last 10 days (799K) increased substantially from the 775k average volume of shares traded over the last three months.This price appreciation can be attributed to the recently announced buyout of Gold Standard Simulations Ltd.  . The acquisition is in line with Synopsys' continued investments toward enhancing its electronic design automation (EDA) software product portfolio. Synopsys sells EDA software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. In the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening their supplier relationships while focusing on cost efficiencies, which have led many to select Synopsys as their primary EDA partner.Also, the company has acquired Simpleware - a privately owned company that specializes in developing software products that help convert \"3D scan data into high-quality computer models used for engineering design and simulation\". The transaction will not only enhance Synopsys' product portfolio, but also expand its customer base, thereby boosting the top line.It is also worth noting that Synopsys' share price has been increasing continuously since the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 18. Also, second quarter revenues saw a year-over-year improvement, mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and strength in hardware products. Moreover, the company provided an encouraging third quarter guidance and raised its fiscal 2016 guidance.For fiscal 2016, the company now expects revenues in a range of $2.360-$2.400 billion (previously $2.350-$2.390 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.386 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $2.95 and $3.00 (previously $2.93 and $3.00).

The company projects cash from operations in the range of $510 million to $530 million (previously $500 million).For third-quarter fiscal 2016, the company expects revenues in the range of $595-$610 million (mid-point $602.5 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $603 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 72-75 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents.With respect to earnings surprise, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 18.8%.Moreover, the stock looks attractive from a valuation perspective. This is because Synopsys currently trades at a forward P/E of 30.67x as against the industry group average of 104.90x, which signifies a huge upward potential.We are positive that the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going forward. Moreover, the unique intellectual properties and global support provided by Synopsys will likely drive forthcoming results. The company has a good cash reserve that is necessary for funding further acquisitions. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  , a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Results from nearly 30% of the sector's total market cap on S&P 500 have been released with consolidated earnings dropping 5% year over year and sales coming 2.6% lower than the comparable period last year. However, thanks to the low market expectations, over 80% of the companies have surpassed their estimates on both the top and bottom lines.Nonetheless, it seems that this quarter might be a tad better than the last one.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDNS options chain for the new April 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $21.00 strike price has a current bid of 70 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $21.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $20.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDNS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $21.35/share today.Because the $21.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CDNS stock at the current price level of $21.35/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $22.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.62% if the stock gets called away at the April 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDNS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDNS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $22.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $22.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

For the PowerShares DWA Momentum Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PDP), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $44.00 per unit.With PDP trading at a recent price near $38.16 per unit, that means that analysts see 15.31% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PDP's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are A.O. Smith Corp (Symbol: AOS), American Financial Group Inc (Symbol: AFG), and Cadence Design Systems Inc (Symbol: CDNS). Although AOS has traded at a recent price of $68.85/share, the average analyst target is 18.45% higher at $81.56/share. Similarly, AFG has 16.92% upside from the recent share price of $67.14 if the average analyst target price of $78.50/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CDNS to reach a target price of $24.31/share, which is 16.05% above the recent price of $20.95. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of AOS, AFG, and CDNS:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n  \nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

This is because this security in the Computer-Software space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board.

The new company was expected to be owned jointly by EMC and VMWare with each having a 50% stake.However, this news added to investors' concerns as Virtustream was still not profitable. A 50% stake would have required VMware to invest a huge amount for the development of hybrid-cloud solutions of Virtustream, which would weigh on VMware's financials.All these concerns had together resulted in dwindling investor confidence in VMware, as can be seen from the fall in share prices. In the last three-month period, the company lost nearly 30% of its market cap in contrast to the S&P 500 index's gain of over 2%.This loss led management to take some measures to regain investors' confidence as declining valuation of VMware would mean lower per share sale price for EMC investors at the time of the deal.In fact, the speculations (of VMware retreating from forming a new Virtustream) started earlier this month when a Reuters report had stated that the company is re-evaluating the proposed ownership structure of Virtustream.Virtustream was an important factor in VMware's valuation as the company had expected an operating loss of $200 million to $300 million in 2016 if it had formed Virtustream. However, Virtustream was expected to contribute significantly to VMware's revenues in 2016 with projected growth in the double-digits.According to the deal, EMC's stake in VMware (about 81% of the company) will be owned by Dell post the closure of the acquisition. VMware however, per the release, will continue to remain a publicly-traded company even after the acquisition.An important thing to note here is that Dell will not be offering regular trading stocks for VMware. Instead, the company will be issuing a tracking stock that would reflect the performance of the trading stock. This will entitle EMC shareholders to have only economic interest in the trading stock but not own them (that is no voting rights or dividends). Most importantly, according to the deal, Dell will create tracking stock from 53% of the value of total VMware shares. Dell of course retains 80% of VMware shares and other shareholders the remaining 20%, which will be trading as usual. Dell will be paying EMC shareholders $24.05 per share in cash and approximately 0.111 shares of VMware tracking stock.Through the EMC acquisition, Dell would be able to get a significant control of VMware at a much discounted price. As a result, investors have become jittery regarding the valuation of the company.However, as per a Dec 11 update, Dell is considering buying back about $3 billion worth of VMware tracking stock.Despite backing out from the joint venture, the company's shares fell over 3% in Friday's trading session. Though VMware margins will now be less affected, revenues will likely come down for the company in 2016.We note that VMware had already given a soft outlook for revenue growth in 2016 owing to the weakness in bookings.It seems that such initiatives are not enough to regain investors' confidence amid the acquisition related uncertainty. We believe that management needs to explicitly lay out a growth strategy for VMware's core business, especially as headwinds from sluggish IT spending and stiff competition remain.Currently, VMware has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same space are Autodesk, Inc.  and Cadence Design Systems Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 8.82%. However, it is worth noting that Synopsys has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 53.22%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synopsys witnessed significant year-over-year improvement in fourth-quarter revenues primarily on the back of higher adoption of its products and several acquisitions. The bottom line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company provided tepid first-quarter and fiscal 2016 revenue guidance.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe that the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results in the first quarter. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive the results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp. coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 30 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Synopsys' Zacks Rank #1 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of stocks which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Boyd Gaming Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #2.NVIDIA Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +18.75% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Since then it has been trying to expand its capabilities in the security space through various buyouts such as, Seeker, Codenomicon, Goanna and Protecode.In the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening supplier relationships and focusing on cost efficiencies, which have led to higher adoption of Synopsys' products. Notably, the company's first-quarter fiscal 2016 revenues witnessed 4.9% year-over-year increase driven by higher adoption.We believe that the company's sustained focus on product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, its unique intellectual properties and global support will drive results. Additionally, the company's acquisitions will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  , a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

According to a Bloomberg report, VMware is planning to buy back a huge number of shares (possibly in multimillion dollars).VMware has been going downhill since the news of the EMC-Dell merger came out. In the last three-month period, the company lost over 25% of its market cap in contrast to the S&P 500 index's gain of over 6%.Investors have become jittery regarding the valuation of the company. Following the spin-off of EMC's stake in VMware (about 81% of the company), it will be owned by Dell. Additionally, according to the deal, Dell will create a tracking stock from 53% of the value of total VMware shares. Dell will retain 80% of VMware shares and other shareholders the remaining 20%, which will be trading as usual. Through the EMC acquisition, Dell would be able to get significant control over VMware at a much discounted price.The decline in share prices is a significant concern for management as this is lowering per share sale price for EMC investors from the earlier expected $33.15 to $30.61 (considering closing price of Dec 4).Therefore, the aforementioned buyback plan is likely an attempt to regain investor confidence. In addition, the company is also reconsidering the ownership structure for Virtustream, a leading hybrid-cloud product company that was acquired by EMC earlier this year for $1.2 billion.Earlier, EMC had announced its plans to spin out Virtustream following the acquisition. The new company was expected to be owned jointly by EMC and VMWare with each having a 50% stake. However, a Reuters report last week stated that the company is now re-evaluating this ownership structure and might even consider consolidating Virtustream's results within EMC, thereby foregoing the 50-50 partnership plan.We believe that VMware shares would likely benefit from the buyback and its dissociation from the loss-making Virtustream business.The EMC-Dell deal is deemed to be the largest technology acquisition ever with a value of nearly $67 billion.Currently, VMware has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same space are Autodesk, Inc.  and Cadence Design Systems Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Also, the company stated that it will likely lead to growth of 24% in annualized recurring revenues during the period.The company is primarily banking on cloud transition to fuel this growth, which is further supplemented by increasing demand for licenses, a large active customer base of 2.8 million (including non-subscribers as well) and scope for conversion of non-subscribers to subscribers. For this, the company will also be offering its subscription services packages for a smaller timeframe (at present it only offers perpetual licenses, which are expensive for short-term users).Moreover, in the last reported quarter, Autodesk finally achieved breakeven earnings and also raised its earnings guidance for fourth quarter 2015, despite an expected softness in billings. In the three-month period, the company has returned over 39% compared with the S&P 500's gain of only 6.2% in the same period. Morever, in the past 30 days, upward estimate revisions have pushed up the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 by over 133% to 14 cents a share.Nonetheless, ongoing investments in cloud-based infrastructure and discontinuation of perpetual license offerings in 2016 can prove to be dampener in the near term.Autodesk sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Microsoft's cloud offerings include Windows Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM.The bullish stance of equity research analysts at Raymond James and FBR on the stock is driving Microsoft.Raymond James' analyst Michael Turits upgraded the rating on Microsoft from \"Market Perform\" to \"Strong Buy\", and gave a price target of $62.00. He is optimistic about the company's successful transition from PC software to cloud computing. Turits sees the company as \"the only 'hyperscale' hybrid cloud vendors able to integrate Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with a vast installed base of on-premise server and client software\".FBR analyst Daniel Ives also rated Microsoft as \"Outperform\" on strong cloud prospects. He believes that though Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leader in the cloud space, Microsoft's Windows Azure has the potential to capitalize on the increasing demand for cloud-computing services in the enterprise sector.The price appreciation may be attributed to Microsoft's strong fundamentals, solid growth of its cloud service, strong Windows adoption and better-than-expected first-quarter 2016 results reported on Oct 22. Since then, the stock has gained 15.7%.In the quarter, Microsoft reported a profit of 67 cents, breezing past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents.

The new collaboration would also aid SAP in expanding its footprint in the Latin American market, with Buenos Aires taking the lead.The strategic tie-up involves seamless integration of the real-time situational awareness capabilities of SAP HANA, SAP's proprietary cloud platform, with Philips' CityTouch street lighting management system to create a comprehensive information network.The collaboration entails real-time integration of information from Philips' connected streetlights with data from other sensors. This data, related to street lighting, parking and traffic controls, will be broadly assimilated on a singular dashboard and critically examined by town planners for improved operational results.Philips is currently working on a project in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to power 91,000 streetlights with its CityTouch-managed LEDs for helping the city realize greater energy savings and better safety measures. The SAP HANA platform has been deployed in this project to help Buenos Aires better manage about 700,000 assets like streetlights, parks, bus stops, buildings and bridges. This will help city planners minimize damage by monitoring storm & heavy rainfall as well as reduce energy consumption by adjusting lighting intensity.SAP believes that as more & more cities increasingly embrace digital transformation, there is tremendous potential for real-time and predictive analytics applications, as they serve to improve services related to lighting, sustainability and efficiency. According to Philips, less that 1% of streetlights in only about 30 countries are connected with CityTouch, which represents lucrative opportunities for SAP, going forward.Meanwhile, the SAP's analytics platform enjoy huge popularity with about 4,000 regional, local and city organizations benefiting from it.

As per the new agreement, Micron will purchase Inotera's DRAM output at a premium to the market price.The acquisition deal is expected to close in the middle of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including shareholder and regulatory approvals.Micron, which holds a 33% stake in Inotera, had been trying to acquire the remaining shares for months. If this deal goes through, it will enable Micron to grasp all the financial and operational benefits of Inotera's business.Taiwan-based Inotera was formed in 2003 as a joint venture between Nanya Technology Corporation and Infineon. The company provides DRAM memory foundry services, especially on 300-mm silicon wafers.Taiwanese DRAM maker, Nanya is one of the leading providers of memory solutions. It is now one of the top four DRAM companies in the world, the other vendors being Samsung and SK Hynix.In Feb 2015, Micron revised its DRAM supply agreement with Inotera. As per the deal, it was agreed that Micron would purchase Inotera's DRAM output at a discount to the market price. In 2009, Micron bought out Infineon's share in Inotera.Now, Micron and Inotera together are announcing a patent licensing agreement with Nanya Technology Corporation for an undisclosed sum. Per the agreement, Nanya can use Micron's 1x and 1y DRAM technologies. The deal represents an addition to Micron's existing license agreement for 20 nanometer (nm) technology with Nanya.In fiscal 2014, Micron purchased approximately $2.68 billion of DRAM products from Inotera, which accounted for nearly 38% of its total DRAM gigabit production. With such a massive exposure to a single supplier, we believe that the recent deal will positively impact the memory chipmaker's profit margins, going forward.It seems that the semiconductor industry is going through a massive consolidation phase as merger & acquisition activities are on the rise. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), worldwide semiconductor sales are likely to witness a year-over-year growth of 3.4% in 2015 and 3.1% in 2016.As per the report, last year, the worldwide semiconductor industry recorded sales growth of 9.9% and reached $335.8 billion. The industry is experiencing growth primarily due to developing end markets and new product offerings, supported by process and yield improvements by semiconductor manufacturers.Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of the new category of wearable devices have led to stronger demand for the processing and sensing devices that run them. These factors are likely to drive the semiconductor industry this year.Hence we believe that the current acquisition deal should translate to stronger results at Micron. However, it may not be easy for Micron to capture share from SanDisk Corp  - a key player in the NAND space.Micron has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The news was first reported by TechCrunch and later confirmed by the company.Palo Alto-based MinHash was founded in 2014 by four persons including two engineers, Naren Chitter and Jayesh Govindarajan, who previously worked at Oracle Corp.  and eBay Inc.  , respectively. Chitter served at eBay's Search Engine Group for over five years and Govindarajan has been associated with Oracle and Avaya for nearly a decade.MinHash claims to have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) platform, named AILA, through which one can scan thousands of media posts and uncover the emerging trends, thereby helping marketers to respond quickly. Once this platform spots the latest trends, it automatically creates campaigns via integrated texts, images, hashtags and URLs.According to MinHash's website, its services will be shut down on Jan 21, 2016. All the four members will join Salesforce's search and data science teams and likely rebuild a version of the platform soon.Over the past few years, Salesforce has been aggressively trying to build its capabilities in the data analytics segment with the launch of Wave Analytics Platform last year and the Relatel IQ buyout.Further, in May, the company acquired a smart calendar app Tempo from a start-up named, Tempo AI Inc. The app acts as a virtual calendar, easily integrating with calendar, email, contacts and other apps on users' smartphones and offering relevant information and suggestions.Therefore, we believe that the recent MinHash acquisition is a step in this direction, benefiting both salespeople and marketers. The acquisition should therefore help Salesforce boost revenues.Investments in start-ups have always been one of Salesforce's key growth strategies. Over the past few years, the company has invested in several start-ups, be it through acquisitions or partnerships. According to a report by TechCrunch, since 2009, Salesforce Ventures, the company's investment arm, has invested about $500 million in more than 150 enterprise start-ups.Further, it should be noted that Salesforce Ventures announced this October its plan to invest $100 million specifically in European start-ups. With this the investment arm intends to fuel cloud innovation and gain customers in the region.We believe that Salesforce's sustained focus on expanding its business through strategic acquisitions and investments will drive growth over the long run.Salesforce currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

With a strong return of 49.7% over the past one year, positive estimate revisions over the last 30 days and better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2016 revenues, Paylocity is an attractive investment opportunity.Paylocity reported revenues of $45.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which not only increased 45% from the year-ago quarter but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $42 million. The year-over-over increase was driven by solid sales and operational implementation during the quarter. The rising demand for the company's unified payroll and HCM platform further aided sales growth.Moreover, revenues were impacted positively by a 45.4% increase in recurring revenues and a 38.2% increase in implementation and other revenues on a year-over-year basis.The company reported adjusted loss (excluding one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of 6 cents per share, which compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents and a loss of 10 cents reported in the year-ago-quarter.Over the past 30 days, all the estimates (2) for fiscal 2016 were revised upward, narrowing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16 cents to a loss of 24 cents. Paylocity also delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 60%.Buoyed by better-than-expected first-quarter results, the company guided a positive second quarter and raised its fiscal 2016 guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, Paylocity expects revenues in the range of $48 million to $49 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $49 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of 2 cents to 4 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 11 cents.For fiscal 2016, Paylocity expects revenues in the range of $210 million to $214 million (earlier projection was $199 million to $203 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $213 million. Non-GAAP net earnings per share are expected to be in the range of 4 cents to 7 cents as against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 24 cents.We remain positive about Paylocity's continuous investments in SaaS technology. It is to be noted that over the past few quarters a significant portion of its revenues has been generated from clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company's SaaS-based services. Therefore, we believe that regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovations, will continue to boost the company's top line over the long run. Initiatives such as these are also likely to have a positive impact going ahead.Furthermore, higher adoption of Paylocity's ACA dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind for the company in the long run.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing competitors such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  , Oracle Corporation  and SAP SE remains a headwind.Besides Paylocity, investors may look at Cadence Design Systems Inc.  , another Zacks Rank #1 stock in the technology sector.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Also, he gave a price target of $62.00.Turits is optimistic about the company's successful transition from PC software to cloud computing.Cloud computing is a flourishing domain in the technology space. It is a procedure by which data or software is stored outside a computer, but can be easily accessed from anywhere and at any time via the Internet. Cloud computing is gaining traction as it can cut IT costs significantly for companies by removing expensive servers and trimming maintenance staff.Microsoft's cloud offerings include Windows Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM. With players like Amazon  , which is strongly entrenched, and Alphabet's  Google quickly building its position, competition is particularly intense in the space.According to Turits, Microsoft looks like a \"long-term winner\" in cloud computing. He sees the company as \"the only 'hyperscale' hybrid cloud vendors able to integrate Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with a vast installed base of on-premise server and client software\".FBR analyst Daniel Ives also rated Microsoft as \"Outperform\" on strong cloud prospects. He believes that though Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leader in the cloud space, Microsoft's Windows Azure has the potential to capitalize on the increasing demand for cloud-computing services in the enterprise sector.Ives believes that Microsoft is firing on all cylinders to surpass competitors. The company's major focus in 2016 will be to increase market share against AWS. He predicts that the company will be much more aggressive in mergers and acquisitions pertaining to cloud computing in the next year.Last year, research firm IDC projected that public IT cloud services spending will surge at a five-year CAGR of 22.8% to over $127 billion in 2018. The growth rate is six times that of the broader IT market. In 2018, public IT cloud services will constitute more than 50% of the global software and storage development budgets.Microsoft is leaving no stone unturned and moving ahead with CEO Satya Nadella's cloud-first mobile-first strategy. The cloud computing business is its fastest growing segment and management had projected earlier that $20 billion will be garnered in commercial cloud revenues by 2018.Currently, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

When you get this seesaw action back and forth, it can feel like it's impossible to make money. Indexes move in a positive direction for a few days then reverse and come back down. The trading range becomes tighter and tighter, while the market resists any breakout to the upside or breakdown below. This is the type of market that drives the guys who buy the whole market crazy.Well I'm not one of those guys. I'm the guy that's out here finding great stocks to buy while the index moves back and forth. I'm armed with a special kind of ammunition. The sort of heavy artillery the Zacks Rank gives me.If you want to get out there and find great stocks in any market, you've got to look for the stocks that are in strong industries that have strong histories of good earnings and bullish analysts upping their estimates. While the rest of the crowd is just going along with the herd, I actively seek out the strongest stocks in any market.Here I'm looking for Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks that have a Momentum Style Score of \"B\" or better. That way I get exposure to stocks that have had recent earnings surprises, an uptick in volume, and have strength relative to the market. When the market is heading sideways and there are stocks that are breaking down, then there are obviously strong stocks that are breaking out as well. Using this screen I can find those breakout winners.Cadence Design Systems, Inc. develops, sells, leases, and licenses electronic design automation (EDA) software, emulation and prototyping hardware, verification intellectual property (VIP), and design intellectual property (design IP) for semiconductor and electronics systems industries worldwide.The push higher since the last earnings report has evolved into an aggressive breakout. Volumes have increased recently and shares seem to have leapfrogged resistance at $22. An overbought commodity channel index (CCI) has cooled off a bit recently, coming down from nearly 300 to 88.21. Below $22 the next level of support is $21.50.EarthLink Holdings Corp., together with its subsidiaries, provides managed network, security, and cloud services to business and residential customers in the United States. The company operates in two segments, Business Services and Consumer Services. The Business services segment provides data services, including multiprotocol label switching services, Wi-Fi, and high-speed Internet access; voice services, such as local and long-distance services over traditional copper lines, hosted voice, SIP trunking, and integrated voice and data solutions; managed services comprising managed network, security, infrastructure, and cloud services; and professional services to evaluate the performance and security of network.ELNK shares were in a trading range from $7.50 to $9.50 for the last three months of trading. So the push now towards $9.50 makes me cautiously optimistic. Of course I'm rooting for the breakout here as volumes have increased and the CCI has pushed above 100. You can roll the dice a little on this stock, in hopes of the breakout here but if things reverse and ELNK comes down, I wouldn't want to ride it all the way back down to support at $7.50. A tight stop on the breakout trade is the way to play this. If shares come back to the bottom end of the consolidation range then you can try to enter at that more favorable price down the road.Extreme Networks, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, provides wired and wireless network infrastructure equipment, software, and services for enterprises, data centers, and service providers. The company offers Black Diamond products, which deliver modular or chassis-based Ethernet connectivity solutions that have a range of management and line cards allowing customers to configure and re-purpose the systems; and Summit product family of stackable Ethernet switching systems, which provide a range of connection speeds, various physical presentations, and options to deliver PoE or unpowered standard Ethernet ports.This is a stock trading all the way down at $3.87 that appears to be making a run to the low $4s right now. There is a big band of volume that was traded at that price which will act both as a magnet and resistance for this stock. A retest of that level from here would provide for a great short term trading idea. A chance for a breakout above that level make this even more enticing. Support sits below the current price and appears to be centered around $3.50.ShoreTel, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, provides business communication solutions in the United States and internationally. The company offers integrated voice, video, data, and mobile applications based on Internet protocol technologies. It offers solutions, such as ShoreTel Voice Switches; ShoreTel Service Appliances; ShoreTel Director, which enables IT administrators to view and manage the entire system from any location using a single application; ShoreTel IP Phones; and Small Business Edition 100 for smaller businesses.This is the most bullish of all the charts here. The stock has gone exponential, rocketing off the lows near $7. A great earnings report has added more fuel to the fire here. Volumes have ticked up significantly as this stock is obviously making its way onto the institutional money radar. The intraday spike down to $8.80 on Monday is the first strong level of support to the downside.Western Alliance Bancorporation operates as the bank holding company for Western Alliance Bank that provides various banking products and related services primarily in Arizona, California, and Nevada. It accepts various deposit products, including checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts, as well as fixed-rate and fixed maturity retail certificates of deposit.This stock has a tendency to trend for several months at a time, then go sideways in a consolidation. Pretty typical of a bank stock though. Right now, shares appear to be in the midst of a bullish trend as shares probe higher in search of a new fair value. The CCI has been bouncing between 200 and 75 for the last month of trading. As long as there are no negative news events I expect the slow accumulation to continue.This is a stock pickers market, so don't go out there and buy up the whole index.

That's the big Boston fund family's top-performing U.S. diversified stock fund this year through Sept. 30, according to Morningstar Inc.Up 3.46% this year, the no-load mutual fund tops 98% of its peer-group of small-cap  tracked by Morningstar industrywide.The fund's 12-month gain was 13.43%, which beat 98% of its direct rivals.You can also invest in its load clone, Advisor Small Cap Growth , which is sold through advisors. Having earned 3.40% this year for  , it is Fidelity's second-best.The no-load  has a 0.99% annual expense ratio vs. 1.22% for its advisor-sold twin.That puts Venanzi at the helm of one of the industry's most  .From his Boston office, 36-year-old Venanzi talked with IBD about how he runs his portfolio, his two types of stock buckets, and how his approach differs from his predecessor's. What's your strategy, and how does it differ from rivals'? A lot of Fidelity's value managers sit near me. I'm looking for different things and for companies that are at a different point in their life cycles.A lot of companies I own aren't making money today. But looking out two, three, five, 10 years, they will be making money and hopefully a lot of it.That differentiates this fund from our other small-cap funds. Some have more of a value bent. Other growth funds, some ownGoogle (  ) (recently renamed Alphabet) andFacebook (  ) and companies like that, which are just too big for this fund.I focus on companies with between $100 million in market cap, up to about $6 billion -- that end is always sort of a moving target. The median market cap today is about $2.5 billion, so that's sort of the sweet spot -- between $1 billion and $3 billion. Tell me how your two types of growth stocks differ from each other. Yes, the fund is a blend of stable growers that are profitable and emerging companies. The stable growers are about 60% to 65% of the fund.A lot of the emerging growers lose money. Many value managers would struggle to justify buying a company that is losing money this year, last year and maybe next year. But I am trying to look five years out and think about whether a company will be profitable, maybe wildly profitable.Can we buy it today before other folks who look at just this year and next year get interested? Do some holdings fall into both of your buckets? Some do. My top position, 2U (  ), isn't making money. But it has a track record of steady 20% to 30% (quarterly) revenue growth. Is it a steady or emerging stock? It's both for me. Why were you comparing your portfolio to value funds? This is definitely not a value fund. It's definitely growth.But especially in this universe, you win in small-cap growth by thinking about valuation more than my competitors do.Most growth funds are a sort of momentum strategy, and valuation is an afterthought. For me, I don't buy stocks that I think are overvalued just because they will have a good three- to four-quarter run.Growing up (as a manager) at Fidelity, for 15 years being around managers like  (Low-Priced Stock Fund , Chuck Myers (Small Cap Discovery and Small Cap Value and Jamie Harmon (Advisor Small Cap , our small-cap team has a legacy of value and sort of GARP-y fund managers. Valuation is important no matter what universe you're in.So this is a growth fund, but valuation is a key part of my process. What's the hardest part about being a small-cap growth manager? The temptation in small-cap growth is to focus on emerging growth and have too much exposure to them. If that's all you own, history works against you. So I try to be super-selective. Only two or three out of 10 emerging-growth stocks work. But if you buy those that are growing, six out of 10 outperform over a longer time.So this fund is a mix of stable and emerging growers, and we are highly selective on emerging growers. How have you changed this fund since taking the helm in November 2011? My predecessor, Lionel Harris, was a good steward. He manages Small Cap Stock Fund . Lionel skewed this fund toward steady growers. That bucket is Lionel's bread and butter. He's less willing to dive into emerging growers than I am. How important is water heater makerA.O. Smith's (  ) global exposure? Seventy-five percent of their business is in the U.S. The rest is overseas, including China. These guys have a strong brand name, which they're able to leverage overseas, especially in China and India.People worry about China (growth slowing). But I'm told by folks who spend more time there than I do that water heaters are something that people there show off. Apartments and houses are smaller than in the U.S., and people have their water heater on display in the living room. They show off their A.O. Smith water heater. The brand seems to resonate.Back at home we've owned it in the past because of the residential and nonresidential construction recovery. Finding companies with a strong competitive position is paramount to my process. And these guys have a strong competitive position. What made you add to your stake inCadence Design (  ) as of your latest disclosure -- which is the time frame for all of my questions? I covered semiconductors as an analyst. It's tough to maintain a competitive position in semiconductors because product cycles are short and prices go down 10% to 20% each year. You're on a treadmill.But Cadence sells software to semiconductor companies to help them design chips. That business does not have the same price-decline curve as their customers do.Cadence,Mentor Graphics (MENT),Synopsys (SNPS) -- their market has consolidated over the past 10 to 15 years. There used to be 15 companies. Now there's just three (main ones), so all have stronger competitive positions. Their pricing is more stable.And Cadence has a new product cycle coming up. It has a big refresh every three or four years, and it's been three or four years since they had a new tool, so I wouldn't be surprised to see one in the next year or so. Why have you slightly trimmed your stake inGlobal Payments (GPN) in recent quarters? I'm always managing position size. Any time a stock outperforms by as much as Global Payments has, you ask yourself if this is still the right position size. And from time to time I take chips off the table, and I add when the company comes back.Global resells or leases equipment made by companies likeVerifone (PAY). This business has recurring revenues, good returns, and underlying market growth as the world continues to move from cash to plastic payment. Global's main differentiators are their global footprint and a one-stop shop that makes it easy for merchants to accept any form of card payment and to easily keep up with industry changes like the chip-and-PIN. They also have software tailored to niche markets like gaming and dentists.Global uses a lot of middlemen to sell. Those middlemen put pressure on. Global had to cut price to gain share. The last couple of years, a new CEO led their charge to decommoditize their business. They did a couple of acquisitions to give them more differentiation, allow them to sell more software around their core product.That's started to reverse a margin decline. Stamps.com's (STMP) earnings per share growth has accelerated. Why have you trimmed? Stamps was still a significant position as of our last report. But all of those comments about managing position size when stocks have a big run apply.Stamps sells software that helps small businesses or people working out of their homes get their boxes out the door (heading to customers).They were one of only three businesses that had licenses that let them put labels on packages for shipping through the U.S. Postal Service.They have a great record of capital management. They invest at the right time. They step back when marketing channels get expensive, when key words (like \"shipping software\" that they pay online search engines for) get too expensive. So at times their revenue growth decelerates. But when their stock pulls back, they buy their stock.Over the past year, they used their cash to make acquisitions, ShipStation and ShipWorks. They're similar to Stamps.com, but they use multiple channels. So Stamps now is more diversified. It has a stronger offering. Did you trimG-III Apparel (GIII) because it has done well? This is another where the stock's done well and we took chips off the table as of our last holding period.They started as licensing, doing outerwear, making raincoats forRalph Lauren (RL). That's a notoriously difficult category.But now \"G3\" owns more brand names, which gives them more control.It's tough to figure a company's terminal value (in the future) if all they have is a business that can go away when their current contract expires. But if they own their own brand, that won't go away. How isDominos Pizza (DPZ) making its earnings per share growth accelerate? The issue for a lot of consumer companies is what does \"online\" mean. Retailers have (challenges). But pizza is one thing you can't get online. But you can order pizza online, which helps Dominos. ICU Medical's (ICUI) earnings per share grew 89% and 90% the past two quarters, but you've trimmed. Is this another position management move? You're probably sensing a theme. This was trading around 60 a year and a half ago. Now it's (above 110). Any time a stock has that kind of move you must revisit it and ask if the position size is right.They make inexpensive plastic tubing and valves used in hospitals. They got too dependent on one customer, Hospira, which went through some regulatory challenges.ICU got a new CEO a year or two ago, who figured out ways to regenerate growth, and Hospira has fixed their regulatory issues. Why have you cut back your position inService Corp. (SCI)? Position management.But this company fits the theme of strong competitive position. They're in an industry, death care, that will stick around. The company is very cash generative. They've done a good job putting cash to work through acquisitions and buybacks. And in the past few years, they've pushed to sell services pre-need, trying to hit baby boomers to take care of their burial needs before they die so their kids don't have to deal with it. They fit my steady grower bucket. Do you have a case of puppy love forVCA (WOOF)? They run animal hospitals and a lab. They have a strong competitive position.I think the thing there is that they went through a period when growth stalled, especially (during the recession from) 2008 through 2010. People spend less on pets when they don't have a job or they're worried about losing their job.But as unemployment went down, people resumed spending on their pets. And VCA management are good capital managers. Which of your baskets isAthenahealth (ATHN) in? Over the past five years they've graduated from emerging growth to steady growth.They're not afraid to try new things. That's led to a lot of innovation that's served shareholders well.They do revenue-cycle management for doctors, doctors' practices. They help doctors collect money they're owed, and do it faster with lower loss rates. And each time (they collect), they take a little cut. It's rare for doctors to switch away, so they're building a sustainable business. It's a good business model when revenues are growing. IsPacific Premier Bancorp (PPBI) a play on the prospect for an interest rate hike? You're on target, but that's not my leading line. If rates go up, Pacific should benefit. In addition, Pacific is small, based in California, growing 15% to 25%, generating above-average returns on equity. The CEO is a take-no-prisoners guy who doesn't like losing money, so their credit is pristine. Their valuation is trading at a historically low multiple.So when you can buy above-average growth for a below-average multiple, that is nirvana.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is a software company that could be an interesting play for investors.

This clean energy power plant operator eventually closed at $7.27, representing a year-to-date decline of 76.5% and a negative one year return of 78.1%. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months was more than 3,535K.TerraForm Power's recent share price drop can be attributed to the recent rating downgrade of its parent company SunEdison Inc.  from Neutral to Sell by Julien Dumoulin-Smith, an analyst at UBS Research. Management changes at TerraForm Power, one of SunEdison's yieldcos, were cited as the reason behind the downgrade.UBS Research stated that the downgrade was mainly due to the shocking turn of events earlier this week. According to the news, Brian Wuebbles, SunEdison's executive vice president and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), will now serve as a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of its yieldco TerraForm Power.Until a permanent CFO is selected, Wuebbles will perform the role of the CFO and CEO in both the companies.Although the change is part of management's strategy to improve its overall operating structure and drive efficiency, the analyst remains skeptical about this decision as he believes that a mere management change cannot alleviate the parent company's ongoing liquidity concerns and debt burden.TerraForm Power's not-so-encouraging third-quarter 2015 earnings also impacted the share price. The company reported a loss of 3 cents per share for the third quarter of 2015, which compared unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 28 cents.Also, the company's balance sheet with total debt (including current portion) of nearly $2.55 billion at the end of third quarter 2015, up from $2.23 billion at the end of second-quarter 2015, remains a concern for investors. The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of only $635.8 million as against $390.6 million in the previous quarter. During the first three quarters of 2015, the company generated only $105.3 million of cash for operational activities.Additionally, estimate revisions have not been favorable. Over the past 30 days, the company witnessed three negative estimate revisions for fiscal 2015. The Zacks Consensus Estimate consequently moved down from earnings of 22 cents to a loss of 53 cents for fiscal 2015.The current situation could remain a headwind for this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company. Thus, we would advise investors to stay away from this stock for now.Better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Facebook, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), respectively.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company also delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.7% in the last reported quarter.The price appreciation can be attributed to Synopsys' efforts to provide customers with increased hardware efficiency, enabling significant reductions in both CPU memory consumption and manufacturing turnaround time.Synopsys' time-based license revenue model also showed solid momentum during third-quarter fiscal 2015, contributing more than 80% to total revenue. The growth can be attributed to an increase in TSL license revenues due to contributions from the acquired companies. Under this system, customers effectively rent the software, rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee. Hence this is a much more predictable revenue model, providing better visibility through a steady and recurring revenue stream. Also, the company has come up with new software offerings, especially targeted toward companies like Toshiba and Juniper, facilitating their production process.Synopsys has also made a few important acquisitions to build its product portfolio and stimulate growth. Acquisitions are central to the company's growth strategy and are helping it to gain access to newer markets and technologies. Also, since intense competition is making the EDA market tougher to penetrate, acquisitions have helped the company to boost revenues. In July this year, Synopsys acquired Bluetooth Smart IP from Silicon Vision - a leading provider of high-performance, ultra-low-power wireless IP solutions. Acquisitions are likely to enable Synopsys to enter markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio and maintain its leading position. Moreover, the company's continued acquisitions are expected to make a good contribution to its revenue stream.Apart from this, Synopsys also collaborated with ARM Holdings plc. which is expected to optimize the performance of its processors. Collaborations with this intellectual property (IP) suite provider have helped the company strengthen its product portfolio and improve the design quality of its custom integrated circuits.Furthermore, Synopsys returns cash to investors through share repurchases. In Dec 2014, the company announced an accelerated share repurchase agreement (2015 ASR) worth $180 million of its common stock under a share repurchase program, which it completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Share buybacks are a good way to return cash to investors when growth opportunities are limited. These also have a positive effect on earnings per share.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  along with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keeps us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDNS options chain for the new May 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $21.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $21.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $19.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDNS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $21.19/share today.Because the $21.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.38% return on the cash commitment, or 11.32% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $21.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $22.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.35. If an investor was to purchase shares of CDNS stock at the current price level of $21.19/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $22.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.19% if the stock gets called away at the May 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDNS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDNS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $22.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $22.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.37% boost of extra return to the investor, or 9.77% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 26%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 27%.

Ltd. The value of the deal stands at a minimum of $626 million. However, the company said the final price of the deal will be determined by an independent third party.In 2010, NQ Mobile had taken over 33% shares of FL Mobile. Later in 2012, the company assumed full control of FL Mobile. FL Mobile operates as an online game publishing unit of NQ Mobile. In the recent quarters, FL Mobile has in fact, driven the company's revenues higher.In a second development, the company has announced its decision to sell Beijing NationSky Network Technology Co. to Hou Shuli - the founder and Chief Executive of NationSky. The value of the deal is pegged at $80 million. Both the deals will provide the company the required cash and credibility.So, is the rough patch for NQ Mobile now over? Ever since Muddy Water Research, an independent research group, published a report on NQ Mobile on Oct 24, 2013, the company's shares have declined more than 80%. Muddy Waters had blamed NQ Mobile of being a \"massive fraud\" revealing that at least 72% of the company's 2012 China security revenues fictitiously come from a shell company called Yidatong, which is actually owned by NQ Mobile itself.Moreover, NQ Mobile's Antivirus 7.0 was termed a spyware by the  firm. Additionally, Muddy Waters had accused the company of flaunting an inflated cash balance just to gain the confidence of investors. Following this report, NQ Mobile had almost faced a share trading blackout and had even threatened to sue Muddy Waters.The company's positive run on the stock market yesterday can also be attributed to its second quarter 2015 results. NQ Mobile reported a 25% increase reported in revenues of $102.1 million in the quarter. The company posted net loss of $1.6 million or a loss of 2 cents per ADS in comparison to net loss of $16.8 million or a loss of 22 cents per ADS in the year-ago quarter.For 2015, the company expects net revenue to increase in the range of 36.9% to 38.4%. For the third quarter of 2015, the company estimates net revenue between $110.0 million and $112.0 million, indicating a 35.5% to 37.9% increase from the third quarter of 2014.Well-placed stocks in the same sector include Aspen Technology, Inc.  , Citrix Systems, Inc.  and Cadence Design Systems Inc.  .

This led to a flurry of positive earnings estimate revisions, which sent the stock to a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).AGCO, which makes agricultural equipment like tractors and combines, is facing significant challenges from falling commodity prices and lower farm incomes, in addition to a strong dollar. But the company has managed well in a difficult operating environment, cutting costs and \"controlling what it can.\"AGCO delivered a solid 'beat and raise' on Tuesday, July 28. Earnings per share for the second quarter came in at $1.25, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02.Net sales fell 25% year-over-year to $2.069 billion versus the consensus of $2.077 billion. Sales were down 25% year-over-year. However, unfavorable currency translation accounted for 14 percentage points of the decline. Excluding forex, net sales declined 11%.Sales were down at a double-digit clip in every geographical region, including its largest market - Europe/Africa/Middle East - which saw sales drop 25% (17 percentage points of which was due to forex). Sales of both tractors and combines were lower year-over-year.Nonetheless, solid cost management and lower material costs drove better-than-expected margins in the quarter.Despite the difficult operating environment, management actually increased its full year EPS guidance. The company now expects 2015 EPS of \"approximately\" $3.10, up from \"approximately\" $3.00. Net sales guidance remained the same at $7.7-$7.9 billion. :Earnings estimates have fallen sharply for  (  ) following disappointing second quarter results. Analysts have unanimously lowered their earnings estimates for both this year and next year, which has sent the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The stock has sold off sharply since the report, but it certainly does not look like a value at 39x forward earnings.TripAdvisor is an online travel company, which enables users to plan and book trips. Most of its revenue comes from click-based advertising.TripAdvisor reported disappointing second quarter results on July 23. Adjusted earnings per share (but  stock-based compensation expense) came in at $0.45, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. It was down 6% year-over-year.Total revenue rose 25% to $405 million, but this was also short of consensus at $412 million. The strong dollar was a headwind in the quarter as 50% of total revenue came from outside of the United States.TripAvisor reached 375 million average monthly unique visitors, an increase of 30% year-over-year. Click-based advertising revenue rose 13%. North America revenue, which accounted for a little more than half of total revenue, increased 31%.However, costs soared too. Selling & Marketing expense jumped 51% year-over-year to $192 million, or 47% of total revenue. And General & Administrative expense soared 38% to $44 million.These factors led to a decline in adjusted EBITDA, even when excluding stock-based compensation expense.

Mehdi stated that Windows 10 is being released in phases to ensure a smooth downloading experience.Last week, Microsoft officially released the Windows 10 across 190 countries in 111 languages.

However, due to the increase in smartphones and tablets, only 14% of the devices worldwide use the Windows OS. A large section of consumers prefer Apple's iOS and Google's Android.With Windows 10, Microsoft expects to encourage customers to own computers, tablets and smartphones powered with the Windows OS. The company's goal is to repair the damage done by Windows 8 while convincing consumers that the upgrade is worth their time and effort.Though Windows 10 has got a great initial adoption, the company's goal of getting Windows 10 into a billion devices within three years is still a far cry.

To strengthen its presence in the software security market, the company recently acquired Codenomicon Oy - a Finland-based global software security solution provider.Moreover, in late May this year, Synopsys signed a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Quotium Technologies including the Quotium Seeker product and its R&D team. We believe all the aforementioned acquisitions will enhance Synopsys' presence in the software security market while expanding the product portfolio and quality of its wholly owned subsidiary, Coverity.Synopsys sells electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. In the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening their supplier relationships and focusing on cost efficiencies, and many have selected Synopsys as their primary EDA partner.Acquisitions are central to the company's growth strategy and help it gain to access to newer markets and technologies. Some of its notable buyouts include Codenomicon, Coverity and Target Compiler Technologies.Also, since intensifying competition is making the EDA market tougher to penetrate, acquisitions have helped Synopsys to boost revenues. The company recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2015 results wherein revenues witnessed a year-over-year increase of 7.6%.We believe that the company's sustained focus on product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its results. Additionally, the company's acquisitions will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The launch also includes updates to all of its Creative Cloud desktop apps, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Lightroom, InDesign, After Effects, Premiere Pro and many more.The new mobile apps, Preview CC and Hue CC, further expand the company's mobile offerings, and reflect the company's strategy of powering numerous apps with discrete functions, instead of having a single all-inclusive Photoshop Touch-style app.Along with the updates, the company also launched Adobe Stock, a brand new stock photo service, which capitalizes on the company's recent acquisition of the Fotolia stock agency, which closed less than six months ago. Adobe Stock is a stock imagery service that is deeply integrated with Creative Cloud tools like InDesign, Photoshop and Premiere Pro.Adobe Stock gives users ready access to 40 million photos, vector graphics and illustrations directly from their CC desktop apps. For the time being, Adobe Stock only features images, but the company is seeking to spread out this service to video and other formats before long.Adobe also introduced major updates to the infrastructure and administrative capabilities of its Creative Cloud, christening it CreativeSync. CreativeSync intensifies the connection of workflows between desktop and mobile apps.The updates include a broad range of video and special effects updates for Premiere Pro and After Effects. Also, both Lightroom CC and Photoshop CC now have a Dehaze feature, which removes fog and haze from photos for incredibly clear images.Adobe Creative Cloud 2015 builds on an already strong base of OS X and iOS apps, and largely features performance-boosting enhancements with improved cross-platform syncing.Adobe's Creative Cloud is a set of services that includes tools like Photoshop, Indesign and Illustrator.

Adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items but include stock-based compensation expense.Following the earnings release, share price declined 1.4% in after-hours trading due to weaker-than-expected guidance for the upcoming quarter as well as full-year 2015.Adobe's revenues of $1.16 billion increased 4.8% sequentially and 8.8% year over year. Reported revenues were toward the higher end of management's guided range of $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion but in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 billion.Subscription comprised 66.6% of Adobe's total second-quarter revenue, up a significant 62.4% year over year. Products declined 42.7% year over year and contributed 23.6% to revenues, while Services & Support, up 1.2%, brought in the balance.Digital Media Solutions, Adobe's largest segment, generated 64% of total revenue. Revenues from this segment increased 6.4% sequentially to $748.0 million.The two major revenue earners within the segment were the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. In the Creative business, Creative Cloud subscriptions continued to accelerate. At the end of the quarter, the company had approximately 4.61 million Creative Cloud subscriptions, a sequential increase of 639K.The increased subscription, Enterprise Term License Agreements or ETLA adoption and digital publishing suite adoption drove Creative annualized recurring revenues or ARR to $2.02 billion, up $230 million. ARR in Document Cloud business increased to $329 million, up 10.8% sequentially.Management is quite optimistic about Creative Cloud adoption and expects to build a healthy pipeline for potential Creative Cloud paid subscribers through marketing programs, trial downloads and free memberships. The company's Photoshop Lightroom offering - rebranded as the Creative Cloud Photography Program - brings in new customers while converting those who originally licensed Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Lightroom.The Digital Marketing segment accounted for 32% of total revenue. Within the segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud revenues were up 5.1% sequentially to $327.0 million. The improvement was driven by increase in the size of transactions, number of solutions per customer, international expansion and growth in partner-driven business. Moreover, multi-solution adoption is growing the size of customer engagements. Bookings in this segment also increased from the year-ago period.LiveCycle and Connect businesses generated revenues of $40.0 million, down 13% sequentially.Print and Publishing revenues accounted for the remaining $48.0 million, down 2% sequentially.Gross margin was 84.1%, down 90 basis points (bps) sequentially and 143 bps from the year-ago quarter. The gross margin is typical of a software company and variations are generally related to the mix of revenues between categories.Adobe incurred adjusted operating expenses of $743.3 million, up 1.3% sequentially but down 0.3% from the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, research & development, general & administrative as well as sales & marketing expenses decreased from the year-ago quarter. As a result, adjusted operating margin increased to 20.1% from 15.7% a year ago.On a GAAP basis, Adobe recorded net income of $147.5 million (29 cents per share) compared with $88.5 million (17 cents) in the year-ago quarter.On a pro-forma basis, Adobe generated net income of $177.0 million compared with $111.5 million in the year-ago quarter.

Deferred revenues were $1.18 billion, flat sequentially.In the second quarter, cash generated from operations was $471.0 million and capital expenditure was $35.7 million. Additionally, the company repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for $200.0 million.For the third quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $1.175-$1.225 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to be $1.243 billion, higher than the guided range. Additionally, management expects total Digital Media revenue to increase sequentially. Adobe Marketing Cloud revenues are expected to increase 21% year over year.Accordingly, based on a share count of 506-508 million, GAAP earnings per share are expected in the range of 23-29 cents, while non-GAAP earnings are expected within 45-51 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 40 cents, well below the guided range. Also, for the third quarter, non-operating expense is expected within the $14-$16 million range and tax rate is likely to be 25% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis.For full-year 2015, management expects annual revenues of $4.845 billion, due to the estimated $80 million foreign currency impact in the second half of 2015. Also, management expects Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth of approximately 24% year over year in the latter half of the year.Adobe reported decent second-quarter results with earnings exceeding our expectations but the top line matching the same.We remain positive about Adobe's market position, its compelling product lines (including CS cloud initiative and digital media products), continued innovation and strong balance sheet.In addition, we believe that the consistent adoption of the Adobe marketing cloud could serve as a potential catalyst, going forward. Due to Adobe's acquisition of Fotolia, we expect noteworthy synergies over the long term. Moreover, the solid adoption of Document Cloud, a new subscription package to enable users to sign documents on the cloud, will boost Adobe's revenues.Moreover, in the quarter, the company acquired 3D modeling company, Mixamo, to expand its 3D animation service.

This will enable customers to create, customize, manipulate and animate new 3D content which can be used in either pictures or animation. The designers can also use thousands of pre-built 3D characters which can easily be incorporated into projects.Also, Mixamo's technology will add more environment options, such as realistic lighting, shadows and reflections, helping designers to produce greater output options in both still and motion.The Mixamo acquisition syncs well with Adobe's strategy to move from 2D to 3D technology.

Average volume of shares traded over the last three months was roughly 2,284K.One of the largest software companies in the world, Adobe Systems Incorporated's massive customer base provides it with a distinct competitive edge.

Additionally, the company launched the Adobe Stock, a stock photo service, capitalizing on the recently acquired Fotolia stock agency. We believe that attractive pricing as well as frequent product, feature and service enhancements continue to drive Adobe's Creative Cloud business.Moreover, the company gained momentum from its strong fundamentals and better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter 2015 results reported on Jun 16. Since then, the stock has moved up 2.9%.Adobe Systems' top line increased 4.8% sequentially and 8.8% year over year to $1.16 billion.

Non-GAAP earnings of 34 cents per share increased 59% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Solid growth in the company's cloud business primarily led to the year-over-year earnings growth.The price appreciation can also be attributed to the company's recent purchase of 3D modeling company, Mixamo. Mixamo offers a 3D platform allowing designers to create and customize high quality 3D characters and animations which can be incorporated into games in a simple and intuitive way.The buyout will enable Adobe to expand its 3D animation service, allowing customers to create and animate new 3D content.

The company's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) of 56 cents, on a proportionate tax basis, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents.However, non-GAAP earnings remained flat with the year-ago quarter as the benefit from higher revenues and lower operating expenses were fully offset by increased cost of sales and taxes. On a GAAP basis, earnings came in at 35 cents per share compared with 41 cents in the year-ago period.Total revenue increased 7.6% year over year to $557.2 million and came ahead of the company's guidance range of $543-$553 million as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $547 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys' products.The company witnessed revenue growth across all its business segments. License revenues (including time-based and upfront) were $492.2 million, up nearly 7% from the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues increased 13.7% year over year to $65.1 million.More than 90% of the second-quarter revenues came from backlog. A single customer accounted for more than 10% of the revenues.Adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) was $457.8 million, up approximately 6.7% from the year-ago period. However, as a percentage of revenues, it contracted 70 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 82.2%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) increased 4.6% on a year-over-year basis to $346.4 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, the same decreased 180 bps from the year-ago quarter to 62.2% mainly due to delayed hiring.Synopsys' adjusted operating income jumped 13.5% on a year-over-year basis to $111.4 million, primarily due to operational efficiency coupled with higher revenue base. Consequently, operating margin improved 100 bps to 20%.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) on a proportionate tax basis was $88.7 million or 56 cents per share compared with $88.1 million or 56 cents a year ago. The year-over-year flat bottom line was mainly due to increased cost of sales and taxes which fully offsets the benefit of higher revenue base and improved operational efficiency.The company reported GAAP net income of $55.6 million or 35 cents per share compared with $63.3 million or 40 cents per share in second-quarter fiscal 2014.Synopsys exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.005 billion compared with $917.1 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $338.4 million compared with $283 million in the last quarter. Long-term debt was $30 million. During the first two quarters of fiscal 2015, the company generated a cash flow of $67.7 million from operational activities and repurchased stocks worth $144 million.Buoyed by the strong second-quarter performance, Synopsys raised the fiscal 2015 guidance. The company now expects revenues in the range of $2.210-$2.235 billion, up from $2.15-$2.235 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $2.76 and $2.81 up from $2.75-$2.80. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $2.222 billion and $1.46 per share, respectively. The company maintained its cash from operations guidance of approximately $450 million.For third-quarter fiscal 2015, the company expects revenues in the range of $550-$560 million. The company expects non-GAAP expenses within $430-$440 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 58-60 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents.Synopsys second-quarter top line witnessed a significant year-over-year improvement. The improvement came mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and effective cost management. The company's bottom line also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, we are encouraged by the company's bullish fiscal 2015 guidance.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Advent Software, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 195.65%. It is worth noting that Synopsys has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 74.73%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synopsys kicked off 2015 on a strong note with both the top and bottom lines witnessing a significant year-over-year improvement. The improvement came mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and effective cost management. The company's bottom line also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, though total revenue marginally fell short of the same.We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp. coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys will beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 32 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDNS options chain for the new June 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $18.00 strike price has a current bid of 35 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $18.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $17.65 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDNS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $18.64/share today.Because the $18.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CDNS stock at the current price level of $18.64/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $19.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.88% if the stock gets called away at the June 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDNS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDNS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $19.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $19.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDNS options chain for the new November 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $18.00 strike price has a current bid of 50 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $18.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $17.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDNS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $18.41/share today.Because the $18.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CDNS stock at the current price level of $18.41/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $21.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 14.88% if the stock gets called away at the November 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDNS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDNS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $21.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $21.00 strike represents an approximate 14% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Also, an announcement related to certain management changes was made.Per NQ Mobile, Yu Lin stepped down as he unable to perform his duties citing personal reasons, which were in no way connected to the affairs of the company. NQ's current President Zemin Xu will be appointed as the Co-CEO and member of the board. Xu will join the other Co-CEO, Omar Khan. NQ's Co-Founder, Chief Operating Officer (COO) and acting Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Dr. Vincent Wenyong Shi will take over the duties of the Chairman of the Board going forward.Moreover, management also declared its intention of carrying on with its share repurchase program in the near future.Meanwhile, in an endeavor to express confidence in the future of the company, RPL Limited, a substantial shareholder of NQ Mobile (approximately 11.3% of outstanding shares) has agreed to an additional two-year voluntary lock-up scheduled to expire in Dec 2016.In Aug 2014, KB Teo resigned from the office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) citing personal reasons, pretty similar to Yu Lin. We believe that in order to divert public attention from this management reshuffle, the company stressed on the share repurchase plan and the extension of lock up period.Nevertheless, the company's decision to continue with its share repurchase plan will bolster its bottom line going forward. Also, the extension of the lock-up period will encourage more investment in the company.Better-than-expected user growth in FL Mobile's gaming platform and new game launches remain growth catalysts. The company's associations with Sprint and Samsung are positives. Moreover, the recent partnerships with the likes of Mobile Telesystems OSJC will help the company in expanding its reach worldwide.However, the company's margins have been adversely impacted by rising expenses and higher contribution of lower-margin businesses.

The company's first-quarter adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) on a proportionate tax basis of 68 cents increased 36% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents.However, on a GAAP basis, earnings came in at 41 cents per share compared with 43 cents in the year-ago period.Total revenue increased 13.2% year over year to $542 million and was toward the higher-end of the company's guidance range of $535-$545 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys' products. However, the company's total revenue marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $544 million.The company witnessed revenue growth across all its business segments. License revenues (including time-based and upfront) were $477.5 million, up nearly 10% from the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues increased 44% year over year to $64.5 million.More than 90% of the first-quarter revenues came from backlog. A single customer accounted for more than 10% of the revenues.Adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) was $443.4 million, up approximately 12% from the year-ago period. However, as a percentage of revenues, it contracted 90 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 81.8%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) increased 2.6% on a year-over-year basis to $324.9 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, the same decreased 620 bps from the year-ago quarter to 59.9% mainly due to a shift in the timing of expenses, delayed hiring and lower travelling and professional expenses.Synopsys' adjusted operating income jumped 49.6% on a year-over-year basis to $118.3 million, primarily due to operational efficiency coupled with higher revenue base. Consequently, operating margin improved 530 bps to 21.8%.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) on a proportionate tax basis was $107.2 million or 68 cents per share compared with $80.7 million or 50 cents a year ago.The company reported GAAP net income of $65.2 million or 41 cents per share compared with $67.7 million or 43 cents per share in first-quarter fiscal 2014.Synopsys exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $917.1 million compared with $985.8 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $283 million compared with $326.7 million in the last quarter. Long-term debt was $37.5 million. The company used cash of $87.3 million for operating activities. During the quarter, Synopsys repurchased $144 million worth of its common stock.Buoyed by the strong first-quarter performance, Synopsys raised the fiscal 2015 guidance. The company now expects revenues in the range of $2.15-$2.235 billion, up from its earlier guidance range of $2.185-$2.225 billion. Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $2.75 and $2.80 up from $2.67-$2.72. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $2.221 billion and $1.33 per share, respectively. The company maintained its cash from operations guidance of approximately $450 million.For second-quarter fiscal 2015, the company expects revenues in the range of $543-$553 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $538 million. The company expects non-GAAP expenses in the range of $418-$428 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 62-64 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents.Synopsys kicked off 2015 on a strong note with both the top line and the bottom line witnessed a significant year-over-year improvement. The improvement came mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and effective cost management. The company's bottom line also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, though total revenue marginally fell short of the same. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the company's bullish fiscal 2015 guidance.We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc. (  ) and Mentor Graphics Corp. (  ) coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is DST Systems Inc. (  ), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

However, shares fell 4.3% in after-hours trading, as the company took down its full-year outlook.Similar to Intel (  ), which reported last week, Microsoft also saw weakness in the PC market, which the company however attributed to difficult comps as earlier quarters benefited from customers upgrading from XP due to withdrawal of support.The company appears to be on track with its cloud-first mobile-first strategy, but its pain period seems to be far from over. That's because Windows continues to struggle and Office attach (which remains largely related to Windows) is trending down. Management assures and we agree that this is also related to the Office 365 migration.Microsoft also saw continued weakness in Asia (the important Chinese and Japanese markets), something that is expected to continue in the next quarter. Moreover, FX is expected to remain a negative due to strengthening of the dollar.That said Microsoft's services and technology are getting into a larger number of devices across the existing PC and mobile platforms, as well as emerging platforms like wearables and the Internet of Things (IoT). And this will continue to drive results in quarters to come.Revenue of $26.47 billion was up 14.1% sequentially and 8.0% from last year, better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.06 billion. Management said that the U.S. did better than expected and Europe was generally in line with expectations. However, the disappointment was related to China and Japan.Following the acquisition of the Nokia Devices and Services (NDS) business that closed on Apr 25 2014, management changed the reporting structure to add a sub-segment called Phone Hardware to the Devices & Consumer (D&C) segment. They also renamed the D&C Hardware segment as Computing and Gaming Hardware.Accordingly, D&C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware and D&C Other revenue made up 16%, 15%, 9% and 9% of quarterly revenue, respectively taking the contribution of the Devices & Consumer segment to 49%. revenue of $4.17 billion was within the guided range of $4.0-4.2 billion. This business still has a certain amount of seasonality so year-on-year comparisons are more meaningful. Additionally, lower-end devices continue to grow in the mix, leading to a near-term negative impact on revenue comparisons.There are three buckets within this segment: Windows Phone, Windows OEM and Office Consumer; and declines across all three drove the 24.8% segment decline from last year.The phone business was positively impacted by the recognition of $650 million in the year-ago quarter related to the termination of Microsoft's commercial agreement with Nokia, so there was a 61% decline.Both Windows OEM Pro and non-Pro revenue declined 13%. Lower priced devices to academic customers and the positive impact of XP end of support were the reasons for decline in Pro revenue. Mix was the main factor pulling down non-Pro revenue as Microsoft tried to increase penetration at the entry-level.Office consumer was the most disappointing however with a 25% decline although it was partially on account of the transition to Office 365 (so just a temporary impact). The disappointing factor was weakness in Japan's PC market, which typically has high Office attach rates.Revenue from  , which includes the Xbox and Surface platforms jumped 62.9% sequentially while declining 10.6% year over to $4.00 billion, higher than the guided $3.5-3.8 billion.Surface devices generated $1.1 billion million (up from 908 million in the Sep 2014 quarter), driven by Surface Pro 3 and accessories.The 20% year-over-year growth in Xbox platform revenue was helped by price concessions for Xbox One that also resulted in declines in Xbox 360.The $2.28 billion contribution from  was better than guided and driven by lower-priced Lumia devices, which grew from 9.3 million units in the Sep 2014 quarter to 10.5 million units in the last quarter. But the shrinking non-Lumia feature phones continue to make up the bulk of sales. Management is in the process of rationalizing the product line, which along with the impact of the shrinking market is hurting segment sales. revenue jumped 34.7% sequentially and 30.0% year over year and was also better than guided. First-party games were up 79% year over year due to Minecraft, the latest Halo and Forza Horizon 2 with Xbox LIVE driving resale revenues up 42%. The increase in search advertising revenue was driven by both RPS and volumes with Bing market share continuing to rise. Office 365 subscribers grew to over 9 million representing a 30% increase during the quarter. revenues grew 8.2% from the previous quarter but fell 2.1% from year-ago levels and were below expectations. The decline from last year was the combined impact of a 13% decline in Office Commercial that was partially offset by a 7% increase in server products and a 3% increase in Windows volume licensing.Office Commercial was impacted by lower transactional revenue due to the XP refresh, transition to Office 365 and weakness in China and Japan.Transactional revenue was also down in the server business, but continued strength in SQL Server, Windows Server and System Center more than offset the impact. revenues saw extremely strong growth of 7.7% and 45.7% from the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively and were within the guided range. Commercial Cloud services grew 114% from last year, the main driver of the increase. Office 365, Azure and Dynamics CRM Online dove results. Enterprise mobility workloads increased.Microsoft's gross margin of 61.7% was down 263 basis points (bps) sequentially and down 451 bps from the year-ago quarter. A number of factors impacted the gross margin in the last quarter.The higher mix of hardware and price discounts were the main reasons for the weak gross margin. But Microsoft is selling a more services and games, and it will also seeing greater scale in its cloud business, which could be positives for gross margins going forward.Operating expenses of $8.32 billion were up 4.7% sequentially and more or less consistent with last year. As a percentage of sales however, there were declines in all expense lines except S&M, which increased 23 bps. COGS was also higher. As a result, the operating margin expanded just 19 bps sequentially while shrinking 221 bps year over year to 30.3%.The company generated net income of $6.43 billion, or a 13.1% net income margin compared to $5.68 billion, or 24.5% in the previous quarter and $6.56 billion, or 26.7% in the year-ago quarter. Reported earnings including restructuring charges of $243 million and one-time tax adjustments came to 71 cents, up from 54 cents and 78 cents in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.Inventories fell 34.6%, with inventory turns sliding from 10.5X to 19.7X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 51 to 56.Microsoft ended with a cash and short term investments balance of $90.25 billion, up $1.06 billion during the quarter. The net cash position was around $61.90 billion ($7.55 a share), down from $65.47 billion ($7.95 a share) at the beginning of the quarter. In the last quarter, the company generated $4.34 billion in cash flow from operations, spent $2.15 billion to repurchase shares, $2.55 billion to pay dividends, $1.49 billion to purchase capital assets and $2.79 billion on acquisitions.Management said that FX would have a negative 4-point impact on revenue growth in the third quarter of 2015. For the quarter, Microsoft expects D&C Licensing revenue of $3.4-3.6 billion, Computing and Gaming Hardware revenue of $1.5-1.7 billion, Phone Hardware revenue of $1.4-1.5 billion, D&C Other revenue of around $2.0 billion, Commercial licensing revenue of $9.7-9.9 billion and Commercial Other revenue of $2.6-2.7 billion. China, Japan and Russia are expected to remain weak in the next quarter. Microsoft expects COGS of $7.1-7.4 billion and opex of $8.2-8.4 billion. Capex will increase sequentially.Full year revenue is expected to increase 4-5% to $33.2-33.6 billion and full-year year tax rate 22-24% (previous 20-22%). Management expects additional restructuring charges of $200 million in the next two quarters and integration charges of $100 million a quarter.Microsoft's second quarter is a clear indication of the improvement in its focus areas: cloud and mobile.While it may be too soon to comment, Microsoft does appear to be delivering on its cloud-first mobile-first strategy. In the last quarter, the company saw very strong triple digit growth in its cloud services. It has also been leveraging the popularity of Office to drive penetration on Apple and Google devices. At the same time, it is doing all it can to drive Surface sales.The hit to margins is not such a big negative considering the fact that it now has a more sizeable hardware business. Particularly since the business model is in transition. That said, the company is still not making money on its Surface devices although it could break even this year. In the meantime, it is sparing no expense to succeed.Microsoft shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Having served as the senior vice president and chief marketing officer of Symantec's consumer business unit division for three years, she has the requisite leadership qualities. Chaffin has also served for more than 25 years in general management and marketing at Hewlett-Packard (  ).She is experienced in diverse fields such as marketing and technology, and is a business leader in the software and hardware industries. Alongside, she is at present on the boards of International Game Technology and PTC Inc.Management believes that with her able leadership, considerable experience and business proficiency, she will be an asset for Synopsys and help the company achieve its long-term goals.Chaffin holds a series of educational and professional degrees, including a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Masters of Business Administration, both from California University. Further, she has also been associated with Ancestry.com LLC, the UCLA Anderson School of Management, Montalvo Arts Center and Illuminate Ventures as a supporting leader.Given her experience with technology firms and her understanding of Synopsys' business, she will likely contribute to the company's growth.We believe that Chaffin will employ better strategies and take Synopsys to newer heights in the changing demand scenario.Synopsys recently announced mixed fourth quarter 2014 results wherein its adjusted earnings per share of 54 cents cruised way ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents.Moreover, benefitting from higher adoption of Synopsys' products and the Coverity acquisition, the company's sales jumped 6.8% to $539 million.The company provided an encouraging first-quarter and fiscal 2015 guidance.

Instead, NQ Mobile appointed Marcum Bernstein Pinchul LLP (MBP) as the new auditor for fiscal 2013 and subsequent periods.NQ Mobile shares fell as much as 21.0% to hit a 52-week low of $3.45 on July 18, 2014. However, the stock rebounded 15.2% to close the day at $5.01.PwC's dismissal came after NQ Mobile management decided that it will be difficult for the company to comply with the auditor's request of expanding its scope in the operations going forward.Expanding PwC's scope in operations would have resulted in delaying filing of its 2013 Annual Report, as the auditor had asked for certain third-party related information, which would have been difficult for the company to obtain. However, NQ Mobile insisted that there was no disagreement with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or otherwise.We believe that the dismissal of PwC at such a crucial time may adversely impact investor confidence, which will remain an overhang on the stock. In such a scenario, speeding up of Annual Report filing will be a major positive that will revive trust among investors.Of late, the company has been facing headwinds related to its corporate governance practices. NQ Mobile recently responded to a Muddy Waters' research report dated Jul 7, 2014, which accused the company of being a \"massive fraud\" with at least 72.0% of its 2012 China security revenue fictitiously coming from a shell company called Yidatong, which was actually owned by NQ itself.Moreover, NQ Mobile was also accused of concealing important information from public including the stepping down of the head of the company's audit committee, Ying Han.NQ Mobile responded to these accusations by conducting an independent investigation. This investigation was conducted by a Special Committee comprising four of its independent directors along with two renowned firms, Shearman & Sterling LLP and Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services Limited. The aim of the investigation was to determine whether NQ Mobile had resorted to any unfair means or not.The results of the investigation were revealed to the public soon after it was over. Per the investigation, NQ Mobile had submitted all material information within the stipulated timeframe as well as in full compliance with all Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.Hence, the Committee concluded that no fraudulent practice had been adopted by NQ Mobile. However, in this case PwC refrained from commenting.NQ Mobile reported mixed fourth-quarter results. Better-than-expected user growth in FL Mobile's gaming platform and new game launches remain the growth catalysts.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 234 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDNS options chain for the new August 2015 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $19.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.35. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $19.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $17.65 (before broker commissions).

If an investor was to purchase shares of CDNS stock at the current price level of $19.11/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $20.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.15% if the stock gets called away at the August 2015 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDNS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cadence Design Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

Both earnings and revenues improved on a year-over-year basis impacted by the higher adoption of Synopsys' products and the Coverity acquisition.

The partnerships will boost its 14nm design platform for cloud infrastructure and mobile market applications. These alliances are an extension of the work on the Intel Custom Foundry 22nm process design platform to the 14nm platform.Intel's collaboration with Synopsis will enable an extensive System on a Chip (\"SoC\") design for its custom foundry 14-nm Tri-Gate process technology. Building on the proven success of the companies' design enablement for Intel's 22-nm foundry process design platform, Intel has chosen Synopsys' design expertise and IP portfolio for its new 14-nm foundry process technology. Synopsis is a provider of electronic design automation (\"EDA\") software products, intellectual property (\"IP\") and services to build and improve chips and electronic systems.Following the collaboration with Cadence, Intel will gain the latter's LPDDR4-3200 PHY for its 14nm Low Power design platform. Cadence's technology will cater to high memory performance, efficient power and cost, and compact system demands of Intel's mobile market applications. Moreover, the collaboration will also help in the expansion of the Cadence digital flow design platform, which in turn will enable customers to leverage the power, performance and area advantages of Intel's 14nm process technology. Cadence provides EDA software and its software, hardware, IP, and services are utilized to design and verify semiconductor and electronics systems.Intel, as part of its partnership with ANSYS, will gain access to ANSYS simulation solutions, which will enable customers to use a production-proven, industry-leading reference flow for power, electromigration (\"EM\") and reliability sign-off solution for its 14nm Tri-Gate process platform. ANSYS offers engineering simulation software and services to bring clarity and insight to complicated design challenges.Intel together with Mentor Graphics will offer models and rule decks for circuit simulation, design rule checking (\"DRC\") and layout against schematic checking (\"LVS\") for mobile and cloud applications. Intel will incorporate Mentor's standard circuit simulation, verification and sign-off technology with 14nm design platform. This will enable customers to offer optimized designs for process-specific needs, thereby providing leading cycle time and physical verification precision. Mentor Graphics provides EDA software and hardware solutions, products and consulting services for electro-mechanical and semiconductor systems.Intel's Tri-Gate technology is a proprietary 3D transistor technology and its 14nm transistor technology for SoC is a highly developed and enhanced version of the Tri-Gate process technology. These transistors enable efficient and high performance chips compared to the earlier generations of transistors. Therefore, this allows chip designers to select transistors for low power or high performance, based on the applications.Intel has previously stated that its foundry partnerships are strategic agreements. These partnerships can enable fabless semiconductor companies to fully leverage the features offered by its 14nm process technology to build innovative products. They should therefore be beneficial for Intel's Custom Foundry business, which should in turn drive up utilization rates and boost its results going forward.Currently, Intel holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: GHC), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Cadence Design Systems Inc (Symbol: CDNS), the market cap is now $4.36B, versus Graham Holdings Co. (Symbol: GHC) at $4.31B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CDNS vs. GHC:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, CDNS is up about 1.2%, while GHC is up about 0.2% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["adence Design Systems reports earnings in less than two weeks, and yesterday traders were making long-term bullish bets on the semiconductor name.More than 7,000 February 18 calls were bought for $0.95 to $1.05 yesterday afternoon, according to optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker tracking system.

The company had earlier reported better-than-expected quarterly results. The company's first quarter saw new customer growth across all its segments, thereby strengthening its travel management business. Concur's performance in SMB, enterprise and in its federal business remained strong in the quarter. This apart, we remain positive about the mounting opportunities for the company driven by the increased demand for the managed travel expenses by the corporate industry across the globe.Concur has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive beat of 46.8%. However, in the first quarter non-GAAP earnings (excluding one-time items) of $0.21 per share compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of net loss of $0.9 per share. Nevertheless, earnings surged 31% year over year.Additionally, management provided an encouraging outlook for fiscal 2014. Concur expects non-GAAP revenue for second-quarter 2014 to grow about 30% year-over-year and expects non-GAAP pre-tax income per share to be at 14 cents a share.For fiscal 2014, non-GAAP revenue is expected to grow approximately 26% year-over-year and non-GAAP pre-tax income per share is projected to be at least $0.93 a share. For fiscal year 2014, the company expects non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 10% to 14%. Cash flow from operations in in the year is predicted to be at least $72 million, while capital expenditures are expected to be 8% to 9% of fiscal 2014 revenue.The company has a well-defined software development methodology, which allows it to deliver products that satisfy business needs of customers and meets commercial quality expectations. Its systems development and programming group teams up with the marketing department to assess market needs and requirements. It also uses independent development firms or contractors, when needed, to expand the capacity and technical expertise of its internal research and development team. Concur has also added 'system integrators' to its business. Recently, Concur unveiled a new travel and expense (T&E) trend analysis solution that was developed in partnership with Oversight Systems. The application based on T&E Cloud Platform will aid the travel management companies to obtain critical insights about corporate spending patterns. The company aims to add more partners going forward to meet the growing customer demand while developing its solution delivery capabilities.Additionally, the company's  that was started a couple of years back, has been benefiting the company by increasing its distribution capacity. Concur's distribution capacity has already increased by more than 100% to date. Also, as this initiative is being increasingly accepted by the company's customers, partners, developers, and suppliers across the globe, the growth trend is expected to continue going ahead. This initiative is driven by the presence of an open platform that makes travel ecosystem more efficient and competitive. The company is also likely to benefit from increasing investments in these open platforms and its open booking service, TripLink, launched in the first half of fiscal 2013. Concur also intends to add a number of new solutions to its portfolio like Tripit Pro, an innovative mobile tool designed to simplify and enhance corporate traveling experience. In a research by Concur's TripIt application, it was found that the number of leisure travels is likely to increase. This uptrend will bode well for company's profits and interests.However, though the macroeconomic environment has improved, the rate of improvement in mature markets is still in a nascent stage. The company has a significant portion of revenues coming from its European businesses, which continue to be impacted by the after effects of the European financial crisis, thereby providing limited visibility into the company's future.Concur currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks that are worth considering within this sector are  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), all three carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["milar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns.

A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in BRC.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 2 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.77 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.50.Also, for the current quarter, Brady has seen 1 downward estimate revision versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 40 cents a share from 48 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 12.81% in the past month.So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Computer & Technology sector, you may instead consider some better-ranked stocks including  (  ),  .

The substance is therefore suitable for high-power and high-frequency devices for application in stressful environments, such as in military or space equipment. However, the reaction to Silicon makes the substrate formation a bit tricky, which is the main reason for the smaller wafer sizes.Imec is working toward larger wafer sizes (its research produced 200mm wafers just last year). It has also developed a manufacturing process compatible with standard CMOS processes to facilitate volume production. For this purpose it has roped in semiconductor stalwarts such as  (  ), Samsung, Panasonic,  (  ),  (  ),  (  ), GLOBALFOUNDRIES,  (  ), Hynix,  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and Renesas, among others.On Semi's portfolio is focused on energy efficient devices and the company has been doing its own research on GaN silicon technology. With this agreement, On Semi brings its own research to the table, which further strengthens the collaboration, possibly speeding up the development and commercialization of GaN on Si and benefiting the entire semiconductor industry.ON Semi reported revenues of $744.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, flat sequentially, down 17.8% year over year and in the middle of management's guidance range of $720.0-760.0 million, or down 1-6% sequentially.On a pro forma basis, the company reported a net income of $51.1 million, or a 6.9% net income margin compared with $52.4 million, or 6.8% in the previous quarter and $113.2 million or 13.0% in the first quarter of 2012.Currently, On Semiconductor has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a Hold rating in the short-term (1-3 months).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he  is down -.28 to 3,122.39.

Its products are used to conceptualize, design, emulate and test various electronic systems and components.Mentor is the oldest and third-largest company within the electronic design automation, or EDA, space. The other two players areSynopsys (  ) andCadence Design Systems (  ).\"Typically, about three-fourths of the total industry's revenue is comprised of these three companies. And the remaining one-fourth is proportioned over many other smaller, mostly usually privately held companies,\" said software analyst Jay Vleeschhouwer at Griffin Securities.\"Everything that we take for granted and have for many years . .. none of that could exist without the technology of these companies. It would be humanly impossible to get the degree of complexity and microscopic scale that we see in semiconductors and chips without the software tools that are used to create this,\" he said.Mentor's strategy is to focus on areas with the largest market share and the best capability, said Mentor's chairman and CEO Walden Rhines.\"That's a little different from others who spread themselves more broadly. One of the reasons that we are doing well is that there's a whole new generation of semiconductor technology coming along and Mentor is the leading supplier of physical verification tools for integrated circuit design,\" Rhines said.The new generation is referred to as the 28/20 nanometer design, which is part of the constant move to smaller, deep sub-micron range of designs. With the device complexity and number of components increasing, the semiconductor industry's demand for power and capacity of design and verification tools is rapidly increasing.Mentor's flagship product is Calibre, which is a software used in the verification and analysis of chips.\"Before you spend millions upon millions of dollars putting a new chip into production and then, sometime later, discovering that there may actually be something wrong with it, you don't want to get to that point without having tested and verified the chip design,\" said Vleeschhouwer.Mentor also does chip verification via hardware. Its latest product is Veloce 2, where you can emulate a prototype of a chip.\"In years past, it was a fairly special-purpose kind of product, used only by certain kinds of chip designs. Now, in the last two years, it's ... used much more broadly by a wide range of people who do complex chip designs,\" said Rhines.\"It's become the most cost-effective way for people to verify that their designs are, in fact, correct in doing what they are supposed to do,\" he added.The company expects the emulation portion of its business to grow 100% for the year.Mentor also has strong technology in the design of printed circuit boards, or PCB. These are the laminated boards that are populated with electronics that go into phones, tablets and computers.\"Mentor is by far the market leader in that PCB category, which, even though it doesn't get a lot of attention from investors, happens to be part of the largest end-markets in EDA,\" Vleeschhouwer noted.Software comprises more than 90% of Mentor's business and three-quarters of that goes into designing chips, while the other quarter goes into designing systems.The latter is another fast, though at times bumpy, area of growth for Mentor. The systems include everything from printed circuit boards to automobiles to airplanes.\"The systems business, surprisingly, is very rapidly growing because planes, trains and automobiles have traditionally been designed by more manual methods and they're in the process of automating their design processes,\" said Rhines.The cost of products usually ranges in the five- to six-digit numbers. About half of a booking is recognized as revenue when the company delivers the product.The remainder is either delivered as support over the life of the contract or as services that go along with the contract, explained Rhines.Some of Mentor's semiconductor customers are Toshiba, Freescale Semiconductor andIBM (  ) . Systems customers includeBoeing (  ), BMW, Airbus, Honda andGE (GE).The average life of a contract is three years and customer relationships tend to be long-standing.\"They are extremely long relationships, the majority of our revenue comes from customers that we've been doing business with for decades and last year, our average three-year contract increased between 25% and 40% compared to the prior contract of the three years before,\" Rhines said.He estimates similar increases this year, with some quarterly variability.Often, customers will buy products from multiple vendors, and will assemble and mix and match various software. There is a relatively small pool of customers and within that set, an even smaller number of engineers who work on designing electronic products.\"These companies, Mentor, Synopsys and Cadence, have increasingly overlapping product lines,\" said Vleeschhouwer. \"They increasingly either try to diversify or bulk up in areas where they are already strong.\"Geographically, the fastest growth in the past decade has come from the non-Japan Asia, especially China, Korea, Taiwan and India. Mentor has the No. 1 market share in China and India, said Rhines.\"A lot of the customers have put more and more engineering resources into India, and so the revenue follows where the engineering bodies are,\" said Vleeschhouwer.Also, structural and organic growth contributes to the region's growth.\"In Korea, you've got customers like Samsung that are putting a ton of money into R&D and China is trying to build up its industry, so they'll have to consume and hopefully pay for software,\" he added.Europe, while it doesn't represent the largest region in terms of revenue, is a region where Mentor has the best market share.\"It's a very esoteric industry. It's probably hard for most people to really get a feel for how a chip is designed. Everyone takes it for granted, you turn on your iPhone and that's it,\" said Vleeschhouwer. \"It's an extraordinary engineering accomplishment. If you think about the capabilities and the speed and the memory storage that gets packed into this extraordinarily small thing, that doesn't happen unless you have the right software tools.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" collaborative approach with  (  ) has helped MICRONAS to develop digital solutions for the design and verification of semiconductors used in the automobile industry.

Collaborations have helped the company strengthen its product portfolio and improve the design quality of its custom integrated circuits, which has in turn helped its sales. Apart from collaborations, the company's acquisitions are aimed at improving business, which is evident from the acquisition of the privately held software maker ExpertIO Inc.According to technology research firm  (  ), worldwide spending for wafer fab equipment will decline 13.3% year over year in 2012 and 0.8% in 2013. However, the firm predicts a 15.3% increase in semiconductor spending in 2014.

Not only has Synopsys gained from Extreme DA's technology, but also from the utilization of its experienced human resources, particularly engineers and sales agents.Acquisitions might be a prudent way of expanding the company inorganically. However, Synopsys needs to make bigger acquisitions to compensate for the modest growth rate in the industry.Even if the company finds larger targets to acquire, we believe that funding could be an issue given the recent slowdown in the business, which has impacted results.

That's been the way things have played out for electronic design automation software vendorCadence Design Systems (  ).Cadence develops software used by semiconductor and electronic system customers to design integrated circuits and electronic devices. After losing money in 2008 and 2009 as the recession took its toll on the semiconductor industry and Cadence struggled with internal issues, the company began to rebound in 2010 and has been on a roll with hefty gains ever since.Key to its success have been the efforts of Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm in early 2009. Tan, along with a new management team to support him, gave the company a good overhaul.Tan and his team revamped the company's business practices to focus on deal quality rather than short-term bookings and revenue, says analyst Richard Valera of Needham & Co. The strong adherence to deal quality, he says, set the foundation for much more predictable, sustained growth over the next several years.\"Their execution on rebuilding the infrastructure of the company and its renewal pipeline, which had been depleted by the aggressive practices of prior management, has enabled Cadence to generate significantly above industry-average growth,\" he adds.That it has, and then some. Cadence has logged nine straight quarters of double-digit sales growth. Earnings have climbed by at least double digits in the same time.If followers are on target, Cadence should keep up its double-digit gains when it reports fourth-quarter results Wednesday after the close. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 12% to 19 cents a share. They forecast an 11% gain in revenue to $340.7 million.If analysts are right, that would represent a slowdown in its growth rate from the past several quarters. In the third quarter, earnings rose 50% to 21 cents a share, topping views. Revenue grew 16% to $338.5 million. It was the eighth straight quarter Cadence beat analysts' forecasts for both sales and earnings.Piper Jaffray analyst Gus Richard estimates Cadence will see 11% top-line growth in the fourth quarter vs. a year earlier and a 13% increase in earnings per share.\"That's a little bit of a deceleration, but we'll see how it comes out,\" he said. \"They have consistently met expectations over the last eight or nine quarters. I don't expect that to change.\"In addition to software, Cadence also offers emulation hardware that lets customers verify that the chip and software they're designing in conjunction with it are working prior to manufacturing the chip. This enables designers of chips for game consoles and other consumer electronics to speed their products to market using hardware simulators to run software on a \"virtual\" chip long before the actual chip exists.Valera says the market for emulation hardware began to surge in 2011. And Cadence, which is the leader in the emulation hardware market, benefited from this surge, which continued through 2012. Although the growth in its emulation hardware business was modest in 2012 relative to 2011, he adds, it's still been a good source of upside for Cadence throughout 2012, likely including the fourth quarter.While Cadence has enjoyed a steady string of quarterly \"beats,\" Valera says it will be difficult for Cadence to continue to exceed estimates to the same magnitude it has for the last couple of years.\"Being four years into their recovery, we think some of the tail winds from normalization of their license model and renewal pipeline will be fading and that the magnitude of beats in revenue and earnings they've been delivering is likely to mitigate as we proceed into this year,\" he said.Cadence and its peers -- which includeSynopsys Inc. (  ), Mentor Graphics Corp . (  )and Magma Design Automation -- are benefiting from the trend toward smaller and more-complex chips for smartphones, tablets and other devices.\"There's hardly any microprocessor or chip on the planet that will not have been touched by software from this company and its competitors,\" said Griffin Securities analyst Jay Vleeschhouwer. \"It's become impossible to design them without the use of these software tools.\"As the complexity of chips has increased and their size has gotten smaller and smaller, he adds, it requires new types of software and an upgrading of tools to make them.\"The shift to a post-PC era, new products and form factors are stimulating design activity,\" said Richard in a report.\"Companies likeMicrosoft (  ),Google (  ), Apple (AAPL) and others are increasingly designing their own chips to take advantage of the shifting landscape and drive their ecosystems' growth.\"Watchers expect Cadence's 2013 earnings to rise 49% to 76 cents a share. They see a 20% pop in 2014.\"I think they'll continue to grind out operating margin improvements and low double-digit revenue growth in calendar 2013,\" said Richard. It's not a rocket ship. It's a slow grind higher.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) recently completed the acquisition of privately-held software maker RSoft Design Group Inc.

This latest acquisition will complement its existing capabilities, enhancing its existing suite of optical designs.Notably, Synopsys stepped into the optical design market with the acquisition of Optical Research Associates in 2010.

With the acquisition of Virage Logic Corp. in 2010, Synopsys added embedded memories, including SRAMs (static random access memory) and non-volatile memory, logic libraries, embedded test and repair IP and configurable processor cores, to its IP portfolio.One thing to note here is that Synopsys has shown no initiative to diversify to other lines of business, although its acquisitions have consistently built its core competencies. Additionally, taking over the same line of business will enrich its portfolio, while also reducing integration time and cost.Synopsys is set to announce its second quarter 2012 results on May 23.

Financial terms of the deal were kept confidential.ExpertIO is an independent provider of Verification Internet Protocol (  ) for storage devices. It specializes in software that is required for testing and debugging electronics in storage and networking devices. ExpertIO had been a technology partner to Synopsys for a long time.Synopsys makes software that is used to test and develop chips. It has its own set of VIP protocols. This latest acquisition will go hand-in-hand with its capabilities, enhancing the existing suite of VIP protocols. Moreover, Synopsys' intellectual property will also get enhanced by the addition of ExpertIO's expert team.The combined effort will bring in advanced VIP solutions that will enhance the SoC (System on Chip) designs. The ExpertIO acquisition is in line with Synopsys' strategy of broadening its VIP portfolio to address the growing verification challenges that designers face while developing complex systems on chips (SoCs) to serve the demand for 'smart' electronics.Strategic acquisitions have always been Synopsys' ploy to strengthen its product portfolio. In 2011, the company made a number of acquisitions. In October, Synopsys completed the acquisition of privately-held electronic design automation (EDA) company, Extreme DA.In September, Synopsys completed the acquisition of a leading independent provider of VIP, nSys Design Systems Private Limited. With the acquisition of Virage Logic Corp. in 2010, Synopsys added embedded memories, including SRAMs (static random access memory) and non-volatile memory, logic libraries, embedded test and repair IP and configurable processor cores, to its IP portfolio.One thing to note here is that Synopsys has shown no initiative to diversify to other lines of business, although its acquisitions have consistently built upon its core competencies, while enabling it to expand capabilities in adjacent areas. Additionally, taking over the same line of businesses will enrich its portfolio, while also reducing integration time and cost.Synopsys delivered solid results in the fourth quarter, with good operating performance and cost control.

But early on Saturday mornings, he'd wake me while it was still dark and take me to the office with him.And about once a month, we'd slip away to the farm where he grew up and there he worked just as hard, doing farm chores in blue jeans instead of business deals in a suit and tie. Other times we'd visit oil wells, look at farm properties or cattle. He liked to drive and talk, and sort things out.Listening to my old man unwind was a phenomenal business education.On one of these trips, Dad was talking about some rental property he and a partner were going to buy together. He explained the nuances of deal's financing and then he looked up at me.\"You know the best way to build equity, don't you, son?\"Bear in mind that I was maybe 7 years old, but I knew the difference between debt and equity. But as I pondered Dad's question, I came up short.I shook my head. \"I don't know, Dad,\" I said.He smiled my favorite smile, a sort of sideways, in-the-know, \"gotcha\" diabolical smile. \"The best way to build equity, my boy,\" Dad held forth, \"is with someone else's money.\"His point was that, over time, the tenants would do the heavy lifting -- paying themortgage and expenses while he and his partner got some income, increased their equity and, potentially, also saw the value of their property rise.A couple of years later, Dad took me on a trip to Nebraska. We went to a big conference hall where two old men sat at a table. They looked like every small-town banker I had ever met and, once they started, they talked non-stop for almost the whole day. Dad sat there and took notes. I was bored.Finally, I heard the man talk about the investment portfolio. He kept using a word that would haunt me for days. Then I made my discovery.\"You know what he's doing, don't you?\" I asked, waving a copy of theannual report .\"What who's doing,\" my mother asked.\"That guy in Omaha. That Mr. Buffett!\" I said. \"He's building equity with other people's money!\"My old man smiled and nodded. He looked like he was about to burst with pride.The word that haunted me was \"  .\" But it didn't describe the verb I found listed in the dictionary on my bookshelf. This float was a noun, a type of money. In an insurance context, \"float\" refers to money held for policyholders to cover their claims.The purpose of an insurance company, from a customer's perspective, is to offer protection from financial loss. For this coverage, drivers pay premiums. But if it ended there, most insurance companies wouldn't make aprofit -- policyholder claims generally exceed premiums paid.So to really understand insurance companies, you have to look at them from the board of directors' perspective. It's then that you see the purpose of an insurance company isn't to provide coverage, it's to borrow money and invest it -- a lot of money.After all, if you have 10 million policy holders paying $100 a month for car insurance, then that's $1 billion piling up every 30 days. That money is the \"float.\" Most, if not all, will eventually be paid out. The key word there is \"eventually.\" In the meantime, the insurance company is free to continue to collect premiums and invest the float for its own benefit.The question, of course, is precisely where is all that money invested? When investing such a large sum, professionals spread it around and seek to  from all sorts of investments.As many of you know, I'm the editor of  . I'm always looking for those securities on the \"fast-track\" to triple, or quadruple-digit gains.So knowing what stocks the big insurance houses are buying doesn't go far enough for me. A lot of what insurance companies are buying are large, stable companies that provide a relatively predictable rate of return.What I'm looking for is the portion of each stock portfolio allocated to smaller companies with greater potential for exceptional returns. These picks have been vetted by some of the sharpest minds in finance -- insurance companies hire top managers to tend to their trillions. Here's a small sample of what I found:State Farm has a roughly $40 billion stock portfolio that covers only 95 securities. This is a relatively narrow universe of picks for such a sum, so I'd say State Farm is willing to make some pretty bold picks. While its largest holdings are no surprise -- Johnson & Johnson, ExxonMobil, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Archer Daniels Midland -- there was one company that looked promising:  .Factory Mutual is more commonly known as FM Global, and it's a go-to insurance provider for companies that need to cover major pieces of property. Its stock portfolio is worth $4 billion and covers about 160 securities. While nearly every one of these stocks is a mega-cap company, one small company has made the cut,  .Allstate's $1.6 billion portfolio is spread across more than 1,000 stocks.

But some suspect that the impact of this quarter\u2019s earnings will take a backseat to bigger picture issues.According to Citigroup, Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis will play a more important role to investors given its potential to drastically alter the global economy.\u201cU.S. options traders see almost no chance that earnings, dividends or buybacks will influence stock prices through the end of 2011, instead placing record bets that equities move in lockstep in reaction to Europe\u2019s debt crisis. The Chicago Board Options Exchange S&P 500 Implied Correlation Index jumped to a record 90.28 on Sept. 30. The correlation coefficient of S&P 500 companies with the index has surged to 0.85, its highest level ever.\u201d (via )Record high correlation among stocks indexes is certainly a driving factor. The rumors, actions, and slightest whims of politicians across the globe have had startling effects on market swings and have contributed heavily to the market volatility plaguing the market.Given the immeasurable consequences of a European collapse, it\u2019s easy to understand how many investors may brush off earnings as a negligible statistic. After all, a strong earnings report for the third quarter will hardly matter if the economy plunges into a global recession and, given heavy correlation, drags that stock down with it. So instead, all eyes are on European developments in the hopes of gleaning some clarity of the economic future.Meanwhile, earnings are hardly dismissible. After all, if the economic collapse doesn\u2019t come to be, they can prove just as valuable as ever. So which companies reporting earnings should be on your radar?To help you find ideas, we scanned the earnings results of thousands of companies, and identified a list of about 200 that have a history of beating analyst earnings expectations over the last year.To refine the quality of our list, we only focused on those \u201cearnings surprise\u201d companies that have seen significant insider buying over the last six months.These companies have a track record of beating analyst earnings estimates, and insiders seem to think there\u2019s more good news on the way\u2013should these companies be on your earnings radar?1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentioned Develops electronic design automation software and hardware for customers worldwide.
