Sports account for a huge chunk of the typical customer's pay-TV bill, and right now that money is being paid by subscribers in return for almost nothing at all.But this is a complicated issue.

Walmart (NYSE: WMT) bought digital marketplace Vudu in 2010. And Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA) Fandango is also in this space with a digital video rental and purchase marketplace called FandangoNow.

It should also concern regulators and lawmakers. Even media names may want to think twice before plugging into the same idea.

At $14.99 per month, the service (when it launches in May) will be the highest-priced non-live streaming service available. It's a big gamble in an industry that's quickly turning into a commodity business.And there's the rub -- one of them anyway. AT&T remains relatively tone-deaf on the pricing front.The other rub?

But the biggest beneficiary of the paradigm shift spotted by digital video editing and production platform Grabyo is the soon-to-be-launched Peacock service from NBCUniversal -- a division of cable giant Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA). Simply put, Grabyo's recent survey of consumers indicates that 74% of television watchers will only be streaming their content by 2025.On the surface, it's neither surprising nor alarming. Cable companies that have been on the wrong end of the cord-cutting craze are finally stepping up their streaming game. In addition to the impending launch of Peacock, ViacomCBS (NASDAQ: VIAC) revealed last month it was planning its own, similar ad-supported video platform. Fox Corporation just announced its acquisition of Tubi, which injects advertisements into television programming and movies to make them free for watchers.Somehow, though, Comcast's Peacock still looks like it comes out the winner of this budding branch of the streaming video market.END", "Broadcast news and entertainment giant Fox Corporation (NASDAQ: FOX) (NASDAQ: FOXA), announced late Tuesday that it would acquire free, ad-supported streaming service Tubi for $440 million in cash.

That was well below Monday's closing price of $63.84, which was already down a stunning 21.1% for the day during the worst single-day drop in the market since 1987. That was a very worrying sign that large shareholders may have wanted out of the high-flying growth stock at just about any price. After all, Roku topped $176 per share as recently as last August, so to see a large shareholder wanting out at $60 was not what shareholders wanted to hear.\u00a0\u00a0However, we now know who the big seller was, and the answer to the question should probably make Roku shareholders breathe a bit easier -- at least, as easy as one can breathe in this environment.END", "By some measures, the global coronavirus outbreak couldn't have been more devastating for Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA).

On the flipside, stay-at-home (and work-at-home) mandates may have cemented its broadband business in place with consumers, while a depressed economy could make cheap entertainment like its upcoming Peacock streaming service a smash hit.Plenty of rough patches are sure to lie ahead.
