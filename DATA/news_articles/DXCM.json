Here's why investors can't get enough of these stocks.END", "\nThere are 16 different analyst targets contributing to that average for DexCom Inc, but the average is just that \u2014 a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $190.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $330.00.  The standard deviation is $32.904.\n\n\nBut the whole reason to look at the average DXCM price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with DXCM crossing above that average target price of $286.75/share, investors in DXCM have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $286.75 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

What's more, the social distancing measures being used to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have badly damaged the global economy and global supply chains and have put a number of industries, such as airlines, brick-and-mortar retailers, and sit-down restaurants, in a serious financial bind.\u00a0The good news is that this pandemic will eventually end. Several pharmaceutical companies are trialing a variety of novel therapeutics that could shorten the clinical course of the disease and perhaps lessen its severity in acute cases, leading to fewer fatalities. Moreover, numerous vaccine candidates are under development, some of which could be available for widespread use as soon as mid-2021.END", "Sure, many stocks have bounced back somewhat from their lows during the massive market meltdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has given back most of its gains during the Donald Trump presidency, and scores of blue-chip equities are now trading at multiyear lows as a result. Despite this historic marketwide drop in stock prices, however, most equities still aren't worth buying right now. The unfortunate truth is that the pandemic is probably several weeks away from hitting a peak in the United States, making it virtually impossible to open up the broader economy. So with little to no economic activity on the near-term horizon, stock prices are bound to print lower lows as this public health crisis deepens during the month of April.But there are a few bright spots in this dour market. Companies that produce products essential to daily life, such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals, should eventually separate themselves from the pack.
