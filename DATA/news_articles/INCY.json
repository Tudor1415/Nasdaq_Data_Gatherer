The standard deviation is $13.354.\n\n\nBut the whole reason to look at the average INCY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with INCY crossing above that average target price of $100.83/share, investors in INCY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $100.83 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

That number works out to 46% of CLX's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 2.0 million shares.  Especially high volume was seen for the $210 strike call option expiring June 12, 2020, with 1,335 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 133,500 underlying shares of CLX.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 148 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INCY options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.70.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $87.30 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INCY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $97.84/share today.\n\nBecause the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INCY options chain for the new December 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.40.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $88.60 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INCY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $103.17/share today.\n\nBecause the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.
