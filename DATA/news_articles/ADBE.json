For many investors who were trying to make sense of the market\u2019s quick run-up from the March lows, the jobs data would seem to help justify Wall Street\u2019s continued ability to look beyond the coronavirus downturn to the recovery.\u00a0The May jobs report showed a surprise 2.5 million increase in payrolls, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics. The job gains were driven by the reopening of businesses after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The data also dropped the unemployment rate to 13.3%, down from 14.7%. For some context, economists had predicted job losses of 7.25 million and a May unemployment rate of 19%.

Not according to year-end projections with several analysts forecasting the S&P 500 to end the year at 3300. All told, May\u2019s job data was yet another catalyst to affirm the notion of a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery, while justifying the rush to risk assets, particularly at a time when interest rates are at zero.

All was well the first two months of the new decade before all hell broke loose, and while the global economy remains in various stages of lockdown and in recession due to you-know-what, the U.S. stock market indices have rallied to close to where they started at the onset of the year.Leading the charge in this new era are technology stocks -- specifically those helping organizations and individuals cope with shelter-in-place and work-from-home orders. Artificial intelligence (AI) was already a promising growth industry, but recent events have made the need for automation and efficient use of data more important than ever. Playing out as a top investment motif for the decade ahead, don't worry if you missed the big stock market rebound the last two months.

But it\u2019s also a temporary thing. This is not the first pandemic the world has faced. Nor is it the first bear market or the first recession consumers have faced. Over the past 200 years, we have seen dozens of pandemics, bear markets and recessions. Through them all, the world, the U.S. economy and the stock market have not just survived, but thrived.

At the same time, its reputation for bulk goods at rock-bottom prices continues to bring in customer in droves, and it consistently racks up strong same-store sales growth. No other warehouse chain has come close to the level of sales that Costco does, which has given it a competitive advantage in the subsector.\u00a0However, the pandemic has brought about rapid change in the retail sector. In addition to the bifurcation between non-essential and essential retailers, and pressure in categories like apparel, e-commerce has boomed as shoppers who have been sheltering in place or are simply reluctant to visit a store are now shopping online.\u00a0That's driven a spike in e-commerce with a number of online retail channels reporting Black Friday levels of traffic in April.\u00a0Adobe\u00a0Digital Economy Index reported domestic e-commerce sales up 49% in April from March, while online grocery saw\u00a0an even bigger boom, jumping 110% from March to April.\u00a0END", "Stocks ended Friday higher, booking sharp gains for the week and for the month of May, prompting some market participants to wonder, when the disconnect (whether perceived or real) between Wall Street and Main Street will end.\u00a0It\u2019s one of the prevailing bear theses that opposes the incredible 35%+ rebound the stock market has witnesses since the March bottom. While bears are, understandably, scratching their heads, the bulls are boasting \u201cdon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d With the market\u00a0near its pre-pandemic highs, who will win? Despite downbeat economic data showing the economic weakness, stocks continue to rise in a manner that assumes the number of Americans currently out of work is fictional.Driven by optimism of easing lockdown restrictions, stocks sustained this week\u2019s rally, shrugging off Friday\u2019s news conference from President Donald Trump on China, which investors feared would have disrupted the market, particularly as it relates to trade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down Friday 17.53 points lower, or less than 0.1%, to close at 25,383.11. It rebounded on its low of the day at 25,031.67. The S&P 500 index added 14.58 points, or 0.5% to end the session at 3,044.31, while the Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 9,489.87, surging 120.88 points higher.For the week, the Dow gained almost 4%, while the S&P 500 added 3%, and the Nasdaq was higher by almost 2%. \u201cSell in May and go away?\u201d It didn\u2019t work this month as the Dow rose 4.3%, the S&P 500 added 4.5%. The Nasdaq was the biggest winner, netting almost a 7% return in May. As I said last week, the \u201cTINA factor\u201d (there is no alternative) seems to be what\u2019s driving this market. With interest rates at zero, and with talks of negative rates surfacing, stocks are the surest way to counter inflation.END", "Software stocks have been a key driver of the market\u2019s strong rebound from the March lows, but Workday has underperformed during that span. While Workday (WDAY) stock is up about 2% year to date, it trails the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce and Adobe (ADBE). Still, investors will be looking to see if Workday will maintain its guidance.\u00a0Workday\u2019s underperformance relative to its peers suggests the market is still taking a wait-and-see approach in its evaluation of its growth prospects. The enterprise cloud specialist is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. While uncertainties remain with the COVID-19 impact, Workday provides essential HR and finance management software that is well-insulated from pandemic disruption.The company\u2019s extensive collection of cloud-based solutions, such as accounting, financial reporting, analytics and compensation, gives it a pathway to multiple years of growth, particularly as businesses adjust to a remote-work environment. Workday\u2019s solutions, which aim to increase business efficiency, while lowering costs, are driving market share growth in two of its main profit drivers \u2014 SaaS and enterprise resource planning.\u00a0While these business functions are critical to maintaining efficiency amid lockdown restrictions, the likes of Salesforce (CRM) are also vying for those dollars. As such, for Workday\u2019s stock to trade on par with its peers, the company must deliver not only on the top and bottom line but also issue confident revenue guidance and upside billings forecast to allay investor concerns about valuation and its competitive position.END", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips[Editor\u2019s note: \u201c10 Stocks to Invest In for a Post-Coronavirus Whipsaw\u201d is regularly updated to include the most relevant information available.]My two cents on the investment implications of the global coronavirus pandemic is simple: use the 2020 stock market dip to look for the best stocks to invest in for the long term.Yes, Covid-19 is a big and scary thing.

The firm has just released a report advising investors to focus on growth stocks with rapidly growing revenues. These are the kinds of companies that should outperform as costs rise over the coming year, Goldman analysts say.\"Mounting pressures from wage inflation and other input costs will pressure margins, making further expansion from currently all-time high margins unlikely,\" writes David Kostin, Goldman Sachs' head U.S. equity strategist. \"As a result, growth in (earnings per share) will be driven entirely by top-line sales.\"That's already playing out so far this year. Goldman Sachs recently calculated that stocks it considers \"high revenue\" have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by 400 basis points already since the start of 2019.Here are seven growth stocks to buy, according to Goldman's expectations for high revenue expansion across the rest of 2019.END", "Back when Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) acquired LinkedIn in 2016, some may have thought that Microsoft overpaid. After all, LinkedIn wasn't generating much in the way of profits at the time and was only growing annual revenue in the low-20% range. That's certainly not poor expansion, but it was far below the rate of other high-growth tech stocks of the time.Fast forward to today, and Microsoft's LinkedIn acquisition looks to be a stroke of genius. Microsoft has not only been able to grow its user base, but it's also accelerated LinkedIn's revenue growth: Last quarter, LinkedIn improved revenue by 33%, 1000 basis points higher than its growth rate in its last quarter as an independent company.Not only has Microsoft improved LinkedIn, but LinkedIn also greatly enhances Microsoft's Dynamics 365 software business, a collection of applications that includes sales and marketing, enterprise resource planning, and human capital management software.Still, Microsoft is only in sixth place in the customer relationship management\u00a0(CRM) software space as of 2017.

This idea that companies can take on-premise software solutions, host them through the cloud and offer them in a subscription package to customers has been around for a while.But, just because the SaaS concept has been around for a while, that doesn't mean it's too late to jump on the SaaS bandwagon. Truth be told, SaaS stocks in the right industry are winning stocks. They are high-growth companies because they align with the secular pivot to cloud solutions, and they're high-margin companies, too, because the costs associated with delivering a cloud-hosted software service at scale are small. Plus, SaaS stocks are also supported by steady and predictable subscription revenue streams.Broadly speaking, then, SaaS stocks are often big growers with big margins and lots of revenue predictability.

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off.

This week's list includes AutoZone AZO , Costco COST and Adobe ADBE .Earnings Growth in a Slowing EconomyEarnings aren't the market's primary concern at present; the focus rather is on the evolving economic picture that is expected to decelerate from its recent pace. We are not seeing much evidence of this growth deceleration in recent economic data, the weaker than expected November jobs report notwithstanding, but the slowdown is expected to arrive over the coming months.The market is hoping that the Fed takes note of this evolving growth expectation and adjusts its monetary policy stance accordingly. Fed officials' public comments and media speculation suggest that the central bank may be leaning in that direction as well.So what's driving the slowdown? It's a combination of factors, ranging from the fading of the tax reform's impact and trade/tariff uncertainty to economic weakness abroad. While many in the market are starting to see the flattening yield curve and pockets of inversion as signs of something a lot more ominous on the horizon. The consensus view appears to be that the U.S. economy is putting the 2018 GDP growth pace of +3%-plus behind it, with the growth pace going forward in the +2%-plus range.END", "Adobe Systems Inc.ADBE is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 results on Nov 13.

It primarily indicates a company's capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. Liquid stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.END", "Investors tend to be drawn to hot technology and biotechnology stocks for their growth prospects - not for the cash they return to shareholders. But several well-known tech and biotech stocks could afford to invest in their businesses, buy back their shares and pay dividends, if only they chose to.When it comes to returning cash to shareholders, corporate management often prefers stock buybacks to dividends because it gives them flexibility. A company can adjust its share repurchases according to business and market conditions. A dividend is a commitment. The market often exacts severe and swift revenge if a company cuts or suspends its payout.The initiation of a dividend can also be taken as a sign that a company or stock's best days are behind it. A quick look at Apple's ( AAPL ) performance shows that's not necessarily the case. The company reinstated its dividend in 2012 after a 17-year hiatus. Between price appreciation and payouts, Apple stock has delivered a total return of about 170% since March 2012, when it announced plans to reinstate its dividend later that year - the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up about 130% over the same span, including dividends.The following five stocks don't yet offer dividends, but they should ... and could.

This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 19 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Adobe Systems Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $177.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $273.00. The standard deviation is $26.97.But the whole reason to look at the average ADBE price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ADBE crossing above that average target price of $236.95/share, investors in ADBE have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $236.95 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.3% return against the $150 commitment, or a 2.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADBE's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 21 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Adobe Systems Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $157.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $253.00. The standard deviation is $22.683.But the whole reason to look at the average ADBE price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ADBE crossing above that average target price of $208.52/share, investors in ADBE have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $208.52 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADBE options chain for the new October 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $200.00 strike price has a current bid of $15.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $200.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $184.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADBE, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $203.78/share today.Because the $200.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Steve Jobs had a no-dividend-ever policy while he was running Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , but after Apple's cash ballooned to over $100 billion after his death, the company began paying a dividend in 2012.Unfortunately for yield-only investors, much of the broader market gains over the last few years have come from these cash-hoarding tech companies.

The average 12-month price target for ADBE - averaging the work of 22 analysts - reveals an average price target of $179.45/share. That's a whopping -1.53% below where ADBE has been trading recently at $182.24/share. With this kind of downside potential (should ADBE fall to that price target), one might expect to see a high concentration of \"hold\" or even \"sell\" ratings on the stock. Yet, take a look at the bullishness:\n\n\n\nRecent ADBE Analyst Ratings Breakdown\n\nCurrent\n1 Month Ago\n2 Month Ago\n3 Month Ago\nStrong buy ratings:\n19\n17\n17\n15\nBuy ratings:\n0\n0\n1\n1\nHold ratings:\n4\n4\n4\n4\nSell ratings:\n0\n0\n0\n0\nStrong sell ratings:\n0\n0\n0\n0\nAverage rating:\n1.35\n1.38\n1.41\n1.45\n\n\nThe average rating presented in the last row of the table above is from 1 to 5, where 1 would be a consensus Strong Buy and 5 would be a consensus Strong Sell. In the middle, 3 would be a Hold. So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment. The average rating of 1.35 for ADBE leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the ADBE price target paints a different picture. Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at Adobe Systems Inc. Of course, the average price target is just that - a mathematical average, and is only one metric. There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $217.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $140.00. The standard deviation is $20.416.But the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes - much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close. And so with ADBE trading so far above that average target price of $179.45/share, the -1.53% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good \"signal\" to investors in ADBE to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Adobe Systems Inc.

Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 20 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Adobe Systems Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $112.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $195.00.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 858 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADBE options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $155.00 strike price has a current bid of $18.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $155.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $137.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADBE, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $157.62/share today.Because the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract .

Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.6% return against the $97.50 commitment, or a 2.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADBE's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $70 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.00. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.3% return against the $70 commitment, or a 2.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADBE's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $70 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.

So unless Adobe Systems Inc sees its shares fall 34.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $67.00 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.00 from $70), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.1% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Adobe Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $70 strike is located relative to that history:END", "Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel , one standout is the PowerShares QQQ (Symbol: QQQ) where we have detected an approximate $209.4 million dollar inflow -- that's a 0.5% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 353,700,000 to 355,400,000).

(Fiscal years end with November.) While the company continues to ramp up its portfolio of services and products acquisition, the strong growth in its organic business continues to boost revenues and profitability. In Q3, Adobe's revenues were near the higher end of its guidance range as the Company continued to report growth in its Cloud revenues, with Creative Cloud ( CC ) and Marketing at the forefront. Trefis expects that this trend continued in Q4 with strong growth in both CC and the Marketing cloud. However, Trefis believes that revenues from the LiveCycle and Connect business declined, while that of the Print and Publishing business remained flat during the quarter. Check out our complete analysis of AdobeOutlook For Q4 And 2016Adobe has guided for revenues of $1.55 billion to $1.60 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. It indicated that GAAP EPS would be in the range of $0.60 to $0.66, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.83 and $0.89. It expects CC net new subscriptions and Digital Media ARR to grow for the year to $4 billion. Furthermore, Adobe expects revenues from its digital marketing cloud to grow by 20% for the year 2016 and bookings to increase by 30%. The revenue guidance for FY2016 is $5.80-$5.85 billion, while GAAP EPS and Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2.12-2.18 and $2.94-3.00, respectively.Growth In Cloud Services To ContinueAccording to our estimates, the Creative Cloud ( CC ) division is the biggest of Adobe's operating segments and makes up 49% of its value. The CC division continues to witness strong growth in net subscriptions. Considering the addition of new users for CC in the last two-quarters, we expect the company to report $3.1 billion in average revenues run-rate ( ARR ) for this product family in 2016, which is approximately 50% higher than last year's level.Adobe's clients continue to adopt CC as the company continues to add more products to its portfolio. Furthermore, it continues to add functionality for mobile devices, which is increasing the popularity of CC amongst creative designers. While Trefis expects the subscriber base to grow, for the subscriber base to grow to the projected 9.1 million, the company will have to report the addition of at least 600,000 subscribers for Q4. Additionally, we expect that the growth in licensing can come from enterprise term licensing agreements (ETLA), as has been the trend over the past few quarters. However, as the company is improving its portfolio of services by adding products at lower price points, we expect the company to report a minor decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) during the quarter. Nevertheless, we believe that CC will continue to drive revenue over the next couple of years.Focus on Revenue Growth From New Marketing Cloud ProductsAdobe's cloud marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 28% of its value in our model. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. The company has scaled up the functionality and product offering of its marketing platform through both organic and inorganic means. In November, the company acquired TubeMogul, an ad tech company for buying and measuring video advertising company, for $540 million.The marketing cloud business has had a compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 50% over last five years. This platform provides a cost-effective portfolio of digital marketing solutions for companies that can manage marketing campaigns across different channels and devices. Gartner consistently ranks its products among the best solutions for digital marketing and customer relationship management ( CRM ). Additionally, it continues to explore the digital marketing space and add functionality, the most recent one being the TubeMogul's programmatic ad platform. Furthermore, the company is driving larger, multi-year and multi- solution customer contracts. As a result of larger engagements and longer implementation cycles, it is witnessing strong growth in deferred revenue and unbilled backlog for marketing division.We expect Adobe's marketing platform to continue to lead the digital marketing solutions market in the short term, on the back of new product releases, as it enjoys strong brand recognition. We also expect that as big data analytics, mobility, social media and cloud computing gain more traction across industries, this division will report incremental growth in revenues in Q4 and FY2016. Additionally, we expect the company to report growth in revenues from new verticals, especially from Primetime, a multi-screen TV platform that enables the dynamic placement of ads on over the top (OTT) live video feeds in Q4.We currently have a $104 price estimate for Adobe , which is inline with the current market price.Understand How a Company's Products Impact its Stock Price at TrefisView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis ResearchThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "END", "Adobe Systems Inc.ADBE is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Dec 15.

Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.5% return against the $75 commitment, or a 2.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADBE's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.

(Fiscal years end with November.) While the company delivered $1.39 billion in revenues in Q2, which is at the high-end of its targeted range of $1.35 billion to $1.40 billion, its non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.71 exceeded its guidance. That said, year-to-year revenue growth was 20.3%. Adobe's core cloud business continued to deliver results as cloud adoption remained robust across both its Creative Cloud offering and its marketing solutions. However, the growth rate for both division was slower than expected, indicating a minor slowdown in adoption.For Q3, we believe the growth trend in cloud adoption continued, which likely drove revenues for both the Creative cloud ( CC ) and marketing divisions. Nevertheless, we believe revenues from the LiveCycle and Connect business declined as that of the Print and Publishing business remained flat during the quarter. Check out our complete analysis of AdobeOutlook For 2016 and Q3Adobe has guided for revenues of $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. It indicated that GAAP EPS would be in the range of $0.46 to $0.52, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.69 and $0.75. Management expects CC net new subscriptions and Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue ( ARR ) to grow sequentially in Q3 and Q4. However, it expects the LiveCycle and Connect business and the print and publishing business to remain flat in Q3 2016. While the company is not giving guidance for its CC revenues, we expect that CC subscription to grow to 9 million paid CC individual and team subscriptions by the end of fiscal 2016.Growth In Cloud Services To ContinueAccording to our estimates, the Creative Cloud ( CC ) division is the biggest of Adobe's operating segments and makes up 49% of its value. Considering the addition of new users for CC in the last two-quarters, we expect the company to report $3 billion in average revenues run-rate ( ARR ) for this product family in 2016, which is approximately 50% higher than last year's level. Offsetting this to some degree will be a corresponding decline in packaged software sales, which includes point and suite licenses.Over the past year, Adobe's cloud subscription service has witnessed robust growth as clients have increasingly adopted these services to drive collaborative development efforts across their companies. The primary reason for this has been new additions to its Creative Cloud offering as the company added more features. For the subscriber base to grow to our projected 9 million, we estimate that it will have to report an addition of at least 500,000 subscribers for Q3, as this quarter is generally one of the strongest. Considering the trend in H1 (i.e., Q1 and Q2), we believe that this addition for Q3 is achievable. Additionally, we expect that the growth in licensing can come from enterprise term licensing agreements (ETLA), as has been the trend over the past few quarters. However, as the company is improving its portfolio of services by adding products at lower price points, we expect the company to report a minor decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) during the quarter. Nevertheless, we believe that CC will continue to drive revenue over the next couple of years.Focus on Revenue Growth From New Marketing Cloud ProductsAdobe's cloud marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 28% of its value in our model. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. The company has scaled up the functionality and product offering of its marketing platform through both organic and inorganic means. Having been built from the acquisition of Omniture, the business has had a compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 70% over last five years. This platform provides a cost-effective portfolio of digital marketing solutions for companies that can manage marketing campaigns across different channels and devices. Gartner consistently ranks its products among the best solutions for digital marketing and customer relationship management ( CRM ).We expect Adobe's marketing platform to continue to lead the digital marketing solutions market in the short term on the back of new product releases, as it enjoys strong brand recognition. In this earnings announcement, we expect the company to report growth in revenues from new verticals, especially from Primetime, a multi-screen TV platforma that enables the dynamic placement of ads on over the top (OTT) live video feeds. Additionally, since many of Adobe's digital marketing solutions leverage the growth in big data analytics, mobile devics and social media, we expect the company posted incremental revenues from these each of these sources in Q3.We currently have a $103.06 price estimate for Adobe , which is 4% above the current market price.Understand How a Company's Products Impact its Stock Price at TrefisView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis ResearchThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "On Wednesday, September 14th, Oracle (ORCL) will release its Q1 earnings results after the bell.

(Symbol: ADBE) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $97.65/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $72.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.95. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.5% return against the $72.50 commitment, or a 3.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADBE's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $72.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.

So unless Adobe Systems, Inc. sees its shares fall 25.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $68.55 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.95 from $72.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Adobe Systems, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $72.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $72.50 strike for the 3.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

Another earnings decline this coming earnings season would be the 5th quarter in a row for the S&P 500 index. This reflects not only the drag from the Energy sector and the U.S. dollar's strength, but also maturation of the current earnings cycle that got underway in the fall of 2009.One relatively encouraging sign that emerged out of the last earnings season was that estimates for the current period (June quarter) didn't fall as much as had been the pattern in the preceding quarters. What this means is that while estimates for the June quarter fell as companies reported Q1 results, but the magnitude of negative revisions was below other recent periods.

Rather than bouncing back from early losses, major market benchmarks instead gave up early gains this morning, eventually falling modestly by about a quarter of a percentage point. Ongoing worries about the Brexit vote continue to plague investor sentiment, but even after the European markets closed, trading in the U.S. seemed to reflect a general lack of certainty about the future direction of the economy and the financial markets more broadly. Even though major-market declines were small, some individual stocks lost a substantial amount of ground. Among the worst losers were Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) , Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE) , and HP (NYSE: HPQ) .Tesla Motors fell 10% after the company announced its intention to buy out residential solar giant SolarCity . The two companies are both led by Elon Musk, and many market participants pointed out the conflict of interest and corporate governance issues that the deal raises. The deal would give SolarCity shareholders between 12.2 and 13.1 shares of Tesla stock for every 100 shares of SolarCity stock they own, representing value of $26.50 to $28.50 per SolarCity stock based on where Tesla opened the day. Skeptics questioned the value of bringing the solar specialist under Tesla's corporate umbrella, fearing that having to divide its attention would distract Tesla from focusing on the launch of its Model 3 mass-market automobile.Adobe Systems lost 6% in the wake of its first-quarter financial report. The digital media and creative software specialist reported record revenue for the quarter, but even though earnings were better than most investors had expected, Adobe delivered an assessment of its future sales projections that many found troubling. Even though Adobe still believes that its top line should grow by nearly 20% in the current quarter from year-ago levels, the current earnings multiple that Adobe shares fetch reflects the belief that the company will be able to sustain even faster growth rates for a long time to come. Any news that suggests a slowdown sooner in the future hurts that thesis, and investors shouldn't expect a rebound unless the company can end up doing better than its initial guidance.Finally, HP dropped 5%. The company said on Tuesday that it expected a stronger profit for the current quarter than most investors had expected, but it announced a strategic shift in how it sells supplies related to its printers that created anxiety about future results. In particular, HP intends to reduce spending on incentive discounts to its distributors, instead preferring to boost marketing efforts to justify more premium pricing. Although some of those who follow the stock believe that the move will benefit HP in the long run, its immediate impact on free cash flow could put pressure on its financials for the next year or two. Moreover, some point to efforts to end discounts in other industries as having been counterproductive and eventually futile. In any event, HP will have to prove to investors that its strategy will pan out for those who are patient enough to see it through.END", "Top Tech StocksMSFT -0.14%AAPL -0.28%IBM -0.69%CSCO -0.09%GOOG +0.34%Technology stocks were edging lower Wednesday, with shares of tech companies in the S&P 500 slipping about 0.2% today.In company news, Aviat Networks Inc.

The CEO of the premier electric car and lithium-ion battery manufacturer and Chairman of U.S. residential solar power firm plans to bring SolarCity under the Tesla umbrella. Immediate react among investors was not good at Tesla, which fell 10 percent, but great for SolarCity, which shot up 20 percent.In recent quarters, though Tesla has presented many big questions for investors, it has been the far stronger growth play; SCTY found itself floundering last quarter, partly based on its highly competitive industry, which has made better inroads in China than the U.S. lately. For Musk, it's pretty easy to see the synergies, both with the two businesses and his investment in both firms, which, combines, would give Musk a 40+ percent stake in the combined company.Musk is not likely to be thrown by a near-term hit to Tesla stock ; he's lived through these things before. What remains to be spelled out is whether these synergies presented in merging SolarCity with the Tesla green-energy keystone will kickstart the company into leadership roles in both EVs and clean energy to households, and whether those businesses can help exellerate the forward U.S. growth story.If this was merely a play to salvage what was left of Musk's flagging solar enterprise, then this will probably reflect negatively on the first quarterly report to include SolarCity, whether it be when the company reports next month or beyond. That said, even in this tempestuous presidential election season we are not hearing much anti-green energy sentiment, which may mean all of Wall Street is now fully on-board with the industry, indicating more widespread growth down the road.END", " InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdobe Systems Incorporated ( ADBE )  just reported earnings, sending shares of ADBE down nearly 5% in aftermarket trading.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $67.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.15. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.2% return against the $67.50 commitment, or a 3.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADBE's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $67.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.

So unless Adobe Systems, Inc. sees its shares fall 28.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $63.35 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.15 from $67.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Adobe Systems, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $67.50 strike is located relative to that history:END", "Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define.

The ROE is useful for comparing the profitability of a company to that of other companies in the same industry.\n\n\n\nTicker\nCompany\nROE (%)\nADBE\nAdobe\n11.71\nMSFT\nMicrosoft Corporation\n13.70\nAAPL\nApple Inc.\n42.94\n\nIndustry Median\n6.21\n\n\nThe company has a current ROE of 11.71%, which is higher than the sector peers. In general, analysts consider ROE ratios in the 15% to 20% range as representing attractive levels for investment. For investors looking at those levels or more, Microsoft ( MSFT ) or Apple ( AAPL ) could be good options. It is critical to understand this metric before investing, and it is important to look at the trend in ROE over time. \n\n\n\nRegarding valuation, the stock sells at a trailing P/E of 60.2x, trading at a premium compared to a median of 24.4x for the industry.

As you recall, during that time Baupost was openly active and buying assets when most funds were overly pessimistic about the environment. While I certainly recommend you to go through the whole interview, one of the most interesting comments stemmed from the question: How do you decide when to sell something?\"We never hold on for the last nickel. I think you do a big mistake when you do that. First of all, we never assume something will go past its fair value. A lot of times people will fall in love with something and buy stock at 10 and think it's worth 20, but it's acting so well when it hits 20, that they hold on until 25 and it's no longer value at all. Not that you shouldn't re-assess if you decide it really has added-value, that this is better than I thought, that retained earnings bring the value higher, that's ok, but to just go along with it because it acts well is irresponsible.\"Warning!

It is true that as investors, we tend to get the best (or worst) out of our emotions. We suffer from anchoring bias, which is sticking to our intrinsic value calculation and refusing to sell until it is realized. In another part of the interview, Klarman mentions that valuations are so subjective and dependent of variables that the best way to go about them is to find an adequate range of values.Once we figure out the range of according values, we should stick to those and start selling, no matter the price of the stock. This will also improve our discipline in investing only when the margin of safety is big enough to make a profit even at the low part of the range.As the saying by John Maynard Keynes goes, \"As the facts change, I change my mind.\" It is very important to re-calculate intrinsic value when new information comes out. Intrinsic value is rarely affected in a drastic way over the course of a few months, but, nevertheless, it is something that we should keep an eye on.As Phillip Fisher said, quibbling over eights and quarters is a sure way to lose money. Learning from great investors as Klarman, we can avoid leaving money at the table as we avoid getting fearful or greedy.What do you think?Read More: END", "END", "END", "As technology advances, new companies and industries rise up, offering unique solutions, services, and products.

Perhaps pre-market traders this morning are thinking we may be seeing a counter-offer from Marriott, but it's too early to say at this point.Crude oil prices swept past the (nowadays) psychologically satisfying $40 per barrel to $42 and change. We never really did see a boost in consumer spending when oil prices fell to below $30 just a few weeks ago, but we are certainly seeing immediate economic strength in the market now that oil prices are up again.

(Symbol: ADBE) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $88.96/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $60 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.8% return against the $60 commitment, or a 2.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADBE's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $60 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. ( Do options carry counterparty risk? This and six other common options myths debunked ). So unless Adobe Systems, Inc. sees its shares fall 32.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $56.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.50 from $60), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.9% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Adobe Systems, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $60 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $60 strike for the 2.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Adobe Systems, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $88.96) to be 24%.

Let's discuss three major reasons why iPad Pros won't render PCs obsolete.1. Affordability Apple has made solid progress in the enterprise market. iOS devices accounted for 64% of all mobile enterprise device activations during the second quarter, according to Good Technology's Mobility Index Report. However, that actually represents a decline from 72% a year earlier. During that same period, Android activations rose from 26% to 32%, and Windows' mobile enterprise share rose from 4% to 11%.The decline of iOS can likely be attributed to the higher price of iOS devices, Android Lollipop's new enterprise features, and Microsoft's introduction of cross-platform Windows features. As I previously noted , the price gap between iPad Pros and Windows PCs could prevent it from dominating the enterprise market. The 32 GB version of the iPad Pro costs $799. The Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, respectively, cost an additional $99 and $169.

( ORCL ) is continuing its trigger-happy acquisition strategy with the purchase of Maxymiser, a marketing cloud company, for an undisclosed sum. Maxymiser is a leading Cloud software that enables advertisers to optimize ad content placed in individual browsers so as to maximize user engagement. Being a relatively late entrant to the cloud computing market, Oracle opted to augment organic development through a lengthy series of acquisitions to fuel growth. Consequently, it has been using a large portion of its annual cash flow for acquiring private cloud computing companies over the last three years. Now, with the acquisition of Maxymiser, Oracle hopes to catch up to marketing cloud leader Adobe ( ADBE ).Our price estimate of $42 for Oracle Corp. is nearly 20% higher than its current market price.See our complete analysis for Oracle Corp. hereAcquisitions Not at Odds With Shareholders' ValueBetween fiscal 2013 and 2015, Oracle spent over $7 billion in acquisitions, almost all of which was in cash. To put it in perspective, the amount Oracle spent on acquisitions forms over 15% of its cumulative cash flow from operations over the three fiscal years. The company has not disclosed whether these acquisitions, or any part thereof, were funded by debt. Nevertheless, Oracle's Debt-to-EBITDA ratio has increased from 1.1x in fiscal 2013 to fiscal 1.8x in 2015.To be fair, Oracle cannot be accused of ignoring shareholder value to fund its acquisition spree. Over the same period of three years, Oracle has returned a cumulative $35 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which is a truly bountiful 80% of its cash flow from operations. Therefore, Oracle's use of cash for its acquisitions may be said to be judicious as far as returns to shareholders are concerned.Faster Integration of Acquired Companies Key to Gaining GroundWhether Oracle's acquisitions are value-accretive depends upon the purchase price and their successful integration with Oracle's broader product portfolio. The company did not disclose the purchase price for acquiring Maxymiser. The latter is estimated to have annual revenues of $30 million, so the price is likely to be insignificant. The acquisition thus seems like a technology \"tuck-in\" intended to firm Oracle's broader offering. Thus in this case, the success or failure of the acquisition will depend upon rapid integration of Maxymiser's capabilities in Oracle's Marketing Cloud offerings. Oracle has been accused of slow integration of its acquisitions in the past, which could widen the gap against rivals like Adobe and Salesforce.com ( CRM ).Even as Oracle struggles to catch up in the cloud computing market, its competitors are already moving on to the next big thing. (Read: Salesforce Eyeing Expansion Into Industry Verticals as Q2 Revenues Beat Expectations) The Marketing Cloud market is estimated to be worth $10 billion and certainly has significant untapped potential. But in the long run, we believe that Oracle needs to return to paving the way as it did in the Database software industry in the past, rather than following the herd in the cloud computing industry.Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis ResearchThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "On Tuesday, Robert W.

We count these companies, which includes such major players like Adobe ( ADBE ), Nike ( NKE ) and FedEx ( FDX ), as part of our Q2 tally. By the time Alcoa ( AA ) reports on July 8th, we will have seen Q2 results from about two dozen S&P members that have fiscal quarters ending in May.Estimates for the current period have come down quite a bit since the quarter got underway. This decrease is in-line with the trend that we have been seeing quarter after quarter for more than two years now. The chart below shows what has happened to 2015 Q2 earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies since the start of the year.As was the case in Q1, the Energy sector remains the biggest drag on Q2 estimates. Total Energy sector earnings are expected to be down -65.1% from the same period last year on -40.6% lower revenues. If we exclude the Energy sector from Q2 estimates, total earnings for the S&P 500 index would be barely in the positive territory (up +0.3%).

But the fixation with 'patience' notwithstanding, changes to the committee's growth projections will likely be an even bigger indicator of its course of action than any wording change(s) to the statement.The FOMC expected inflation to be in the 1% to 1.6% this year and 1.7% to 2% next year. With respect to GDP growth, the committee projected the U.S. economy to be bound by a 3% growth pace at the top end for both this year and next, with the low end of the growth band at 2.6% this year and 2.5% next year. The committee's downgrade of these projections will likely show a delayed rate hike even if the language change in the post-meeting statement is pointing towards a June timeline for a rates liftoff.The June timeline has emerged as credible following the labor market gains of the last couple of months, but recent market action indicates that investors still appear willing to interpret bad-news-as-good-news. This seems like the only logical explanation for the market's strong gains in recent days following soft economic readings. I suspect that a downgrade to the committee's growth and inflation projections will likely get interpreted in a similar way.In corporate news, the 2015 Q1 earnings season gets underway with the Oracle ( ORCL ) and Adobe ( ADBE ) earnings reports after the close today.

Oracle's margins shrank in the quarter, which is likely something the company will address in its upcoming conference call. That said, ORCL stock is up about 1 percent in after-market trading.Conversely, Adobe has typically performed well over the past year, posting an average quarterly positive earnings surprise of more than 28 percent until today's meet on the bottom line.

However, Android still isn't considered a serious enterprise platform for companies due to concerns about security and fragmentation. That's why many businesses stubbornly stuck with BlackBerry devices in the past.However, many companies now realize that they can cut costs by letting employees store company data on their personal smartphones instead. This paradigm shift, known as the BYOD (bring your own device) movement, is a boon for Google and Apple and a bane for BlackBerry, which now controls less than 1% of the global smartphone market.To address security concerns, Google added a new \"Work Profile\" to Android 5.0 Lollipop, which split business and personal data into two separate accounts.

We expect the company to record customer growth in both domestic as well as overseas markets in the fourth quarter on the back of its product portfolio.Moreover, the increase in construction and manufacturing activities in the emerging markets present growth opportunities, going ahead. Additionally, low channel inventory, increasing efficiencies through its channel partner framework, simplified upgrade pricing mechanism and electronic software delivery will positively affect the to-be-reported quarter results.However, Autodesk's uneven top-line growth in the recent past increased its dependence on cost saving programs to boost earnings.

Evolving Fed expectations and the foreign exchange market movements have been adding to the stock market volatility.The Euro's exchange value appears to be stable in today's European session after falling a record low of under $1.05 on Wednesday, down from around $1.39 a year back. The divergent paths for monetary policy remains the primary driver of this exchange rate movement. The European Central Bank has just gotten going with its bond-purchase program, which has pushed short-term government bond yields in the region into negative territory. And it's not just German and French yields that have reached record-low levels - even distressed credits like Spain and Italy are at record-low levels.The picture is totally different this side of the pond, with the Fed getting ready to normalize monetary policy after keeping it extraordinarily easy and loose for many years. The question that market participants have been grappling with lately is whether they will start raising rates in June or in September. Many had earlier expected the Fed to be in no hurry to start the rate hike process and didn't expect the first rate increase before September. But they had to revise their position following the strong February jobs report, with the labor market strength prompting many to expect the Fed to start tightening sooner rather than later.It is in this context that Thursday's soft Retail Sales reading raised the hopes of some that the June rate hike scenario may not be such a slam dunk after all.

This also replaces Adobe's similar now-exhausted $2 billion repurchase program, which was unveiled in early 2012 and designed to run through the end of fiscal 2015.

(Symbol: ADBE) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $71.76/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2016 put at the $60 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.05. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.1% return against the $60 commitment, or a 5.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADBE's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $60 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. ( Do options carry counterparty risk? This and six other common options myths debunked ). So unless Adobe Systems, Inc. sees its shares fall 16.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $56.95 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.05 from $60), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5.2% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Adobe Systems, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $60 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2016 put at the $60 strike for the 5.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

And no, I'm not talking about Google Chrome, even though it did overtake Internet Explorer earlier this year for the first time as the United States' most popular Web browser.Instead, according to a report from ZDNet, Microsoft Corporation is readying its own replacement for its flagship browser starting with Windows 10. Codenamed \"Spartan,\" ZDNet's sources say the new browser definitely isn't just the next build of IE. Rather, Spartan is being built as a revamped, lightweight, extension-enabled browser that happens to sport a more similar look and feel to both Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. And while IE 11 might temporarily be available for backward compatibility purposes in Windows 10, more than anything it sounds like Spartan could end up being everything IE isn't -- or at least everything frustrated IE users have grown to believe it isn't.The question of rebranding or renaming Internet Explorer arose back in August, when a group of engineers from Microsoft's IE team decided to tackle a Reddit AMA (\"Ask Me Anything\") forum. One Microsoft engineer responded that the topic had been discussed internally, and then elaborated, \"Plenty of ideas get kicked around about how we can separate ourselves from negative perceptions that no longer reflect our product today.\"But why did Microsoft choose the complete replacement route?

We expect its broad product portfolio to generate new customers in both domestic as well as overseas markets.Moreover, the increase in construction and manufacturing activities in the emerging markets present further growth opportunities. Additionally, a low channel inventory, increasing efficiencies through its channel partner framework, simplified upgrade pricing mechanism and electronic software delivery will help it to achieve long-term growth targets.Autodesk's uneven top-line growth in the recent past has made it over-dependent on cost saving programs to boost earnings. Although restructuring programs are corrective measures to realign cost, their success often depends on execution. We believe that there is a certain limit up to which costs can be curtailed; the company needs to invest to boost organic growth.END", "Splunk may not be the most familiar candidate for your portfolio just yet, but make no mistake: The operational intelligence specialist continues to become more indispensable to its clients by the day.Having first shipped its software in 2006, Splunk already counts more than two-thirds of the Fortune 100 among its 7,900+ customer base, 500 of which were added last quarter.

Both phones sport larger screen sizes -- the iPhone 6's display measures 4.7 inches, while the iPhone 6 Plus is officially phablet-sized with its 5.5 inch retina screen.It wasn't that long ago Apple CEO Tim Cook went on record stating he had no intention of going down the phablet path. Thankfully for iFans, that's changed, and it appears Cook's about-face was a sound business decision for investors. How many of the 10 million units sold the first weekend were of the phablet variety we can only speculate, but based on lead times -- how long, on average, it's taking Apple to fill orders -- the company's phablet is a rousing success. Though challenges remain, look no further than industry-leading Samsung , according to new research from Adobe , Apple can expect the iPhone 6 Plus to continue flying off the shelves.The good news Though it hasn't happened as quickly as some industry pundits expected, the market for phablets is expected to explode.

The company's transition to a subscription-only business model is making progress, with recurring revenue now making up the bulk of the company's total revenue. Here are five things that management said during the company's conference call that shed some additional light on the state of the business.Creative Cloud is growing fast Adobe is best known for its creative software products, including Photoshop and Illustrator, and traditionally they've been sold as one-time perpetual licenses, either separately or as part of the Creative Suite. This ended with Creative Suite 6, and going forward Adobe will only sell new versions of its creative software as part of the Creative Cloud, a subscription product that carries a monthly fee.Adobe is working on transitioning existing Creative Suite customers to the Creative Cloud, and the result has been extremely rapid growth in the number of subscribers. This has been counteracted by a decline in one-time license sales, but the progress so far is impressive. CEO Shantanu Narayen gave a rundown of the numbers:END", "Adobe ( ADBE ) posted its Q3 results (fiscal years ending with November) Tuesday, September 16. The market reacted negatively to the results as growth in company's revenue failed to live upto its expectations. While the company delivered $1.005 billion in revenue, just $10 million below consensus but enough of a miss to send the shares down about 5%. That said, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28 exceeded both its guidance and market expectation. However, the company once again reported faster-than-expected adoption of subscription licenses for its Creative Cloud (CC) business, as more of its clients chose annual subscription plans. The company reported over 2.8 million paid subscribers for the CC services, a sizable increase of 500,000 over the previous quarter. This generated nearly $1.4 billion in Annualized Recurring Revenue ( ARR ) in the quarter. The company said that revenue from creative division suffered as the company phased out sale of sales of the perpetual Creative Suite 6 license in Q2. Adobe continued to witness significant growth in its marketing cloud initiatives during the quarter as revenues grew by 14% year over year to $290.1 million. However, revenues from the LiveCycle software business (relatively small) declined by 18%, and printing and publishing were flat. We examine some of Adobe's key drivers below and its outlook for Q4 2014. Check out our complete analysis of AdobeOutlook For Q4Adobe has guided for revenues of $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. It indicated GAAP EPS would be in the range of $0.05 to $0.11, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.26 and $0.32.Adoption of cloud services continued to remain strong and the company expects to have nearly 3.3 million paid CC individual and team subscriptions by the end of fiscal 2014. (Fiscal years end with November.) According to our calculations, this means it will need to add over 38,100 paid users per week in the final quarter of FY2014. The company has also disclosed that it expects to end the year with over $2.5 billion of digital media revenue at a growth rate of 20% year over year. Furthermore, Adobe expects revenues from its digital marketing cloud to grow by a 25% rate for the 2014 to 2016 period. However, it expects the LiveCycle and Connect business to decline further, while the print and publishing business is expected to remain flat in 2014.Strong CC Subscription Buoys Revenues, But CS6 Phase Out Impacts GrowthDigital Media division, which maps onto out CC division and Acrobat Family division, reported that its revenues declined by 2.5% year over year to $621.4 million during the quarter. The overall revenues were negatively impacted as the company phased out sales of perpetual licenses of Creative Suite 6, despite the strong growth in CC revenues.According to our estimates, the Creative Cloud division is the biggest of Adobe's operating segments and makes up approximately 58% of its value. During the quarter, the company added 500,000 new subscribers and 96% of the creative cloud subscribers have signed up for annual contracts. Additionally, the growth in licensing came from enterprise term licensing agreements (ETLA), which usually have a tenure of three years. This indicates that CC will continue to drive revenue over the next couple of years. The revenue from CC increased by over 17% sequentially to $1.4 billion in ARR (resolved above) and the subscriber base grew to 2.81 million. Considering the pace of CC adoption, we now expect the company to add over 3.3 million CC subscribers by the end of 2014.Strong Adoption of Marketing Platform Boosts RevenuesAdobe's cloud marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 21% of its value. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. Adobe continued to witness strong growth in its marketing cloud services and revenues grew by 17% year over year to $290 million. Additionally, the revenue run rate exceeded $1.4 billion in annual revenue. We expect that as big data analytics, mobility, social media and cloud computing gain more traction across industries, this division will report incremental growth in revenues as it has a portfolio of analytical tools that deal with marketing on social media and mobile devices.

But at its core, this discussion is actually about handicapping the timing of the Fed's first interest rate hike, which will be the next monetary policy move after the QE program comes to an end next month. Investors perceive 'considerable time' to mean about 6 months, though the Fed have never defined it in those terms, Janet Yellen's off-hand response in one of her previous press interactions to that effect notwithstanding.Not to get too hung up on just one phrase, but removal of 'considerable time' in today's statement would signal to the markets that the countdown had started. This could also help Chairwoman Yellen come out with a consensus statement this afternoon, as removal of this phrase will 'pacify' the hawkish Philly Fed President Charles Plosser and the dissident Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher. The doves will likely point to the complete absence of pricing pressures, as this morning's tame CPI shows, and continued labor market slack in the economy.But they could presumably be 'won over' by reiteration of data dependency in the statement and the press event.

The company is betting big on the cloud, moving to a subscription-only business model for both its dominant creative software and its digital marketing products, and investors so far have clearly been supporting this move. But with competitors like Corel Corporation attempting to take advantage of Adobe's shunning of perpetual licenses, and with Salesforce making big acquisitions in order to break into digital marketing, is now the time to buy Adobe stock?Plenty of competition Adobe's main business is its suite of creative software products, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. These products have become industry standards, and because of this, Adobe has been able to achieve operating margins in excess of 20% over the past decade. But with the company no longer offering traditional perpetual software licenses for new versions of its products, instead pushing customers toward subscriptions, this opens up a window for competitors.Corel Corporation, a privately held company based in Ottawa, is one such competitor. The company's CorelDRAW product is a direct competitor to Adobe's Illustrator, and by continuing to offer perpetual licenses in addition to subscription options, Adobe customers who tend to upgrade infrequently could be drawn to Corel's offering.During fiscal 2013, Adobe's revenue from its digital media segment, which contains its creative products, declined by 15% as perpetual license sales decreased and subscription sales increased. This isn't surprising, given that it takes a few years before total revenue from the subscription product matches that of a perpetual license, so there's no reason to worry just yet. But over the next few years, as the transition continues, it will become clear if Adobe is losing market share, or if going subscription-only was the right move.END", "Thriving WiFi networks throughout the U.S. has become a major concern for large wireless operators.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided during its two-day policy meeting to remain committed to its low-interest rates. The central bank allayed fears of near-term rate hikes but tweaked target interest rate forecasts. Reportedly, the Fed expects interest rates at the end of 2015 to approach 1.25%, up from March's projection of 1.0%. The 'dot plot' also notes that the key rate is likely to increase to roughly 2.5% at the end of 2016, up from prior projection of 2.25%. However, the longer term rate forecast is now down to 3.75% from about 4%.END", "Adobe Systems Inc. ( ADBE ) was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise by over 8% on the day.

Weakness associated with escalating tensions in Iraq following the attempt by Iraqi insurgents to take control of the country's largest oil refinery was offset by the minutes from the Bank of England.

The market isn't expecting any surprises from the Fed this afternoon and the FOMC will try its best not to disappoint on that front.Taper has effectively become a non-event, with the Fed expected to stay on course and announce another $10 billion cut to the pace of its bond purchases today. With benchmark treasury yields lower now compared to the start of the year or where they went immediately after the start of Taper talk a year ago, the smooth QE unwind has to be termed a success. The performance is particularly impressive given the passing of leadership baton from Bernanke to Yellen while the QE Taper was getting underway.But many suspect that the lower yields are less a function of Fed effectiveness and more a result of the bond market's skepticism of the consensus growth outlook. The FOMC members and the stock market believe that the U.S. economy was pulled down by temporary forces in the first quarter and remains on track for a sustainable above-trend growth in the current and the coming quarters. To that end, it will be instructive to see the FOMC members' GDP growth projections this afternoon. With Q1 GDP growth expected to get revised down even further, FOMC members will likely lower their projections for this year from the March level of +2.8% to +3%.The key issue for the market with respect to Fed policy is to handicap when they will start raising short-term interest rates from the current level. The consensus view anchored by FOMC projections is for a mid-2015 timeframe. But the Fed's hand could be forced by developments on the inflation front, as Tuesday's hot-looking May CPI showed. It will be interesting to see how Janet Yellen characterizes the inflation question in her comments this afternoon, but a higher path for inflation along the lines of what we saw yesterday will have a direct bearing on market expectations.END", "Adobe Systems Inc.

It seems that after four years, the most (if not the only ) consistent feature of this bull market remains the mind-boggling inconsistency of the economic data it generates.While economists and market prognosticators typically weigh in during earnings season about what the trends mean for the market, there seems to be a trend emerging, this time around, in the most important off-season earnings reports: they're good . We may be at the absolute low-water mark in the three-month cycle, in terms of the number of earnings reports being released each week, but there have recently been a few exciting reports from important companies.Consider H&R Block's ( HRB ) earnings report from last Wednesday. The $9.1 billion tax company's fiscal fourth quarter ends in April, which is, of course, the most important month for the company. The company's earnings for the quarter beat the Street's guess by only a penny, but revenue surged, climbing 16% over the year-ago quarter, and beating the Street's guess handily in the process. The trend which seems to have emerged (over the last 25 years or so) is that tax software continues to improve, but never fast enough to catch up to the increasingly complex tax code. Thus, it seems, the need for professional tax preparation services will always be with us.Just this morning (Wednesday), Adobe ( ADBE ) reported second quarter earnings of $0.23 per share, beating the Street's guess by a full $0.07, or 43%. The Street has been watching Adobe carefully since last year, when the company decided to forgo traditional software sales for a cloud services / licensing model. Since, in the broader sense, the whole software industry is moving in this direction, Adobe's big earnings win should be seen as very important good news. ADBE stock is currently up 8% on the day.Finally, there is FedEx ( FDX ), which also reported this Wednesday morning. FDX stock has been flat so far this year, but that may be about to change, as the company's revenue was up, its expenses were down, it raised its dividend by 33%, and beat the Street's Earnings Per Share guess of $2.36 by a full dime. The company's CEO, Fred Smith, had this to say: \"An outstanding fourth quarter helped FedEx post solid results for fiscal 2014, and we believe we are well positioned for a strong fiscal 2015.\" FDX stock is up 4.6% today.That's just three companies, to be sure, but each, in its own way, speaks not only for itself, but for the overall economy. Of the disparity of economic indicators, I won't try to make any sense of it except to say that these paradoxes have been with us since the bull market began. Perhaps paradox is itself, a bullish indicator.Is that Silly? Yes. Is it said with tongue in cheek? Yes.

In Q1, even as its cloud subscription services gained traction, its revenues and profits fell due to the shift in focus from a perpetual licensing model to subscription and service licensing. In this earnings announcement, we expect the growth trend in cloud adoption to continue, which will drive revenues for Creative cloud and Acrobat family divisions. Furthermore, we expect Adobe's marketing cloud division to report yet another quarter of growth, buoyed by adoption of its marketing platform. However, we expect the revenues from LiveCycle and Connect business to decline, and the Print and Publishing business to remain flat during the quarter. Check out our complete analysis of AdobeOutlook For Q2 FY14 And BeyondAdobe has guided for revenues of $1.00 billion to $1.05 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. It indicated GAAP EPS would be in the range of $0.06 to $0.12, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.26 and $0.32.Adobe expects to have nearly 3 million paid CC individual and team subscriptions by the end of fiscal 2014. According to our calculations, this means it will need to add over 30,000 paid users per week in 2014, 40% more than the 2013 weekly subscription rate of 21,000. This would give the company total annual recurring revenue of approximately $1.6 billion from CC. The company has also disclosed that it expects to end the year with over $2.5 billion of digital media revenue at a growth rate of 20% year over year. Furthermore, Adobe expects revenues from its digital marketing cloud to grow by 20% year over year. However, it expects the LiveCycle and Connect business to decline further, while the print and publishing business is expected to remain flat in 2014.Growth In Cloud Services To ContinueAccording to our estimates, the Creative Cloud division is the biggest of Adobe's operating segments and makes up approximately 55% of its value. While this segment generated only $480 million in revenues in 2013, we expect the company to report $1.17 billion in revenues for 2014, which roughly translates into annual recurring revenues of approximately $1.65 billion.Over the past year, Adobe's cloud subscription service has witnessed robust growth as clients have increasingly adopted these services to drive collaborative development efforts across their companies. While we expect that the share of revenue from Creative Cloud (CC) will continue to grow in Q2 2014, its adoption will continue to negatively impact the revenues and profitability as use of subscription service is generally spread over the period of the software's use. In Q1, the company added 405,000 new subscribers, and 96% of the creative cloud subscribers have signed up for annual contracts. Additionally, the growth in licensing came from enterprise term licensing agreements (ETLA), which usually have tenure of three years. We expect this trend to continue in Q2 and estimate that the company is well underway to add 3 million subscribers in 2014. Therefore, we believe that the company will continue to report traction for its cloud services in this earnings announcement.Revenues From Marketing Cloud To GrowAdobe's cloud marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 21% of its value. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. The company has scaled up the functionality and product offering of its marketing platform through organic and inorganic growth. We believe that this platform provides a cost effective digital marketing solution for companies that can manage marketing campaigns across different channels and devices.Adobe is aiming to increase its revenues from cloud based marketing solutions by expanding in new geographies and verticals. We expect that, as Adobe continues to develop its marketing solutions capabilities, this division will emerge as an important driver for revenue growth. In this earnings announcement, we expect the company to report growth in revenues from new geographies. Additionally, since many of Adobe's digital marketing solutions cater to the growing big data analytics, mobility and social media industries, we expect the company to post incremental revenues across these industries. Adobe expects new bookings to grow at a 30% CAGR, and revenues to grow at a 20% CAGR by 2016. However, we project revenues from its digital marketing division to reach $3 billion by 2020.To read more about our view on Adobe's digital marketing division, see here .Acrobat Family Division Revenues In FocusAdobe Acrobat family is the third largest division at Adobe and makes up 11% of its value. In the past few quarters, revenues from this division have been on a decline, primarily due to launch of document cloud services that have subscription fees spread over the period of usage. The company has amassed over 1.6 million subscribers for document cloud service. We expect this trend to continue in Q2, and forecast the subscriber base to grow to 2.2 million in 2014. Additionally, we continue to closely monitor the growth in Enterprise Term Licensing Agreements (ETLAs), adoption of online document services, EchoSign (an electronic content management system) as these have been instrumental in bringing new business to this division.We currently have a $51 price estimate for Adobe , which is around 22% below the current market price.See More at Trefis | View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis) | Get Trefis TechnologyThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "Adobe Systems Inc.

The steep pricing of Xbox One may have discouraged casual gamers thus affecting Microsoft's gaming market share.Microsoft has always been very competitive and in the current environment, where competitors like Sony are far ahead in the gaming console market, it is natural that Microsoft would take some aggressive step.

Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist.

In the earnings announcement, the company once again reported faster-than-expected adoption of subscription licenses for its Creative Cloud (CC) business, as more of its clients chose annual subscription plans. The company reported over 1.8 million paid subscribers for the CC services, a sizable increase of 405,000 over the previous quarter. This generated nearly a billion dollars in annualized recurring revenue ( ARR ) in the quarter, and for the first time the cloud subscription revenue exceeded the revenue from perpetual license sales. Adobe also witnessed significant growth in its marketing cloud initiatives during the quarter as revenues grew by 24% year over year to $267 million. However, its LiveCycle software and print and publishing businesses (all relatively small) declined by 10% and 14% respectively.The company reported diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) of $0.09 on a GAAP-basis and $0.30 on a non-GAAP basis. However, the revenues were flat year on year at $1 billion, which is at the high end of its targeted range of $950 million to $1.0 billion. We examine some of Adobe's key drivers below and its outlook for 2014. Check out our complete analysis of AdobeOutlook For Q2 FY14 And BeyondAdobe has guided for revenues of $1.00 billion to $1.05 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. It indicated GAAP EPS would be in the range of $0.06 to $0.12, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.26 and $0.32.Adobe expects to have nearly 3 million paid CC individual and team subscriptions by the end of fiscal 2014. According to our calculations, this means it will need to add over 30,000 paid users per week in 2014, 40% more than the 2013 weekly subscription rate of 21,000. This would give the company total annual recurring revenue of approximately $1.6 billion from CC. The company has also disclosed that it expects to end the year with over $2.5 billion of digital media revenue at a growth rate of 20% year over year. Furthermore, Adobe expects revenues from its digital marketing cloud to grow by 20% year over year. However, it expects the LiveCycle and Connect business to decline further, while the print and publishing business is expected to remain flat in 2014.Strong subscription Buoys Creative Cloud DivisionAccording to our estimates, the Creative Cloud division is the biggest of Adobe's operating segments and makes up approximately 55% of its value. During the quarter, the company added 405,000 new subscribers, and 96% of the creative cloud subscribers have signed up for annual contracts. Additionally, the growth in licensing came from enterprise term licensing agreements (ETLA), which usually have tenure of three years. This indicates that CC will continue to drive revenue over the next couple of years. The revenue from CC increased by over 28% sequentially to $987 million ARR, and subscriber base grew to 1.844 million. The company added 31,153 new subscribers per week in Q1. We expect the company to maintain this subscription rate for 2014 and add 3 million CC subscribers by the end of 2014.Strong Adoption of Marketing Platform Boosts RevenuesAdobe's cloud marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 21% of its value. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. This build up started in 2009 with the acquisition of Ominiture. Since, the company has scaled up the functionality and product offering of its marketing platform, through organic and inorganic growth.During the quarter, Adobe witnessed strong growth in its marketing cloud services. In Q1, this division reported a 24% year-over-year increase in revenue to $267 million and the revenue run rate exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue. We expect that as big data analytics, mobility, social media and cloud computing gain more traction across industries, this division will report incremental growth in revenues as it has a portfolio of analytical tools that deal with marketing on social media and mobile devices. Adobe expects new bookings to grow at a 30% CAGR, and revenues to grow at a 20% CAGR by 2016. While this division contributed 20% to Adobe's total revenues in 2013, we expect it to increase to 24% by 2020.Adoption of EchoSign and Document Cloud Services Buoys Revenues At Acrobat FamilyDivisionAdobe Acrobat family is the third largest division at Adobe and makes up 11% of its value. In the past few quarters, revenues from this division have been on a decline, primarily due to launch of document cloud services that have subscription fee spread over the period of usage. However, due to strong adoption of online document services, EchoSign (An electronic content management system) and growth in Enterprise Term Licensing Agreements (ETLAs) for Acrobat, the company witnessed 14% growth in Acrobat ARR. We expect document services' ARR to drive revenue growth in the Acrobat family division in the future.We currently have a $51 price estimate for Adobe , which is around 25% below the current market price.See More at Trefis | View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel , one standout is the Proshares Ultra S&P500 (Symbol: SSO) where we have detected an approximate $15.7 million dollar outflow -- that's a 0.5% decrease week over week (from 30,750,000 to 30,600,000).

The weak start to the Q1 earnings season with underwhelming reports from FedEx ( FDX ), Oracle ( ORCL ) and General Mills ( GIS ) will also attract some attention.We will get three things at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting this afternoon - the official statement, the committee's economic projections and the Chairwoman's press conference. No major surprises are expected on the Taper question or the projections, though given the recent downtrend in the unemployment rate, the committee's projections for year-end 2014 and 2015 will likely come down to match private-sector consensus expectations. All indications are that they will continue with the recent $10 billion reduction pace on the Taper front.The only major question is whether the FOMC will change the unemployment threshold for its forward guidance. The current threshold is 6.5%, not that far from the current unemployment rate if 6.7%. The last official FOMC statement and public comments from Fed officials have been emphasizing that they don't intend to make any changes to monetary policy even 'well past' the unemployment rate reaches that level. The committee would prefer to replace the hard numerical threshold with something more qualitative without disturbing current market expectations in any negative way. The market expects interest rates to start rising in the second half of 2015, as reflected in the Fed Funds futures market. It wouldn't be easy for the Fed to remove the unemployment threshold without disturbing market expectations, but that's the key challenge.Beyond Fed related matters, the 2014 Q1 earnings season got underway with the Oracle and Adobe results after the close on Tuesday (we count all companies with fiscal quarters ending in February as part of our Q1 tally).

However, management provided strong first quarter revenue guidance. But the transition to web-based subscription for Adobe's Creative Suite 6 from traditional box licenses could impact its near term revenue. However, we remain optimistic about Adobe's market position, compelling product lines, continued innovation, acquisitions and strong balance sheet. Also, solid adoption of the Creative Cloud and Adobe marketing cloud could serve as potential catalysts, going forward. However, end-market recovery appears slow which remains a matter of concern. We are therefore, reiterating our Neutral rating.Overview:San Jose California-based Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest software companies in the world. Adobe picks up licensing fees from customers, which form the bulk of its revenue. It also offers technical support and education, which account for the balance. Since, fiscal 2012, the company operates through three segments.The Digital Media Segment solutions segment enables small businesses and enterprises to create highly compelling content, deliver it across diverse media through smartphones, tablets, e-readers, and other devices, and then optimize it through systematic targeting and measurement. Within Digital Media, the two major components of revenue are the Creative family of products and Document Services products. The target customers are traditional content creators, web application developers, digital media professionals and user interface designers/developers, writers, videographers and photographers.The Digital Marketing solutions segment provides insight into the performance of digital marketing initiatives, empowers organizations to make informed decisions, and tries to ensure the success of online marketing programs. The target customers are digital marketers, advertisers, publishers, merchandisers, web analysts, chief marketing officers and chief revenue officers.END", "END", "Shares of Synopsys Inc.

The closing share price also represents a decent one-year return of 23.2% and a year-to-date return of 22.1%.The price increase was supported by a significant rise in share volume. Average volume of shares traded over the last 10 days (1,040k) increased substantially from the 610k average volume of shares traded over the last three months.This price appreciation can be attributed to the deployment of its Design Compiler Graphical products for Samsung mobile system on chips (SoCs). The Design Compiler Graphical is intended to reduce power consumption and provide more competitive SoCs for the mobile market.It is also worth noting that the share price has been increasing continuously since the company reported fourth-quarter results on Dec 4. Synopsys delivered mixed fiscal fourth-quarter 2013 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same.

Also of interest, will be the FOMC members' updated economic forecasts, and Bernanke's last press conference as the Fed Chairman, where he will try to explain FOMC's 'Taper' decision, or lack thereof.Many in the market continue to hope that the Fed will hold off on the 'Taper' decision this week. A Wall Street Journal poll of 46 economists shows that only a quarter of the respondents expect this week's FOMC meeting to result in the Taper announcement, while over a third of the total see the Fed holding off through the March 2014 meeting.The Fed will no doubt be the big subject this week, but the 2013 Q4 earnings reports start trickling in as well. We still have a couple of more weeks to go before the (calendar) quarter ends, but we count all companies with fiscal quarters ending in November as part of our Q4 tally. And by that definition, the Q4 earnings season got underway with the earning release from Adobe Systems ( ADBE ) after the close on Thursday. We have a number of industry leaders reporting results this week, including FedEx ( FDX ), Oracle ( ORCL ), Nike ( NKE ), General Mills ( GIS ) and others.As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q4 earnings season have fallen sharply over the last three months.

( ADBE )is set to report fourth-quarter 2013 results on Dec 12. Last quarter, it posted in-line results. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Growth Factors this Past QuarterAdobe's third-quarter earnings of 22 cents exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny due to solid cost management. However, revenues were down sequentially and at the lower end of management's guidance range due to faster-than-expected shift to subscription pricing model leading to more deferred revenues.Margin expansion was limited due to the change in sales mix, which favored lower-margin products.Adobe provided a decent outlook for the fourth quarter, with revenues forecasted to increase 3.0% sequentially. Adobe expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 28 cents-34 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents.END", "Adobe ( ADBE ) is set to announce its Q4 2013 earnings on December 12. While the company continues to post excellent growth in its cloud subscription business, its revenues and profits have fallen significantly in the recent quarter due to the shift in focus from a perpetual licensing model to subscription services. In Q3, the company reported 8% y-o-y decline in revenues to $995.1 million, while its net income declined by 60% y-o-y to $83 million. In this earnings announcement, we expect the growth trend in cloud adoption to continue, which will drive revenues for Creative solutions and Acrobat family divisions. However, we expect the revenues from LiveCycle and Connect business to decline, and the Print and Publishing business to remain flat during the quarter. Check out our complete analysis of AdobeOutlook for Q4 CY13For Q4 CY13, Adobe expects revenue in the $1 billion-$1.05 billion range and non-GAAP earnings per share between 28-34 cents. Additionally, the company has projected that its subscriber base for Creative Cloud services will increase to 1.35 million by the end of this year. According to our calculations, the subscriber base target means that Adobe needs to add over 27,000 paid users per week for Q4 2013, 10% more than its past weekly subscription rate of 24,000. This translates into total annual recurring revenue ( ARR ) of approximately $685 million by the end of fourth quarter. Additionally, we expect the company to report 25% y-o-y growth in its digital media ARR to $875 million, and 20% growth in document services ARR to $115 million in FY 2013. Adobe expects 2013 revenue of $4.05 billion and EPS of $0.56 on a GAAP basis and $1.34 on a non-GAAP basis.Growth In Cloud Services To ContinueAccording to our estimates, the Photoshop and Creative Software division is the biggest of Adobe's operating segments and makes up approximately 55% of the its value. During Q3 2013, this segment generated approximately $637 million in revenues.In the past few quarters, Adobe's cloud subscription service has witnessed robust growth as clients have increasingly adopted these services to drive collaborative development efforts across their companies. While we expect that the share of revenue from Creative Cloud (CC) will continue to grow in Q4, the adoption of CC will lower the revenues and profitability as subscription services spread these over the period of the software's use. Adobe has over 12.8 million point and suite software licenses in Q3, and we expect many of these licensees to adopt CC in the coming quarters. Therefore, we believe that the company will continue to report traction for its cloud services in this earnings announcement.Revenues To Decline At Acrobat Family DivisionAdobe Acrobat family is the second largest division at Adobe and makes up 12% of its value. The Acrobat family division reported a 2% y-o-y decline in revenues to $182 million in Q3. We expect this trend to continue in Q4 as its point product document services continue to decline. However, we expect the company to report incremental revenues from Acrobat document cloud services, which will stem the decline in Acrobat family division to some extent. Additionally, we continue to closely monitor the growth in Enterprise Term Licensing Agreements (ETLAs) that are instrumental in bringing new business to this division.Adoption Of Adobe Marketing Solutions in FocusOmniture is Adobe's third largest division and makes up 10% of its value by our estimates. Adobe acquired Omniture in 2011, and since has included all of Omniture's products under its digital marketing cloud division.Adobe is aiming to increase its revenues from cloud based marketing solutions by expanding in new geographies and verticals. As Adobe continues to develop its marketing solutions capabilities, we expect this division to emerge as an important driver for revenue growth. In this earnings announcement, we expect the company to report growth in revenues from new geographies. Additionally, since many of Adobe's digital marketing solutions cater to the growing big data analytics, mobility and social media industries, we expect the company to post incremental revenues across these industries.We currently have a $41.16 price estimate for Adobe , which is around 25% below the current market price.Click Here To Understand What Drives A Stock At TrefisThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "Next week eurozone finance ministers will hammer out the details of the eurozone's proposed banking union in an attempt to solidify plans for the project before the end of the year.Bridging the deep divide among the bloc's members over how to set up a resolution mechanism for failing banks will be top priority.Key Earnings ReportsNext week, investors will be waiting for several key earnings reports including Toll Brothers Inc.

Breaking down that Adobe-generated data, roughly 21% of all Thanksgiving online sales came through mobile devices this year, with $152 million spent via tablets and $70 million via smartphones from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Amazon (AMZN). Speaking of Amazon, it and eBay (EBAY) performed strongly with Thanksgiving e-commerce sales due to heavy promotions designed to lure shoppers, per marketing and website optimization company Monetate, which based its findings on data from nearly 30 million online shopping sessions.And that was just Thanksgiving Day.In terms of Black Friday, Nielsen\u2019s (NLSN) Holiday Spending Forecast study found that 85% of consumers planned on skipping the stores on Black Friday this year.

It is intentions like those that give credence to Comscore\u2019s (SCOR) outlook calling for total spending across digital channels to reach $55.2 billion for the holiday season this year. Of that $55.2 billion, it\u2019s expected that mobile commerce -- buying on smartphones and tablets -- will reach $7.1 billion for the November-December holiday season, or 13% of total holiday digital commerce.As any investor knows, share gains for one company or modality means share loss for another, and that\u2019s exactly what Nielsen\u2019s findings point to -- only 13% of respondents planned to shop in physical stores this Black Friday, down from 17% last year. When queried as to where they would be shopping on Black Friday, 71% said department stores, such as Macy\u2019s (M), Saks, Nordstrom (JWN) and others. The runner-up to department stores was electronics stores, but activity I saw over the weekend pointed to more show-room visiting than actual buying at Best Buy and GameStop (GME). At both places, there were many folks looking for Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) new Xbox One, but at least at the stores I visited, there were none to be had.Even ahead of Thanksgiving and Black Friday, $18.9 billion had been spent on holiday shopping during the Nov. 1-24 period, according to Comscore. Per Comscore data, that is a 14% increase year over year.All of that data is great, but explaining how to invest and score big profits during the holiday season is the kind of information I share each week with subscribers to my trading service PowerTrader. That service uses a combination of stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and call options to deliver big returns. Rather than get caught up with which retailers are gaining share or losing share, I recommended a few weeks ago a way to trade during the holiday shopping season that is based on the shift to online shopping. Even as the holiday shopping season kicks into higher gear, my PowerTrader subscribers are up in the call option I recommended to them. That\u2019s the power of PowerTrader -- it combines stocks and ETFs with out of the money call options to deliver big profits. As far as what the online holiday call option I mentioned is, I\u2019ll give you a hint -- the company and its shares are nowhere to be found on this page.Discover more big profit generating ideas like this one with PowerTrader.PowerTalk with Peter Schiff, CEO and chief global strategist of Euro Pacific CapitalJoining me this week on PowerTalk is Peter Schiff, American businessman, investment broker and financial commentator, as well as the CEO and chief global strategist of Euro Pacific Capital Inc.

His persnickety posts often railed against a certain technology -- the most notable of this category is his entry about Adobe ( ADBE ) Flash -- and detailed why Apple would be moving in a different direction.Well, in a similar vein, Google ( GOOG ) chairman and former CEO Eric Schmidt has posted a Google+ entry that champions his company's product above that of a competitor's and urges readers to join his flock.And that competitor just happens to be Apple. This weekend, Schmidt provided a step-by-step walk-through on how users can easily switch from an iPhone to an Android device. Titled Eric's Guide: Converting to Android from iPhone , the post detailed the process, with steps ranging from the rudimentary (like setting up your Google account) to the more finely tuned (like moving your music from iTunes to Google Play's music cloud). And much like Jobs, Schmidt wasn't above a few digs at his company's main opponent.\"Many of my iPhone friends are converting to Android,\" Schmidt opened. He made reference to the \"latest high-end phones\" from Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and Motorola that are supported by the major carriers Verizon ( VZ ), AT&T ( T ), Sprint (S), and T-Mobile (TMUS) and that \"have better screens, are faster, and have a much more intuitive interface.\"Schmidt jibed, \"They are a great Christmas present to an iPhone user!\"As evidenced in the guide, the process is surprisingly simple. Thanks to Google's comprehensive cloud services, which store and sync contacts across all your devices -- a process Apple still hasn't been able to do well with iCloud -- the toughest part of the process is having to deal with the increasingly bloated iTunes.Schmidt closes with one last jab against Apple's Web browser. \"Be sure to use Chrome, not Safari; it's safer and better in so many ways. And it's free.\"All in all, the post is a pretty decent pitch for potential Android customers as we draw closer to the holidays and provides a handy guide for users who might be unfamiliar with Google's mobile platform.

It's the Rodney Dangerfield of the tech industry - always the underdog, and yet somehow, always around.Microsoft ( MSFT ) has monopolized the PC industry for decades. Google's ( GOOG ) control of Web search is uncontested. Adobe ( ADBE ) and Symantec ( SYMC ) may as well be unmovable objects, and despite the perennial threat from cloud competitors, SAP ( SAP ) and Oracle (ORCL) are as profitable and healthy as ever. Not exactly a tough audience.The hardware industry hasn't been nearly as kind to HP (HPQ) and Dell (DELL). Chinese competitors have grabbed market share from HP, while Baidu (BIDU) has failed to dent Google. Dell and Microsoft were both challenged by a change in consumer trends, but Microsoft has remained afloat while Dell hasn't. Hardware isn't easy, and IBM (IBM) only survived the last 102 years by walking fast and carrying a packed suitcase; the 2005 sale of its personal computer business to Lenovo (OTCMKTS:LNVGY) was just the latest in a long history of well-timed exits.Despite this, software firms are competing for the chance to sell a physical product - and in many cases they're jeopardizing their software business in order to do it. Google bought Motorola in 2012, sowing discord with Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and threatening Android's neutrality. Microsoft debuted the Surface tablets last year, and more recently purchased Nokia's (NOK) handset business; HP now considers Microsoft a competitor . Amazon (AMZN) sells its own tablets, which routinely get top billing on the Amazon website. Oracle bought its way into servers, and promises clients \"integrated solutions.\" Indeed, integration is a word that pops up frequently these days, as everyone looks to Apple (AAPL) and tries to copy its approach.BlackBerry (BBRY) offers us a more cautionary tale. Like Apple, it ran an integrated business long before the model became popular, selling both mobile devices and the software and services that ran on them. Obviously, the outcome was quite different; BlackBerry is now shopping for a buyer, while Apple sits on a $480 billion valuation.Good software can't save bad hardware. Bad hardware, on the other hand, can kill even a well-respected software product. Last week, BlackBerry opened its instant messaging service to iOS and Android, and the app quickly rocketed to 10 million downloads. Not bad. And three years ago, this move might have established BBM (Backberry Messenger) as a top mobile messaging application. Now it faces an uphill climb against well-established competitors, a falling subscriber count, and a deteriorating brand.That's a shame, because both BBM and BlackBerry's Enterprise Server are valuable products, offering security to a business world that desperately needs it. Data has become a make-or-break asset for corporations, and the loss or theft of that data is getting both easier and more damaging. Bring-your-own-device has populated offices with personal smartphones and tablets, opening the door to potential security breaches . BlackBerry could have positioned itself as a solution to these problems, if it hadn't tied everything to a sinking hardware line. Instead, it's looking like BBM and BES might go down with the ship.Meanwhile, Google has failed to turn around Motorola. Oracle has struggled since acquiring Sun Microsystems' server business, and Microsoft was forced to write off $900 million on the Surface RT last quarter. For years, Microsoft didn't release Office for iOS and Android, preferring to drive consumers toward mobile Windows products; but the only obvious result was more business for alternatives like Google Docs.There's a danger that, in trying to copy Apple's model, these companies are merely repeating BlackBerry's mistake - eroding their core business in an attempt at hardware glory. Certainly, it's hard to argue that integration necessarily results in better products, when Samsung holds the top spot in the smartphone market and four of the top five tablet vendors are OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).At its peak, BlackBerry's hardware revenues were five times what it earned on software and services. Last quarter, that ratio inverted as software and services grabbed 50% of revenue. Too late, the handset maker has discovered which side of its business is the more valuable. As it looks for alternatives to a $4.7 billion offer from Fairfax Financial Holdings (OTCMKTS:FRFHF) - almost $4 billion under book value - BlackBerry will have a hard time convincing anyone to bid on what has essentially become a software firm in a world where software gets no respect.See also:Tech News: Steve Wozniak Doesn't Want New iPad Air and Amazon Delays Its Set-Top BoxApple: Why Free Software Makes Perfect Mathematical SenseApple Inc.

This was about 11 times the security's average single-session put volume, and more than six times the number of calls exchanged. However, not all of yesterday's put action was of the bearish variety.Most popular was the January 2014 45-strike put, where north of 6,000 contracts -- including several mid- to large-sized blocks -- changed hands at the bid price , suggesting they were sold . To be more specific, these out-of-the-money puts traded for a volume-weighted average price of $0.66. Meanwhile, open interest at this strike jumped by 4,915 contracts overnight, confirming the creation of new short positions.In other words, the speculators are counting on the software concern to remain north of the $45 level through the close on Jan. 17, 2014. This would render the options worthless, and allow the sellers to retain the initial premium collected. At last check, the delta for the put stood at negative 0.16, implying it has just a 16% chance of moving into the money by January options expiration. Still, if the stock does, in fact, sink below the strike price during that time frame, the traders could find themselves on the hook to buy the shares at $45 each, no matter how low ADBE sinks.This confidence in Adobe Systems isn't unfounded, considering the shares have climbed north of 39% year-to-date -- and 57.5% year-over-year -- to trade at $52.60.

A retrace is like a discount in a shopping mall; it's as if something is on sale since it costs less to buy than it did previously. In fact, if you look at the data, slow retraces (those taking more than six bars to retrace to their breakout level) have as much as an 82% chance of being bought, depending on their time frame and qualified trends . Those are pretty good odds. So why do we fear buying retraces?I think the answer is that traders and investors are very bad about taking profits on the way up and thus, when the retrace occurs, their mindset switches into defensive mode. The result is that, rather than opportunity, everything is fear. So the key to buying retraces is to sell into the spikes; sell into anchored resistance zones or into price projection areas so you can buy the retraces.Here are some examples of retraces I am buying after selling into the spike higher in the past few weeks.Amgen ( AMGN ) is the premier biotech megacap name out there and remains a reasonable high beta target for traders and investors alike.

The markets will likely remain in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the afternoon announcement and subsequent Bernanke press conference. The Housing Starts data this morning, though a bit on the weak side, will likely not have much resonance given the Fed spotlight.The markets have spent the last few months getting ready for the Taper announcement. As such, the actual Taper announcement later this afternoon may not carry much surprises. That said, there are still a number of aspects of the decision that remain uncertain. The size and composition of the Taper matters - will they cut by the expected $10 billion to $15 billion that everyone has been expecting or more? Will they cut back on Treasury bond purchases, mortgage backed securities, or a combination of the two?A bigger Taper will be a negative surprise for the markets, but will actually be indicative of greater confidence within the FOMC about the economic outlook. On that front, we will also get today the FOMC members' economic forecasts. It will be interesting to see how the Fed sees the growth picture next year at present, after they upgraded their outlook at the June meeting. The first time release of their 2016 forecasts will be instructive of how the Fed officials view normalized growth, interest rates, and inflation.The Fed has been trying hard to explain that Taper didn't mean tightening. To emphasize that point, they may update their long-term guidance by providing new thresholds for inflation and unemployment rate. The current guidance says that they wouldn't think about raising rates till the unemployment rate stays above 6.5% and inflation remains below 2.5%. They could potentially provide the lower bound of their inflation range, to accommodate those that appear concerned about disinflationary trends. They could lower their unemployment rate target as well, but that could potentially muddy the Fed's message. The Bernanke press conference will likely touch on most of these topics.END", "Adobe Systems (ADBE) shares surged in early Wednesday trading despite the company missing estimates, as its cloud subscription revenue and subscriptions came in better than forecast.Adobe is transitioning from a software company into a cloud computing company, putting its Creative Cloud software in the cloud. On that front, Adobe beat Wall Street's estimates soundly, adding 331,000 subscriptions, well ahead of a Briefing.com estimate of 262,000 subscribers. At the end of the quarter, the San Jose-based Adobe said subscribers topped the 1 million mark.\u201cOur customers are overwhelmingly choosing subscriptions instead of perpetual model licenses which is accelerating our business model transition,\u201d Adobe's executive vice president and CFO Mark Garrett said in a press release. \u201cDuring Q3, 41 percent of our revenue was recurring and we exited the quarter with record deferred revenue on our balance sheet. These results are building a stronger, more predictable revenue model for Adobe which will drive higher long-term growth.\u201dHowever, for the fiscal third-quarter, Adobe earned 32 cents per share on $995.1 million in revenue, below analysts expectations of 34 cents per share on $1.01 billion in sales.On the company's earnings call, Adobe said it expects earnings to be between 28 cents and 34 cents per share, with sales between $1 billion and $1.05 billion, while continuing to add to its Creative Cloud subscription numbers. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters are looking for earnings of 35 cents per share on $1.05 billion in revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter.In light of the continued strength in cloud subscription revenue and subscriber numbers, Wall Street analysts were largely positive on the stock. Here's what a few of them had to say.Citi analyst Walter Pritchard (Buy, $56 PT)\"Net sub adds of 331K was well ahead of our 275K and street 263K was driven by uptake of Team edition, the discontinuation of the perpetual product and higher retention than originally assumed. Management raised FY subscriber guidance from 1.25M towards our 1.35M estimate with Q4 guide of \u201cslightly up\u201d.

Revenue of $995M was below street $1.01B and more inline with our $997M as a result of the more pronounced transition. Digital marketing was strong @ $311 vs. our $291M (street $297M). Even excluding $6M from Neolane, the segment still outperformed. Lower revenue and slightly higher OpEx (Neolane) drove EPS of $0.32 vs. street $0.34.

Creative ARR came in at $545M vs our $498M as subscriber adds surprised to the upside at 331K vs our 250K. The FY14/15 top and bottom line come down and we expect acceleration in both revenue and earnings thereafter.

The company witnessed a faster-than-expected adoption of subscription licenses for its Creative Cloud (CC) business as some of its clients chose enterprise term licenses (ETLA) instead of team offering during the period. The company now has over 1 million paid subscribers for the CC services that generated $546 million annualized recurring revenue ( ARR ) in Q3. Adobe also saw significant growth in its marketing cloud initiatives. In Q3, digital marketing revenues grew by 20% y-o-y to $311 million. However, its LiveCycle software and document services business declined by 11% and 2% respectively.The company reported diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) of $0.16 on a GAAP-basis and $0.32 on a non-GAAP basis. While the company reported 8% y-o-y decline in revenues to $995.1 million, its net income declined by 60% y-o-y to $83 million. Due to a change in its licensing model from perpetual to subscription based, Adobe reported unearned revenue growth to $683.1 million. We examine some of Adobe's key drivers below and its outlook for 2013. Check out our complete analysis of AdobeOutlook For Q4 2013 And FY 2013Adobe has guided for revenues of $1-$1.05 billion for Q4 2013. This would lead to Q4 GAAP EPS in the range of $0.09 to $0.15, and Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 to $0.34.Adobe expects to have over 1.35 million paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions by the end of 2013. According to our calculations, it means it will need to add over 27,000 paid users per week for the rest of FY2013, 10% more than its current weekly subscription rate of 24,000. This would give the company total annual recurring revenue of approximately $685 million. Additionally, we expect the company to end the year with over $875 million of Digital Media ARR at a revenue growth rate of 25% y-o-y, and we expect that its document services ARR will increase to $115 million by the end of 2013.The company also expects the LiveCycle and Connect business to decline further while the Print and Publishing business is expected to remain flat this year. LiveCycle and Connect business will contribute approximately $200 million to revenues in 2013. Adobe expects 2013 revenue of $4.05 billion and EPS of $0.56 on a GAAP basis and $1.34 on a non-GAAP basis.Creative Cloud Subscriptions Gain TractionAccording to our estimates, the Photoshop and Creative Software division is the biggest of Adobe's operating segments and make up approximately 55% of the company's value. During Q3 2013, this segment generated approximately $637 million in revenues. Recently Adobe abandoned its Creative Suite ( CS ) entirely to focus its efforts on developing Creative Cloud. The company has stated that the revenues from its perpetual licensing software will decrease by 2015. However, it will continue to sell CS6 to ease the transition to CC.While we expect that the share of revenue from CC will continue to grow in Q4, the adoption of CC will lower the revenues and profitability as subscription services spread these over the period of the software's use. With a license based model, Adobe received bursts of income every two-three years when new software was released. However, with the subscription fee structure, Adobe will have recurring stable revenue over the period of the software's use. During the past quarter, Adobe reported an increase in adoption of enterprise CC offering through ETLAs and subscriptions. Creative Cloud added 331,000 new subscribers in Q3 2013, up from 221,000 last quarter. As a result, the revenue from CC increased by over 50% sequentially to $546 million, and subscriber base grew to 1.031 million.Revenues Continue To Shrink At Acrobat Family DivisionAdobe Acrobat family is the second largest division at Adobe and makes up 11% of its value. Acrobat family division reported 2% y-o-y decline in revenues to $182 million. The primary reason for this decline was lower sales of point product document services. However, increase in revenue from Acrobat cloud services stemmed further decline in revenues.During the quarter, company's online document services surpassed 1.3 million subscriptions. Revenues from Acrobat Cloud services grew 30% sequentially to $109 million, primarily due to increase in ETLAs. While we expect document services' ARR will drive revenue growth in the Acrobat family division, the company plans to have perpetual model for Document Services for a longer period. This might negatively impact the revenue growth in the future.Adoption Of Digital Platform Lifts Digital Marketing RevenuesOmniture is Adobe's third largest division and makes up 10% of its value by our estimates. Adobe acquired Omniture in 2009 and since then has included all of Omniture's products under its digital marketing cloud division. Recently, Adobe acquired Neolane, which extended Adobe's capabilities into offline campaign management. During the quarter, Adobe witnessed strong growth in its marketing cloud services. Many research firms such as Gartner and Forrester rank Adobe's web content management platform amongst the top echelons of digital marketing platform.In Q3, this division reported a 20% y-o-y increase in revenue to $311 million, and the revenue run rate exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue. Additionally, Adobe marketing cloud achieved 28% y-o-y growth in revenues to $255 million in the quarter. We expect that as big data analytics, mobility, social media and cloud computing gain more traction across industries, this division will report incremental growth in revenues as it has a portfolio of analytical tools that deal with marketing on social media and mobile. While this division contributed 12.5% to Adobe's total revenues in 2012, we expect it to increase to 16% by the end of our forecast period.We are in the process of updating our Adobe model.

In other news, this morning's CPI reading was uneventful and the 2013 Q3 earnings season quietly gets underway today.The Fed is expected to announce tapering its monthly bond purchases at the conclusion of its meeting Wednesday afternoon; the consensus expectation is for trimming of $10 billion to $15 billion from the $85 billion a month pace and wrap up the entire program by the middle of 2014. The market has taken the taper prospect in the stride, pushing stocks back to within striking distance of early August highs. This is in contrast to the prior two QE episodes at the conclusion of which stocks had sold off. Stock market investors appear to be more optimistic about the economic picture this time around, hoping that improved economic fundamentals and the resulting bump to corporate profitability will offset the impact of higher interest rates.Recent economic data has for the most part been in the positive category. The last jobs report was underwhelming, but other labor  market data has been favorable and the unemployment rate has been steadily coming down. The jump in interest rates as a result of the taper talk has dented some of the housing market gains, but the sector's recovery may not be at risk as long as the labor market continues to improve. The factory sector is also showing signs of health, with ISM and Industrial Production data exhibiting renewed momentum. Pricing pressures in the economy remain muted as this morning's August CPI numbers confirm. It will be interesting to see the Fed's updated economic forecasts, particularly given the modes forecast upgrade at the June meeting.The improved economic outlook has ultimately to show up in a stronger earnings picture.

Many see the debt ceiling being more detrimental to markets than the talk of tapering if Congress doesn't pass legislation to raise the ceiling over the next few weeks.

Despite mounting evidence that the Syrian government was behind the August 21 chemical weapons attack, Russia is backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's claims that rebels are responsible for the attack. Russia's stance on the issue is in stark contrast to that of the US and has raised questions about Russia's commitment to destroying Syria's chemical weapons supply. Most believe that if Russia doesn't help enforce the UN's disarmament plan, the US may renew its push for military force.END", "Stocks declined worldwide today as investors grow cautious about the Fed's policy decision.Today, the Federal Open Market Committee begins its two-day meeting. Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold a press conference on its outcome tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. It is widely believed among investors and economists that the Fed will begin the infamous \"taper\" this month. Currently, the central bank buys $85 billion in mortgage-backed securities and government bonds. Expectations that it will cut that back by a token amount this month are high, but Bernanke has repeatedly said that scaling back monetary stimulus depends on continued improvement of economic indicators. The disappointing August jobs report, and downward revisions of previous months' job growth, could keep the Fed on a dovish track.Adding to the dovish case, inflation stayed low last month. The consumer price index rose 0.1% month-over-month in August, missing expectations of a 0.2% rise.The NAHB homebuilder survey will come out later this morning.

The bank will pay $800 million in fines to US and UK government agencies to settle questions of whether it misled shareholders about trading risks. In a reversal of regulators' policy, the bank was actually forced to admit fault. This is much more than symbolic, as it exposes JPMorgan to private lawsuits.IBM ( IBM ) will reportedly make a huge vote of confidence in Linux today. The enterprise tech company will spend $1 billion to convince customers that the open-source operating system is a better choice for powering enterprise data centers. The benefit to Linux is that since it is free and open source, a data center can install it on any number of cloud instances it wishes without paying license fees for installing competing products such as Microsoft's ( MSFT ) Windows Server.Though Linux servers, usually with support from companies such as Red Hat ( RHT ), have been growing fast, it still only claims 23% of new server purchases, where Windows Server has 49%.

Summers was a former Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and a key advisor to President Barack Obama's economic stimulus program.While dealing with the Syria crisis, Obama couldn't drum up enough support for Summers who was said to be more \"hawkish\" than Janet Yellen, the current Vice-Chairman. To add more salt to the wound, Summers has a reputation as a divisive colleague and is still facing backlash based on a statement in his 2005 keynote speech, when he served as the President of Harvard University.According to Summers, \"there is relatively clear evidence that whatever the difference in means, which can be debated, there is a difference in the standard deviation and variability of a male and female population.\"The final nail in the coffin came in the form of a phone call from Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, to Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff.

Although President Obama hasn't made a decision yet, no new candidates have been added for consideration. A nomination from the president isn't expected until next week at the earliest. On Monday, the United Nations released a report on the chemical attack in Syria which the White House has said adds to evidence that the attack was carried out by the Syrian government. Although the purpose of the report was not to assign blame, officials say several of the UN inspectors' findings point to the Syrian government's involvement. In light of the new information, the US has renewed a push for harsh punishments for Damascus if it does not follow the UN's disarmament plan. Minutes have been released from the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy meeting which indicated that the bank is open to cutting rates in the future if need be. The bank's members said the drop in mining investment and the subdued outlook for non-mining investment is still weighing on the country's growth prospects. Although a rate cut is not imminent, the RBA members agreed not to close the door on the possibility in the future. In Italy, support for Silvio Berlusconi and his political party is falling according to polls.

It's unlikely that any announcement about a taper in the Fed's bond-buying program will move the market, as the market is expecting a slight taper. However, if the taper is extreme in either direction -- if purchases will not be reduced, or if the reduction is sizable -- the market will react. Interest rates will move if the Fed changes its unemployment or inflation thresholds for future policy action. The first rate hike is expected to occur in February 2015, and any change in that timing would result in a large decline or increase in US Treasuries. Also, the Fed may look to defend its inflation goal, an unprecedented step since the central bank has always been an inflation-fighting institution. Lastly, central growth forecasts should be taken down to reflect the slower pace of growth projected for this year.Economic releases will also make the news. On Monday, we see the first glimpse of September manufacturing data from the NY Fed's Empire Manufacturing survey.

Economists are estimating a modest 2.1% growth in starts and a 0.4% decline in permits. The August retail sales report this past week showed a -0.9% decline in building materials, which typically indicates a decline in building permits. However, the July report was revised up to +0.4% from -1.8%, so the net change should be close to neutral. New home starts peaked in March and new home contracts peaked in July. The other piece of housing data out for the week is Thursday's existing home sales. Sales are expected to fall 2.6% to an annual rate of 5.25 million.The last piece of economic data due out is August consumer price indices. The consumer price index is estimated to fall to an annual rate of 1.6% from 2.0% in the prior month. A decline is forecast in part because of falling gas prices; the core index is forecast to rise to an annual rate of 1.8% from 1.7%. National average gas prices fell by $0.035 during the month of August.

This mood is likely to continue through the summer months, though the start of the 2013 Q2 earnings season in a few days could potentially spotlight another source of vulnerability of the market. Expectations for earnings growth have been coming down as the quarter has progressed and currently remain fairly low.The growth picture is even more underwhelming when Finance is excluded from the aggregate growth tally. Given these low expectations, it wouldn't take much for companies to beat them. But positive earnings surprises may not mean much anymore, since roughly two-thirds of them beat earnings expectations anyway. We have seen that play out with the handful of results from the likes of Oracle ( ORCL ), FedEx ( FDX ), Adobe ( ADBE ) and others already. More than earnings surprises, we will be looking for top-line surprises in Q2, particularly after the unusually weak revenue results in Q1.Guidance is always important, but it has assumed even more significance this time around given the elevated expectations for the second half of the year. Earnings growth was barely above +1% in the first half of 2013, but it is expected to jump to +9.7% in the back half of the year. Importantly, the growth expectations for the second half of the year are not due to easy comparisons - the level of total earnings in the 2013 Q3 and Q4 each represent new all-time high records.My sense is that estimates need to come down in a big way. The market hasn't cared much in the recent past about negative revisions as aggregate earnings estimates have been coming down for over a year now.

But it didn't like the surprisingly explicit timeline from Chairman Bernanke, and has been in a somewhat downbeat mood ever since.The after-effects of the Bernanke announcement and the resultant impact on benchmark interest rates will no doubt remain the big issues for the market this week as well, but we are also getting close to the start of the Q2 earnings season. In fact, the Q2 earnings season actually got underway last week with the earning releases from FedEx ( FDX ), Oracle ( ORCL ), Adobe ( ADBE ), Darden ( DRI ) and others.It hasn't been a very inspiring start thus far, but all of these companies have been grappling with lingering issues affecting their businesses for awhile and their Q2 reports didn't indicate that they had finally turned the corner. We will see if this week's reports from the likes of Walgreen ( WAG ), ConAgra ( CAG ), Lennar ( LEN ), Paychex ( PAYX ) and others will show a more promising side of the earnings picture. But we will likely have to wait a bit longer for the reporting season to get really high gear -- Alcoa's ( AA ) report is coming on July 8th.As has become customary at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q2 earnings season remain quite low. A major driver of these low expectations is company guidance during the Q1 earnings season, which was overwhelmingly on the negative side. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up only +0.5% from the same period last year.END", "END", "In May, software producer Adobe Systems Incorporated ( ADBE ) made a landmark announcement when it said it was moving to a subscription-only model for its leading products like Photoshop. In a nutshell, the Creative Suite became Creative Cloud.To be clear, the Creative Cloud isn't really cloud-based the way something like Google Inc ( GOOG ) Docs is. Basically, the Creative Cloud is traditional desktop software with some cloud-based enhancements like remote storage and social sharing capabilities.Adobe's announcement caused significant outrage among users, especially since for many people, the transition to the Creative Cloud represents a significant price increase while permanent ownership is being revoked.As an example, I could theoretically use my copy of Photoshop CS5 (for which I paid $220) until the end of time, so long as I had a computer that could run it.But should I want to upgrade to the latest Photoshop, I'd have to pay $19.99 per month or $240 per year, while knowing that I'd lose my ability to use the software at all should I be unable or unwilling to pay this amount at some point down the road.While I wasn't terribly outraged since I have no intention of upgrading anytime soon (I'll cross that ugly bridge when I come to it), plenty of folks were making their voices heard.An online petition at Change.org garnered nearly 33,000 supporters: \n\n\n\nThere was also plenty of anger seen throughout the blogosphere, perhaps expressed best by photographer Brad Trent in his post entitled \" Why We All MUST Fight Adobe and Stop the Creative Cloud!!!\" :The real controversy is that from now on, you won't have the ability to move forward incrementally as you see fit. In the past, if Adobe trotted out an upgrade to Photoshop that didn't fit your workflow, you could just keep using the version you had and wait for the next version before you kicked in your money to be up to date. Adobe obviously didn't like this. They saw it as a money-losing proposition if users didn't slavishly continue along the upgrade ladder, paying for the privilege, of course.And MacPerformanceGuide.com put together a spectacular summary of the ramifications and described Adobe's actions as a \" colossal marketing and PR blunder that only a truly insular organization could have invented.\"Now the good thing about a controversy like this one is that, as a public company, Adobe's obligated to let us know what's going on in terms of actual sales.Did the negative PR hit Adobe's bottom line?The answer is a big, fat resounding... probably not.Adobe reported better-than-expected earnings at $0.36 per share while revenues were in-line. On the downside, third-quarter earnings and revenue guidance were below consensus estimates.However, the big news is that Adobe saw an acceleration in signups for the Creative Cloud, with 221K subscribers added vs. expectations of around 185K subscribers. And this was a big improvement from the 153K subscribers added last quarter. Plus, Adobe is expecting an even greater number of subscribers to come on board during the third quarter.This is where things get interesting.On one hand, Adobe is being told by both customers and Wall Street that it's moving in the right direction.Yet the company also said this on the earnings call:Our decision to discontinue perpetual licensing of new versions of our desktop products has caused concern with some customers. While we will continue to offer CS6 on a perpetual basis, the feedback from our community is important and we are evaluating additional options that will help them with the transition. Our goal is to over-deliver on customer expectations, which we believe will make the entire community ultimately embrace Creative Cloud.So to some extent, Adobe is hedging its bets on Creative Cloud with this ambiguous statement, which could be interpreted a million different ways -- the phrase \"additional options\" doesn't offer much in the way of clarity.Presumably, its most logical concern is that signups slow down, leaving it facing the challenge of converting those of us who see no need to upgrade our existing Adobe software products. But at the same time, the company probably doesn't want to aggressively trigger such worries because the appearance of momentum is important to both customers and investors.Stay tuned -- I suspect this story's going to get a lot more interesting in the quarters to come.See also:The Future of Android Looks More Like Apple Inc.Democratizing Wall Street: Inspired by 'Hoofy & Boo,' 'Seasonal Odds' Aims to Level the Playing FieldTomorrow's Product Announcements Could Get Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.

Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) is making it practically impossible to upgrade memory on certain iMac models. And Google Inc ( GOOG ) has placed restrictions on reselling or even giving away Google Glass.So while we can buy what we want, we are facing more rules than ever after the purchase is made.I hope I don't sound too gloomy because the consumer technology experience has never been better, even with seemingly unfriendly restrictions like those I just listed.With the exception of video games, which peaked with the release of Tecmo Bowl in 1988, virtually everything works better and is way cheaper than it used to be.Now, one particular company that is pushing the boundaries of consumers' capacity to accept change when it comes to the issue of ownership is Photoshop-maker AdobeSystems Incorporated ( ADBE ), which recently made the decision to move to a subscription-only model under its Creative Cloud name .In the future, Adobe will not sell boxed versions of its Creative Suite products like Photoshop and Illustrator.Buyers will have to purchase subscriptions, meaning that you can only use software as long as you keep paying for it. When a subscription lapses, the software becomes disabled.This is a massive paradigm shift for the software industry, and quite a controversial one.Cloud-based subscription software is nothing new, but this is the first instance of a transition of a major existing product to such a model.Thus, I don't think it's the policy itself as much as the jarring change away from the \"buy once, use forever\" tradition (even though no software gets used forever) that is causing all the controversy.Of course, the fact that Adobe is effectively hitting many customers with a significant price increase isn't helping.Today after the close, we're going to get the first bit of financial feedback since Adobe announced it was throwing the switch: The company is delivering its second-quarter earnings report. And incidentally, today is the day when the new cloud apps are being released.Generally speaking, it seems like the only fans of Adobe's move are 1) power users that use multiple Adobe products and eagerly embrace new features and 2) people that sell training for Adobe software products.I emphasize the word \"seems\" because on the Internet, there's always a risk that a vocal minority is outweighing the sentiment of a silent majority. There's a lot of bellyaching over Adobe's switch, but as investors, we must be concerned about how the dollars and cents add up. It's entirely possible that fewer people use Adobe products and the company ends up making far more money. We just don't know yet.Remember, we have all seen plenty of people publicly announce that they're quitting Facebook Inc ( FB ) because of privacy issues or interface changes or supposedly intrusive advertising:END", "Benchmarks were battered on Wednesday after Bernanke said the Central Bank might cut back on the $85 billion bond purchase program towards the end of the year, if the economy improved.

But following Bernanke's testimony on May 22, the Dow Jones has oscillated within the range of 200 points more than fifteen times. The S&P 500 is currently trading 2.4% below its all-time high attained on May 21. Initially the Fed had said there would be no changes in the bond buying program. But Bernanke's statements emerged as singular dampener during yesterday's trading session. The Fed chairman said the bond purchase program would be reduced during the end of the year with the intention of completely ending it by mid-2014. These statements drastically effected investor sentiment after which markets went into a free fall.Bernanke said: \"If the incoming data are broadly Consistent with this forecast, the Committee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year; and if the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our current expectations of our economy, we would continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around mid-year.\"END", "Wall Street was effortlessly earning another fast buck until Fleet Street intervened.

US equities continued to tumble with the S&P 500 (INDEXSP:.INX) down two-thirds of a percent in afternoon trading while the 10-year Treasury yield declined by 2 basis points to 2.1259%.This past week was the slowest of the month in terms of economic data. Thankfully that will change this coming week. Highlights of the week include the consumer price index, housing starts, building permits, the Empire (NY) manufacturing index, the Philadelphia regional manufacturing survey, the NAHB housing market survey, and existing home sales.Before getting into the manufacturing data, of course, the major event for the week will be the FOMC decision on Wednesday, which will be the most important one yet -- until the next one. A few non-voting officials have hinted over the last two months that the Fed is looking to pull back on purchases, but that seems unlikely given the trends in employment and inflation. It is possible, however, that the Fed has been trying to talk down market as some asset classes have reached extreme levels and may taper based off of this decision alone. Commentary over the last four months has hinted as much. Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold a press conference 30 minutes after the 2 p.m. ET statement and will iterate the formal direction of the FOMC's outlook.Tuesday's release of the consumer price index should see consumer inflation increase on a year-over-year basis as Friday's producer price index increased to 1.7% from 0.6% the month prior.

The \"cleaner\" core index is estimated to remain unchanged at 1.7%.Manufacturing data should be better in June as producer prices and inventories fell far enough to become attractive to manufacturers. In May, we started to see slight rebuilding and upticks in producer prices; this should continue into June. The higher inflation and manufacturing growth should be a minor headwind to any Treasury rallies as nominal growth expectations trend a little higher. The New York and Philadelphia regional manufacturing surveys are the two most significant surveys in the US so keep an eye on their direction.The housing data from the week will be a highly watched stat as purchases and refinancing activity fell during May due to higher interest rates. The MBA purchase index fell 3.81% while refinancing activity fell by 40%. However, Toll Brothers Inc's ( TOL ) CEO said earlier today that purchase activity was picking up as homebuyers rushed to buy houses due to the fear of higher interest rates. Lastly, existing home sales inventory reached a 13-year low earlier this year and has been a boon for building activity as purchases continue to increase.Global economic data will be on the lighter side for the week.

In the best of times, Sony's gaming business accounted for over 60% of its operating profit. These days, the company's biggest profit center is actually its life insurance segment.However, during Sony's heyday, Nintendo and Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) were busy hatching plans to topple the big giant, and that's exactly what happened during the current gaming console cycle.Though it was outsold by the PS2 by more than a six-to-one margin, Microsoft had built a small following of gamers with the original Xbox, courtesy of its Xbox Live online multiplayer gaming experience as well as the Halo megafranchise.This laid the framework for the success of 2005's Xbox 360, which, through a lower price and earlier launch date, managed to actually outsell the PlayStation 3.While Microsoft ate away at Sony's market share among hardcore gamers, Nintendo attacked from the other side with the highly innovative Wii. Its motion control system -- friendly to everyone from toddlers to Grandma -- captivated the masses.Fast forward to 2013, and the industry has seen yet another major shakeout -- smartphones and tablets from the likes of Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) have captured a huge number of the casual gamers that once played the Wii and Activision Blizzard, Inc.'s ( ATVI ) Guitar Hero. Plus, gadgets like the iPhone and iPad have virtually destroyed the traditional handheld gaming market that was once dominated by Nintendo and Sony. (See: Nintendo Joins the Long List of Apple Victims .)Heck, at this point, Nintendo's practically off the map. (See: Weak Wii U Sales Are Dragging Nintendo Down .)Again, Microsoft was able to disrupt Sony through a significantly lower price and earlier launch date, and with other factors like a superior launch lineup, an easier software programming environment, and a more evolved online gaming experience.The two versions of the original Xbox 360 were priced at $299/$399, while the PS3, due to its expensive Blu-ray drive, was much more expensive at $499/$599.And now, we're seeing details indicating that Sony and Microsoft have flip-flopped strategies.Microsoft is taking the high-end of the market with the Xbox One console. It will launch in November at $499, and will include a piece of hardware that will increase its cost of goods sold -- the new version of its Kinect motion control system.Sony PS4 will come in 20% lower at $399, with its Eye system priced as a $59 add-on.Now, the cost of entry may not necessarily matter much at launch.Hardcore gamers -- the type of people who are willing to pay up for new consoles -- can be very loyal to their chosen platform's exclusive franchises. That would be stuff like Halo on the Xbox side and Uncharted on PlayStation.So simply assuming that the PS4 will destroy the Xbox One at launch based upon a $100 price differential is far too simplistic.However, that $100 price difference, combined with some customer-unfriendly Microsoft policies, may have a long-term impact on those gamers without serious loyalties -- as well as Xbox fans considering a switch to the other side.First, the Xbox One must be connected to the Internet, and the user must \"check in\" every 24 hours, which has an odd Big Brother feel to it.Microsoft has had the capability to remotely suspend or ban consoles via Xbox Live for terms of use violations, including console tampering and fraudulent online activities, so it's obvious that it's going to be monitoring what goes on in these consoles.I have no problem with Microsoft banning users or even bricking consoles under certain conditions, but does it really have to go all NSA on us?And what if people just want to play some Madden and never connect their consoles to the Web? Why force people into this, if not for the need to monitor and collect data on any number of activities?Interestingly enough, AdobeSystems Incorporated ( ADBE ) instituted a similar policy with its Creative Cloud suite of products, which requires occasional online check-ins in order to function.Additionally, Microsoft's policy on used games is downright confusing.In its own words:In our role as a game publisher, Microsoft Studios will enable you to give your games to friends or trade in your Xbox One games at participating retailers. Third-party publishers may opt in or out of supporting game resale and may set up business terms or transfer fees with retailers. Microsoft does not receive any compensation as part of this. In addition, third-party publishers can enable you to give games to friends. Loaning or renting games won't be available at launch, but we are exploring the possibilities with our partners.Given the wishy-washy language, we have no idea whether buying and selling used games is possible, and if so, how much it will cost. Why should we need permission to give legitimately bought copies of games away? I can understand enabling an individual copy of a game to work on only one console at a time, but this type of intervention seems over the top. Worst of all, the rules are likely to differ from publisher to publisher!On Sony's side, it's taking what some are calling a populist approach, with no restrictions on disc-based games, and no Internet-connection requirement.So who's going to win in the long term? The more corporate, 1%-friendly Xbox One, or the PlayStation 4, which is keeping power and choice in the hands of the people?I was an Xbox fan from way back, but I have to say it.Advantage Sony.Twitter:  @MinyanvilleThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "Last week, all eyes turned to Redmond as Microsoft ( MSFT ) unveiled its upcoming eighth-generation console, the Xbox One. Although full game demos were conspicuously missing, Microsoft paid a great deal of attention to one of the features that has made the Xbox 360 such a hit with users: its media center capabilities.The Xbox One touts live TV features like a voice search for programs, a Web browser than can snap to the side while watching broadcast television, and the ability to automatically update your fantasy football league any time a member of your team scores a touchdown. In fact, speaking of voice search, Microsoft has basically injected Google ( GOOG ) Now commands into the Xbox One's means of interactivity. While it might not be as in-depth and interpretive of \"fuzzy language,\" being able to say \"Xbox, watch TV\" and have it switch to a live broadcast of Breaking Bad is pretty cool.The only problem with this \"ultimate all-in-one entertainment system,\" as Microsoft called it: We've heard that before, and we've been let down. Time and time again.Sure, there's always a chance that the Xbox One will revolutionize the way we watch TV and lead the way in developing an all-too-important standard in which all other media centers can follow, but there've been seemingly hundreds of these types of devices since WebTV came on the scene, and their success is measured in how well they can stream Netflix ( NFLX ).Take, for example, the Apple ( AAPL ) TV.I bought a first-generation Apple TV years ago in the hopes that it could deliver the on-demand, fully interactive television that I dreamed about when I was a TV junkie youth. The idea of scrolling through unlimited programs with a remote and having a program or film play automatically whenever I wanted was such a fantastical vision.And in terms of a high-quality, non-stuttering program or film, it still is.Admittedly, the Apple TV has always been dubbed a \"hobby\" by Cupertino, and man, did it show. The underpowered, overpriced device could barely deliver 720p entertainment and crashed so often that I wondered if that \"hobby\" was like someone saying their pastime was wind-surfing when they've only gone twice.The Apple TV was sold already stunted: Its USB port in the back couldn't be used without jailbreaking the device. In other words, you actually had to hack the Apple TV so it could function like a normal media player and access local files. I purchased the device on the condition that I could hack it -- which a number of sites said was a breeze -- and use it in that matter.Well, hack or not, the first-generation Apple TV was a terrible, glitchy product. One of the worst I ever bought.But then I bought the Boxee Box, which redefined the meaning of \"worst.\"Touted as an open source device that, again, would be the ultimate all-in-one set-top box, the Boxee Box was introduced with the very popular Boxee software built in. It had two USB ports which you didn't have to hack in order to use, 1040p video capabilities, hundreds of streaming apps, a Web browser with Adobe ( ADBE ) Flash support, and a remote with a QWERTY keyboard on the back.The thing was, most -- if not all -- of those features were continually broken throughout the lifespan of this device.The Boxee Box never worked right for most users. A quick search through its support forums, its Facebook page, or @Boxee mentions on Twitter show a legion of dissatisfied users who, like me, tried in vain to get an uncommunicative company to address -- let alone fix -- the problems we've continued to have with this bug-ridden device. (A device that Boxee has since unceremoniously abandoned, leaving its most loyal users in the lurch before debuting a new and equally buggy set-top box. How's that for customer appreciation?)Users were forced to keep outdated firmware loaded on their machines -- because every infrequent update from Boxee would break something else -- and find their own workarounds to get things running for more than a day. (A flashback to the \"if you want it to work, you have to hack it\" days of Apple TV.)Between constant crashes, a severe memory leak, broken Flash support, an unusable Web browser, non-working apps, and an underpowered processor that could barely even start a 1040p stream let alone play it in its entirety, the Boxee Box is by far the biggest regretful purchase I've ever made.And that's coming from someone who owned a Droid Bionic.But the Apple TV and Boxee Box aren't the only disappointing entries into the media center arena. Google TV has all but been considered a flop since it was introduced in 2010. Yet again, touted as the vehicle that will redefine the way we watch television, Google TV hit one snag after another -- a poor UI, questionable manufacturing partners, uncooperative studios, low developer support -- before it seemed to be a shambling corpse still fighting for relevance. A future upgrade to Jelly Bean may inject some life into it, but its fate looks to be already sealed.That isn't to say it's all the fault of the manufacturer. The aforementioned \"uncooperative studios\" play a major role in denying the public a TV-watching revolution. The NBCs (CMCSA), the ABCs (DIS), the Foxes (NWS), and the CBSs (CBS) all prefer the staid and antiquated broadcast model and, like the publishing industry, will eventually go down with the ship as the average user begins to prefer a cut cord to a $100+ monthly bill.After all, you've seen the way they've run Hulu into the ground.However, even in 2013 when Netflix and Wi-Fi abound (mostly), these studios and cable companies are still kicking around due to their massive control and power over the media. Despite an abundance of streaming and often free entertainment options, they still hold all the cards when it comes to passive television watching for the average viewer.And, most importantly, they are absolutely essential for the success of any of these media centers. Want live TV interactivity? You better have a cable subscription and a licensed cable box -- the kind with the extra monthly charge to operate. If not, well, they'll see you in court -- a costly hiccup that the over-the-air television outfit Aereo knows all too well. (We still have to wait and see if its court win does anything for its success and adoption.)So, what are we left with? Like I said before, glorified Netflix streamers. Even now, to get most of the options we all want and have them work consistently, well, your best option is building your own home theater PC, slapping a copy of XBMC on it, and sitting back with a Bluetooth keyboard remote.In other words, another hack.See also:Forget Apple TV or iWatch: Apple's Next Trump Card Is Mobile PaymentsGoogle Looks Ahead to Its Next Billion CustomersXbox One and PS4: New Consoles Are Nice, but New Gamers Would Be Even BetterThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "Synopsys Inc.

( PBI ) announced its plan to sell the management services business wing in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to Swiss Post Solutions.Swiss Post Solutions is a division of Swiss Post that offers a comprehensive range of business process management services.Pitney's two regional subsidiaries, namely Pitney Bowes Limited and Pitney Bowes Ireland Limited, inked an agreement for an undisclosed amount with Swiss Post for this purpose. Although the detailed terms of the contract are yet to be revealed, the company has clarified that this transaction will not cover Marketing Lifecycle Services (MLS), which will continue to be operated by Pitney itself. The transaction is expected to be complete within three months of the announcement.After a thoughtful consideration, the management at Pitney found the held-for-sale business segment failing to complement its existing line of businesses. In addition, the management services business in the UK and Republic of Ireland was expected to perform more efficiently and effectively as part of Swiss Post Solutions. This is primarily due to the fact that the European market is the primary focus and core business area for Swiss Post Solutions, unlike that of Pitney. This acquisition will strengthen the international market presence of Swiss Post Solutions.END", "Autodesk Inc.

In addition to the post-meeting statement, we will also be getting the economic forecasts of individual FOMC members and hear from Bernanke himself in the press conference. The issue at hand is the future of the Fed's $85 billion a month bond-purchase program which has done more than anything else in pushing stocks to the current all-time high levels. As such, it's more than just an academic exercise among economists.Recent economic data has broadly been favorable. The housing momentum remains in place, as confirmed by Tuesday's strong February Housing Starts and Permits numbers. The labor market seems to be improving as well, with the weekly Jobless Claims numbers now under the 350K level, and even the factory sector seems to be showing signs of life again. In fact, the gains in household buying power as a result of the improving labor market and wealth effect from stock market and housing strength is helping offset the negative impact from higher taxes and gasoline prices. Last week's better than expected February Retail Sales data prompted many analysts to raise their estimates for GDP growth in the current and coming quarters. This improving GDP growth backdrop has put the spotlight firmly on the Fed's QE program.The Fed is unlikely to announce any changes to the QE program today, but they will likely acknowledge the improving economic scene in the post-meeting statement as well as in the individual forecasts. We know from the minutes of the last two FOMC meetings that a strong group of the committee members are in favor of at least ending the open-ended nature of the current QE program, to give itself more flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions. We wouldn't see any evidence of those discussions in today's statement, but they will come out next month in this meeting's minutes.For now, the core of QE supporters within the FOMC, comprised of Bernanke, Yellen, and Dudley, will hold their ground and continue with the program. Given the expected drag on economic growth from the budget sequester and other fiscal austerity measures, they will be looking for at least a couple of more quarters of steady economic growth before making changes to the program. But even then, they are unlikely to outright stop the program. They will most likely curtail the program at first, say from $85 billion a month to $40 billion a month, sometime in the back half of the year, before looking at ending it in the first half of 2014. All of this is contingent on the current favorable economic momentum continuing in the coming months and quarters. But as we saw in each of the last three years when the economy lost steam in the Spring/Summer months after positive starts earlier on, current expectations of the economy may not pan out.END", "Adobe Systems Inc.

Oracle released the software patch, \"Update 11\", to plug the loophole in the Java system and upgrade the security level from medium to high.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security had earlier warned users to refrain from using Java software in their computers unless absolutely necessary. The government body claimed that the applications running on Java's latest version, Java 7, were vulnerable to hacking and could lead to cyber-crimes.

Behance was founded in 2006 and has about a million members. Adobe states that Creative Cloud members will soon gain access to basic Behance capabilities such as portfolio creation while paid Creative Cloud members will have access to extra capabilities offered by Behance ProSite .The company reported record Q4 revenue of $1.15 billion, beating its guidance of $1.07-$1.12 billion and taking its annual revenue to $4.4 billion. Adobe has seen significant growth in its Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud initiatives. It claims that it has nearly 1 million free subscribers for Creative Cloud along with 326K paid subscribers. At an average selling price of $750 per subscription , this leads to an annual recurring revenue of $153 million. Check out our complete analysis of AdobeHow Will The Social Aspect Help Adobe Creative CloudAdobe Marketing Cloud's Q4 revenues grew 32% on a yearly basis to $220.4 million. The only significant drop in revenue was reported in the LiveCycle and Connect business, which reported $70 million in Q4, down from $103 million last year. The company has seen a faster-than-expected adoption of subscription licenses and will focus on increasing its end-user subscriptions while rolling out enterprise term licenses in 2013. An indication of the popularity of Creative Cloud was that it added 10,000 new subscribers each week in Q4 2012, up from 8,000 last quarter. Adding Behance to Creative Cloud will accelerate efforts to enable a more open and collaborative creative community, and this is likely to help Adobe sell more Creative Cloud licenses. Adobe is one of the leading developers of creative software and it is safe to assume that a lot of creative content creation takes place on Adobe's software and integrating a marketplace like Behance is likely to drive Creative Cloud subscription. The biggest advantage of this integration is that the users can create content as well as seek feedback, showcase their content and distribute it across devices from a single platform, making the workflow much simpler and therefore driving up consumption.We currently have a $33 Trefis price estimate for Adobe, which stands just below its market price.

It continues to expand its marketing software business with the acquisition of marketing automation firm Eloqua for nearly $871 million.Eloqua's expertise is in marketing automation and is used in campaign profiling and management, testing, execution, measurement and lead nurturing. Eloqua automates the marketing process, making it easy for marketers to immediately respond to a buyer's behavior online.

While this is not very significant now, it can be in the future as Oracle had key wins in the customer relationship management ( CRM ) and human capital management (HCM) space. To put this number in perspective, Salesforce.com, the top cloud CRM player in the world had revenues of $2.3 billion in 2011, and we estimate it to be $2.9 billion this year. Oracle had key wins in the CRM and HCM space including clients like Abercrombie & Fitch, Edwards Air, Expedia, Macy's, T. Rowe Price, United Airlines, U.S. Bancorp, Whirlpool and Xerox.Oracle In The Cloud And Social MediaThe Eloqua acquisition will add to Oracle's social cloud SaaS product portfolio, which consists of other acquisitions such as Vitrue, the social marketing platform provider, Collective Intellect, the cloud based social intelligence solutions and Involver, another social media development platform.This gives the company an extensive social media marketing campaign development platform along with analytics capabilities. While there are many players in this market, the key distinction is the relationship it acquired when it bought out Involver. This company is a Facebook marketing developer and a technology provider for Facebook's internal marketing team. It pioneered social apps by creating the first social app suite on Facebook, and is currently leading the industry with Social Markup Language (SML) and Visual SML. This allows front-end developers to achieve what Involver calls a \"pixel-perfect\" application and helps marketers customize applications. It also provides an intuitive interface to build the campaign with no requirement for coding.We expect these acquisitions to drive Oracles cloud business in the future and we currently have a $40 Trefis price estimate for Oracle , which currently stands nearly 20% above its current market price.

An indication of the popularity of Creative Cloud was that it added 10,000 new subscribers each week in Q4 2012, up from 8,000 last quarter. We examine some of Adobe's key drivers below and its outlook for 2013. Check out our complete analysis of AdobeOutlook for Q1 2013 and FY 2013Adobe has guided for revenues of $0.95-$1 billion for Q1 2013 mainly on the effects of the Q4 to Q1 cycle. This would lead to Q1 GAAP EPS in the range of $0.08 to $0.14 and Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.26 to $0.32.Adobe expects to have over 1.25 million paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions by the end of 2013, and according to our calculations, it means it will need to add over 17.5K paid users per week for the rest of 2013, nearly double its current weekly subscription rate. This would give the company total annual recurring revenue of approximately $685 million. The company claims that 2013 will be the pivotal year in its transition to the subscription model, and we expect it to end the year with approximately $800 million of Digital Media annualized recurring revenue ( ARR ).The company expects the LiveCycle and Connect business to continue to decline, contributing approximately $200 million of revenue in 2013, and the Print and Publishing business to be flat year-over-year. Adobe expects 2013 revenue of $4.1 billion and EPS of $0.62 on a GAAP basis and $1.40 on a non-GAAP basis.Putting Subscription Model In PerspectiveGrowing the subscription business too quickly may become a problem for Adobe in the short term. This model assures a regular monthly revenue stream, but the licenses are sold at a higher price point and too many subscriptions replacing licenses sold may provide a rocky revenue stream in the short term.Creative Software is the largest business for Adobe and we estimate that the average price per license sold is somewhere in the $850-$900 range, with the entire Adobe CS6 costing nearly $2,500. We expect the company to sell around 2.5-2.75 million licenses next year. Adobe also stated that it modeled an 80% retention rate and the average selling price ( ASP ) for Creative Cloud subscription is $750.In a scenario where most users transition to a subscription model, it will potentially lose $250-$275 million annually next year. However, this is not entirely bad as over a two-year refresh period, it will have potentially made much more in subscription revenues as users will need to pay an annual subscription fee of $750 per year as opposed to $850-$900 for two years. This calculation is based on average prices and will materially differ based on the number of high-priced licenses sold versus the number of lower-priced software licenses sold.A likely indication of the trend that Adobe's high-end segment buyers are transitioning to subscription is that it is pushing for enterprise licenses in 2013 and that its guidance of $4.1 billion in revenues for 2013 is lower than its revenues in 2012, and we are likely to see this trend reverse very soon.We currently have a $33 Trefis price estimate for Adobe, which stands just below its market price.

This data would be consistent with another negative GDP print for the Euro-zone in the December quarter, the third quarter of back-to-back GDP contraction. But it does raise hopes that if the data continues to improve, we may see the region move back into a modestly positive territory at some stage in 2013. Thursday's announcement of agreement on unified bank regulation is also a net positive for the region's long-term outlook.In corporate news, we have a positive earnings report from Adobe Systems (  ADBE ) and PPG Industries ( PPG ) is increasing its exposure to the improving U.S. housing market by acquiring rival AkzoNobel's North American paint business for $1.05 billion.END", "Adobe Systems Inc.

It has released products such as Adobe Social with an eye on the booming cloud and social analytics market. It has also changed its business structure to a subscription model on the cloud through its Adobe Creative Cloud. In this earnings release, we will look primarily at how Adobe is doing in the digital media and marketing space. Check out our complete analysis of AdobeCreative Cloud Growth Is KeyAdobe has guided that for Q3 2012, it expects revenue of $1.075 - $1.125 billion, diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.38-$0.43 on a GAAP basis, and $0.56-$0.61 on a non-GAAP basis. Adobe has a majority of the market share in the creative software space thanks to the continued success of its Creative Suite line of products. The majority of its revenues are driven by Creative software like Photoshop, which is why Creative Cloud is expected to be one of its most important releases to date.The subscription-based model was made available on May 11, 2012 to users at $49.99 a month and will allow users to access the entire CS6 suite as well as exclusive online content. Considering the fact that the entire package is currently available for $2,599, the subscription model will attract and encourage part time and casual users. The subscription model can make it cheaper for users to access the software, but there is an added advantage for the providers who can exercise better control over software maintenance and updates. There is however a chance that revenues will suffer in the short term as users migrate to the cloud based offering.We currently have a  $32.58 Trefis price estimate for Adobe , which stands just below its market price.

As of 06/30/2012, Brave Warrior Capital owns 12 stocks with a total value of $1.4 billion. Greenberg was an English major in college and never contemplated going into investing. He ended up going to Columbia business school with no real career objective. He went to work for J.P. Morgan after b-school. A light bulb went off for Greenberg when he was asked to analyze a company that owned land with redwoods growing on it. He made some enquiries and discovered that the land was worth three times the price at which the company was trading. That shaped his thinking because he learned that there are situations out there where you don't need to be a genius to figure them out.Glenn Greenberg maintains a highly concentrated portfolio that he describes as a \"defense against ignorance.\" He believes that the more companies you own, the less you will know about each, and the less you know about a business, the more likely you are to make mistakes due to fear and greed. He usually owns less than 10 stocks. Greenberg invests in companies with little competition, and places a great deal of emphasis on Return On Invested Capital.Glenn Greenberg buys Oracle Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals Int (usa), Google Inc, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Vistaprint Limited, Fiserv, Inc., Motorola Solutions Inc, Higher One Holdings, Inc, Primerica, Inc., sells Aon Plc during the 3-months ended 06/30/2012, according to the most recent filings of Brave Warrior Capital.These are the details of the buys and sells.END", "Wednesday, June 20, 2012Leaders of the Group of 20 (G-20) developed and developing nations failed to come up with any concrete actions in their two-day summit meeting in a beautiful Mexican resort town.

Other options include a fresh bond-purchase program or further extending the Fed's current guidance of keeping interest rates near-zero through 2014.Hardly anyone can credibly claim that more Fed stimulus will do any real good to the economy, given where interest rates are already.

On that note, Nasdaq's gains were important, thanks to technology shares. Not only yesterday, but even in the past the Nasdaq has outperformed the other benchmarks on a few occasions. On Monday in particular, the Nasdaq was boosted by an event that also played a role in sparking off the broader rally. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) settled over $600 a share, on Monday, for the first time in its history, and the uptrend was a direct result of its announcement which bolstered shareholders' value. Apple announced a quarterly dividend of $2.65 per share, to be paid in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company announced a three-year share buyback plan worth $10 billion, which will begin in fiscal 2013.The technology sector has performed decently so far this year and has lent support to the markets' uptrend.

Investors were closely watching the meeting of the European leaders, which ultimately came up with no solution to the region's debt woes. The Dow's day long choppy run ended with Hewlett-Packard's earnings guiding the index into the positive zone. Separately, the initial claims reading came in positive and durable goods increased in April.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.3% to close at 12,529.75. The Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) slivered up 0.1% to finish yesterday's session a mere 1.82 points higher at 1,320.68.

The remaining 3% stocks were left unchanged.The European summit that came to a close yesterday, failed to provide any definite decision on the lingering financial woes of the region. The proposal of the euro-bond failed to convince to make an agreement for spurring economic growth in the shorter term, said French President Francois Hollande. Hollande added: \"Germany remains convinced that eurobonds can only be the end of a process, while we believe it's the start of a process. That's it, in a nutshell\". As for Greece's tough battle against its frail economic condition, the nation's prime minister sounded cautious about exiting the euro. However, European Union president Herman Van Rompuy said: \"\"We want Greece to remain in the euro area while respecting its commitments\".The European summit went on for over five hours, ultimately failing to come out with concrete proposals and the markets struggled for direction. However, the Dow was guided by second quarter figures of its key component Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ ). Hewlett-Packard surpassed the Street estimates on both counts, i.e., the top and bottom lines. Moreover, the company also surpassed its earnings per share guidance. However, the figures moved lower on a year-over-year basis. Nonetheless, that hardly had any impact and its shares rose 3.3%. Among other Dow components, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD ), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX ), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO ) and AT&T, Inc.

While there will be 79 firms reporting -- 15 of them members of the S&P 500 -- most will be February fiscal period ends, which actually makes them the leading edge of the first quarter reports, not the trailing edge of fourth quarter reports.Firms reporting this week include: Adobe ( ADBE ), ConAgra ( CAG ), Discover Financial Services ( DFS ), Darden Restaurants ( DRI ), General Mills ( GIS ), Nike ( NKE ) and Oracle ( ORCL ). That is an interesting cross-section of the economy and might offer some clues as to how the first quarter earnings season will go.Not a lot of economic data due out next week, but what we get will mostly be about housing, including the NAHB index, Starts and Permits, and both New and Used Home sales. In most recoveries, it is housing that leads the way, but not this time.

Our price estimate is around 25% ahead of the market.Adobe to Capitalize on The Rise of HTML 5While Flash has been the dominant technology used to create interactive, animated content, its market share has been decreasing as HTML5 gains ground. Apple refused to support Flash on the iPhone and the iPad citing performance issues, which led many developers to move to adopt HTML5.With PC sales dropping and tablet sales showing tremendous growth eventually many developers will move on to HTML5 to create content as it is compatible with most platforms and doesn't need any special plugins.With Adobe Edge, Adobe plans to capitalize on this shift to HTML 5. With Edge, Adobe can recapture some of its lost market share and improve sales of its Creative Suite software bundle, which currently has more than a 40% share of the global market.

Adobe plans to release a mid-cycle version of CS 5 later this year. It will have a few new features like video production facility as well as more capabilities for Flash and HTML. This is not the first time that Adobe has planned for a mid-cycle release. It had a mid-cycle release between the launch of Creative Suite 2 and 3, following the integration with Macromedia after Adobe acquired it. But according to the management, this is the first significant mid-cycle release.According to management:I would say that this is really a new strategy and given all of the functionality that we're putting in with respect to multiple screen as well as Digital Publishing Solution. We also did things like bundled the Macromedia products when we acquired Macromedia, but I would say this is really the first significant mid-cycle release.Our TakeClearly, this mid-cycle release is meant to boost Adobe's Creative software sales. The company might have realized that an 18 to 24 month period is too long a period between any two software version releases. The longer gap between software versions risks company from losing its customers. This risk might have prompted the company to now go for a mid-cycle release.If you think that this release could help Adobe gain market share in 2011, drag the trend-line to see the impact on our estimate for Adobe stock.See our full analysis for Adobe.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "Symantec (  SYMC ) is the global leader in the security software market, and sells a number of products to consumers and enterprises.

In the consumer antivirus market, Symantec competes with McAfee, now part of by Intel (  INTC ), as well as Microsoft (  MSFT ), CA (  CA ), AVG, TrendMicro and Kaspersky Labs.Although Symantec is the leader in the consumer antivirus market, its market share has declined in the past few years. Here we look at the challenges that Symantec faces in this market and how it plans to overcome them. We estimate that Norton antivirus software accounts for around 33% of our $21.24 price estimate for Symantec stock . Our price estimate is about 20% higher than the market price.Symantec's Losing Market ShareSymantec's share in the consumer security software market has declined from around 57% in 2007 to around 46% in 2010, and we expect it to continue to decline to around 42% by the end of Trefis forecast period. The main reason for the decline has been the gaining of the popularity of free alternatives available in the market. For example, Microsoft's \"Security Essentials\" is essentially free, can be conveniently installed through Windows Update System and identifies malware fairly accurately. We wrote a previous note on this challenge titled Symantec's Challenge From Microsoft Security Software .What Could Symantec Do?What is Symantec doing to halt this decline? Symantec has realized that offering antivirus products on a stand alone basis will not win it the market share battle alone. Instead, it has started to offer a variety of products, which works on multiple platforms. This strategy could help Symantec up-sell and cross-sell its Norton line of products. For example, Symantec has started to offer Norton Online Backup, a data recovery software. This software has seen rapid customer adoption, which we highlighted in an earlier note titled Higher Demand for Norton Backup Software Means Upside to Symantec's Stock .In its earnings announcement, Symantec mentioned that it continues to expand its Norton offerings into alternative channels such as LG Electronics and Adobe (  ADBE ), which is helping it expand its customer base. Symantec is also trying to diversify its business beyond PCs to mobile and tablets with its Norton Everywhere initiative.Can these initiatives help Symantec regain its lost share in the consumer security software market, or will it continue to decline?

This means that Adobe could lose ground to competitors Microsoft (  MSFT ), Apple (  AAPL ), Quark and Corel.Creative Suite and Acrobat software are the two most valuable businesses of Adobe, accounting for about 53% and 15% of our price estimate for Adobe stock respectively are are the units most likely to be affected. We have adjusted our Adobe price estimate slightly from $37.43 to $37.28 , which is around 10% ahead of the current market price.Adobe's Near-Term OutlookAdobe had a decent Q1 with revenues at $1.03 billion, a sequential growth of about 2%. The main highlight was the rebound in the education market, which is the largest business vertical for Adobe. A few months back, we discussed how the slow education market and weak Japanese spending could weigh on its results (see Potential 40% Upside to Adobe Based on New Market Levels ). Adobe's stock sunk 20% after that weak outlook announcement.As the uncertain business environment in Japan has forced management to provide conservative outlook for Q2, the company now expects the revenue estimate for Q2 quarter to be between $970 million and $1.02 billion.Potential Impact on Adobe stockThe main business divisions affected by the Japan tragedy are the Creative Suite and Acrobat software units. Since these are the two most valuable business for Adobe accounting for nearly 70% of its stock value, the downside impact on our price estimate for Adobe's stock could increase, and Adobe could lose some ground in the Creative Suite software market.See our full analysis and $37.28 price estimate for AdobeThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "Adobe Systems is known for artistic software like Photoshop, and one bull is crafting a trade with the precision of a painter.optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker tracking system detected the purchase of 2,000 April 33 calls for $1.68 and the sale of 6,000 April 38 calls for $0.25, resulting in a net cost of $0.68.

It competes mainly with Microsoft (  MSFT ), Apple (  AAPL ), Quark and Corel in the creative software market. Historically, Adobe's market share has fluctuated in the range of 45%-50%, and its share has risen with the releases of new software versions.However, Adobe's market share dropped by 5 percentage points from 2008 to 2009 in spite of the release of Creative Suite 4 (CS4) in October 2008. The reason for the decline is attributable to IT budget cuts implemented by corporates, reduced ad spending by enterprises, and the absence of significant new features in CS4. Adobe's 2010 revenues have improved with the release of CS5 with upgraded features and at faster speeds. We expect Adobe's share will continue to be volatile in the coming and will end up declining to around 45% by the end of Trefis forecast period. Trefis members predict the share will reach closer to 54%, implying an upside of 11% to our price estimate for Adobe's stock.We currently have a Trefis price estimate of $37.43 for Adobe's stock , ahead of the current market price of $34.Sales Growth Volatile, Depends on New Version ReleaseTraditionally, the market has seen high volume sales growth whenever a new version of Creative Suite is launched. Generally there is a gap of around 18 months between the release of new versions. In 2010, Adobe largely made up for its market share loss a year earlier with the launch of CS5. Many CS3 users skipped upgrading to CS4, making CS5 an important release for Adobe. Creative Suite revenues increased from $432 million in Q1 2010 to $533 million in Q2 2010 after version 5 release. As a comparison, the revenues for CS5 exceeded that of CS4 by 15% during the first five weeks of product launch.We believe introduction of newer versions at regular time periods will keep Adobe's creative software share elevated in the coming years. Besides, it should benefit from the growing creative software market , which we estimate will increase at a rate of 4% annually in the coming years. (See Adobe's Upside and Downside Market Share Scenarios )Higher Pricing Could Weigh on Adobe's ShareAdobe has continuously increased the prices of its Creative Suite products, which has limited its market share growth and may continue to do so. The average price of Adobe's creative software products has increased at an estimated $384 in 2005 to $787 in 2010, and we expect the price to cross $1,100 by the end of our forecast period.Trefis Community ForecastTrefis members forecast Adobe's creative software market share will increase from near 52% in 2011 to 54% by the end of the Trefis forecast period, compared to the flat baseline Trefis estimate of 45% over the same period.

Adobe's Creative Suite of software is used by creative professionals such as graphic designers, photographers as well as hobbyists to create visually rich print and online content. Such content includes photographs, videos, animations and mobile content. Adobe is the largest player in the creative software market and has around 46% market share. It competes mainly with Microsoft (  MSFT ), Apple (  AAPL ), Quark and Corel in this market.Here we explore upside and downside scenarios for Adobe's Creative software business, which accounts for around 55% of the $37.43 Trefis price estimate for Adobe stock. Our Adobe price estimate currently stands about 5% above market price.10% Downside - Risk of Adobe's Market Share DeclineAdobe sells some of the popular software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Flash Professional and InDesign, which has placed Adobe in a dominant position in the creative software market. Historically, Adobe's share in the creative software market has fluctuated between 40% to 50%, and has historically increased when a new software version has been released.See our full analysis and $37.43 price estimate for AdobeCreative Suite 3 (CS 3), which was released around Q1 2007, was successful because of the Adobe's acquisition of Macromedia that allowed it to add Flash and Dreamweaver for the first time ever. CS 5, which was released in May 2010, was again a success as it had a few new features like the ability to handle large amounts of data at faster speeds and added new features for designers such as the ability to work on 3D objects and videos. Going forward, we estimate that Adobe's market share will continue to increase as and when a new software version is released and then decline when the initial uptake for the new software version has died down.However, Adobe will need to continue to bring compelling features for every new version of its Creative suite to justify the uptick in its market share. This presents a risk to its market. Adobe has lost market share in the past such as its loss in market share following the release of CS 4. Its market share declined from 48% in 2008 to 43% in 2009 despite the release of CS 4 in October 2008, since it lacked compelling features for the users to upgrade their software.In the scenario where its market share declines to 36% by the end of Trefis forecast period, there could be a downside of 10% to our estimate for Adobe stock.10% Upside - Total Creative Software Market Increases at a Faster RateWe believe that the driving factors behind the growth of Creative software market are many.

We expect Adobe's share in this market will continue to be volatile due to its dependence on sales from new software releases and threats from competitors' products.Adobe's market share trend in this business has been volatile historically. Adobe saw a decline of around 5 percentage points in 2009 in its creative software market share caused by IT budget cuts and reduced advertising budgets by companies. Some of the important products in Adobe's Creative Suite are Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Flash Professional and InDesign.While we expect Adobe will have share of 41% by the end of Trefis forecast period, Trefis members forecast a higher share level of 51%, indicating a potential upside of 13% to our price estimate for ADBE stock.We currently have a Trefis price estimate of $37.43 for Adobe's stock , about 12% above the current market price of $33.56.Sales Growth Dependent on New Version Release CyclesHistorically, Adobe has seen high volume sales growth when a new version of its Creative Suite products is launched. Historically a new version is released approximately after every 18 months.Adobe's Creative Suite 5 (CS5) was released in May 2010 and has performed well. CS5 has exceeded CS3 sales by 10% in the first two quarters post launch. According to AppleInsider, Adobe is working on CS5.5 and plans to release this prior to the launch of CS6, which it expects will set its Flash and Air technology as a substitute platform for developers seeking for capitalization on the flourishing market for iOS and Android-based mobile phones and tablet apps.However, competitors pose a threat to Adobe's plans.Quark's QuarkXpress is a market leader in the professional page layout market, though it comes with a high switching cost. Apple has made inroads into the creative video tools market with its product Final Cut Pro, which has become a popular choice in video editing.Trefis Community ForecastTrefis members forecast Adobe's creative software market share will increase to above 51% by the end of the Trefis forecast period, compared to the baseline Trefis estimate of a decrease from 43% in 2011 to 41% during the same period.

With attractive pricing and more features offered compared to social networking sites and collaboration tools, we expect the number of paid subscribers for Chatter will continue to grow.Although Chatter's paid subscriber growth is a positive, the Chatter Collaboration Network constitutes only 3.5% of Salesforce's stock value, based on our estimates. Hence even a significant increase in paid Chatter subscribers will have a limited impact on CRM stock.

Currently trading at $41.13, HPQ is far from its 52-week high of $54.75. Over the past four quarters, Hewlett-Packard has outperformed earning estimates by just six cents combined. The company will need more juice to move the needle this time, and likely won't get it.Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:  ADBE ) is a diversified software company that has experienced a -25.6% drop in stock in 2010. It's been a while since ADBE posted impressive numbers, as the stock is down -6.2% over the past five years. Adobe is trading at $27.34, just $2 above its 52-week low.Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:  DELL ) is another tech stock worth dumping. Since last October, Dell has watched its stock fall -13.5% compared to small gains by the broader markets. Since late April, DELL stock is down -21.7% - and an earnings miss could send this stock down even farther.Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:  CSCO ) designs, manufactures and sells IP-based networking. Over the past 12 months, CSCO stock has declined -6%. At $22.60, Cisco is well below its 52-week high of $27.74.Research In Motion (NASDAQ:  RIMM ) has posted dreadful numbers, despite being the designer and manufacturer of the popular Blackberry smartphone. In the last year, this tech stock's price has fallen -28.7%. Since late March, RIMM stock is down -33.1% and continued erosion of its marketshare could hurt earnings again.Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:  MSFT ) may have a market cap of $213 billion, but its stock should be sold nonetheless. Since January, MSFT stock is down -19.2%. Trading at $24.62, this tech stock is just above its yearly low of $22.73.As of this writing, Louis Navellier did not own a position in any of the stocks named here.Top 5 Stocks for the 4th Quarter Surge.Louis Navellier details five stocks set to deliver record earnings and jump 30%-50% in the next 90 days as the big money piles in.

Maybe if they hadn't intervened in the normal economic downturn we were supposed to have, (as is the case in every economic cycle), we wouldn't be looking to experiment with monetary policies right now. I am already annoyed of gas prices headed back toward $3 a gallon. I don't even want to think about what other everyday expenses will hit us all in our pocketbooks.Meanwhile, Wall Street is celebrating market gains, but when I see commodity prices screaming higher, I know this will eventually hit the consumer in many ways that will not benefit those who are not invested in the high-beta momentum stocks of the day. I am also concerned the gold trade is going to seduce many into a false sense of security. Talk to some people who are actively investing and they will bring up the subject of gold in the first minute of any conversation. Short-term, gold prices are technically okay, but making big long-term bets will be where the retail investor will eventually get hit. There is nothing wrong with taking advantage of the near-term buying frenzy as long as you keep positions small, but also be nimble and ready to ring the register when the pullback inevitably comes.There was an interesting, but not surprising survey out a few days back saying forty percent of U.S. workers are planning to delay their retirement due to concerns about out-living their savings and fears of rising health-care expenses. More than half of the survey respondents also mentioned they have cut back on their daily spending. This is all well and good, but there needs to be an emphasis on getting some of those savings to work and build new income streams with the aid of high-quality dividend-paying stocks that can be found on our Best Dividend Stocks list.

Adobe shares have rallied 9.59 percent to $32.12 in morning trading on the news. But that's just chump change for one investor, who yesterday crafted an aggressive strategy designed to deliver maximum leverage. This trader purchased 7,000 October 30 calls and sold an equal number of October 29 puts, collecting a small payment of $0.16.Those calls are now worth about $2.40 while the puts have plunged in value to about $0.72, meaning their position is now worth $1.68. Given that they were paid to implement the trade, this represents an infinite return--an example of how investors can sometimes use options to make money out of thin air.However, there was a risk to the trade: If ADBE had fallen below $29, the investor would have been obligated to buy the shares for that price. So instead of risking cash up front when entering the trade, the investor agreed to accept risk over time.

A spate of merger and acquisition action has prompted a renewed focus on information technology companies, particularly cloud computing stocks.However, don't be fooled into thinking that a bunch of big spenders in the technology sector means that all tech picks are doing well. In fact, a number of big name blue chips in the industry continue to face very difficult roads ahead.Here are 11 blue chip tech stocks stumbling right now:Microsoft (  MSFT )Industry: SoftwareMarket Cap: $205 billionMicrosoft (NASDAQ:  MSFT ) is known globally for its Windows operating system. But lately, the tech stock has been known for its declines. The tech giant has dropped -22% in the last eight months, compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ, which have fallen -3.4% and -5.8% respectively. Currently, Microsoft is trading right around its 52-week low. Add the fact that experts are estimating a -6.8% drop in growth next quarter and Microsoft is definitely a blue chip stock worth selling.Cisco (  CSCO )Industry: Communications EquipmentMarket Cap: $117 billionNetworking company Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:  CSCO ) has had a less than stellar 2010. Since January, the tech company's stock has slid -14.3%, setting it behind broader markets. Additionally, experts are predicting earnings of $0.40 per share in its next quarterly report, which is down from an EPS of $0.43 last quarter. Up until May, Cisco stock had remained relatively stable on the year. Since May however, the stock has dropped -23.8%. CSCO is trading very close to its 52-week low of $20.36, with its current stock price of $20.45.Hewlett-Packard (  HPQ )Industry: Computers & PeripheralsMarket Cap: $91 billionHewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE:  HPQ ) has been making headlines over its 3Par bids, but none of the press has helped turn around HP stock. The tech giant has seen its stock underperform in 2010 as well. In fact, the tech stock has fallen -24.4% since January, including a -15.4% drop since the beginning of August. The bidding war over 3par could be a double-edged sword - if HP misses out, it could get punished. If it wins and overpays, shareholders may be just as angry.Qualcomm (  QCOM )Industry: Communications EquipmentMarket Cap: $62 billionQualcomm INC (NASDAQ:  QCOM ) is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of digital wireless telecommunications products based in San Diego. Thus far, QCOM stock has slid -17.2% in 2010. Currently the stock is up to $38.29, from its 52-week low of $31.63 in July. Experts are also predicting a growth estimate for the current quarter of -9.4%. Recently, competitor Intel (NASDAQ:  INTC ) completed the buyout of Infineon's wireless chip unit, which means competitor QCOM may now be at a disadvantage on the mobile device front.TaiwanSemiconductor (  TSM )Industry: Semiconductors & Semiconductor EquipmentMarket Cap: $49 billionPrimarily engaged in the research, manufacturing and distribution of integrated circuit related products, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:  TSM ) is another blue chip stock worth selling. Since January, the stock has fallen -17.7%, against small declines by the broader markets. Additionally, experts are not predicting growth for the company in the near future, as they have posted a -2.2% growth estimate for next year. The fact that Deutsche Bank has downgraded the semiconductor stock to a \"hold\" from a \"buy\" is also discouraging.Nokia (  NOK )Industry: Communications EquipmentMarket Cap: $32 billionCell phone maker and communication company Nokia Corp. (NYSE:  NOK ) has experienced the brunt of the competitive mobile phone market. Year-to-date, Nokia's stock has vastly underperformed, falling -34% in 2010. Over the past 12 months the company has seen a sharp decline of -39.5%. To make matters worse, Nokia has missed earnings estimates for the past two quarters, causing experts to scale back on their predictions for next quarter, with an earnings estimate of $0.14. A net profit margin of just 1% does not have investors thrilled about Nokia stock either.Research in Motion (  RIMM )Industry: Communication EquipmentMarket Cap: $25 billionResearch in Motion Ltd. (NASDAQ:  RIMM ) is famous for its signature Blackberry smartphone. Much like competitor Nokia, RIMM has had a rough go of it in 2010. The stock has slid -33.2% in the last eight months and -38.3% over the past year. That represents a loss of nearly $28 per share over a 12 month period. The smartphone market has been unkind to RIMM lately, as competitors Google (  GOOG ) and Apple are hitting it big with their Droid and iPhone smartphones. And with a recent report that iPhones are becoming more popular in the office , the corporate staple Blackberry may be out of style.Dell (  DELL )Industry: Computers & PeripheralsMarket Cap: $23 billionPersonal Computer producer Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:  DELL ) has seen its stock gradually decline nearly -18% in 2010. A shell of its former self, Dell stocks currently trade at $11.70, a -66.7% drop from August of 2005. InvestorPlace recently reported that Dell sales have dropped significantly due to reduced consumer spending, and corporate buying. Locked in a bidding war with Hewlett-Packard for the tech company 3Par, Dell may see its only real chance for revival slip away if HP makes the purchase. A net profit margin of just 3.5% last quarter is another reason why this clue chip tech stock is a sell.Yahoo! (  YHOO )Industry: Industry Software & ServicesMarket Cap: $18 billionBased in California, Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:  YHOO ) has become a household name thanks to its aptly named website Yahoo.com. Despite the site's popularity, the company's stock has seen a drastic decline of -28.9% since mid-April. Year-to-date the stock is down -22.1%, and is just barely above its 52-week low of $13.03, with a stock price of $13.09. YHOO's stock has been sitting right around that 52-week low price for several weeks, proving that the Internet stock is anything but strong.Adobe (  ADBE )Industry: SoftwareMarket Cap: $15 billionAdobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:  ADBE ) is a diversified software company that offers a line of creative, business, web and mobile software and services used by a variety of clients. Adobe's stock was down slightly through the first six months of 2010, and has seen a sharp drop of -16.4% since mid-June. Year-to-date the stock is down -24.7%, compared to minor declines in the broader markets. Like many of the other stocks on this list, Adobe is not trading much higher than its 52-week low of $26.01. The tech stock currently trades at $27.64.Activision Blizzard (  ATVI )Industry: SoftwareMarket Cap: $13 billionActivision Blizzard Inc. (NASDAQ:  ATVI ) publishes video games for personal computers, gaming consoles and handheld devices. Year-to-date, Activision has seen a modest decline of -4.4%, and a 12-month drop of -8.5%. While Activision's stock performance has not been awful, shareholders must be disheartened by the performance based on the video-game company's releases over the past year. In November, Activision released Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 which has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide. More recently, Activision released Starcraft II in late July and sold more than one million copies in the first day. Despite huge sales, Activision stock has been treading water for the past year, which must certainly upset stockholders.As of this writing, Louis Navellier did not own a position in any of the stocks named here.5 Small Cap Stocks to Buy Now.Small, innovative companies are watching their earnings explode - and they are the next ten-baggers.
