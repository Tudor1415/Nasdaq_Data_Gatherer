It was not immediately clear if any of those parameters would change.The initial plan was to impose a 7% tax on big tech companies\u2019 local revenues from targeted advertising, digital marketplace provision and user data sales despite opposition from the United States where the biggest firms are based.The Czech Republic would follow other countries in Europe with its digital tax after the European Union failed to reach a bloc-wide agreement. The Czech legislation is still subject to parliamentary approval.END", "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) may be the king of search engines, but its presence in the television market has been nearly nonexistent. Sure, its YouTube is the go-to platform for sharing and watching crowd-contributed digital video, and YouTube TV adds actual studio-made programming to the mix. YouTube TV presently hosts a modest 2 million paying subscribers, which translates into a modest $3 billion in annual revenue. That's hardly a show stopper.Don't be surprised if Alphabet's digital television footprint expands much more rapidly over the course of the next five years than it has during the past five, however. The company has made four important moves on the TV front just within the past month that could finally, collectively, turn it into a television powerhouse.END", "By Ross Kerber, Helen Coster and Arriana McLymoreJune 10 (Reuters) - In the past, U.S. corporations have largely remained silent as protests erupted over killings of African-Americans by police officers. That changed with the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which has set off a flurry of corporate statements of solidarity with the black community \u2013 along with pledges of more than $1.7 billion to advance racial justice and equity.The unprecedented outpouring of support, however, has stirred up criticism along with praise. Many social justice advocates, corporate diversity experts and investors say companies also need to focus on equity in their own ranks, especially by hiring and promoting minority workers.The tensions show the difficulty executives face in aligning their firms with popular social causes at a time of soaring wealth and inequality \u2013 and growing pressure from some investors to show leadership on societal problems. Activists, along with some business leaders, also see an opportunity amid global protests to push reform on social justice issues well beyond police brutality.The rush of corporate concern belies the reality of workforce inequity, said Natasha Lamb, managing partner of Arjuna Capital.
