And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $25 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  (Do options carry counterparty risk?  This and six other common options myths debunked).  So unless Fox Corp sees its shares fall 28.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $23.65 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.35 from $25), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.8% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWorth considering, is that the annualized 2.8% figure actually exceeds the 1.3% annualized dividend paid by Fox Corp by 1.5%, based on the current share price of $34.95.  And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 28.41% to reach the $25 strike price.  \n\t\t\t\t\nAlways important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Fox Corp, looking at the dividend history chart for FOXA below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.3% annualized dividend yield.\n\nEND"]}
