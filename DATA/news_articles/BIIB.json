(BIIB) on Wednesday reported net income attributable to the company for the first quarter of $1.40 billion or $8.08 per share, up from $1.41 billion or $7.15 per share in the prior-year quarter.Excluding items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $9.14 per share, compared to $6.98 per share in the year-ago quarter.Total revenue for the quarter grew 1 percent to $3.53 billion from $3.49 billion in the same quarter last year.On average, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report earnings of $7.73 per share for the quarter on revenues of $3.41 billion. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.END", "\nThere are 23 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Biogen Inc, but the average is just that \u2014 a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $245.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $420.00.  The standard deviation is $45.323.\n\n\nBut the whole reason to look at the average BIIB price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with BIIB crossing above that average target price of $336.09/share, investors in BIIB have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $336.09 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Biogen Inc:\n\n\nEND"]}
