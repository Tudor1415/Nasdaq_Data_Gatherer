Or is the company more like PayPal (NASDAQ:) or legacy payment processors like Fiserv (NASDAQ:), Visa (NYSE:) and Mastercard (NYSE:)? Back in October, a Barron\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s article made the case for the latter. In other words, implying more downside for SQ stock.Add in increased competition, and Square does not look like a great opportunity. So, what\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the verdict? Let\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dive in, and see why SQ stock is most likely going to be stuck in neutral in 2020.END", "Investors in Fiserv Inc (Symbol: FISV) saw new options begin trading this week, for the September 18th expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FISV options chain for the new September 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $120.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $120.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $112.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FISV, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $122.24/share today.\n\nBecause the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.00% return on the cash commitment, or 9.13% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, and highlighting in green where the $120.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND"]}
