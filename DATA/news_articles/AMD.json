options become available today, for the September 2021 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 464 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AMD options chain for the new September 2021 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $57.50 strike price has a current bid of $11.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $57.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $46.30 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $58.39/share today.\n\nBecause the $57.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 19.48% return on the cash commitment, or 15.32% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Advanced Micro Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $57.50 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND", "In early trading on Wednesday, shares of Aptiv topped the list of the day's best performing components of the S&P 500 index, trading up 3.5%.

It has a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly\u00a0125, while the forward P/E multiple of 47 does not scream value, either.

I have even written about doing the same for MU stock, but only when all the experts hated it. Today, I will again take cues from the action in AMD, NVDA and INTC. Meaning that chasing Micron and the rest in their spikes will eventually be a mistake. And while this is not the same as suggesting to short them, I am merely pointing out that there might be better starting points in semiconductor stocks.My caution stems mostly from extrinsic factors, nothing against the companies themselves. Again, I stress that I remain committed to buying dips in these great stocks \u2014 especially AMD.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $53.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $50.34 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $53.58/share today.\n\nBecause the $53.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

But in recent months, many of the big chip makers have seen sharp gains.While individual companies will show idiosyncratic reasons for gains, the sector as a whole has been positively impacted by three major factors starting in 2H19. First, and probably most important, is the continuing expansion of 5G mobile networks. The wireless switchover requires new types of modem chips to handle the new signal bands, and chipmakers are seeing increased orders from the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Wireless handsets, routers, modems, transmitters, towers \u2013 all of these will need the new chips.The next main factor is continued demand for memory chips. Data centers are expanding, meeting an urgent need in the digital economy, and the chip makers are seeing orders for new, more powerful, memory and processing chips. Those same chips are also finding customers in the online gaming community. The memory and processing requirements for business and gaming applications frequently overlap, and gamers are notorious for wanting the best systems they can afford.Finally, on the geopolitical front, the US and Chinese governments signed off on the Phase 1 agreement of a trade deal, an important development that promises to defuse the long-running trade and tariff disputes between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Chip makers were exposed to the \u2018trade war\u2019 on multiple fronts \u2013 as exporters from both the US and China, as suppliers of parts to reexported Chinese electronic goods, and as components in goods imported to the US.

Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 9.8% return against the $20 commitment, or a 6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to AMD's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $20 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.

So unless Advanced Micro Devices Inc sees its shares fall 41.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $18.03 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.97 from $20), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Advanced Micro Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $20 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\nEND", "I recently wrote about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:) and suggested a bullish position.

The segment generated revenues of $23.0 billion in 2018, accounting for 32% of the company\u2019s total revenues, and a growth of 21% over the prior year. This can be attributed to a continued uptick in sales of its Xeon scalable processors. In this note we discuss the expected performance of the company\u2019s Data Center Group in the near to medium run. You can view our interactive dashboard analysis on ~\u00a0What\u2019s Driving Our $51 Price Estimate For Intel?\u00a0~ for more details on the expected performance of the company. In addition, you can see more of our data for\u00a0information technology companies here.Intel\u2019s Data Center Group segment includes revenue from the sales of\u00a0processors and chipsets designed for the enterprise, cloud, communications infrastructure, and technical computing segments.\u00a0 The company\u2019s share in the global data center total available market was around 33% in 2018. Of late, AMD has been gaining share from Intel in desktops, notebooks, as well as the server markets, led by its Ryzen and EPYC processors. In fact, AMD has managed to gain close to 2% market share (y-o-y) in servers as of Q1 2019. The overall data center market demand slowed in the recent past, primarily in China, and this impacted Intel\u2019s Q1 segment sales. While the company faces near term demand headwinds, the segment could see growth rebound in the medium to long run. In fact, the total available data center market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% to $90 billion by 2022.While the company\u2019s Xeon scalable is the market leader, AMD\u2019s EPYC Rome architecture could pose a further threat with its strong performance.\u00a0Intel cut its Data Center Group revenue forecast for the full year 2019, and it now expects the sales to be down in mid-single-digits, due to weakened demand from China, and inventory absorption. The figure for the full year could be around $21.6 billion, in our view. While the company could see revenue grow in the medium term run to north of $25 billion by 2022, it could translate into a 5% loss of market share to 28% from 33% currently. The market at large will likely benefit from growth in cloud computing, which will result in increased sales of bigger, faster, and higher-end servers at the expense of cheaper ones.\u00a0What\u2019s behind Trefis?

Second-generation Ryzen chips closed that performance gap further, but Intel still claimed the single-threaded performance crown.While AMD was not quite at parity with Intel, its share of the desktop PC CPU market share surged to 15.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to Mercury Research, its best mark since Q4 2014, and up 3.9 percentage points year over year.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $19.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $17.16 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $19.39/share today.Because the $19.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

So when Micron Technologies (NASDAQ: MU ) confounded the markets with its consistent single-digit price-to-earnings ratio last year, investors should have exercised caution. The good news is that the patient investor may wait out the cyclical downturn in the chip sector. It will take another six to nine months before reaching a demand and supply equilibrium. Within the graphics chip space, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has the clearest headwinds to work through. In knowing what inventory it needs to work through, NVDA stock could start recovering within one or two quarters.Nvidia experienced excess inventory in the channels, which hurt its revenue forecasts. It blamed the crypto hangover for the excess supply imbalance. At significantly lower prices, cryptocurrency is not likely to recover any time soon. This is the bad news for anyone holding crypto. For NVDA and AdvancedMicro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) shareholders, chances are good that the excess GPUs on the market will clear.The two firms likely benefited from an increase in sales during the holiday season, after retailers offered rebates and discounts on graphics cards. Once the last-generation card supplies are cleared, game developers will embrace Nvidia's ray-tracing. RTX card sales slumped in the last quarter and will be weak again for the next two quarters due to cheaper models still on the market.END", "Investors in Advanced Micro Devices Inc (Symbol: AMD) saw new options begin trading this week, for the March 15th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 71 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AMD options chain for the new March 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $17.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.09. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $17.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $14.91 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $17.43/share today.Because the $17.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 12.29% return on the cash commitment, or 63.24% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Advanced Micro Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $17.00 strike is located relative to that history:END", "For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL -January 3, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog.

Thanks to generous federal tax credits and $90 billion in investment in clean energy sources from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, that figure had grown to 31 Gigawatts by the beginning of 2017 - a 2500% increase.

After showing major relative out-performance into September, stocks like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) in October moved into sharp mean-reversion (lower) mode. AMD stock as a result has now finally reached levels where better reward to risk buying opportunities are found.The concept of \"mean-reversion\" in the stock market is a powerful one and unfortunately not one that is being paid sufficient attention to by the majority of traders and investors. In other words, although stocks and other assets always move up and down, sometimes moves in one direction or another become so excessive that buyers (in the case of a bull run) eventually get exhausted or sellers (in the case of a sell-off) eventually become tired. It is at those junctures of either maximum bullishness (greed) or maximum bearishness (fear) that stocks often make sharp mean-reversion moves.To wit, shares of Advanced Micro Devices from this past July into the September highs rallied around 115% and left the charts in vertical overshooting mode.END", "The best performing sector as of midday Wednesday is the Technology & Communications sector, up 2.5%.

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $24.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $23.17 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $25.39/share today.Because the $24.50 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 176 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AMD options chain for the new February 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $21.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.27. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $21.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $18.73 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $21.80/share today.Because the $21.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract .

The company's Turing line brings ray tracing to real-time graphics, which should help computer and video game graphics appear more lifelike and realistic than ever before due to the ability to trace the path of light as it interacts with objects. \"Hybrid rendering will change the industry, opening up amazing possibilities that enhance our lives with more beautiful designs, richer entertainment and more interactive experiences,\" Huang said at the conference. \"The arrival of real-time ray tracing is the Holy Grail of our industry.\"Nvidia's announcement clearly has many investors excited. The new graphics cards with Turing technology will be available in the fourth quarter and look poised to be in high demand in both the gaming sector and the quickly growing data center industry. Yet, even without these new chips, Nvidia's business remains strong despite the drop in demand from cryptocurrency miners as its gaming unit continues to play a major role in the multibillion-dollar industry.Last quarter the firm's gaming division soared 68% to reach $1.72 billion, while its total Q1 revenues surged 66% from $1.94 billion in the year-ago period to $3.21 billion. Meanwhile, the company's ever-growing data center business skyrocketed 71% to reach $701 million. Nvidia boasts data center clients that include giants Amazon AMZN , Microsoft MSFT , and Alphabet GOOGL -which have all invested heavily in chips that power their new artificial intelligence ventures.END", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has always been a solid tech investment, but it has truly come to life over the past two-and-a-half years. In 2016, NVDA stock gained nearly 234%. Although the following year dipped in magnitude, the 86% boost was still very impressive.Even now, with NVDA stock currently up nearly 31%, shares still resonate with investors. However, critics have come out of the woodwork, and it's difficult to ignore their perspective. On a technical level, shares have moved substantially over the past few years. At a certain point, investors should expect a correction.Fundamentally, the valuation for NVDA stock has become very rich . Shares trade at 43-times trailing earnings and 32.5-times forward earnings. That hasn't been a problem during its multi-year run up. Nvidia levers impressive strengths in its financials, including a strong balance sheet and class-leading profitability margins.

(Symbol: AMD) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $15.77, changing hands for $16.36/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 13 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $9.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $21.00. The standard deviation is $4.029.But the whole reason to look at the average AMD price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with AMD crossing above that average target price of $15.77/share, investors in AMD have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $15.77 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

To give investors a quick overview of AMD's business, we have created an interactive dashboard using Trefis' technology that shows what AMD does, how it has performed in recent years, and how is it likely to grow in the next 2 years.AMD's Revenue & EBITDA Composition \n\n\n\n As you can see in the chart above, AMD's Computing & Graphics division (Dark Grey bar) accounts for nearly 53% of its revenue, with the remaining coming from Enterprise, Embedded & Semi-Custom segment (Light Grey bar). However, Computing & Graphics only accounts for 34% of total EBITDA, despite our expectation that the division's EBITDA margin will be positive for full year 2017. The figure for the last 2 years was negative, which alludes to the strength that Intel and Nvidia have in the CPU and GPU businesses, respectively. Nevertheless, AMD is doing better in Enterprise, Embedded & Semi-Custom businesses where its EBITDA margin is expected to be 12%-13% for full year 2017.AMD's Past Revenue & EBITDA Growth \n\n\n\nBetween 2012 and 2015, AMD's revenue plummeted from $5.4 billion to around $4 billion. However, we estimate that the company's full year 2017 revenue was up by nearly 20% for 2016 at around $5.2 billion.

AMD certainly has the technical knowhow to do so. If some of these expectations pan out, AMD's earnings - and likely its valuation - could find some room to grow further this year. We have created an interactive valuation calculator dashboard using Trefis' interactive technology where you can modify inputs such as EBITDA multiples and fundamentals determining AMD's 2018 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). \n\n\n\nOur base case gives a $15.50 price estimate for AMD, assuming that the company's EBITDA multiple will decline to nearly 18 compared to 23 for 2017, and its EBITDA for 2018 will surpass $800 million. We estimate that AMD's Computing and Graphics EBITDA for 2018 will hit $400 million mark, equaling the figure for its Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Group. These forecasts are based on the assumption that AMD will see strong revenue growth along with meaningful margin expansion. We expect this to be driven by adoption of EPYC and Ryzen processors, price increases and higher demand for Radeon GPUs.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $10.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $10.28 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $12.08/share today.Because the $10.50 strike represents an approximate 13% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract .
