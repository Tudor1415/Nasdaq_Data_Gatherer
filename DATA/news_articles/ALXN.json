While it is true that last year too started on a cheerful note with expectations of a ramp-up in M&A activity, propelled by the implementation of the new tax law, thereby leaving more cash in the hands of companies, the deals however, dried up after the initial euphoria.Key acquisitions in 2018 included Bayer's takeover of Monsanto for $63 billion, Novartis snapping up AveXis, Inc. and Endocyte plus Sanofi grabbing Ablynx and Bioverativ, Celgene's buyout of Juno Therapeutics, Alexion's acquisition of Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics and Syntimmune et al. GlaxoSmithKline plc has also announced an agreement to acquire commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company Tesaro, Inc with a focus on oncology.The landscape in the drug/biotech sector is rapidly changing. A slowdown in mature products due to increasing competition and rise of biosimilars has forced most pharma bigwigs to eye lucrative acquisitions to bolster their pipeline. Small tuck-in acquisitions are quite frequent too. While amalgamation of complementary product portfolios and overlapping pipelines are a key reason for mega deals, smaller biotechs are generally bought owing to innovative pipelines.END", "Investors in Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Symbol: ALXN) saw new options become available today, for the February 2019 expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ALXN options chain for the new February 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $90.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ALXN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $95.78/share today.Because the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.05% return on the cash commitment, or 42.89% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., and highlighting in green where the $95.00 strike is located relative to that history:END", "We issued an updated report on Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc .

Inbrija is expected to be launched during the first quarter of 2019.The regulatory agency nod was based on data from a pivotal phase III placebo-controlled study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of Inbrija in approximately 900 patients afflicted with PD and undergoing carbidopa / levodopa regimen but still experiencing OFF periods, which means the return of Parkinson's symptoms. The study met the primary endpoint with Inbrija demonstrating clinically meaningful improvements in motor function as measured by the UPDRS Part III in comparison to placebo.We would like to remind investors that previously, the FDA was expected to make its decision on Inbrija in October this year. However, in September the FDA delayed its verdict by three months and set an action date of Jan 5, 2019. The FDA approval thus comes slightly earlier than expected. Inbrija is also under review in the EU with a decision expected soon.The time line was postponed by the FDA after Acorda submitted additional information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls on the regulatory body's request.

The new tax reforms left more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies that could be invested for M&A activity. The first few months lived up to the bullish expectations but the number of mergers and acquisitions dwindled thereafter, probably because potential acquisition targets demanded a premium.Key acquisitions this year included Bayer's $63 billion buyout of Monsanto, Sanofi's SNY multi-billion dollar buyouts of Ablynx and Bioverativ, Celgene's CELG purchase of Juno Therapeutics, Novartis' (NVS) acquisition of AveXis and Roche's (RHHBY) purchase of Foundation Medicine.

Also, Glaxo's $13 billion buyout of Novartis' 36.5% stake in their consumer health care joint venture in June was given a heads up by the investor community.Overall, the outlook for pharma/biotech M&A deal remains bullish for 2019 due to growing availability of capital for these firms and a lot of innovation happening in the sector.Drug/biotech companies regularly merge with or acquire competitors in mega deals to achieve critical mass both in research and development (R&D) and sales and marketing.

The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.Other FactorsPlus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 1 estimate has gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon.

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Alexion Pharmaceuticals, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Alexion Pharmaceuticals is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank.

The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.34 per share to $1.33 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Alexion Pharmaceuticals right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing.

It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.80. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.1% return against the $75 commitment, or a 2.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ALXN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $75 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.

The deal will see the companies collaborating for the development and commercialization of Conatus' lead pipeline candidate, emricasan, which is being developed for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH, a common but often \"silent\" liver disease.

(Symbol: ALXN) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $115.50/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $7.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 9.9% return against the $75 commitment, or a 4.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ALXN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $75 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. ( Do options carry counterparty risk? This and six other common options myths debunked ). So unless Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. sees its shares fall 35.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $67.60 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $7.40 from $75), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.7% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., and highlighting in green where the $75 strike is located relative to that history:END", "Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel , one standout is the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (Symbol: IBB) where we have detected an approximate $1.1 billion dollar inflow -- that's a 16.1% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 24,800,000 to 28,800,000).

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $85 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $5.70. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.7% return against the $85 commitment, or a 5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ALXN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $85 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.

So unless Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. sees its shares decline 35.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $79.30 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $5.70 from $85), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., and highlighting in green where the $85 strike is located relative to that history:END", "Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.ALXN announced that new long-term data from an ongoing, open-label extension of the pivotal phase III ARISE study on Kanuma, in children and adults suffering from lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D), were presented at the World Congress of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition.Data demonstrated that marked and sustained improvements in disease-related lipid and liver abnormalities were observed in patients with LAL-D when treated with Kanuma.

The lawsuit mentions that Gilead has reaped tens of billions of dollars in sales of those drugs, without the University's authorization and also without compensating the University.All three drugs brought in total sales of more than $8 billion in the first half of 2016 while combined sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi crossed $19 billion last year. Epclusa is a recent addition to Gilead's HCV portfolio.

That's when an undervalued stock can quickly become a fast-rising growth stock.Today I'd like to present a company that's transitioning from a decade of chronic net losses to solid profitability-and whose earnings growth rate is expected to surge ahead of its competitors through the year 2020.Vertex Pharmaceuticals ( VRTX ) is a biotech company that develops breakthrough drugs and carries them through to the manufacturing process. Vertex is a clear leader in the treatment of cystic fibrosis ( CF ). Its CF therapies can potentially treat about half of the world's CF patients, which could generate billions of dollars in sales.Vertex is currently negotiating with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) on pricing of cystic fibrosis treatment Orkambi in the U.K. The stock has been volatile in relation to news on the Orkambi pricing issue, despite Vertex management's expressed confidence that they can achieve a resolution.But the stock market has yet to embrace that potential outcome. VRTX remains an extremely undervalued stock.The company also develops treatments for anti-inflammatory conditions, cancer and other serious diseases, with at least six drug candidates in its pipeline. A phase III cystic fibrosis treatment is due for completion in July 2017.Earnings Growth of 207%!After only one barely-profitable year between 2006 and 2015, Vertex is expected to earn $1.11 per share in 2016, $3.41 per share in 2017 (December year-end) reflecting 207% earnings growth in 2017, and surpass $11.00 per share by the year 2020.That puts Vertex on target for much stronger earnings growth through 2020 than most other big names in the biotech sector, including Alexion ( ALXN ), Amgen ( AMGN ), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) , and Gilead (GILD).Now that Vertex is turning a profit, it will qualify as a candidate for a myriad of institutional growth stock portfolios that screen for annual net income. That means lots of potential stock-buying activity, which will push the share price upwards.Most investors will immediately recognize, as I did, that 207% earnings growth, coupled with an extremely low 2017 P/E of 25.4, flags VRTX as a wildly undervalued stock in the midst of an aggressive growth period.It's no wonder that institutional investors own 98% of this large-cap stock. VRTX appears to be a slam-dunk capital gain opportunity. (The stock does not pay a dividend.)Vertex has a 42% long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio-a perfectly acceptable number.And the news only gets better! Let's look at the stock's two-year and five-month charts.Now is a Great Time to Buy Vertex Pharmaceuticals ( VRTX )VRTX reached its all-time high closing price at 141.48 in August 2015. The stock then lost over 40% in value as the market corrected in September and in January, and then proceeded to trade sideways February through May. Finally, VRTX broke out of its trading range at the end of May, but it was a false breakout. The share price came back down with the market downturn in June.This appears to be a temporary pullback for this great, undervalued stock with tremendous growth potential-and history. This is a great time to buy VRTX!Traders can jump out as VRTX approaches medium-term upside resistance at 110. Everyone else should hold their shares for future capital gains.

Some of the immediately pressing concerns are a possible recession in the UK, unemployment woes, a plunging pound, and uncertainty regarding M&A deals in the UK among others.A big question is how will Brexit impact drug companies?The first thing that comes to mind is the impact of Brexit on the drug approval process in the UK and EU. Currently, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) looks into the approval process under a centralized authorization procedure which allows drug companies to submit a single marketing authorization application to the EMA. Under this process, the companies are able to market their medicines throughout the EU on the basis of a single marketing authorization thereby saving cost and time.But with Brexit, a lot now depends on whether the UK will remain within the ambit of the EMA the way countries like Norway are or whether the UK will set up its own regulatory authority for drug approval. If the first scenario prevails, the approval process will continue as it is. However, if the UK sets up its own regulatory agency, the approval process could end up being lengthier as well as more expensive for companies seeking UK and EU approval for their drugs.END", "\u2022 Hertz Global Holdings, Inc's (  HTZ ) shares increased 5.9% after the activist investor Carl Icahn raised his stake in the company from 14.3% to 15.2%\u2022 Shares of Axiall Corporation (  AXLL ) jumped 8.8% on news that Lotte Chemical will bid to acquire the company for $3.1 billion\u2022 Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc's (  VRX ) shares slumped 14.6% after forecasting full-year earnings at $6.60-$7.00 per share, down from previous projection of $8.50-$9.50 per share\u2022 Shares of United Natural Foods, Inc.

It also doesn't hurt that dividend stocks tend to attract more risk-averse, long-term-oriented investors, which has the positive effect of reducing volatility.There are a lot of dividend stocks to choose from as an investor, but that's far from the case in the biotech sector.

Think about that for a moment: $1 trillion equates to 1.3% of global GDP, and is higher than the cumulative annual GDP of all but 15 countries around the world. And looking forward, global pharmaceutical spending is only expected to increase. IMS Health projects that spending could rise by 30% between 2014 and 2018 to $1.3 trillion.Why prescription drug prices are soaringWhy are pharmaceutical prices rising so rapidly? As we've discussed previously, there are nearly a dozen reasons why prescription drug prices are soaring worldwide. Some are expected and include the need to cover research and development and marketing costs for new drugs. But other reasons for rising prescription costs often fly under the radar.For example, we know drug developers need to cover their R&D costs to develop a drug, but consumers often forget that drug developers are also looking to recoup losses tied to research into dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of failed discovery, preclinical, or clinical therapies that didn't make it to pharmacy shelves.Drugmakers are also making a strong push into treating orphan diseases (indications with 200,000 or fewer people in the U.S.) and developing medicines that are personalized and focus on a specific gene or protein within a patient. The move makes a lot of sense on the part of drug developers, as there's minimal competition and little reason for insurers to deny coverage. This push toward specialization has been a major reason why prescription drug prices keep heading higher.END", "Biotech is the name of the game this year, seeing spectacular gains consistently.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $205.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $197.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ALXN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $208.06/share today.Because the $205.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

There are several good answers to that question. Strong research and development comes to mind, for example. So does smart financial management, particularly during the clinical development stage.Ultimately, though, the key to success in biotech is the same basic key that exists in other industries. I can't think of any competitive advantage more important than one emphasized by Warren Buffett: an economic moat. Buffett once stated that he looks for \"economic castles protected by unbreachable moats\". In other words, he likes companies with products that don't face tough competition. So how do biotechs build these moats?Blue oceanSeveral years ago, the term \"blue ocean\" became popular in business circles thanks to the best-selling book Blue Ocean Strategy . \"Blue ocean\" referred to new markets in which there were no competitors. Few industries have as many obvious blue oceans as biotech, primarily because of the opportunities to develop drugs for orphan diseases -- rare conditions that affect relatively few people and usually have few (if any) effective treatments.Alexion Pharmaceuticals stands out as an example of a biotech that focused on treating an orphan disease to create a wide moat. The company's drug Soliris received approval from the FDA and European Medicines Agency in 2007 as a treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH. PNH is a rare blood disease that affects only one to two people in a million.END", "The Celgene Corporation CELG - Juno Therapeutics' JUNO immunotherapy deal worth at least a billion dollars was the main story in the biotech sector this week.

Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 11% return against the $145 commitment, or a 6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ALXN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.

So unless Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. sees its shares fall 21% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $129.00 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $16.00 from $145), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., and highlighting in green where the $145 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $145 strike for the 6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

Results showed that AGS-004 failed to lower the median viral load in patients in the treatment group after 12 weeks of interruption in antiretroviral therapy (ATI) compared to placebo.However, the study revealed that AGS-004 has the potential to stimulate memory T-cell responses, which may cast a direct impact on the latent viral reservoir. According to the data, 70% of the AGS-004-treated patients who completed the ATI achieved positive antiviral memory T-cell responses prior to ATI compared to none in the placebo group. Additionally, within the treatment group, patients who achieved antiviral memory T-cell responses showed significantly fewer CD4+ T-cells with integrated HIV DNA compared to the non-responders.Argos Therapeutics believes that based on these results, AGS-004 can be used in an ongoing HIV eradication study in adults (expected to enter stage II in the next few months) and a planned pediatric study (expected to commence in 2015), where one of the key objectives is the reduction of the latent HIV reservoir.

In addition, Shire plans to assess the need for collecting additional clinical data in support of other potential international regulatory submissions.We note that the acquisition of SARcode Bioscience in 2013 added the phase III candidate lifitegrast to Shire's pipeline. The news was encouraging as lifitegrast did not meet one of its prespecified co-primary endpoint (the sign of inferior corneal staining score) in a phase III study, OPUS-2, in Dec 2013 even though the other prespecified co-primary endpoint for the patient-reported symptom of eye dryness was achieved.Meanwhile, Shire plans to form an Ophthalmics Business Unit (BU) that will focus on the commercialization of its pipeline products in ophthalmology.END", "Looking at units outstanding versus one week prior within the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel, the biggest outflow was seen in the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLF ), where 4,850,000 units were destroyed, or a 0.6% decrease week over week.

Successful development and subsequent commercialization of pipeline candidates augment their top line. Positive pipeline related news have the potential to cause stock price appreciation. Similarly, pipeline setbacks can deflate a stock.Earlier in the week, GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) suffered a pipeline setback when its cardiovascular candidate darapladib performed disappointingly in a phase III study (SOLID-TIMI 52: n>13,000). The study evaluated the efficacy of the candidate (as a combination therapy) versus placebo in adults after an acute coronary syndrome. Top-line results from the study revealed that darapladib failed to attain the study's primary objective of reducing major coronary events compared to placebo on being added to the standard of care. Glaxo will present detailed data from the study at a medical conference later.We note that this is the second event-driven phase III study on darapladib in coronary heart disease. We remind investors that in Nov 2013, Glaxo had announced disappointing top-line data from the first study (STABILITY) as well.Data from that study had revealed that treatment with darapladib did not cause a statistically significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (comprised of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke) versus placebo in CHD patients, thus failing to meet the study's primary endpoint.

The charges sent Insys tumbling as the website stated that according to an affidavit from Marc Heggemeyer, a special agent for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, Office of Investigations, Awerbuch was responsible for approximately 20.3% of Subsys scrips prescribed to Medicare beneficiaries in the U.S. in the Jan 2009 to Feb 2014 time period.The Clarifying StatementIn response to this news, Insys issued a clarifying statement. Insys stated that it takes patient safety seriously and works with physicians for the proper prescribing and use of Subsys.

Alnylam's first quarter 2014 loss of 39 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.18 but wider than the year-ago loss of 15 cents per share. The wider year-over-year loss was primarily due to lower revenues and higher expenses.Revenues for the reported quarter were down 55.6% to $8.3 million. Revenues in the quarter decreased due to the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue of $9.7 million from Alnylam's agreement with Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( CBST ) in the year-ago quarter. The top line was also short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12 million.Quarter in DetailRevenues in the first quarter of 2014 included $5.5 million from its collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited ( TKPYY ), in addition to $2.8 million from the company's alliance with a couple of other companies.Research and development (R&D) expenses went up approximately 97.3% to $43.8 million.

BioThrax sales declined 20% to $24.5 million in the quarter due to the timing of deliveries to the Strategic National Stockpile.We note that BioThrax is the sole vaccine to be cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease. Emergent BioSolutions is looking to get BioThrax approved for the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of anthrax resulting from exposure (suspected or confirmed) to bacillus anthracis in combination with antibiotics for treating patients with suspected or confirmed exposure to anthrax spores.Last month, the FDA awarded orphan drug status to the vaccine for the PEP indication. The status makes the drug eligible for seven years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. following approval for the orphan indication. Emergent BioSolutions will not be required to pay the fees associated with the filing of the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) as a result of orphan status granted by the U.S. regulatory body.

The NYSE ARCA Biotech Index (^BTK) and NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (^NBI) have declined more than 7.8% and 7.9%, respectively, in the last 2 months.The sell-off was triggered by lawmakers issuing a letter to Gilead Sciences Inc.

The drug, priced at $84,000 for an 84-day treatment (12 weeks), came under the scanner for being way too expensive. This led to further speculations about lawmakers putting pressure on biotech companies to cut their prices.It is however worth noting that this sell-off was more due to a change in sentiment rather than a shift in industry fundamentals. Recently, a trend reversal has also been noticed with the NYSE ARCA Biotech Index and NASDAQ Biotechnology recovering approximately 4.6% and 5.5%, respectively last week. Investor expectations from biotech companies are building up as the Q1 earnings season kicks in. Several major biotech companies are expected to report their first quarter earnings this week.The currently subdued prices provide investors an attractive entry point.

Emergent BioSolutions is now looking to get BioThrax approved for the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) indication in combination with antibiotics for treating patients with suspected or confirmed exposure to anthrax spores.The last licensure-enabling trial in Emergent BioSolutions' BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed) PEP program was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic for treating bacterial infections) when administered before and after the administration of a three-dose series of BioThrax.The study also evaluated the immune response to BioThrax when administered with or without ciprofloxacin. Data from the study, which met its primary and secondary endpoints, did not reveal any interaction between ciprofloxacin and BioThrax.

The sector, which has had an incredibly good run over the last two years, tumbled in the latter part of March with the trigger being a letter issued to Gilead ( GILD ) by lawmakers.This letter basically questioned Gilead's pricing of its newly approved hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Sovaldi, and immediately led to concerns that lawmakers will force biotech companies to cut prices of their drugs which in turn would affect their results. So companies like Biogen ( BIIB ) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

According to the company, approximately 9.5 million people are suffering from type II diabetes in Japan.

Considering the fact that the prevalence of hepatitis C is higher in low-income and minority patients, the pricing policy from Gilead has come under severe criticism.The letter has raised several questions including the methodology used by Gilead for the drug's pricing and the extent to which the company is providing discounts to lower-income patients.

This next-generation blood test has the capacity to steadily supplant the century-old tuberculin skin test (TST) used in screening TB infections.Qiagen's QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube is among the five growth drivers of the company. The product's sales rose by more than 20% at Constant Exchange Rate (CER) in 2013 contributing to 6% of total sales in 2013.

The company presented encouraging early stage data from the SB-728-T program at the conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections (CROI).SB-728-T makes use of the company's zinc finger DNA-binding protein nucleases (ZFN) genome- editing technology. SB-728-T is an autologous CD4+ T-cell candidate where the gene for CCR5, a co-receptor for the dreaded virus to enter, is modified using ZFN-mediated genome editing to disrupt the CCR5 protein. The disruption of the CCR5 protein makes the relevant T-cells resistant to infection by the most common HIV strain.Data from a phase I /II open-label, dose escalation, multi-center study (SB-728-1101) revealed that HIV patients treated with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company 's ( BMY ) chemotherapy drug Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide) responded better to the subsequent SB-728-T infusion. The patients did not take antiretroviral drugs. The candidate was found to be safe and well tolerated.However, the positive results were witnessed for a very small population. The highest dose of Cytoxan, 1.0 g/m2, prior to SB-728-T infusion led to the greatest decrease in viral load. Data revealed that the virus stabilized (but was detectable) in 2 of the 3 patients treated with the dose.

The NICE, while acknowledging that Soliris was a very effective drug for treating aHUS - a rare blood disorder, has asked Alexion to clarify the high price associated with the drug (\u00a334,200 per adult). The NICE said that Soliris therapy for aHUS patients in the UK would cost \u00a357.8 million to the National Health Service in the first year (assuming approval). The acknowledgement of the efficacy of Soliris for treating aHUS is in line with the positive recommendations issued by the advisory group for national specialised services (AGNSS) and NHS England on the same.Due to the high cost, the independent advisory committee has asked for additional information from the company such as its research and development costs on Soliris. NICE also intends to seek clarifications from NHS England on the treatment costs before issuing a final guidance to the latter.Soliris is already available in markets such as the U.S., Japan and the EU for aHUS.

The drug contributed CHF5 million to Actelion's total revenues in the final quarter of 2013 following its launch in Nov 2013. The company said that the drug was well received by the prescribers in the U.S. Opsumit has been seeing strong demand since its launch.The drug has also received approval in the EU (Dec 2013), Canada (Nov 2013) and Australia (Feb 2014). In Jan 2014, the company launched Opsumit in Canada and Germany. Actelion is looking to get Opsumit approved in other countries as well. The company expects peak sales of Opsumit to even exceed Tracleer sales, a blockbuster PAH drug at Actelion.END", "Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Genomic Health Inc. ( GHDX ), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in GHDX.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 9 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared to no upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from earnings of 11 cents a share a month ago to its current level of loss of 84 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Genomic Health has seen 5 downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to loss of 19 cents a share from break-even level over the past 30 days.END", "Qiagen NV ( QGEN ) recently divulged its plans to launch innovative products that will minimize the two major roadblocks in the next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform viz. sample preparation and bioinformatics.Qiagen revealed certain details about these products that will allow next-generation sequencing users to deal with difficult samples tactfully and gain more coherent data in return.

Soliris is available in the U.S, EU, Japan and many other countries for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is a rare genetic blood disorder.

Moreover, operating expenses will also move up in the final quarter of 2013 due to Alexion's efforts to expand.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Alexion is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Also, some investors are pondering if there are implications for Celldex's ( CLDX ) rindopepimut. I have been working for some time on an update report on rindopepimut so that this report was well in the works before the ICT-107 results were released.The mechanism of action of rindopepimut is quite different from ICT-107; the latter uses a technology that loads dendritic cells with six synthetic peptide mimetics of commonly expressed glioblastoma antigens. Rindopepimut targets one specific antigen, EGFRvIII that is a mutation of the EGFR receptor that is expressed in roughly 30% of newly diagnosed glioblastomas. Perhaps importantly, it isbelieved to create an immune response to cancer through antibodies while ICT-107 appears to act more through T-cell activation.In terms of clinical trial data that led to broader clinical trials, ICT-107 development expanded intoPhase II trials on the basis of an open labelPhase I trial in 16 patients. Rindopepimut has reported data from three open label trials that involved 105 patients and in which the results were consistent across all three trials. A major difference between IMUC and Celldex as companies is that IMUC is essentially dependent on ICT-107 and has a strained balance sheet. CLDX has a broad pipeline of products and is in a powerful cash position with about $323 million of cash.END", "Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( ALXN ) provided additional information on its voluntary recall of two lots of the company's sole marketed product Soliris. Alexion stated that this voluntary move was prompted by the presence of visible particles in vials in the two lots of the drug. Alexion believes these have the potential to affect the safety of patients in two broad areas: immunogenicity and thromboembolic events.Alexion said that it has issued instructions to hospitals as well as users to return unused vials of Soliris from both the affected lots . Last month, Alexion had given similar instructions but they were limited to the distributor level.Soliris is available for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Japanese approval for Soliris in the aHUS indication came in Sep 2013.Alexion believes the voluntary recall will not impact the supply of Soliris. Though current supplies of Soliris may not be interrupted, we believe further slipups regarding Soliris will impact the drug's supplies. This will be catastrophic for the company since it is entirely dependent on Soliris for growth.END", " END", "By Smith On Stocks :Review of Amazing and Volatile Stock Price PerformanceFrom the closing price on December 30, 2011 through October 1, 2013, Celldex's ( CLDX ) stock price increased 15 fold from $2.60 to $37.83; its shares have recently backed off to about $26.00. The number of shares outstanding nearly doubled over this 21 month time frame from 44.2 million to 81.1 million and the market capitalization increased 27 fold from $115 million to $3.1 billion.This is a vivid example of what is so compelling about investing in emerging biotechnology companies. While the number of investment failures may significantly exceed the number of successes, there are occasional spectacular successes that can more than offset several failures in a balanced portfolio of emerging biotechnology stocks. It is also a graphic example of the extreme volatility on the upside and downside that can occur with emerging biotechnology stocks.In the next table, I have pointed out a few key points that were important in this dramatic stock price increase. The analysts' day presentation on January 23, 2012 may have gotten the ball rolling as the company explained that there would be important clinical trial data in 2012 on EMERGE, aPhase IIb trial of CDX-011 in refractory breast cancer andPhase II data on the use of the cancer vaccine rindopepimut in glioblastoma.END", "Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Earnings were above the year-ago adjusted earnings by 36%. The year-over-year rise in earnings was attributable to higher product sales. Including one-time items, third-quarter 2013 earnings came in at 47 cents per share, flat year over year.Alexion's revenues jumped 36% to approximately $400.4 million in the third quarter of 2013 driven by strong Soliris sales. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $396 million.Adjusted operating expenses climbed approximately 37% to $178.8 million in the third quarter of 2013. The increase was attributable to a rise in both research and development (R&D) expenses (up 36%) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (up 37%). The increase in R&D expenses was attributable to the company's efforts to develop its pipeline.Pipeline UpdateAlexion currently has several candidates in clinical development focusing on different areas.

Soliris is available for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).Alexion Pharma expects 2013 revenues in the range of $1.520-$1.530 billion. The company expects adjusted earnings for 2013 in the range of $3.02 to $3.04 per share. The company will provide detailed guidance for 2014 at its fourth quarter 2013 conference call later this month.Alexion Pharma is expecting six product approvals within the time period of 2014 to 2018 including asfotase alfa (hypophosphatasia), ALXN 1101 (MoCD type A) and Soliris' label expansion. Asfotase alfa is expected to be approved by year end. This will reduce the company's dependence on Soliris for growth.In a bid to expand, Alexion Pharma inked a deal with the privately held Moderna Therapeutics for the discovery and development of messenger ribo nucleic acid (mRNA) therapeutics to treat patients suffering from rare diseases. The drug discovery platform can expedite the development and manufacture of candidates for treating patients with rare diseases. Under the terms of the deal, Alexion will make an upfront payment of $100 million to Moderna for purchasing 10 product options to develop and commercialize therapies utilizing the mRNA platform.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Abraxane for the above indication in Sep 2013. The FDA clearance marks the first approval of a drug for the metastatic pancreatic cancer indication in nearly eight years.We note that Abraxane in combination with Gemzar is also under review in the EU for the advanced pancreatic cancer indication. Abraxane is also under review in many other countries for the indication.We note that this is the third indication for which Abraxane has been approved. Abraxane is already available as a second-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer.

The patients stand a moderate risk of being affected by cardiovascular diseases.Alirocumab is a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) antibody. Alirocumab works by blocking the PCSK9 pathway to lower LDL-cholesterol levels.Data from the study revealed that 24 weeks of treatment with alirocumab lowered levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C/ bad cholesterol) by 47.2% compared to a 15.6% reduction witnessed in patients treated solely with Merck & Co. Inc.'s ( MRK ) cardiovascular drug Zetia (ezetimibe: 10 mg). Patients in the alirocumab arm injected themselves with 75 mg of the candidate every 14 days. The dosage was doubled at the 12th week of the study in patients with LDL cholesterol levels exceeding 70 mg/dl at week 8. However, the high dose was not needed in majority of the patients. Regeneron/Sanofi intend to present detailed data from the study at a medical conference next year.We note that ODYSSEY MONO is part of the ODYSSEY phase III program (n>23,000). The program includes multiple trials. Enrollment has been completed in most of the trials. Successful development of the cholesterol fighter would boost the companies' top line significantly as the cardiovascular market offers significant commercial potential.

Approval has also been sought for the same indication in Canada. Celgene is also evaluating apremilast in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe psoriasis. U.S. approval for the moderate-to-severe psoriasis indication is expected to be sought by Dec 31, 2013. Moreover, Celgene intends to seek EU approval for apremilast in the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications by year end.Results of pre-specified sub-analyses from the phase III (ESTEEM 1) study revealed significant improvement in apremilast treated patients suffering from nail and scalp psoriasis at 16 weeks. Results further revealed that the patients continued to show improvements through 32 weeks. Moreover, apremilast treatment caused significant improvements in health-related quality-of-life parameters in plaque psoriasis patients. The improvements witnessed at week 16 were maintained through week 32.Apremilast is also undergoing phase III studies in the ankylosing spondylitis indication. The candidate is also being evaluated for treating patients suffering from Beh\u00e7et's disease (encouraging results from a phase II study were presented in Jun 2013). Celgene is also advancing the development of the early-stage candidates in its pipeline. We believe that the successful development and commercialization of the pipeline would boost Celgene's top line further.END", "Hospira, Inc. ( HSP ) has been facing manufacturing issues over the past few quarters. In Nov 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a directive prohibiting Hospira from importing its Symbiq medication infusion pumps, manufactured in Costa Rica, to the U.S. The directive is a setback for the company. The facility at Costa Rica makes most of Hospira's infusion devices and sets (Symbiq, Plum etc.).The import ban was expanded by the FDA in Feb 2013. Following the fresh directive, Hospira is also prohibited from importing Plum, GemStar and LifeCare PCA infusion pumps, manufactured in Costa Rica, to the U.S. Hospira expects the expansion of the import ban to adversely impact its 2013 net sales by $50-$100 million. Moreover, manufacturing issues at the company's other facilities, such as the Boulder active pharmaceutical ingredient plant, Rocky Mountain, Lake Forest and IKKT are further challenges for the company.In another development, Hospira initiated a voluntary nationwide recall of a couple of its injectable drugs- a lot of Reglan (metoclopramide) and two lots of Zofran (ondansetron). Hospira initiated the move due to vial defects. The FDA stated that glass strand particulates due to a defect on the part of the glass supplier were the reason behind this voluntary move by Hospira.Though Hospira has not received reports pertaining to any adverse events associated with these lots, we believe further slipups will impact the drugs' supplies. This will create another challenge for the company to overcome.END", "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated ( VRTX ) has been showing progress in its efforts to expand the label of its cystic fibrosis (CF) drug, Kalydeco.

Results showed that children receiving the two highest doses of the candidate (6 mg and 9 mg) continued to show improvements in muscle function tests up to 14 months after being administered a single injection.The Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE) was used to analyze motor function in the children belonging to the 9-14 months age group. Isis Pharma said that improvement in HFMSE scores were dose-dependent with higher improvements being observed in the highest dose arm (9 mg). Most of the children in this arm continued to show improvement during follow up with no children declining. The safety profile also looked favorable.ISIS-SMNRx is currently in phase II development - while a phase II study is evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of ISIS-SMNRx in infants with type I SMA, a phase Ib/IIa multiple-dose study is being conducted in children with type II and type III SMA.

Data revealed that treatment with Natpara (50, 75 or 100\u00b5g/day subcutaneous injection) caused an improvement of bone remodeling. This was witnessed by an increase in bone turnover markers and the reduction in bone mineral density. However, similar improvements were not witnessed in patients treated with only calcium and active vitamin D.Moreover, results were also presented from the PARADOX research (n=374). The research examined the clinical, social and economic implications of hypoparathyroidism in adults diagnosed at least six months ago. Results revealed that patients suffer from illnesses related to the skeleton and joints. Moreover, they experienced bone-related symptoms and comorbidities even after being treated with calcium and active vitamin D.The company expects to submit a Biologic License Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) for Natpara by year end.

Two of the studies evaluated adults and pediatrics suffering from aHUS and another (a retrospective study) studied Soliris on aHUS children. Japanese approval was also sought on the basis of data from an ongoing prospective study in addition to a retrospective study on Soliris in patients (adults and pediatrics) suffering from aHUS. Alexion expects to launch Soliris for treating aHUS patients in Japan by year end.Apart from Japan, Soliris is approved for treating aHUS in the U.S., EU and many other countries. The U.S. and EU approvals for the indication came in 2011. The Japanese approval of Soliris for treating aHUS patients will boost the drug's sales potential further.

( ALXN ) stated that it has initiated a recall and replacement of the remaining vials of a single lot of the company's sole marketed drug Soliris. Alexion further stated that this voluntary move was prompted by the presence of visible particles in a few vials in a solitary lot of the drug. Soliris is available for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.According to Alexion, the recalled and replaced vials accounted for a negligible portion (1-2%) of the vial consumption in a month.

The company also stated in its filing with the SEC that it observed the particles during its regular testing of retained samples after the filling, packaging, and labeling of the vials by a third party contract vialer. Alexion said that the affected lot was filled in Jun 2012. It was initially distributed in Dec 2012 ex-U.S. markets.The company is investigating the matter. Alexion believes the voluntary recall will not impact the supply of Soliris.

Important pipeline candidates at Alexion include asfotase alfa (hypophosphatasia), ALXN1102/ALXN1103 (hematology), and ALXN1007 (inflammatory disorders).Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alexion is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive earnings Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) (Read: Zacks Earnings ESP: A Better Method ) and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. Unfortunately this is not the case here as elaborated below.END", "Friday's session closes with the NASDAQ Composite Index at 3,600.08.

Our investment thesis is supported by a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Why the Reiteration?Regeneron reported higher-than-expected earnings in the first quarter of 2013, on the back of strong sales of its eye-drug Eylea. The drug has performed well since its US launch in late 2011 for treating patients suffering from neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The European approval of the drug for the same indication came in Nov 2012.Sales of Eylea in the US came in at $314 million in the first quarter of 2013, up 13.8% sequentially. Encouraged by the strong performance, the company raised its forecast for 2013 Eylea sales. Regeneron now expects 2013 sales of Eylea in the range of $1.25-$1.325 billion (old guidance: $1.2-$1.3 billion). We too expect Eylea to continue to perform well.In Sep 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the label expansion of Eylea into the macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion indication.END", "Theravance Inc. ( THRX ) recently announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the company's marketed product, Vibativ (telavancin), for an additional indication.The FDA approved Vibativ for treating adults suffering from hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. The disease is also known as nosocomial pneumonia (NP). Approval was gained for treating the disease caused by susceptible isolates of staphylococcus aureus in the absence of suitable alternatives.Following the approval, Theravance intends to launch the drug for the new indication in the third quarter of 2013. The FDA approved Vibativ for the new indication on the basis of data from two phase III studies (ATTAIN I and II).We note that Vibativ is already approved in the US for treating adults with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus. Vibativ is also marketed in Canada for cSSSI.END", "Gilead Sciences, Inc. ( GILD ) recently presented interim data from a phase II study (101-09: n=125) on its pipeline candidate idelalisib (formerly GS-1101). The study is evaluating idelalisib in patients suffering from indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). The patients have not responded to treatments by Roche Holding AG 's ( RHHBY ) Rituxan (rituximab) and alkylating-agent-containing chemotherapy. The company intends to present detailed data from the study shortly.Overall response rate (ORR) is the primary end point of the study. ORR for the study refers to the proportion of patients achieving a confirmed complete or partial response following treatment with idelalisib. ORR of 53.6% was observed in the study. Interim data also revealed that the ORR was consistent across the cohorts analyzed for the study.Data also revealed that the median progression-free survival was 11.4 months and the size of the tumor diminished in 89% patients following idelalisib therapy.Apart from iNHL, idelalisib is also being evaluated in other oncology indications, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Successful development and commercialization of idelalisib for the oncology indication would boost Gilead's top line further. In May 2013, Gilead presented encouraging data on idelalisib from a phase II study for the CLL indication.END", "Amgen ( AMGN ) recently received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an additional indication for Xgeva (denosumab). The FDA approved Xgeva for the treatment of giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) that cannot be treated with surgery. Approval was granted for use in adults and skeletally mature adolescents.Amgen had submitted its regulatory application in the US as well as the EU in Dec 2012. FDA approval was granted after a priority review was conducted.Xgeva is currently approved for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. Xgeva sales came in at $748 million in 2012. Amgen has been working on expanding Xgeva's label into additional indications.Xgeva is currently in phase III studies for the delay or prevention of bone metastases in patients with adjuvant breast cancer and prevention of SRE in patients with multiple myeloma. Last year, Amgen had received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for its supplemental biologics license application s(BLA) for Xgeva for the delay of bone metastases in prostate cancer.END", "The much hyped Supreme Court ruling regarding legal claims that challenge its patent landscape is out for Myriad Genetics Inc. ( MYGN ) and it seems like a halfway triumph for this molecular diagnostic company.The IssueIn Nov 2012, Myriad revealed that the U.S. Supreme Court would review the decision of U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. It applies to the company's composition of matter claims that isolated DNA of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are patentable. Earlier, in Apr 2012, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit declared that Myriad's composition of matter claims covering isolated DNA of the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes were patentable.Following the Supreme Court review, earlier ruling by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to declare the patentability of Myriad's composition of matter claims covering isolated DNA of the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes were subject to legal scrutiny once again. The legal claims pertain to the company's flagship Bracanalysis test. The decision was anticipated in Jun 2013.The VerdictWhile the apex court upheld Myriad's patent claims on complementary DNA or cDNA, the other five claims from the company to cover isolated DNA were declared not eligible for patents by the U.S. Supreme Court. According to the Court, most of Myriad's unchallenged claims pertain to 'method claims' applying knowledge about BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene. This implies patent eligibility for the company's 'method claims'.END", "Amgen ( AMGN ) recently presented data on its late-stage oncology candidate, trebananib. Results from the phase III global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled TRINOVA-1 study showed that trebananib met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).The study is evaluating trebananib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Amgen said that results were statistically significant with a 34% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death being observed. Median PFS was better in the trebananib arm compared to the control arm (7.2 months versus 5.4 months).However, an early imbalance of deaths favoring the control arm was observed. Moreover, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was higher in the trebananib arm compared to the control arm (20% versus 7%). Most frequently reported adverse events in the trebananib arm included localized edema, nausea and alopecia.Apart from the TRINOVA-1 study, Amgen is evaluating trebananib in two more phase III trials for ovarian cancer - TRINOVA-2 and TRINOVA-3. While TRINOVA-2 is being conducted to evaluate whether trebananib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is superior to placebo plus PLD in recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer, TRINOVA-3 is evaluating trebananib or placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in the first-line treatment of epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.END", "Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc . ( ALXN ) recently announced that encouraging data on its sole marketed drug Soliris has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) for treating patients suffering from atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).Data from the two pivotal studies published in the NEJM revealed that treatment with Soliris significantly inhibits systemic complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and reduces the need for TMA-related intervention. Moreover, chronic Soliris therapy also results in improvement in platelet count as well as renal function in aHUS patients. Moreover, treatment with Soliris leads to the reversal of vital organ damage and causes improvements in the quality of life (related to health). The study also indicated that earlier intervention with Soliris caused clinical outcomes to improve.We note that Soliris is available in the US, EU and many other countries for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare genetic blood disorder. In Sep 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared Soliris for treating children and adults suffering from aHUS, an ultra-rare genetic disorder. Soliris was subsequently launched in the country. In Nov 2011, a similar approval for the drug was granted in the EU.Alexion Pharma is working on developing its pipeline to reduce its dependence on Soliris for growth. The company is also working on expanding Soliris' label into additional indications like Shiga-toxin producing e. coli hemolytic uremic syndrome, neuromyelitis optica and myasthenia gravis. Alexion Pharma's pipeline also includes asfotase alfa (hypophosphatasia), ALXN1102/ALXN1103 (hematology), and ALXN1007 (inflammatory disorders).END", "We recently maintained our Neutral recommendation on biopharmaceutical company, Gilead Sciences, Inc. ( GILD ). Our target price is $55.00 per share.Why the reiteration?In May 2013, Gilead reported lower-than-expected earnings in the first quarter of 2013. Lower-than-expected revenues were responsible for the earnings miss during the first quarter of 2013. Revenues climbed 11% to $2.53 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56 billion. The year-over-year increase in total revenue was attributable to higher product sales.We are encouraged by the approval of Complera/Eviplera, which together with Stribild has further fortified the HIV franchise at Gilead. The company is looking to combat the threat of genericization by inking deals and acquisitions and introducing new products. Gilead still expects product revenue for 2013 in the range of $10-$10.2 billion, reflecting an increase of 6%-9% over 2012 levels. We expect Gilead to easily achieve the increased guidance driven by its strong product portfolio.We are also impressed by Gilead's efforts to develop its pipeline. The company is highly optimistic about the potential of its pipeline candidate sofosbuvir, which aims to treat patients suffering from hepatitis C virus (HCV). The candidate is under review both in the US and the EU. Approval of the candidate would not only boost Gilead's top line, but also strengthen its position in the lucrative HCV market. A sizeable population suffers from HCV the world over. However, the treated population is much lower. This leaves the field open for new treatments.END", "Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ( BMY ) recently announced encouraging data on its oncology candidate nivolumab from a phase I dose-ranging trial (study 004: n=86). The study evaluated the safety and anti-tumor activity of nivolumab in combination with Bristol-Myers' marketed skin-cancer drug Yervoy (combined either concurrently or sequentially) for treating patients suffering from advanced melanoma. The data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Data from the study revealed that 53% (9 out of 17) patients treated with the combination of nivolumab and Yervoy (concurrently) had confirmed objective responses. The patients were treated with the same combination dosage as is being used in the ongoing phase III study. The phase III study is also evaluating the combination of nivolumab and Yervoy in advanced melanoma patients.Data from the phase I study also revealed at least an 80% tumor shrinkage in each of the above nine patients within twelve weeks. Furthermore, an estimated survival rate (52-week) of 82% was observed across all concurrent groups. Bristol-Myers presented the estimated survival data at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.We believe that the encouraging data on nivolumab is good news for Bristol-Myers as its pipeline must deliver to combat the loss of revenues due to the genericization of Plavix. Plavix, co-developed with Sanofi ( SNY ), went off patent in the US in May 2012. Moreover, the threat of genericization looms over many other key drugs at Bristol-Myers.END", "Celgene Corporation ( CELG ) recently presented data from various studies on its oncology drugs at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) held in the US.Celgene presented detailed data from the MPACT (Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial) study (n=861), which evaluated its oncology drug Abraxane in combination with Eli Lilly and Company 's ( LLY ) Gemcitabine as a first-line therapy in patients suffering from advanced pancreatic cancer.Data from the study revealed that there was significant improvement in overall survival in patients treated with Abraxane and Gemzar compared to those treated with Gemzar alone. The median progression-free survival of 8.5 months was observed in the Abraxane plus Gemzar arm compared to 6.7 months for patients in the Gemzar arm.We note that Abraxane is under priority review in the US for the advanced pancreatic cancer indication. Abraxane in combination with Gemzar is also under review in the EU for the same indication.END", "The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) recently issued a positive opinion regarding the approval of Celgene Corporation 's ( CELG ) oncology drug, Pomalyst.Celgene is seeking approval for the use of Pomalyst in combination with low-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patients, who have received at least two prior therapies (inclusive of Celgene's key oncology drug Revlimid and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company' s ( TKPYY ) Velcade). The disease worsened for the patients while on their last therapy. A final decision from the European Commission is expected within two to three months.The CHMP's positive opinion on Pomalyst came on the back of encouraging data from the phase III study (MM-003: n=455). The study evaluated Pomalyst as a combination therapy in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients. Data revealed that there was significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival in patients in the Pomalyst arm.We note that Pomalyst is already available in the US for the MM indication. The US Food and Drug Administration approved Pomalyst in Feb 2013. The US approval of Pomalyst has boosted Celgene's already strong oncology product portfolio. Celgene's top line would be boosted further in the event of Pomalyst gaining EU approval as the MM market offers significant commercial potential.END", "Biogen Idec Inc. ( BIIB ) recently announced that it expects a delay in the EU launch of its oral multiple sclerosis treatment, Tecfidera, as it continues to work on strengthening patent protection for the candidate. Although Tecfidera is protected by a European patent until 2028, Biogen believes that Tecfidera is also entitled to regulatory data protection.The company is currently working on the regulatory data protection situation and therefore expects to launch Tecfidera in the EU in the second half of this year.We note that a response regarding Tecfidera's approval status in the EU should be out this quarter. In Mar 2013, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion regarding the approval of Tecfidera. Biogen is looking to get Tecfidera approved in the EU as a first-line oral treatment for adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).According to the CHMP, Tecfidera has a favorable benefit-to-risk balance based on the quality, safety and efficacy data submitted by Biogen. Results from studies showed that treatment with Tecfidera led to a significant reduction in disease activity in multiple sclerosis patients. Moreover, the candidate had a favorable safety and tolerability profile.END", "Omeros Corporation ( OMER ) recently filed a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) with the European regulatory authorities to initiate studies on OMS721. OMS721 is Omeros' lead human monoclonal antibody from its mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) program.OMS721 will be primarily developed for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), which is a rare but life-threatening form of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Omeros plans to initiate a phase I study at the beginning of the next quarter subject to a positive regulatory review of its CTA.Omeros' placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-ascending-dose phase I study on OMS721 will be evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the candidate administered subcutaneously in healthy subjects.Omeros intends to advance OMS721 in phase II development in aHUS patients as soon as it completes the phase I study.END", "Amgen ( AMGN ) recently announced a strategic alliance with Japanese company, Astellas Pharma Inc.

Results from the study showed that weight gain in patients, who were administered ALKS 3831 for three weeks was significantly lower (an average of 2.5 kg) than in patients who took Zyprexa (an average of 3.4 kg).Alkermes also reported that ALKS 3831 was well tolerated in the study and the safety and tolerability results were almost similar to that of Zyprexa alone.The company stated in its press release that weight gain is a common side effect in atypical antipsychotic medications with Zyprexa being associated with the highest occurrence as well as magnitude of weight gain in this class of drugs.END", "Celgene Corporation ( CELG ) received encouraging news recently with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearing the company's growth engine Revlimid for an additional indication. The US regulatory body approved Revlimid for treating patients suffering from mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The disease of the patients had either relapsed or worsened after two prior therapies, including Takeda Pharmaceutical Company 's ( TKPYY ) Velcade.The US approval came on the basis of encouraging data from a multi-center, single arm, open label phase II study (MCL-001: n=134) which evaluated Revlimid in the MCL indication. We remind investors that Celgene had filed a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA), seeking FDA approval to expand Revlimid's label, late last year. The FDA reviewed the application on a priority basis. The US regulatory body gave its nod of approval on its assigned target date of Jun 5, 2013.We note that Revlimid is already approved in combination with dexamethasone for treating multiple myeloma (MM) patients who have received at least one prior therapy. Revlimid is also available for treating transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality (with or without additional cytogenetic irregularities). The label expansion into the MCL indication would further boost the sales potential of the drug.We note that the positive news from the FDA came close on the heels of the European Medicines Agency's (EMEA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommending the EU approval of another drug at Celgene, Pomalyst.END", "Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ( BMY ) recently announced encouraging data on its oncology candidate nivolumab from a phase I dose-ranging trial (study 004: n=86).

We note that Xofigo will be co-promoted by Bayer and Algeta US, LLC in the US. We remind investors that the FDA granted priority review to the New Drug Application (NDA) for Xofigo in Feb 2013. The NDA was submitted in Dec 2012.The US approval of Xofigo was based on positive results from the phase III ALSYMPCA (ALpharadin in SYMptomatic Prostate CAncer) study. Results from the study revealed that treatment with Xofigo resulted in a 44% improvement in overall survival and caused a 30.5% reduction in the risk of death compared to patients in the placebo arm. Moreover, in January this year a licensing decision on the medical use of Xofigo was issued by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.We note that Bayer is also seeking European approval of the candidate.

The drug is available for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.The US regulatory body issued a warning letter to Alexion Pharma following its inspection of the facility last year. The FDA issued a Form 483 Inspectional Observations to Alexion Pharma following the completion of the inspection on Aug 6, 2012. Alexion Pharma responded to the letter in the same month and subsequently provided additional information to the US regulatory body in Sep and Dec 2012.However, the response did not satisfy the FDA which issued the warning letter to the company. The FDA also remains concerned about the quality system implemented by Alexion Pharma at the facility. The FDA further stated while issuing the letter that it is dissatisfied with the company's inadequate investigation of bacterial contamination at its manufacturing facility at Rhode Island.The news had a negative impact on Alexion Pharma's shares.

( ALXN ) to Outperform from Neutral based on the company's strong fourth quarter 2012 results. Moreover, Alexion Pharma has a long-term earnings growth rate of 28.5%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the short run.Why the Upgrade?On Feb 14, Alexion Pharma announced impressive fourth-quarter results. The company's adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents on the back of strong sales of Soliris - Alexion's only marketed product. It is marketed for the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome indications.Management expects Soliris to continue performing well. Consequently, net product sales for 2013 are expected in the range of $1.490-$1.505 billion significantly above the $1.13 billion recorded in 2012. We too expect Soliris to continue performing well in 2013. Consequently, we have increased our revenue estimate for 2013.Other PositivesAlexion is studying Soliris for additional indications as well, such as acute humoral rejection, myasthenia gravis and STEC-HUS. Alexion intends to seek marketing approval for Soliris in the STEC-HUS indication in the US and the EU in the second half of 2013. Currently, there are no approved treatments for any of these disorders and the successful development of Soliris for one or more of these indications will further help expand the market potential of the drug.

Toward this end, each day we search our database for a \"top stock\" (a top rated company in terms of earnings strength as well as company and industry performance) that presents a strong technical \"set up\" and a good entry point.In short, when our equity team is looking to add a stock to one of our portfolios, the \"bull's eye\" stock shown below is generally their first choice.Company Symbol Industry StockRating YTD% Gain S.T.StopLoss Regeneron Pharmaceuticals IncREGN Biotechnology  9.8  -4.54%  8.32 Why We Like The Stock: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN) is our most compelling buy today due to the fact that it is a top rated stock (in terms of earnings strength and company/industry performance) with a positive technical set-up. A lot of Biotechnology stocks act very differently, so we can work with these stocks as trades that really aren't correlated to the market or to themselves. For example, REGN's competitors Alexion Pharma (ALXN), Vertex Pharma (VRTX), Biomarin Pharma (BMRN), and Pharmacyclics Inc (PCYC) all act on their own, and really don't even resemble the SPDR Biotech ETF (XBI). So, on it's own merit, REGN is a great looking stock. On a weekly basis, the stock has exhibited strong performance since the beginning of 2012. Notice that the stock tends to pullback and base for a while until marching higher on a new leg up. That is what is happening currently with REGN, which makes for a great entry point. We'd be buyers at the current price around 3, and look for a test / possible breakout of recent resistance at ~5. A close above 0 would be the goal here. With some wiggle room (stop at 8.32), REGN looks like a great intermediate- to long-term trade and is our most compelling buy today.We Would Be Buyers: At the current price (~3.00).

Alexion Pharma's revenues jumped 44.2% to $294.1 million in the third quarter of 2012 driven by strong sales of Soliris, the company's sole marketed product.Soliris is available since 2007 for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare genetic blood disorder. In September 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared Soliris for treating children and adults suffering from aHUS. The absence of competition bodes well for the initial sales ramp of Soliris for the new indication. Soliris was subsequently launched in the US. In November 2011, Soliris was approved for aHUS in the EU. Alexion Pharma expects to launch Soliris for the aHUS indication in major EU nations by mid-2013. The company intends to seek Japanese approval for Soliris in the aHUS indication by early 2013.Alexion Pharma is also studying Soliris for additional indications, such as acute humoral rejection, myasthenia gravis and STEC-HUS. We are also encouraged by the company's strategy of pursuing acquisitions/signing deals to expand its pipeline beyond Soliris.END", "Cytokinetics Inc.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of tirasemtiv on various measures of muscle strength, muscle fatigue and pulmonary function. As CY 4023 was a hypothesis-generating trial, no single primary efficacy objective was stated earlier.Results from the CY 4023 study revealed that six hours after dosing, a statistically significant improvement was noticed in the Quantitative MG score (QMG), which is a measure of disease severity widely used by physicians in clinical trials of patients suffering from MG. Patients on tirasemtiv also showed improvements in predicted forced vital capacity compared to placebo.Both doses of tirasemtiv were well tolerated among the 32 patients who were enrolled in the phase IIa study. Cytokinetics did not report any premature termination or any serious adverse event from the study.

If you are, you're not alone.Judging by the VIX index, also known as the \"fear gauge\", there are plenty of nervous investors. The index measures the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options.In other words, it represents one measure of the market's expectation of stock market volatility over the next 30 day period. A higher index value means that more investors are expecting extreme market volatility (i.e. higher levels of investing risk).Last week, the VIX shot up to 26.2, the highest fear level since March when the tsunami and nuclear disaster occurred in Japan.\"The stock market is sharply lower, and many investors think the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index (VIX) should be much higher,\" writes Steve Sears at Barrons.So, how can you protect your portfolio against a spike higher in the VIX index, i.e. increased market volatility?To help you get started, we performed statistical analysis on the price changes of companies with no debt, and identified stocks with a positive correlation to the VIX index.Need a reminder of your school statistics courses? Here's a quick summary:Correlation measures the tendency of two data sets to vary together. In other words, if a company's price changes have a strong positive correlation to the VIX index, it means that its price will tend to rise if the VIX index rises (i.e. positive correlation = direct relationship)If, on the other hand, the company's price changes have a negative correlation to the VIX index, it means that its price will tend to fall if the VIX index rises (i.e. negative correlation = inverse relationship).All of the debt-free companies mentioned below have strong positive correlation to the VIX index, based on price trends over the last quarter. In other words, based on price data from the last 3 months, these companies will tend to rise in price if the VIX index rises.If you're worried about increased market risk, this list might offer a useful starting point for your next investing idea. But please keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results--just because these stocks have seen gains during times of extreme market volatility, does not mean that they will do so again in the future.List sorted by correlation to the VIX index, based on price data over the last three months. (Note: The closer a correlation statistic is to 1, the stronger the positive relationship).We will also include the projected earnings growth for each company.Analyze These Ideas (Tools Will Open In A New Window)1.

The latest miracle of modern medicine allowed doctors to replace a man\u2019s cancerous windpipe with a new man-made one, comprised of a synthetic structure that was coated in the patient\u2019s own stem cells.According to a statement by Karolinska University Hospital, \u201cTransplantations of tissue engineered windpipes with synthetic scaffolds in combination with the patient's own stem cells as a standard procedure means that patients will not have to wait for a suitable donor organ,\" reports AFP.This is a huge leap forward for stem cell research. For starters, the stem cells were taken from the patient\u2019s nose and bone marrow, which is much less morally controversial than embryonic stem cells (from unborn babies).Also, a previous trachea (throat) stem cell transplant conducted by many of the same doctors had required a donor trachea to provide the structure for the stem cells. The process has since been streamlined.\u201cA windpipe can be made in between two days and a week, and because it uses the patient's own cells, there's no risk of organ rejection,\u201d according to The Daily Beast.Organ rejection is a serious risk that often requires strong medication to weaken the immune system (the system in charge of killing unwanted organisms in the body). Eliminating organ rejection risk will also eliminate the many risks from impairing one\u2019s immune system, making many transplants much safer.Stem cell research has come a long way towards improving medicine. It is still a nascent field, however.\u201cExperts say synthetic structures could be used to fashion simple organs like the windpipe, esophagus or bladder, but that it will be years before scientists can create more complicated organs like kidneys or hearts in the laboratory,\u201d reports ABC News.Do you think this news is a confirmation of stem cell\u2019s promising future?

It\u2019s been like a ride on a nightmare carousel: The horses go up and down and around and around and never get anywhere. And it just goes on and on and on\u2026But, while it may seem impossible, some companies actually leapt off the merry-go-round and turned in great performances. There were the champions of course\u2014with Apple, Google and Facebook standing squarely in the winners\u2019 circle\u2014but some notable also-rans deserve a second look as well.Here are five companies positioned to sprint ahead of the pack in the next year. Take a second look.1. Solarcity\u2014The ExceptionIf you\u2019ve been following the death notices of solar power companies, you might think their chances are pretty dim. There was Massachusetts-based Evergreen Solar, which fell into the Chapter 11 pit in August, taking an estimated $58 million in state aid with it. Then, of course, there was Solyndra, which upped the ante, taking $528 million in federal loans with it when it went belly-up the same month.One exception in the sector is SolarCity, which boasts a client list including Walmart, Intel and eBay, to say nothing of residential customers across the West and Southwest. It\u2019s now working with $200 million in venture funding, with an IPO on its calendar for late 2012 or 2013. Mark your calendar to watch for it. (Can you feel that slight tremor in the once all-powerful Chinese solar industry?)2. Alexion PharmaceuticalsThe pharmaceutical industry, battered by the economy, foreign entries into the market and the uncertainties of health care reform, could have used some of its own mood-enhancing drugs this year. But some companies rose above the fray, including Alexion (AXLN), which started life with a product to treat a rare\u2014but life-threatening\u2014blood disease and is now working to expand its range, both through organic product development and acquisitions. A three-year average shows revenue growth of 75 percent and profit up 82 percent. It could be just what the doctor ordered in 2012.3. PandoraThe on-demand media industry just keeps streaming (yes, we meant streaming) ahead, which is music to the ears of companies like Pandora (P), the Web-based radio station that provides listeners with a steady diet of music targeted to their individual tastes. Prior to the company\u2019s IPO in June there was some noise in the technology and financial presses about its lack of profitability (some analysts say it won\u2019t be profitable until 2014), but the potential for good returns is staggering. For starters, it now has 80 million listeners. It\u2019s particularly popular with mobile device users, but is also bringing commuters into the fold; more and more new vehicles will be Pandora-enabled in the coming year.The company is currently working to get its ad-revenue house in order to cash in on the expected tsunami in mobile advertising sales. According to some estimates, revenue in the sector is expected to surge to more than 10 times last year\u2019s figure to $10.5 billion in 2015. That should usher in a veritable symphony of profits for Pandora.4. Intuitive SurgicalUnhappy with your doctor\u2019s bedside manner? Perhaps your next surgical procedure will be performed by a surgeon that doesn\u2019t have one\u2014a robotic device. An increasing number of hospitals and medical systems are turning to robotic surgical systems for their cost-effectiveness and precision. One company, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), has been cashing in on that trend with its da Vinci surgical system, which allows a surgical team to make tiny, precise incisions, thus reducing a patient\u2019s trauma and recovery time. In the second quarter of this year Intuitive revenue rose 21.4 percent (compared to Q2 2010) to $425.7 million from $350.7 million. And the company has enjoyed double-digit year-over-year percentage revenue growth for the past four quarters. Put another way, the company\u2019s da Vinci system is helping it turn revenue growth into an art form.5. Cirrus LogicLook around your home or office. How many devices have some technological component? (A dead give-away is an LED screen somewhere on the device.) There are dozens, right? Well every one of them requires integrated circuit products (read: semiconductors) to work. One company that\u2019s helping to make technology even more ubiquitous in our lives is Cirrus Logic (CRUS), which produces semiconductors for products ranging from smart phones to Blu\u2013ray players. Over the last three years the company has seen year-over-year annualized earnings-per-share gains of 340 percent. And, as technology continues its incursion into every corner of our lives, the company\u2019s revenue potential can only increase.So, while it doesn\u2019t look like that carousel that was the 2011 market is going to become a high-speed raceway anytime soon, there are some brass rings out there. You just have to be willing to reach a little to find them.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "Last Saturday, I had the pleasure of attending the second Boston Book Festival. It's fitting that our historic city has an event devoted entirely to the written word, as it is home to the oldest free public city library in the world supported by taxation and the first to allow its patrons to borrow books and other materials.The festival is held in Copley Square, also the location of the Boston Public Library, and plays host to a variety of events, like author readings and discussions, book signings, live music and children's activities. My favorite parts were the author readings and discussions and I was fortunate to be able to attend two featuring some of my favorite writers: Bill Bryson and Joyce Carol Oates.In recent years, people have bemoaned the effects the rise of the Internet and e-readers have had on books, but the festival proved that while the medium in which we read books may be changing, the written word is here to stay.Last year when I attended the festival, I wrote about Amazon.com (  AMZN ), maker of the Kindle e-reader. After that, the stock has meandered higher, ultimately topping out with the overall market in the spring. It got hit in the summer volatility, but has climbed rapidly since the market resumed its upward trend in early September. This is what Cabot Top Ten Weekly Editor Michael Cintolo had to say about it on September 13:\"Retail has not been the place for growth stock investors in recent months, but there have been some signs of life in the sector, and Amazon remains a leader in the field. The reason for the stock's strength lately surrounds its major price cut for the new version of its Kindle e-book reader, which can be had for $139 (compared to $399 when it was first released three years ago). That price cut is sparking sales of the device in a big way-one analyst sees nearly five million Kindle sales this year alone-and it doesn't hurt that Best Buy will also begin selling the Kindle at its stores in the weeks ahead. Of course, the Kindle is just one piece of Amazon's story; top management has guided the firm into the #1 position in online retail. We like the 40%-plus sales growth each of the past three quarters despite the weak retail environment, as well as the 35% earnings gain projected for 2011. It's not a new story, yet it looks like the company is set to get a lot bigger in the quarters to come.\"But Amazon isn't the only company with a successful e-reader. Apple (  AAPL ) sold 4.2 million of its iPad tablets in the most recent quarter. While the iPad isn't strictly an e-reader, it does compete with the Kindle, especially with those customers seeking more functionality from the device. Here's what Mike had to say about the stock in late September:\"Apple needs no introduction, as it's one of the best-known (and best-loved) companies today. The big news during the past few months was probably news that did not come about-after a well-publicized mess-up with its new iPhone (antennaegate), consumers didn't storm out and the issue seems to be resolved. And that allows investors to look ahead to the many other irons Apple has in the fire, such as the fast-selling iPad (some now see north of 20 million sold during the next 12 months), a possible new iPhone using Verizon's network (this could be particularly huge for business), new Mac computers, and the new Apple TV, which allows Netflix streaming and movie rentals right to a TV. Sales and earnings growth remains terrific, and valuation, at 22 times trailing earnings, is surprisingly reasonable.\"AAPL hit new highs recently and while it stumbled a bit after its earnings report on Monday, the stock recovered as the week went on. And the company is clearly going strong and has a lot of potential for the future. Just this week, Apple held an event focusing on its Macintosh computer where it announced a new operating system, called Lion, and a new version of its ultra-thin Macbook Air.And if the trend toward reading on devices, rather than from books, continues, both of these stocks stand to benefit.
