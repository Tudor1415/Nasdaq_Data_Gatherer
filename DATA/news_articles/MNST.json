At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MNST options chain for the new July 2nd contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.50 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $65.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MNST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $69.25/share today.\n\nBecause the $65.50 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

[Operator Instructions].I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

A copy of this information is also available on our website, www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. -- Let me begin by stating that our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has affected the health of so many individuals around the globe, including some of our team members. This includes myself. In mid-March, I began to experience flu-like symptoms, tested positive for COVID-19 and thankfully made a good recovery. I'm feeling good but for an occasional cough. For this, I'm very grateful. And we are fortunate that everyone at our company who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 is doing well and has been making good progress.The company has always operated with co-leaders, and I would like to thank Hilton and the leadership team for their leadership and support during this difficult period. To everyone at Monster, my sincere thanks and appreciation for all your efforts. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Early in March 2020, we implemented global travel restrictions and work from home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants.We are incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers and bottlers, distributors around the world, who are ensuring the integrity of our supply chain. Our flavor manufacturing facilities, our co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating. Certain of our bottlers, distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels. But generally, our products remain available to consumers. In limited countries, which are smaller markets for us, the operations of our bottlers and distributors have been more affected. Since March 2020, while various markets have faced governmental measures, restrictions and guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sales and merchandising activities of certain of our bottlers and distributors have been modified.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our net and gross sales for the 2020 first quarter was not material. The company's April sales were materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, bottle and distributor sales of the company's product to retail in the United States were markedly less adversely impacted. Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at home consumption and a decrease in immediate consumption.To date, our sales in the second quarter have been adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is our largest channel and food service on-premise. While our e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business remain stable. Currently, we do not foresee a material impact on the ability of our co-packers to manufacture and our bottlers and distributors to distribute our products as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.In addition, we are not experiencing raw material or finished product shortages in our supply chain. Monster Energy Cares, our philanthropic arm, is actively engaged in a number of philanthropic efforts, including donating products to individuals working on the front lines, such as first responders, healthcare workers, hospitals and the national guard. Based on currently available information, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our liquidity.In the first quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.06 billion, up 12.3% from $946 million in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 first quarter would have been up 13.4%. Operating income was $365 million, up from $311.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in net income was 6.6%. The lower percentage increase in net income was primarily due to our higher effective tax rate in the quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019, primarily attributable to a decrease in the equity compensation deduction.Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 first quarter increased 8.2% to $0.52 a share from $0.48 in the first quarter of 2019. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through April 25, 2020, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots, decreased by 1.2% versus the same period a year ago.

We have verified with Nielsen that the data for Mexico for the month of March 2020 did not fully capture all of Monster's sales. As a result, the Nielsen data is inaccurate and will not be covered on this call. We will resume reporting Nielsen data for Mexico once their data has been corrected. According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2020 compared to March 2019, and Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 23.7% to 37.1%; in Brazil, from 19.2% to 25.7%; and in Chile, from 35.9% to 41.4%.I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.

During the latest 4-week period ending March 2020, Monster's share in Japan grew from 49.5% to 61.6% as compared to the same period in the previous year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions and/or other trading factors during those periods.Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $356.8 million, 33.6% of total net sales in the 2020 first quarter compared to $284.1 million which is 30% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $10.4 million in the 2020 first quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.In EMEA, net sales in the first quarter increased 26.3% in dollars and increased 28.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 41.3% compared to 43.2% in the same quarter in 2019. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix. We're also pleased that in the first quarter, Monster gained market share in the Czech Republic, France, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Poland, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 32.8% in dollars and 33.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42% versus 42.2% over the same period in 2019 as a result of country and product mix. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 61.7% in dollars and 60.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 40.6% in dollars and 48% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019.In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 2.6% in dollars and 7.5% in local currencies.

In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 114.7% in dollars and increased 138.1% in local currency.Net sales in Chile decreased 16.8% in dollars and 3.2% in local currency in the quarter. This was due to timing of shipments and our retail market share and depletions remain strong. In the 2020 first quarter, we transitioned to Trinidad and Tobago to the Coca-Cola Bottler. In addition, we began production with our bottler in Trinidad, which will allow us to supply other islands and countries in this region on a tax-efficient basis. In January 2020, Monster Energy was launched by the Coca-Cola bottler in Israel.I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. A number of proceedings are currently ongoing to adjudicate claims, including claims for false advertising and trademark infringement, bought by the company against VPX and by VPX against the company. These proceedings are ongoing. Our only update since our last earnings call is in relation to the lawsuit against VPX, over its intention to launch its own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores.On May 1, 2020, a district court judge granted a preliminary injunction enjoining VPX from using the Reign mark in connection with any ready-to-drink beverage. A motion for summary judgment has been filed by Monster in this proceeding against all of VPX's claims in this suit with a hearing on that motion set for later in May this year. In the event that summary judgment is not granted against all claims in this suit, the matter is scheduled for trial in August 2020. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are sub judice, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call.We are working closely with our China team to follow the rules implemented by local authorities, and we have reopened our office in China. Monster shipments and distribution in the first quarter in China were negatively affected by the lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in a volume decrease in the first quarter in China. But beginning in late March, early April, we have seen an increase in shipments and depletions. In April, we began distribution of our new Monster Energy Dragon Tea, which is noncarbonated and which has received early positive feedback. In addition, certain globally supplied ingredients sourced from third-party manufacturers in Wuhan and other parts of China have recommended shipping to our network of co-packers.During the 2020 first quarter in the United States, we launched a number of new exciting products, including a line of Reign, Inferno, Thermogenic Fuel, two new energy drinks in the Monster Ultra line, a line of Java Monster 300 and a line of Monster Hydro Super Sport as well as NOS Turbo. These launches were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we did not achieve planned distribution levels, in part due to certain retailers, postponing implementation of their new planned schematics, which included our innovation products.We are developing plans with our bottlers and distributors to reprioritize these recent innovation launches to ensure that we are able to maximize their distribution as soon as normalcy returns, particularly to the convenience and gas channel. In Canada, our Monster Energy portfolio was extended in January 2020 with the launch of Monster Ultra Paradise, Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, Monster Hydro Blue Ice, Monster Dragon Green Tea and Yerba Mate. We also added an additional flavor to our NOS Energy lineup with NOS Sonic Sour. In Mexico, we launched Predator as our first entry in the country in the value segment. And in Brazil, we launched our noncarbonated Monster Energy Dragon Tea Lemon Tea during March 2020.In Australia, we launched Monster Energy Mule nationally and rolled out Mother Epic Swell nationally in January after an exclusive for the select convenience and gas chain launch in the fourth quarter of 2019. Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Germany and the Netherlands in March 2020 and in France and Sweden in April 2020 and is now available in nine EMEA markets and is planned to be launched into a further three markets in 2020.Black Monster Mango Loco was launched in Russia in March 2020. Mango Loco is now available in 34 EMEA markets. Juice Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Iceland, Malta and Norway in February 2020 and the Baltics, Denmark and Hungary in March 2020 and is now available in 20 markets across EMEA. Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in Germany and the Netherlands in March; and in Belgium, Italy and Norway in April and is now available in eight EMEA markets. We are planning to launch Ultra Paradise into a further 14 markets in 2020 in EMEA.Espresso Monster was launched in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece and Switzerland in March 2020, and in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in April 2020 in both mocha and vanilla variants. Expresso Monster mocha and vanilla variants are now available in 20 markets in EMEA. We are planning to launch two flavors of Espresso Monster into a further two markets in 2020. Additionally, we launched Expresso Monster Salted Caramel in Norway in February 2020 and in Sweden in April 2020. We are planning to launch this product in a further three EMEA markets in 2020.Reign was launched in Germany in February 2020 and in Spain in April 2020. Additionally, we are planning to launch Reign into a further six markets in 2020. Monster Hydro Sport was launched in Norway and Sweden in February 2020, and we are planning to launch Monster Hydro Sport in Spain late in the second quarter. Burn Dark Energy, our new citrus Burn variant, was launched in Russia in March 2020. two SKUs of the new Nalu Energy Tea line, green tea and ginger and black tea and passion fruit were launched in Belgium in April 2020. We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand, in the Czech Republic and Hungary in February 2020 Afghanistan and North Macedonia in March 2020.Additionally, we are planning to launch Predator in Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria in the second quarter of 2020. We're also planning to launch Predator into a further five EMEA market later in 2020; Bosnia, Croatia, Romania, Russia and Slovenia. Similar to the United States, in a number of markets, our recent new product launches were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are implementing plans to reprioritize certain launches. In Japan, we successfully relaunched Pipeline Punch with strong results that built our number one country share position in value. In South Korea, we further expanded Pipeline Punch to 90% of convenience stores with positive results that also took Monster to our number one share position in value.The Monster portfolio grew strongly in both countries. We are planning to launch Ultra Paradise in both Japan and South Korea later this year. India followed up on the December 2019 Mango Loco launch and extended distribution nationally early in the first quarter before a national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which took effect on March 25, 2020. We estimate April 2020 gross sales to be approximately 22.2% lower than in April 2019. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, April 2020 gross sales would have been approximately 20.8% lower than comparable April 2019 gross sales. However, bottle and distributor sales of the company's products to retail in the United States were markedly less adversely impacted.April 2020 had the same number of selling days as April 2019. April sales were materially and adversely impacted by the COVID pandemic to differing degrees from country to country. We're optimistic for improvement once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Indeed, a number of U.S. states have recently begun to partially reopen, and certain countries internationally are starting to do likewise.In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points; one, the company's priority has been and remains the health and safety of our employees, customers, consumers and our communities. Two, currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities it's co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. Three, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio.Four, we are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno, Thermogenic Fuel high-performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S., but also internationally. Five, we are pleased with our growth and performance, both domestically and internationally during the first quarter. We reiterate the growth potential for us in India when the country reopens as well as in China; six, we are proceeding with planning for future launches of our affordable energy brands as well as rain total body fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.; seven, this year, in light of the public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will conduct our annual meeting on June 3, 2020, exclusively as a virtual meeting via live webcast.You will not be able to attend the annual meeting in person, but during the virtual meeting, you may ask questions, and will be able to vote your shares electronically. Additional information regarding attending the annual meeting, voting your shares and submitting questions can be found in the company's proxy statement.I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Thank you and good afternoon everybody. And Rodney, I'm glad to hear you're well, and wish you good health to all on this call. So how much has traditional channels and convenience and gas impacted the 20.8% effect neutral decline globally in April? And if you can break down the U.S., I guess, well although I appreciate the detail that you gave, saying that U.S. was less impacted will be helpful for investors to figure out when the timing of COVID passes.And then the other thing I would I mean, I would like to clarify on the e-commerce performance. How much you gave, and we appreciate that. How much would that represent now as a percentage of total sales? -- Okay. So Andrea, maybe I should deal with that question. So what we saw in April was a decline in sales, which we indicated. If you look at the Nielsen for all measured channels, we, on these call additionally, give the Nielsen for convenience. But if you look at the Nielsen for all measured channels, that showed a decline of 10.2%. Not only do we measure shipments, we also measure depletions, and depletions are the sales that the bottlers and distributors sell to the various retailers.Depletions were largely in line with the Nielsen numbers for all measured channels. In fact, they were a little bit better. So I think what you're seeing in and I'm only talking the U.S., and I'll talk about EMEA, which is our next biggest market in a while. So in the U.S., what we saw was, I believe, and the numbers appear to verify that there was a reduction in inventories in the bottler network. Because shipments declined much faster than depletions and, in fact, the Nielsen numbers.So that's where we are in the U.S. with our bottler and distributor business. With our direct business, we have some direct business to clubs, e-commerce, etc, that business was largely intact. So we didn't see declines in that part of the business. Also what happened in April is that there was a lot of stock building and pantry loading that seem to culminate in a the last week in March. And in April, and if you look at April sales week by week, our sales have improved week by week. And that's also true in EMEA, which is our next biggest market.So in EMEA, they didn't see the same degree of stock reduction by the bottlers distributors. But what we have seen in EMEA, as the countries have opened, sequentially better performance week on week. For the rest of the business, Asia Pacific was up on last year, marginally and LATAM was well, I shouldn't say marginally, it was actually it was up to a nice degree over last year, and LATAM was in line with last year. So that's the issue from the U.S. and from EMEA, and I hope that answered your question.So regarding the second question, and you're kind of naughty because you're only allowed one question, but on the second question about e-commerce. We don't disclose those numbers. The numbers are available on Stackline. We don't disclose those numbers, but that market is becoming a very big market for us. And you could see from the indication on the call that our market share in with Amazon is growing pretty significantly. Thank you.And our next question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. -- Hi, Mark. -- First, by the way, I'm making dinner for the kids while listening. So you guys are very fortunate. I guess I just wanted to talk a bit about some of the cost controls that seem to have occurred in the quarter. Maybe talk a bit about how to think about selling and G&A expenses in terms of some of was some of this just response to what you had seen in end of quarter? Some of this because you didn't have NASCAR recurring and selling expenses, why was G&A up a little bit less than we've seen. And I know you don't want to give guidance, but any sort of direction that you can give us in terms of how to think about those numbers for 2020, that would be helpful. -- So as we look at the, particularly with sponsorships and endorsement, yes, NASCAR has fallen away. And we have other sponsorships and endorsements that may not cost the same this year as they did last year because a number of events have been canceled. So we don't give guidance, but I think it's as one reflects on the year, we could see a change in patterns in our spending. We've been spending a lot more on social media, which we believe is very important, particularly in this market that we are in, and we'll continue to spend in the markets as we deem appropriate.Our next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. I guess, Rodney, as you mentioned some of the states are starting to reopen, what have you seen kind of from the core Monster consumer in a more restrictive state, like in New York or California, where we're expecting kind of manufacturing and construction to come back online sooner, that I would think would also kind of play more into your core consumer. Just anything you're hearing on the ground as states start to reopen more? -- I think that that's drilling down to a level that I don't think is appropriate, and I don't think it's something we should be doing because there are so many variances from state to state and so many factors. I think you've got to look at it on a broader basis across the U.S. and also across the world because you look at individual countries, and we're really not in a position to have analyzed each and every country and giving you percentage up or the percentage back to normal.I think it's just more anecdotal of a trend that we are seeing, and it's starting to open. And we're just saying, we feel that when you look at the weekly numbers Hilton referred to earlier, you can see that there seems to be a trend that those numbers are improving on a weekly basis.Thank you. The next question will come from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. -- Hey, good morning, everyone. Rodney, I'm very glad to hear that of your recovered from COVID so keep safe. So I'd like to question you about the renewed competition in the space. PepsiCo in the quarter became a much stronger competitor with, first, the acquisition of Rockstar and that's with the announcement of a distribution agreement with in the U.S. Any comments on the move and how you are planning to adjust maybe to this new landscape? And also, I mean, should that change the way you and the Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers partners? -- Well, I think it's difficult to comment on Coca-Cola because we've always maintained a good relationship with the Coca-Cola company even during the arbitration proceedings that we had. We know that transitions generally are very disruptive, we've been through a number, and we know how disruptive they can be. So that's, we believe, in the short term, there's an opportunity for us. In the long term, it's difficult to comment because Pepsi Cola has never really had success in the energy category historically, although they now have brands that are a lot more powerful than they had before.Rockstar has declined 50% since their in market share since their distribution agreement began in 2009. And so it's really difficult to say. I think that the short-term will be disruptive, and we've got plans both for the short-term and for the long term. And I think it will be inappropriate for us to disclose what those plans are. But rest assured, we do have plans. And we believe we've got very strong brands. And that we've got good marketing prowess and that the better brands will prevail in the long term.Our next question will come from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. Good afternoon. Just following up on I'm glad to hear you're doing well, Rodney. Just following up on the Pepsi side, less from what your seeing, be it from Rockstar or Bang, because I think you've kind of already seen that, are you expecting anything new out of Mountain Dew or seeing anything from that front now that it seems that Pepsi is a little more unleashed and what it can do on the energy sector? -- Well, we haven't seen anything yet, but we are anticipating that, yes, that it was reported in the press that they were kind of hamstrung with utilizing the word energy on some of the other brands. And we believe that, that's something that will happen in time. But honestly, Bill, we shouldn't conjecture on what they may or may not do. -- I would just like to add that a lot of these things are not new. They have endeavored to play in that space through kick start in the Mountain Dew range, and as an extension. And so there'll be a little bit of a divergence, tweak to that. They have already been building or what Hilton said, they've been distributing Rockstar for the last 10 years. So at the end of the day, I don't think there's going to be much change. But again, we can't speculate to whatever they were put behind and for how long.But we do think that the Rockstar brand has some challenges, and we think that we're in a strong position to address that. And to address the Bang position, I think that you've seen the market shares of Bang over the past 12 months. And we think we're in a good position to continue to compete with them, regardless of their distribution system change. There are benefits, but there are also some negatives in that come with that change. -- So the one thing I would add, actually, to what we've all just said, is that the this result with PepsiCo, I think, will galvanize us, Coca-Cola and our whole bottling system against the common enemy. And I think that's a very positive factor as well.Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Mr. Hilton Schlosberg. -- Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally.We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the not-too-distant future. We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy.

But inside today\u2019s bull market, the  and its component stocks have demonstrated the kind of leadership critical to sustaining the wider market rally. And right now, three Nasdaq-100 stocks are \u2018still\u2019 working hard to ensure that friendly trend continues. (NYSE:),  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:) and more are just a few of the big names supporting NASDAQ gains. By Tuesday\u2019s closing bell, these large-cap stocks had advanced strongly.This is especially important considering that those names have been a veritable who\u2019s who of stocks that have lagged the broader averages since late March\u2019s coronavirus-induced bottom.Of course, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, and it would be a mistake to be dismissive. On the session,  added 1.27% and for the first time since the bear market bottom, moved convincingly above its 62% to new relative highs, turning bullish.Reports of a new vaccine trial from biotech  (NASDAQ:) and renewed economic optimism following a mostly successful test of new social hygiene standards during the Memorial Day holiday helped with those gains. But elsewhere in the market, Tuesday\u2019s early optimism faded fast.The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 and many of its top constituent stocks, which led U.S. equity markets higher over the past two months, has stumbled.The index closed fractionally lower as influential leadership from  (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:) and other heavyweights was absent, even counterproductive, with many of those stocks closing firmly underwater.The good news is that a single day does not a trend make. It\u2019s quite normal for leadership within a bull market to take a break. It is after all, a market made up of stocks. And even the best of the best are prone to profit-taking. Having said that and as long as the pause we\u2019re seeing right now doesn\u2019t turn overtly symptomatic of a bearish top, it\u2019s time to have a watch list of Nasdaq-100 stocks to buy.\nSource: The first of our Nasdaq-100 stocks to buy is Apple. Shares of the diversified consumer technology giant have narrowed the market cap gap against Microsoft in recent days. And three new upwardly-revised, above-market-rate  could be what\u2019s needed to put shares back atop the valuation food chain.Technically, shares of Apple have attempted to break out of a tight handle congestion pattern formed off the 76% retracement level of its cup shaped corrective base. However, the initial reaction has faltered, so shares are modestly\u00a0trading back inside the handle formation.My advice for this Nasdaq-100 stock to buy is wait on a flattening of stochastics, then watch for price action to confirm a daily chart pullback entry. The observation is the current handle could fall victim to a bear raid. But as long as shares remain above $294.69, any additional price weakness could be viewed as a healthy opportunity to buy shares within the larger cup base.\nSource: T-Mobile is the next of our NASDAQ stocks to buy, as shares of the industry-disrupting telecom giant could offer investors big profits.You won\u2019t find any defensive dividends for TMUS shareholders. But what you will find is a company leading the wireless services market in subscriber and sales growth. And that\u2019s not all.Following T-Mobile\u2019s takeover of Sprint, the combined company boasts more  than larger competitors  (NYSE:) and  (NYSE:). That could prove an important advantage as the 5G network grows.Technically, another thing this Nasdaq-100 stock has that\u2019s also more attractive than its peers is a bonafide uptrend, developed as part of a well-formed corrective cup. Shares recently attempted to breakout, but after establishing marginal new all-time-highs, settled back into the base.Similar to Apple, T-Mobile is a stock to buy on healthy pattern weakness, if the purchase is backed by an improving stochastics indicator. For this Nasdaq-100 stock though, the line in the sand for a purchase also requires that shares remain above the 76% retracement level.\nSource: Monster Beverage is the last of our Nasdaq-100 stocks to buy and we may have saved the best for last. A recent  by the company\u2019s namesake energy drink saw investors thirsting for more as shares bubbled higher by nearly 6%.Moreover, the monthly price chart strongly suggests there\u2019s more of that fizzy action in the works. Technically, shares are positioned within 1% of breaking out of a near two-year long basing pattern that\u2019s formed around Monster\u2019s former 2016 all-time-high.A failed base breakout occurred in February just as the novel coronavirus\u2019 began to upend risk assets. But a second monthly attempt and new narrow all-time-high was secured Tuesday before shares dipped back into the base to close out the session.Bottom-line, with second attempt\u2019s often yielding big-time profits and Monster\u2019s stochastics confirming the possibility for a more sustainable rally, unlike peer  (NYSE:), this Nasdaq-100 stock is a hot commodity for investors right now.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler\u2019s management does not own any securities mentioned in this article.

These days, the two companies have a lot in common, and you may find yourself struggling to choose which one's the better fit for your own portfolio.Operating MetricMcDonald'sMonster BeverageTrailing revenue$20.8 billion$4.3 billionTrailing $5.3 billion$1.0 billionCash equivalents$5.4 billion$1.3 billionLong-term debt$34.8 billion$0Data source: collected from Morningstar on May 12, 2020.Reflecting their relative levels of maturity, McDonald's runs a very large and capital-intensive business, while Monster's playbook is leaner and meaner.Don't worry too much about the heavy debt load at McDonald's. The company is still good for an investment-grade credit rating, and its torrential cash flows could be used to pay these debt balances down to zero in less than a decade. That's just not how McDonald's prefers to run its balance sheet, as it uses financial leverage to make its day-to-day business decisions more flexible.That being said, Monster's debt-free balance sheet offers a different type of flexibility. This company doesn't have to worry about fulfilling debt covenants at all times, which opens the door to all sorts of interesting ideas. If distribution partner   wanted to step up its 19% ownership to a full-fledged buyout, for example, Coke wouldn't have to take over any debt arrangements.Monster's year-over-year revenue growth has landed north of 10% in all but two quarters in the past three years. Meanwhile, McDonald's has been more likely to shrink than grow: data by The Golden Arches still carry the larger annual revenue stream in this comparison, and it isn't close. However, Monster is still getting bigger in the long term and McDonald's just isn't: data by The COVID-19 health crisis changed the game for both of these companies, of course.McDonald's entered 2020 on an updraft, showing 7.2% higher comparable-store sales in January and February. That momentum vanished in March, and comps fell 3.4% in the first quarter as a whole.Monster saw no significant damage to its bottling and distribution pipelines in the first quarter, but foot traffic to important sell-through points such as convenience stores and gas stations crumpled in April. Monster's energy drink sales through this channel fell 14.4% year over year last month.Looking ahead, McDonald's management believes that the fast-food world has been permanently changed by the coronavirus and it will take some time to adapt to the new market reality.\"We do know that customers will not immediately revert back to their pre-shutdown routines. For example, we know that breakfast will be the most challenged daypart,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said in the . \"As I said earlier, we entered this crisis with a solid foundation. While we face significant disruptions and challenges, we remain confident in our ability to adapt, as we've done throughout our 65 years to secure our long-term success.\"Monster CEO Rodney Sacks saw fewer long-term issues related to the COVID-19 health crisis.\"We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period,\" Sacks said on . \"We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally.\"Image source: Getty Images.In my view, there's really only one reason to prefer owning McDonald's instead of Monster Beverage. The burger chain offers a generous effective dividend yield of 2.8% right now, and Monster doesn't pay dividends at all. So if you're looking for a massive cash machine that should be able to fuel  for years to come, McDonald's would be it.Other than that, Monster offers  and a lightweight business model, easily changed to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. The distribution partnership with Coca-Cola was a game-changer in 2014 and continues to drive Monster's global growth today. So if you want your stocks to deliver more than a steady dividend check, Monster is poised to deliver strong long-term stock returns.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But when it comes to beverage stocks to buy in today\u2019s market, big-picture leadership off and on the price chart hints strongly at bullish situations worth buying into.The month of May is just underway. And following a bear-beating April performance, the best for the broader market since 1987, there\u2019s rightfully been some consolidation. For its part, the  is off by about 1.5% after its hefty near-17% rally.Last month\u2019s solid performance comes on the heels of a record-breaking rebound in late March. And in case you forgot, that trailed a pandemic-driven, record-breaking corrective bear market.To say that investor tastes can and do change \u2014 and sometimes at the drop of a hat \u2014 is an understatement. And visually, if the S&P 500 doesn\u2019t quite bring that point home, price charts in large-cap growth names like  (NYSE:) or T\u00a0(NASDAQ:) should offer clarity.The market action is enough to make an investor ponder the question, \u201cWhat will tomorrow usher in?\u201d Understandably, it\u2019s hard to know the answer amid a -tainted earnings season, an unfolding new normal and escalating tensions between the U.S. and China.Rather than focus on Wall Street\u2019s seemingly day-to-day whims, let\u2019s explore something a bit more bullish. Below are three beverage stocks set to have the \u201cit\u201d factor with investors.\n\t\n\t\tSource: Chart by TradingView\n\tMonster Beverage is the first of our beverage stocks to buy. Earnings for the maker of the self-named and popular caffeinated drink are tomorrow night. In front of the quarterly report there\u2019s some analyst chatter of  tied to the global pandemic. But don\u2019t think the warnings are the end for Monster. They\u2019re not.This competitor of  (NYSE:) timeless soda pop is forecast to show sales growth of 6.7% for the period. Monster has also proven itself a durable player in this market for more than 15 years since first gaining the attention of Wall Street.And technically, Monster shares are well-positioned for a meaningful upside breakout.This stock\u2019s monthly price shows a high-level corrective base has been forming for the past 16 months. With the pattern developing around the stock\u2019s prior August 2016 all-time high while maintaining the integrity of its longer-term uptrend, there\u2019s solid evidence shares could be \u201cit\u201d with investors through 2020 and beyond.\n\t\n\t\tSource: Chart by TradingView\n\tThe next name on our list of beverage stocks is Constellation Brands. The diversified adult beverages giant whose brands include Pacifico beer and Robert Mondavi wine has been growing its tendrils, investing in Canada\u2019s largest cannabis producer  (NYSE:).Last week, Constellation announced it  on Canopy shares valued at $174 million. The move increases this stock to buy\u2019s stake to nearly 39% in the Canadian producer as management reaffirmed its belief in the long-term beverage opportunities within the cannabis market.On the price chart, this stock to buy looks a bit different than shares of Monster. Some might worriedly see a downtrend forming on the monthly chart. What I see is a larger Fibonacci-based two-step or mirror move that\u2019s potentially signaling an end to the correction. That\u2019s based on leg CD extending 1.3% the length of leg AB which sets up the possibility for a bottom to form. There\u2019s more, too.Constellation shares have held a challenge of the 62% retracement level tied to the 2008 financial crisis. There\u2019s also a solid-looking bullish stochastics divergence from points B to D.And with April\u2019s inside candlestick supporting a meaningful low, Constellation is a stock to buy on a nearby breakout signal above $171.97.\n\t\n\t\tSource: Chart by TradingView\n\tNot that I\u2019ve saved the best for last, but Boston Beer has certainly proven the most technically dominant of our stocks to buy. My familiarity with this beverage company is irrevocably tied to its namesake Sam Adams beer as a much younger adult.But Boston Beer has proven itself to be much more than that over the years.Despite Covid-19 dinging Boston Beer\u2019s commercial craft brewing business due to bar and restaurant closures, the outfit\u2019s hard seltzer brand Truly has shown its own wherewithal with today\u2019s consumers and . And consumers aren\u2019t the only one\u2019s buying what Boston Beer is selling.On the price chart this stock broke out in late April to all-time highs. The market-leading rally out of an irregular corrective cup pattern has taken Boston Beer roughly 10% above the base. It makes shares appear somewhat pricey in the near term.However, given the larger classically formed base that\u2019s backing up this stock and stochastics signaling room for momentum, it\u2019s time to make SAM\u2019s acquaintance today.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler\u2019s management do not own any securities mentioned in this article.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MNST options chain for the new December 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $50.10 (before broker commissions).

The company also has no long-term debt. You'd be hard-pressed to find a stronger balance sheet for a company with a $30 billion .\u00a0Granted, there's relatively low barriers to entry in the beverage sector, and Monster is constantly challenged by new competitors. For example, in its , Monster management noted that newcomer Bang, owned by Vital Pharmaceuticals, had gained market share in January and controlled 7.6% of the energy-drink category. However, Monster energy still controls 40.9% across its various beverages and lost only 0.6% market share -- indicating Bang is stealing more from other players than from Monster.Given its top-dog energy drink status, global distribution, strong balance sheet, and history of success, I'd say Monster has a good chance of beating the market going forward.Because of the coronavirus, the travel industry has ground to a complete halt worldwide. That's devastating to travel reservation company  \u00a0since no one is currently booking anything. But this affects Booking's competitors as well and virtually prohibits new players from arising right now. And considering the company's portfolio includes properties like Priceline.com, Booking.com, OpenTable, and RentalCars.com, this is a network that can't be replicated overnight.For 2019, Booking Holdings generated record revenue of $15.1 billion, which resulted in a whopping $4.9 billion in net income. The company was projecting more growth in 2020, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, it had to withdraw its first-quarter guidance. But assuming this present health crisis is temporary, Booking can weather the storm. It has $6.3 billion in cash and an untapped $2 billion in credit if things get tight in coming quarters.When the travel industry returns to normal, it's likely that travelers will resume making reservations through one of Booking Holdings' many properties. There's no reason COVID-19 would dethrone Booking from its top status. And considering it trades at less than 11 times trailing earnings, you've never been able to call this a  more than now.Data by .Coffee empire   was hit harder than most during this bear market, due to the company's high exposure to China where COVID-19 originated.

The S&P 500 finished the week down a total of 9%.The broader-market gain on Friday was helped by a rise in stocks across many industries. Investors bought stocks aggressively in hopes that the market's recent pullback was an overreaction to the fears of the coronavirus' impact on the global economy. The market seemed particularly encouraged by President Donald Trump's national address on Friday afternoon. During the address, Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency, and he detailed plans to mitigate the spread of the virus. stocks didn't miss out on the market's gains on Friday.

Finance.While Trump's address may have been part of the reason for the market's rise on Friday, it's likely primarily the result of investors reassessing whether or not stocks had been oversold. While many economies around the world are likely to be negatively affected by the coronavirus, including the U.S., stocks may have fallen too far too fast in an attempt to price in these concerns. Indeed, on Thursday, the\u00a0market saw its worst one-day decline since 1987.\u00a0Going into Friday's trading, some investors may have been betting that the market was oversold, setting the stage for a rebound in stocks.However, even after a 9.2% gain for the S&P 500 on Friday, the market index is still down 20% since Feb. 19, leaving stocks in bear market territory.Just as the overall market remains significantly below its high in February, these three consumer goods stocks are still trading much lower than they were in mid-February. Since Feb. 19, Monster Beverage, , and Under Armour are down 11%, 22%, and 37%, respectively. While all three of these companies will likely be forced to navigate unique challenges as the U.S. and other countries attempt to curb the coronavirus, investors should consider whether or not these challenges have already been fully baked into current stock prices.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Wall Street generally cheers the maneuver, as it sees it as one way of returning to cash to shareholders (the other being dividends). Companies often prefer to return capital with  instead of dividends, as investors expect dividends to be consistent and generally to grow each year, while buybacks can be deployed strategically when the stock price is low and management thinks it's cheap.\u00a0Select politicians and activists, on the other hand, have long decried buybacks as a financial engineering gimmick and a tool for corporate bigwigs to enrich themselves and shareholders rather than invest to grow their business and hire more people. In the aftermath of the 2017 tax cut, stock buybacks surged as corporations used the tax windfall to repurchase their own shares and juice per-share profits. This move provoked loud jeers from critics.Today, we're nearly one month into an epic market crash. The\u00a0 has given up all of its gains since President Trump's inauguration in January 2017, erasing a three-year surge in a little more than three weeks. A bear market would seem to be just the kind of opportunity for companies with the available cash to capitalize on repurchases.Image source: Getty Images.With the\u00a0now down about 29% since its peak on Feb. 19, some companies spy an opportunity to buy back stock at a discount. Most companies are choosing to suspend share buybacks amid the current uncertainty, including\u00a0,\u00a0, and\u00a0, while Zara-parent\u00a0, the world's biggest apparel retailer, just suspended its dividend. That trend shows that companies generally see an economic shock approaching them, especially in the \u00a0sector, as industries like retail, restaurants, and travel are seeing demand quickly dry up.However, other companies are choosing to capitalize on this unique sell-off and buy back shares. Among them are ,\u00a0, and .Oracle, the legacy tech giant, recently increased its share repurchase authorization by $15 billion. CEO Safra Catz defended the move on the recent  and said the company could easily support its dividend, which yields 2%, adding on its  last week, \"We have been buying back our stock. We think it's an incredible deal. It's basically gone on clearance sale in the past few days and we think it's an enormous, it's a fantastic investment and it reduces the number of outstanding shares or otherwise known as partners we have to share our very good profits with.\"Oracle's stock has outperformed the market during the sell-off, down 14% compared to a loss of 28% in the .Last week, Monster Beverage authorized a $500 million share repurchase on top of its existing allowance of $536.6 million.\u00a0Though the company did not make a statement about the decision, it likely signals that management is aiming to accelerate its repurchases. Monster shares have fallen 19% since the recent sell-off. As an energy-drink maker the company will likely see a sales decline during the pandemic, but this is a highly profitable company with a rock-solid balance sheet. If Monster's stock continues to fall, management will likely take advantage of the opportunity to buy it back at a discount.Nomad Foods, the parent of frozen-food brands like Bird's Eye, has also tossed its hat into the share-buyback ring, authorizing a $300 million repurchase program, equivalent to about 10% of its market cap. Like Monster, Nomad didn't explain the move, but the company is a defensive, consumer staples stock and should hold up well over the current volatile period. During the recent pullback, the stock is down 22%.Companies don't always know when the best time to buy back their stock is, and are generally poor judges of when it's a good deal. However, Oracle, Monster, and Nomad look more stable than the broad market, as their businesses shouldn't be as directly impacted as those in other sectors like consumer discretionary and cyclicals, which are likely to be hit by the pandemic and the recession that could follow. Though the market could certainly fall further from here, I'd expect these well-capitalized stocks to continue to outperform.On the other hand, companies like Gap that are suspending their dividends despite trading at rock-bottom valuations based on trailing earnings could be in trouble. Stocks that are suspending buybacks despite their low prices are sending a clear signal that they see a great degree of uncertainty ahead. Given the unique situation we're in, with a pandemic threatening the global economy, these stocks are probably best avoided for now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Management also held a conference call to discuss business continuity and its supply chains, given the rising demand for some of its products.Keurig Dr Pepper reassured shareholders even as  , another relatively safe buy during this crisis, stated on Friday that it won't be able to meet its own 2020 outlook due to the pandemic's impact on its business.What allows Keurig Dr Pepper to so confidently project top- and bottom-line growth when even mighty Coca-Cola doesn't have earnings visibility? Part of the answer, as I explained in a  last week, is due to a set of characteristics unique among major beverage companies. For instance, only 13% of the manufacturer's revenue is rooted in concentrates (which are sold to affiliates that manufacture syrups used in fountain drinks).While Coca-Cola doesn't disclose its total concentrate sales, they form a significant part of each geographical segment's revenue. Quarantines, curfews, mandatory business shutdowns, and shelter-in-place orders are translating into a steep plunge in fountain sales and a corresponding decline in demand for concentrates. In its earnings warning on Friday, Coca-Cola specifically noted that it would experience a negative impact from \"the direction to refrain from dining at restaurants, the cancellation of major sporting and entertainment events, material reduction in travel, the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of work-from-home policies.\"\u00a0Thus, Keurig Dr Pepper, which derives 44% of its sales from bottled beverages (which end up in grocery and convenience stores) and 38% of sales from Keurig brewing systems and K-Cups,\u00a0will benefit more directly from the sudden surge in at-home consumption, with manageable exposure to decreased concentrate sales.The company very likely also has a slight demand edge on Coca-Cola, as well as beverage rivals\u00a0\u00a0and , in that two-fifths of its revenue is coffee-based. It's not difficult to see how a sudden shift to working at home by millions of people will benefit the company's direct and licensed K-Cup coffee sales.\u00a0Coffee pods are hot commodities at a time when everyone is working from home. Image source: Getty Images.Another advantage the\u00a0 stalwart enjoys over its competitors is its relative lack of international revenue. While the three competitors I've mentioned above each sport an entrenched global distribution footprint, Keurig Dr Pepper's revenue is concentrated in the U.S. and Canada. Its single international segment, Latin America, makes up less than 5% of total annual sales.\u00a0The organization will suffer less from global supply-chain disruption due to COVID-19 versus its fellow manufacturers.Since Keurig Dr Pepper foresees minimal business disruption, it should continue to maintain its extremely healthy  of 21% and net profit margin of 11% this year.The company's dividend is not at risk. Its  lands slightly on the high side at 67%, although this should drop to around 60% by year end based on its projected earnings-per-share growth. The KDP symbol currently offers an attractive annualized dividend yield of 2.6%.As for its balance sheet, thanks to \"continued exceptionally strong free cash flow,\" the company also reaffirmed its intention to continue to pay down the debt financing undertaken to complete the 2018 merger of Dr Pepper Snapple Group and Keurig Green Mountain. Management projects that the organization's leverage ratio will fall somewhere between 3.5 times and 3.8 times by year end, indicating a moderate debt load.Investors are beginning to notice Keurig Dr Pepper's relative strength during an extremely volatile period in the economy. As of this writing, the  index has shed nearly 30% of its value year to date, while Keurig Dr Pepper has retraced just 18% over the same period. The beverage giant now trades at a forward P/E of roughly 17. While this multiple may have positioned the company as a value stock in February, it now equates to a slight premium over the larger market, which has seen its aggregate forward P/E fall all the way to 13.0.So, a safe consumer goods investment that was underpriced as recently as a few weeks ago can now be considered slightly expensive. But for income investors who don't want to worry about a dividend payout being cut overnight, or the likelihood of dire business consequences due to the coronavirus pandemic, the comfort is well worth a few percentage points of pricing premium.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Pepsi aims to accelerate Rockstar's growth through its global distribution network and massive marketing assets, and may also fold some of Rockstar's energy drink innovations into Pepsi's own brands, such as Mountain Dew.

Grabbing Rockstar's 5.5% share of the American market is a more serious attempt.At the same time, Pepsi's splashy entrance might motivate Monster partner   to simply acquire the leading energy drink company. Coke already holds a 19% stake in Monster and has been managing the company's distribution network since 2008. Taking the next step with a complete buyout wouldn't be much of a surprise, and Pepsi's presence just might be the last straw that triggers that transaction.That's all speculation, of course. What we have today is a more powerful infrastructure behind a reasonably successful rival, and the negative market reaction makes sense from that perspective.

According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended in December 2019 Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.3% to 13.6% in the Czech Republic from 33.6% to 34.7% in Greece from 18.8% to 23% in the Republic of Ireland from 18.1% to 20.6% in Italy and from 10.9% to 14.5% in Poland and from 15.8% to 17.4% in South Africa. According to IRI in Australia Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ended December 29 2019 increased from 7.9 7.5% to 9.3% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 13.5% to 12.5% during the same period.According to IRI in New Zealand Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ended December 29 2019 increased from 5.6% to 6.3% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live+ market share in value decreased from 8.5% to 8.2% and Mother's market share in value increased from 7.8% to 9.6%. According to Nielsen in South Korea Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined for the quarter ended December 2019 grew from 37.6% to 50.6% as compared to the same period in the previous year. Monster is now the leading energy brand by market share in value in all outlets in South Korea. According to INTAGE in Japan Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the 13-week period ended December 30 2019 grew from 46.7% to 54.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $319.6 million 31.4% of total net sales in the 2019 fourth quarter compared with $274.3 million or 29.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $9.1 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA supply chain and production issues have largely been resolved. In EMEA net sales in the fourth quarter increased 8.6% in dollars and increased 12.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.7% compared to 42.1% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix. We're also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium Czech Republic France Germany Great Britain Greece Italy Norway Poland the Republic of Ireland South Africa and Spain.In Asia Pacific net sales in the fourth quarter increased 49.9% in dollars and 47.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 40.2% versus 46.1% over the same period in 2018 as a result of country and product mix. In Japan net sales in the quarter increased 84.2% in dollars and 76.8% in local currency. In South Korea net sales increased 51.5% in dollars and 58.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2018. In Oceania which includes Australia New Zealand Tahiti French Polynesia New Caledonia Papua New Guinea and Guam net sales decreased 4.1% in dollars and increased 0.8% in local currencies although I'd like to point out that sales of the Monster brand increased 18.4% in dollars and 24.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2018. In Latin America including Mexico and the Caribbean net sales in the fourth quarter increased 6.9% in dollars and 16.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.6% compared to 44.7% over the same period in 2018. In Brazil net sales in the quarter increased by 35.8% in dollars and increased 44% in local currency. Net sales in Chile decreased 14.8% in dollars and 17.6 sorry 7.6% in local currency in the quarter.In January 2020 Monster Energy was launched by the Coca-Cola Bottler in Israel. We continued the rollout of Monster across India and began the launch of Mango Loco in December. We also continued Ultra White's expansion from September's launch to further provide a broad portfolio with strong taste experiences for Indian consumers. The Monster range continued to build significant active distribution increases across China in the 2019 fourth quarter versus a year ago but the situation in China is currently challenging. I wanted to provide an update regarding the recent coronavirus or COVID-19 outbreak. First of all our number one priority is the safety of our employees in China. We are thinking of everyone who has been affected by coronavirus and we continue to monitor the situation closely. In addition to having employees in China we and our suppliers currently globally source certain ingredients from third-party manufacturers in Wuhan and other parts of China. We also manufacture finished goods through third-party bottlers and co-packers in China.The coronavirus outbreak could adversely affect our business and cause disruptions internationally due to the closure or suspension of activities at such third-party manufacturers as well as within China at our co-packing facilities and our China office. Ingredient sourcing delays could also interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products internationally. In addition the outbreak together within the accompanying special government measures could adversely affect the growth of our business in China and affect demand for our products. However it's too early to determine what impact it will have on our global supply chain and our operations. As I've said before our first priority is employee safety and we are continuing to monitor the situation closely. I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. VPX the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising. VPX filed a trademark lawsuit in March 2019 against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and another lawsuit suit in August 2019 against Monster alleging a host of legal challenges including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX.These proceedings are ongoing. In October 2019 the U.S. District Court denied VPX's motion for a preliminary injunction against our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In its decision the court ruled that VPX failed to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and failed to establish it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims. In October 2019 VPX announced its intention to launch its own line of Reign-branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. Later that month we filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and prevent VPX from infringing Monster's trademark rights in this way. In November 2019 VPX stipulated that I would refrain from launching such products until the district judge entered a final order on the preliminary injunction motion. In January 2020 the magistrate judge issued a reported recommendation that an injunction be granted in Monster's favor. Motions for summary judgment have been filed by Monster in this proceeding and which are currently pending.In the event that summary judgment is not granted the matter is scheduled for trial in May 2020. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. In October we launched Java Monster Farmer's Oats which contains oatmeal and is our first plant-based coffee product being nondairy and vegan as well as two new flavors in the Reign brand family Strawberry Sublime and Mang-O-Matic to supplement our Orange Dreamsicle line extension which was launched at the end of the third quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2019 we also extended Ultra paradise Reign Melon Mania and Reign Razzle Berry in multipacks. In 2020 in the United States we will be discontinuing our Cafe Monster line of products and repositioning our Espresso Monster line. We launched Reign Inferno thermogenic fuel in Jalapeno Strawberry Red Dragon and True Blue at the end of January 2020. We launched Mango Loco in Argentina during the fourth quarter of 2019. In Puerto Rico in January 2020 we launched Reign Strawberry Sublime and Mang-O-Matic as well as Muscle Monster vanilla and chocolate.We launched Monster Energy Monster Energy Absolutely Zero and Monster Energy Valentino Rossi in Israel in January 2020. Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Belgium Great Britain Northern Ireland the Republic of Ireland in January 2020 and is planned to be launched in to a further seven markets in 2020. Monster Pipeline Punch will be launched in the Baltics and Norway this year and will then be available in 17 markets across EMEA. Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in Great Britain Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in January 2020 and in Sweden in February 2020 and is planned to be launched into a further 18 markets throughout 2020. Espresso Monster was launched in Belgium the Republic of Ireland and Poland in the fourth quarter of 2019 in both mocha and vanilla variants. We also launched both variants in the Baltics the Netherlands and Portugal in January 2020 and in Austria in February 2020. Espresso Monster mocha and vanilla variants are now available in 14 markets in EMEA. We are planning to roll out two flavors of Espresso Monster or into a further nine markets throughout 2020.Additionally we have launched Espresso Monster Salted Caramel in Germany and Great Britain in December 2019. We're planning to roll out our Salted Caramel Espresso variant in a further five EMEA markets throughout 2020. Reign was launched in Great Britain Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the fourth quarter of 2019 and we are planning to launch Reign in Germany by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Additionally we are planning to launch into a further seven markets throughout 2020. Monster Hydro Sport was launched in Germany Great Britain Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the fourth quarter of 2019 and in France in January 2020. We are planning to launch Hydro Sport in Norway and Sweden by the end of the first quarter of 2020. We launched Predator our affordable energy brand in Kenya and Uganda in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally we launched Predator in Poland in January 2020 and are planning to launch Predator in Afghanistan Czech Republic Ghana and Hungary in the first quarter of 2020.We're also planning to launch Predator into a further 11 EMEA markets throughout 2020 Azerbaijan Belarus Bosnia Croatia Ethiopia Iraq Russia Slovenia Nigeria the Netherlands and the UAE. We launched Monster Mother Epic Swell in Australia during the fourth quarter of 2019 with a convenience customer before a national launch in January 2020. Monster Mill also launched in Australia in January 2020. In South Korea we further expanded Pipeline Punch to 90% of convenience stores with initial positive results. We launched Mango Loco in India during December and completed Ultra White's rollout in India Vietnam and Malaysia during the 2019 fourth quarter. We are planning to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific over the upcoming months including a full country relaunch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in March 2020 and Ultra Paradise in South Korea and Japan later this year. We estimate January 2020 gross sales to be approximately 15.3% higher than in January 2019. On a foreign currency adjusted basis January 2020 gross sales would have been approximately 15.7% higher than comparable January 2019 gross sales.January 2020 had the same number of selling days than in January 2019. In this regard we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days days of the week in which holidays fall timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion I'd like to summarize some recent positive points.Retail sale statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. New additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year as well as our innovation pipeline in 2020. We're encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno thermogenic fuel high-performance energy drinks not only within the U.S. but also internationally. We are pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets. Net sales in the fourth quarter in EMEA increased 12.8% in local currency in Asia Pacific increased 47.9% in local currency and in Latin America and the Caribbean increased 16.2% in local currency. We reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally. We are also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.A.I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year.[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys. -- Hi Dara. -- So gross margins returned to year-over-year expansion in the quarter after fairly significant compression generally in the last couple of years. So can you just discuss some of the key factors that drove that sequential year-over-year improvement in Q4? And if you think those factors are more sustainable as we look out to 2020? And then just on the U.S. front can you discuss your shelf space outlook particularly with Coke Energy launch? And if you think you've seen any market share impact from the Coke Energy launch so far? -- So maybe I can address the gross profit issue that you referred to. So if you look at worldwide what the positive factors worldwide well obviously the price increase in the U.S. and Canada and then product mix particularly with Reign which is a better gross margin than some of our juice and coffee products we will take benefits in because we were manufacturing Java Monster's domestically and we weren't importing from the U.S. and aluminum and other raw materials were a positive factor. So that was the positives. Against that we continue to have and you'll see the gross margins that we referred to on this call. Against that you'll continually see a change in the strategic brands versus the Monster products and the strategic brands because they are concentrates they have higher margins than the finished goods product. So that's you'll continue to see that as an offset.You'll continue to be see geographic mix as an issue because obviously in the U.S. our margins are strong. They are less strong in other parts of the world for all the reasons we've spoken to in the past and you'll see the same trend with regard to product mix as we sell internationally as we sell more juice products and more coffee products they have a lower margin than the traditional Monster products and Reign products. So that's in a nutshell where we are with margin.Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thank you for taking my question. If you can comment on how the launches in particular Reign Inferno and how incrementally has been to your quarter-to-date update? And as a follow-up to your coronavirus commentary obviously safety is the most important at this point. But what is your view on the monitoring in California and overall changes in mobility? Have you seen any greater impact in convenience stores so far against the other channels? -- Perhaps I'll just take the Inferno has been really well received. The initial it's really very new to tell but the sales have been good. The line extensions that we introduced into the Reign line including particular Orange Dreamsicle have also been well received. So the numbers are looking really positive for Orange Dreamsicle and the other new products as well as Reign. So anecdotally we've had some good response both to the concept of the thermogenic inferno products as well as to the actual flavors. -- So Alex if you look at for example what's happening in China we're seeing obviously significant foot traffic decreasing in the bigger stores and the convenience stores have they have and are suffering but not to the same degree. So if you translate that back to California we haven't seen any implications yet. But the whole idea of the situation in China is that they limit the number of shoppers in particular stores. So that's why you'll see reduced foot traffic in the bigger stores and more concentrated foot traffic in the convenience stores. But we haven't seen any implications of that at this time. And then if I could just talk about the coronavirus for one second I've been asked and I haven't really answered it because I was waiting to answer it on the call. And we don't normally give numbers sales in various countries. But what I can tell you is that our sales in China in 2019 were less than 1% of our consolidated net sales for the company. So that puts a little bit in perspective because it was a little bit of nervousness but it's less than 1%.Our next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. -- Yes. Hey, thanks. So Hilton last month in New York you acknowledged potential I think you think you framed to those issues of focus as Coke Bottlers were taking on Coke Energy and bring it to the market in the U.S. Just I guess some update there and how you're feeling about those bottlers' execution on your brands now that we're a couple of months into the year. The January numbers imply that you've had some good uptake of that innovation but just any color around that and around the in-market execution that you're seeing would be great. And then just to give voice to a question Dara had asked that I think we might have lost sight of. Just any additional color on the cooler and shelf set redesigns as they're shaping up in the U.S. Are you getting the positioning that you thought you would? Is Coke Energy getting the position that you thought it would relative to yourselves and Red Bull and others? That too would be great. Thank you. -- Okay. So the situation with our bottlers is always going to be a challenge now and we know that and we're working with all of our bottlers and our field teams and our guys on the street are working very closely to ensure that we get the right type of representation on shelves. The anecdotal information that I've seen is that Coca-Cola Energy took off and unfortunately or fortunately there doesn't seem to be a very strong amount of repeat purchases. However they will continue we believe to spend significant amounts of dollars on their products. And what we have to do is what I've probably said in New York and I'll say it again we have to stay true to our lives and ensure that our products get the right representation in the stores and we don't suffer the issues of shelf space that for example we experienced in Australia and we alluded to that in our presentation as well. But the news of today is that Coca-Cola Energy has been in its current form has been discontinued from the two major retailers in Australia. -- If I could just perhaps just add a little bit on that on color. We've looked at some of the schematics that have come out for this year in the U.S. which is the obviously the place where Coke Energy has recently been launched. And if we look at the schematics for that plus obviously the performance energy products by and large we are getting increased shelf space both for our general products as well as our Reign products and Inferno including our innovation. And perhaps if we look back on 2019 some of the innovation that we introduced didn't quite get the real estate and distribution levels that we had hoped for and we thought and that probably was affected us a little bit in the 2019 year. But if you look at the new products we have a really robust pipeline of new products. We have new Reign products Inferno. We've got Ultra Fiesta and Ultra Rosa in the Ultra line that are two really good products. We have NOS Turbo which is sort of a performance energy product to help boost the NOS line.We've got our new Hydro Sport SKUs we have a new Java 300 line which has a higher caffeine content to compete with the Starbucks Tripleshot. So and we are looking at the SKUs and we're getting a lot of good listings for the innovation. So hopefully execution of our bottlers and distribution partners this year on particularly on innovation will be better and we are getting extra innovation. In many cases we are getting the performance products onto an additional or separate shelf. In some cases it's simply an expansion of and within the energy set.Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. Good evening, guys. -- Good evening. -- Two very quick ones. First one for Hilton. The G&A in the quarter this one is a bit granular but I think that needs to be asked to sort of explain some of the profit margin pressure in the quarter. So gross margin better but G&A was quite a bit higher even excluding the intellectual property claim. Can you talk a little bit about some of the drivers there? And I know you don't like to guide but should we expect sort of normalization on that line item looking out for the balance of the year? And then Hilton just on the performance segment understanding your comments already on the shelf space reset but can we get updated thoughts there? So Bang obviously made a lot of noise but the market share on that product is down about a point sequentially from where it was around the time of the launch of Reign. And when we look at the combined market share of those two brands being and & Reign it's kind of hanging around this 11% sort of area. So your updated thoughts on the outlook for performance for the balance of '20 and sort of beyond that. Are we sort of at a place where this 11% market share is kind of the right number? Or you think it goes beyond that? And if so why? So thanks for all that guys. -- Okay. Wow that's quite enough. That's about 24 questions in one. If we talk a little bit about G&A I think we were satisfied with the G&A that was spent in the quarter. We were rolling off the NASCAR program and we have a big push into social media. And that was one of the big factors that we kind of were duplicating some of the social media costs in the quarter as we roll off the NASCAR program. So you won't see that NASCAR program to the same degree in 2020. And then when I look at the rest of the G&A payroll is obviously increasing higher than ordinarily we would like but we're running an international business today that's growing and developing and you could see from the sales and the number of countries we're in that we have to support the organization.So quite apart from other small issues which or not small issues but other issues which you'll pick up in the K I don't want to go into them now. All I can tell you is that I think that apart from that litigation which obviously we were really unhappy about but it's a fact of doing business in the U.S. and I always tell everyone I'm not a lawyer but I listen to these juries and it's like it is what it is. But I'm satisfied that our G&A is under control. So sorry what the next question you asked was about the percentage of the performance energy products in the U.S.? And with that yeah... -- And so that... -- Yes sorry. -- Yes I'm sorry not to. It was just basically broadly outlook for performance segment which of course has made a lot of noise over the past year or two. But Bang's market share is now down about a point Reign is three, 3.5 it's is in that range. And when you look at the combined market share of those two brands it's been sort of bouncing around this 11% sort of area. So where does that leave us? What's your outlook for performance energy? And what's its role in the category going forward? Thank you guys. -- Well I think Rodney put up his hand. So I'm happy for him to take over. All right. Just looking at that section I think the section that again we call it the performance section but really it's part of the energy category and it's really energy. It's a question of whether we can carve out additional space with retailers to look at attracting increased buyers into the categories. And so I think that you are we are seeing some increased buyers coming into the category. And the set is sort of starting to settle down now. You're getting space allocated to Bang space allocated to Reign including Inferno. We're seeing a little bit of space being allocated to some of the competitors. You've got Rockstar with their sort of line and they've come out with a thermogenic line as well. And then you've got Adrenaline Shoc and then some of the smaller guys who are trying to get space but don't have the distribution dips CELSIUS and C4. So but we think it is panning out. So it's sort of starting to settle down. It may grow a little bit but we certainly don't know.We think that there is an appetite there is an increased consumer base through the different type of products that we've introduced now for example through Inferno. But we do we don't give as I said guidance I think you know that. And we certainly don't have a crystal ball but we think that there is some positive growth that will be achieved in energy generally. And I think that this subset of types of products within the energy category will grow a little bit. And we are launching for example our Hydro Super Sport and that again is sort of an advanced hydration but it does have BCAAs and higher caffeine. So a lot of products like that Turbo are starting to play into this area. Just really really just dividing up the attributes that consumers are looking for. Some consumers are looking for higher caffeine or BCAAs and we think that that will help the whole category grow as well as these specific products within the category. -- Yes. I can just add to that Kevin. I'm a consumer of these products and I honestly believe the category is here to stay but where it will go I don't think anybody knows. I think the main thing is that we have a number of SKUs that are addressing the category. We have some new product innovation that's coming in terms of flavors and we're pretty excited about that whole performance energy part of the energy category but it's one part. There's lots of other parts to it as well. -- Yeah. Thanks.Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. -- Wow. That was a pronunciation. Hey, guys. How are you? -- All right. And you? -- I am good, other than the stock market. So Hilton I wanted to go back to gross margin. I know I seem to ask this question a lot on calls but international in particular I guess how should we think about that going forward? I'm not asking guidance but I guess it seems like the pressure on the strategic brands is having an outsized impact on that number. So as you go to the back half of '20 you start lapping these low double-digit declines that you had in 3Q and 4Q. You're obviously launching Predator now. I guess that's not you're launching Predator now that's a concentrate model so that should help. How should we be thinking about kind of those moving parts? Meaning as you lap easier comparisons as you get the benefit from Predator should that help stabilize international gross margins? Can they move a little bit higher if Predator works in these markets? Maybe just a bit more color there in terms of the puts and takes on thinking about international margins would be helpful. -- Yes I think that as we look at the international business we've spoken about the way the pricing structure works in those markets that we try and price ourselves close to where Red Bull is and that we have different models with the bottlers internationally that kind of force us into a different gross margin computation than we have in the U.S. Having said that if I look for example at the EMEA margin which we discussed earlier on the call and the margins there fell from 42% to 38.7% but there were a number of factors that went into that result. Firstly and we've spoken about this before we have country mix we have brand mix we have product mix. So we have a very extensive product project now to reduce the juice content in a number of our juice products to enhance margin. We have other projects and I just came back from the U.K. about two weeks ago where the whole meeting was just focused on margin focused on freight in focused on co-packers focused on where best to allocate our resources to try and improve the gross margins. And we have this concentrate and Monster progression.That of course will be resolved in part when we're able to get Predator up and running. So there were a number of factors. And then you always have one-offs in the quarter. So in the fourth quarter we had about a one percentage hit to gross margin in EMEA through one-off costs. So I think we're very well aware from this office of the need to improve margins and we are working on improving the margins within the constraints of the strategic brands having higher margins than the Monster brands and Reign brands. Obviously our objective is to sell more Monster and sell more Reign. And if that takes away from the strategic brands then so be it because this is the Monster Beverage Corporation. This is what our mission is to sell Monster and Reign products. So if the strategic brands will in fact over time they make a hit we're doing the best we can to keep them at their current levels and improve on that. But it's a mix and it will continue to be a mix. And I'm not sure there's anything more I could say. I probably said too much.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg for any closing remarks. -- Thank you. On behalf of Monster I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola Bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited about the new opportunities we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drinks throughout the world comprised of our Monster energy brand together with the strategic brands as well as Hydro Predator and Reign and the pretty extensive new innovation that we have recently introduced and are planning to continue to introduce throughout the rest of 2020. Thank you very much for your attendance.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Nonetheless, incorporating a 7% bounce back on Monday, March 3, shares remain about 385% above their May 2019 IPO pricing of $25.\u00a0Of course, volatility has been a hallmark of Beyond Meat ever since its IPO debut, as investors have by turns appeared smitten with its enormous potential to disrupt the $1.4 trillion global meat market,\u00a0and more realistic about its prospects in an increasingly crowded field of plant-based meat substitute manufacturers.Let's explore why, despite its recent retracement, Beyond's stock still looks overvalued.Beyond Meat's fourth-quarter earnings charted year-over-year revenue growth of 212%, to $98.5 million. The top-line expansion scaled\u00a0 from 25% to 34% and also helped decrease the company's year-over-year quarterly net loss from $7.5 million to $0.5 million.Yet shareholders blanched at Beyond Meat's 2020 outlook, as revenue growth is slated to decelerate this year (albeit at a still-blistering projected range of 64% to 71%), resulting in a projected top line of between $490 million and $520 million.\u00a0More pertinently, despite the higher revenue, 2020 gross margin is slated to come in between 33% and 35%. At the midpoint, that's static against current gross margin. And adjusted \u00a0(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) as a percentage of net sales won't expand either, but it will remain \"approximately equivalent to 2019 levels, as the company anticipates accelerated investments in marketing, R&D and international expansion initiatives in 2020,\" the company stated in its 8-K filing.Image source: Getty Images.In other words, as founder and CEO Ethan Brown explained during the company's\u00a0, Beyond Meat is seeking aggressive global growth, \"even if this comes at the expense of near-term profit and margin expansion.\"This growth is predicated on scaling supply by launching localized production in targeted geographic regions. Brown relayed that Beyond Meat expects to open a new co-packing facility in the Netherlands this quarter, and it's aiming to begin production in Asia by the end of 2020 -- though the COVID-19 epidemic could alter the timing of this goal.Expansion isn't the only headwind crimping profits and cash flow. As I discussed on  with analyst and host Emily Flippen, while the company's most visible rival may be privately held Impossible Foods, it's facing stiffened competition from large, institutional food providers such as Cargill and , which are launching their own meatless products into retail channels.Given its relative lack of profitability, earnings-based metrics do little to illuminate Beyond Meat's market pricing. We can instead utilize its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio as a reasonable valuation metric. And for the sake of comparability, the beverage industry offers some cases that parallel Beyond Meat's early disruption of an established market.For example, like Beyond Meat,  was once an early mover in an extremely large total addressable market (TAM) -- the global coffee cafe and retail market. Starbucks currently trades at 3.4 times forward one-year sales and reveals a glimpse of what Beyond Meat's P/S ratio might look like in several years when it matures., a pioneer in the energy-drink business, provides us with an example of a company that has seen torrid growth. Since it began focusing on the energy-drink market in 2012, Monster has seen its brands explode in volume, and the company now boasts an impressive 30% market share among energy drinks in the United States. Monster currently trades at 7.3 times sales.\u00a0, which has introduced an app-driven, cashier-less coffee experience in China and is notable for its ubiquitous, extremely small cafes, has generated triple-digit revenue growth (like Beyond Meat) in recent quarters. It's also newly public, having made its debut on the public markets in July 2018.\u00a0Luckin is expanding beyond China to increase its TAM; it currently sports a forward P/S ratio of 5.1.As for Beyond Meat, the volatile \u00a0trades, as of this writing, at 11.4 times forward 2020 sales. This is the kind of multiple you'd usually associate with high-gross-margin, SaaS (software-as-a-service) tech outfits.\u00a0Given the company's slowing revenue growth, its relatively meager gross margin, and no plans to improve EBITDA margin as it fights for market share, Beyond Meat's share price in relation to its net sales should probably fall closer over time to that of fellow consumer-goods innovators Luckin Coffee and Monster Beverage.By this logic, a P/S multiple of 5 to 7 times sales appears reasonable in the intermediate term. That implies a stock price for Beyond Meat in a ballpark range of $45 to $65 -- quite below present trading levels.Of course, more breakthroughs in its pea protein research, leading to additional products that are ever closer in texture and taste to animal meat, could sustain Beyond Meat's dazzling market premium. Or perhaps sales will accelerate past management's 2020 framework, justifying current pricing.\u00a0I don't predict that this stock will descend all the way to the range I've described. But as realities of growth and competition set in, I won't be surprised if a more moderate price-to-sales ratio manifests in these shares over the next few quarters.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company will need to fend off hard-charging competition.But valuation certainly hasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t been a reason to sell quality stocks in this market. And the decades of expertise Boston Beer has acquired in building Sam Adams into one of the country\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s most popular beers should allow the company to keep its market-leading share.Fourth-quarter earnings might not show the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s potential strength. In fact, earnings may decline on a year-over-year basis. If that leads to a short-term sell-off, it will make Boston Beer stock an even more attractive long-term play.Hard seltzer already is a billion-dollar industry. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s likely to grow for years to come.After all, hard seltzer can be enjoyed by pretty much any consumer. One serving of Boston Beer\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Truly seltzer has just 100 calories. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s refreshing, tastes good, and targets drinkers who don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t enjoy liquor or wine.In fact, a recent report notes that millennials actually  to wine. That shift led U.S. wine sales in 2019 to actually decline almost 1% year-over-year.The wine market in this country is . Hard seltzer is taking market share from beer as well. And so if coming generations truly prefer hard seltzer over the alternatives, $100 billion-plus in alcohol sales are up for grabs.It doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t take much in the way of market share for that opportunity to drive material upside in Boston Beer, which still has a market capitalization below $5 billion.One key issue for Boston Beer is that in hard seltzer it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not the sales leader \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 yet. That title currently goes to privately held , whose White Claw owns .But Truly isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t far behind, at roughly one-third market share. The question is if other rivals can chip away at the dominance of the sector\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s two leaders.  (NYSE:) has launched seltzers under both the Natural Light and Bud Light brands.

Private companies like  and  are attacking the market.  (NYSE:) unit Smirnoff is trying to capitalize on its Smirnoff Ice brand. Once marijuana legalization becomes a reality in the U.S., cannabis-infused seltzers too will enter the market.The fear is that those competitors, large and small, will erode Truly\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s market share. And that is what has happened in the non-alcoholic space. (NASDAQ:) had an early lead with its LaCroix sparkling water. Competitors ranging from  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:) to  (OTCMKTS:) and  have taken its sales, however. After rising more than 1,000%, FIZZ stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value.But I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d point to a note from  that Barron\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s highlighted this month.

But I do expect Boston Beer will keep healthy share in a growing market \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 and that should be enough to drive Boston Beer stock higher.There is a short-term consideration, as Boston Beer reports fourth quarter earnings on Wednesday afternoon. And it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s possible that report could provide an opportunity.After all, Boston Beer\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s numbers aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t likely to be spectacular. Hard seltzer sales slow in the fall and winter months. The company is spending on marketing behind Truly and other products. And the legacy beer portfolio, even with help from  of , has seen choppy performance in recent years.Investors sold Boston Beer stock after the third-quarter report: shares dropped 8%.

Some investors still are focusing on the beer business, and thus may see Q4 as disappointing. Savvy investors, however, see a billion-dollar opportunity in hard seltzer \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 an opportunity which should make Boston Beer stock an attractive long-term pick.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 by getting them into the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

We'll talk with best-selling author Bob Sutton about how successful companies scale their businesses. And, as always, we'll give you an inside look at the stocks on our radar.But we begin with big retail. Costco's first quarter sales came in lower than expected. Management put part of the blame on Thanksgiving being so late this year. Andy, I'm not indifferent to how the calendar affects businesses, but I don't think Thanksgiving being late in the year had anything to do with Costco's website being slow this quarter.Well that is true, Chris. They did have a little trouble on their website during the Black Friday, Thanksgiving period. But big retailer is right, Chris. They're so close to 100 million card holders! They're at 99.9 million, up from 98.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of last year. Overall it was a pretty nice quarter from my perspective. Total sales up 5.6%. Membership fee income up 6.1%. Renewal rates still very strong at almost 90% when you look across the world, about flat with last year. Their executive memberships are now at 21.4 million. That was up a little bit from the end of the year. Comp sales up 5%.Chris, you mentioned the website. The Thanksgiving period did fall out of the comp period. But they also report monthly numbers, so we knew what they were looking at. And overall it was still the 5% to 6% of comp store growth. Some nice e-commerce business growth. But they did leave some on the table. They talked about on the call, their website problems did leave a little bit. E-commerce was up very nicely, but it could have been a little better had their website performed a little better during the holiday period.Yeah, I've always wondered -- I think Costco is a great example of one of those membership models that just has proven to be so successful over time. And over this past year, I can't believe this, we joined Costco for the first time ever. I mean, we were never Costco members. I'm sorry, Mac. But as I mentioned before, we're doing some bathroom renovations at home, and we thought maybe having that membership, we could shop around. It turned out, we didn't use it at all. So I'm going to be interested to see in a year, will we renew that membership? And really for Costco, that is the business, right? It is those members. So it's just going to be noteworthy to see not only those membership renewals, which they've historically just maintained so nicely, but also how high they can keep pushing that price, because it does seem like we're running into a world where even Prime memberships are coming under fire now for how pricey they can be perceived.The other really interesting thing about the call is, they got asked the question about order online, pickup, especially with the success we've seen at  and , for example. And they say it's just not something they're focused on. They look at it. The CFO actually said it's kind of a head scratcher to them, considering the way that people shop at Costco. So, they have no intention of going aggressively after that. They're just kind of watching it because of that experience, shopping at a Costco.I feel like maybe in school, there's some secret class where they teach people how to be Costco shoppers. I'm just always astounded by how full those parking lots are, and how many people use Costco for their regular shopping. It's a wonderful deal, tremendous value, don't get me wrong, but I mean, you're not born knowing that, right? It's taught somewhere at some point, right?Yeah, and people appreciate it, too. Apparently. Shares of software maker Adobe hitting an all-time high this week. Fourth quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. Adobe getting higher subscriptions in that core digital media business, Jason.Yeah. I think oftentimes, investors will overlook bigger companies. They feel like maybe the companies have grown so big that the low-hanging fruit has been picked, the returns aren't there for investors, and it's not a worthwhile investment. I think Adobe is a great example of a company that just blows this idea completely out of the water. I mean, when you look at a lot of the numbers that they're chalking up, it's really just astounding for a $140 plus billion market cap. Quarter four revenue was up 21% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per share up 25%. I'm really excited about the Adobe Arrow platform they're developing for augmented and virtual and mixed reality. It was really neat to see how much focus on the Document Cloud there was in the call, though. Document Cloud revenue for the quarter of $340 million. That was up 31% from a year ago. $1.22 billion for the year. That was up 25%. We talk a lot about on this show, and we talk about their competition in the space. Adobe is one of their big competitors. Very similar-sized businesses when you talk about what they're focusing. DocuSign revenue was up 40% for the quarter last year, for context. So there's clearly some jockeying going on there in that space. I'm making my bold, reckless prediction right here, right now, for you three around this table, and all our listeners. I think 2020, Adobe buys DocuSign, because that would give them access to the small and medium-sized businesses that really have taken to DocuSign's product offerings so early.Well, in a couple of weeks, we'll have our preview show for 2020. You'll need to come up with a different reckless prediction for that.I'm sure people will probably forget what I just said anyways and I can just use it again, right?This is a comment that's less about Adobe and more about software in general. I told Jamo this a couple times. I keep on forgetting that Adobe is like a $150 billion business. Isn't that just nuts? To me, it's a good reminder that some software companies are just going to be massive. When we look out across a lot of the other smaller players -- DocuSign is a $10 billion business or so. A lot of these businesses that a lot of investors are saying are overvalued are actually going to turn into multi-baggers because companies like Adobe are showing that it's possible. So, that's exciting to me. It's not just a software company, but it's an exceptionally profitable software company, with margins near 30%, returns on capital close to 30%, too. This is a business, like you said, Aaron, that sometimes doesn't get the respect they deserve because, while it's been around a long time, the way they've totally changed their business and really focused on the cloud and new innovations is going to drive that business forward.Yeah, the reliability of the subscription revenue, and the focus on their market, that creative market that they focus on. As long as they keep investing in bringing new and awesome products and services for people to use, pare going to keep reupping. They're going to recognize a little pricing power as time goes on. This investment should just continue to really perform, I think, for Foolish investors that take that long-term view. Same-store sales for GameStop fell 23% in the third quarter. Coincidentally, that is roughly the same amount that the stock fell this week. Aaron, the video game industry is booming. This is a video game retailer. How is it this bad?I'm about to go off right now, so bear with me. This situation is so bad that in a lot of ways, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of what's going on. Let's set the stage. The future of video games is going to be entirely digital. GameStop is a physical store that sells mainly physical goods. Red flag. They have over 5,000 stores -- which, for those counting, is more than a number of s and Chick-fil-As combined. And every attempt to pivot they've ever taken -- buying a mobile phone company, buying an in-browser gaming business -- they've all emphatically failed. Oh, yeah, and their net debt is 3X their market cap right now. So yeah, that's setting the stage.There is some cyclicality in the gaming business. Obviously, when your same-store sales go down some 20%, that's a bit more than cyclicality. I'll also say that GameStop has gone through a pretty insane executive turnover. It's not getting better. The most recent CEO, the current one, George Sherman, who started in April, is acting like he has absolutely no clue how to run a business. Check this out. Since July, GameStop has repurchased a third of the company's stock.Well, it's cheap now. [laughs] I don't know, just, George, what the heck are you doing, man? Are you trying to kill your own company? You're getting paid millions of dollars [laughs]\u00a0to just buy back your stock? And this is something like all investors, all activists, all board members, need to hear -- this company is overextended. It's on the wrong side of history. It's over-leveraged, and instead of putting their cash flows to work to save the business, they're not even handing it out in dividends to shareholders anymore. They're literally just lighting money on fire to repurchase shares of a business that will die unless they spend that money some other way.So yeah, maybe at this point, they can't save themselves. They've shot themselves in the foot a while ago and are already bleeding out. It's just so bad. If they want to save themselves, they've got to get rid of this guy as quickly as possible. They need to close down their underperforming stores as quickly as possible. And they need to start experimenting with alternative floorplans as quickly as they possibly can to become a place that doesn't just sell gaming goods, but sells gaming experiences. Whether that means partnering with, like, amateur eSports leagues, start-ups that are doing cool location-based VR type stuff. Essentially, they need to do everything they can to make their locations, build communities, showcase the future, and in the simplest terms, just be a place where people want to be. They're just failing, and it's so abysmal. We have some other news in the industry this week, and that is, we got some more details on Microsoft's next generation Xbox. Which, to this point, had been referred to as Project Scarlet. What details are most exciting to you, and why do we have to wait a year for this? Because that was the other thing I noticed. We got some more details, and it's basically December 2020. Both the new Xbox and the new PlayStation, PlayStation 5, will come out around holidays next year. Typically, console cycles are pretty long anyway, so it's not that surprising that people are starting to talk about things earlier than normal. But I also think, with consoles, we're going to start seeing them start to reflect more like phone plans, where you have upgrades and you start paying them off monthly. And what they're doing, they're framing this up as the Series X. And I expect, in the same way that they launched the Xbox One, and then had the Xbox One X and One S, this will be a series that gets updated slowly over time so that people won't have to wait so long to get the next version going forward.Well, if he wants, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella can just go through his furniture, find some change, buy GameStop, and then they'll have a showcase for the new Xbox! I think Satya's a little smarter than that. on the rise. The company broke even in the first quarter, but Wall Street was expecting a loss, so that was good enough to send the stock up 10%, Andy.Yeah, a little different than last quarter, when we saw the reverse. The stock was down pretty big on the day of their announcement. Active client counts up 17%. That's one number I watch pretty closely. It's been right around there for the past couple quarters. That's good. Net revenue was up 21%, which I think has gotten a lot of people excited.The big innovation they've been pushing over the last few quarters are these direct buy initiatives. Shop Your Looks, Shop Your Colors. They continue to see some nice results with these tests as they go out, so it allows people not necessarily to have to always depend on these shipments that they get from their stylist, but actually they can go on, and through some improved algorithms, make these purchases directly. And that's starting to have a little bit of an impact. They raised some guidance for the year after this quarter. The stock really had not performed very well in the last few months. We saw that rebound this quarter. Lululemon's same-store sales in the third quarter were up 17%, but that just wasn't good enough for investors, Jason, and the stock down 4% on the report. Lululemon is getting it done!Well, yeah, we wouldn't have said this probably a couple of years ago, certainly a few years ago, but the biggest risk for a stock like this right now is valuation, because when you look at the business, it really is firing on all cylinders -- hey, Ron, how you doing? The valuation doesn't leave a lot of room for a hiccup. And we know in this space, that's likely to come at some point. But I don't think that's anything that owners of the business should be worried about today. When you look at the numbers that they continue to chalk up there. Top line growth up 23%. Comps up 17%. Direct-to-consumer now represents 27% of total sales. They did pull back on top line guidance for the year just slightly, which probably led to a little bit of the market's trepidation. And I did notice, inventory levels are creeping up there a little bit. It's nothing terribly concerning, but we should keep an eye on it as we watch the margin picture continue to unfold.But for now, I think this is a business that just continues to impress. Like , we talk about, they've got great products. This is what happens when you have great products and you run a great business. Kevin Plank, why don't you take some notes?  is our email address. Question from Rob in Massachusetts. He writes, \"I'm 33 years old. I've been investing for a little over a year and really enjoying myself. Recently, I came across some amazing numbers in regard to the aging population in the U.S. and the number of people who need or will be needing some sort of incontinence product. How do I invest in this market opportunity? Thanks for all the great shows. I'm a cheesemaker and The Motley Fool podcasts keep me well occupied during the long hours of washing cheeses.\"Thank you for a great question, Rob, and thank you for making cheese. One of the great products in the world. What's the move here, Andy?Yeah, sticking with probably the big large consumer product goods companies like , I think that's one. That's probably the play. It's definitely a market that's getting more and more attention to help older citizens. So I think it's probably bigger on the consumer side, on the big players like Kimberly Clark.Yeah, I have absolutely no idea how to capitalize on this trend. Never thought about it before. Andy's probably right. But I sense it a deeper, darker conspiracy here. Does anybody find it ironic that a cheesemonger, the creator of one of the least lactose-friendly foods, is curious about profiting from products that will only benefit from lactose intolerance? I don't know, I'm thinking that Big Cheese is trying to profit on both sides of the digestive system here.I'm not going to sit here and let you bad mouth cheese. The fact that I'm in Big Cheese's pocket has absolutely nothing to do with that.Let's get to the stocks on our radar this week. Our man behind the glass, Steve Broido, is back, and he's going to hit you with a question. Andy Cross, what are you looking at this week? Steve, a hot IPO this week. , BILL, came out and the stock did really well, up 60%. It's now valued more than $2 billion. They provide business processing for small and midsize businesses, invoicing, payable, that kind of stuff. Really interested in this business. Cloud-based, very friendly, and there are a lot of small and medium-sized businesses out there who continue to use paper-pushing initiatives and they need to move into the digital space, so bill.com can help them do that. Steve, question about bill.com? That's a pretty clever URL they got. What do you think they paid for it, just out of curiosity? I'm assuming some Bill somewhere bought bill.com, and they had to buy it from him. [laughs]\u00a0Maybe true. I don't know, Steve-O.Jason Moser, what are you looking at this week? A new one for our universe here, a company called , TRMB. At its core, Trimble build software that connects the physical and digital world. Clearly right up my alley. It does serve a number of different markets, from construction and engineering to energy, aviation, and beyond. Specifically, it's Trimble Connect that has me interested. That's their mixed reality platform. They've partnered with companies like Microsoft and Neurable and Magic Leap, among others. CEO Steven Berglund has been there since 1999 running the show. I like to see leadership that's been there for a while. This is one that's on the watch list here for our augmented reality service.Steve, question about Trimble?What company are they trying to disrupt in this space?Very much similar to what we're seeing from and from companies like .Aaron Bush, what are you looking at this week?I'm looking at , MNST, which is a super easy business to understand. They sell energy drinks. They make lots of money selling cans of liquid. The stock has underperformed over the past five years or so. But I think now, it's finally at a point where it'll start outperforming again. The brand dominates in the U.S. They partnered with \u00a0to be able to tap into their global distribution system. That's clicking into gear. Both Europe and Asia clocking in over 40% growth. I think this is a business that will be able to do double-digits EPS growth going forward, and where the price is at, I think it looks pretty compelling.Steve, question about Monster Beverage?Seems like the world is trending healthier. Is Monster or a healthy drink? [laughs] No. But, believe it or not, energy drinks are still growing something like 10% as a trend around the world. So I'm not too worried about people shying away from Monster right now.You're more worried about cheese eaters.Yeah, I'm really worried.Trimble, Monster Beverage, bill.com. You got a stock you want to add to your watch list, Steve?I think Trimble. Let's go with Trimble. Alright. Jason Moser, Aaron Bush, Andy Cross, guys, thanks for being here!For more than 30 years, Bob Sutton has taught at Stanford University. He's the author of several best-selling books, including . Last month at The Motley Fool's annual meeting, I talked with Bob in front of a live audience about what works and what doesn't work when it comes to scaling.Let's get into some of the things in the book. One of the points that you make pretty quickly on is the idea that if you're looking to spread excellence around, one of the most effective ways to do that right off the bat is to find the things that are negative and subtract those.There's a famous management book, some of you may have heard of, I think the best-selling of all time, perhaps, by Jim Collins. Our mantra is the opposite, it's bad to great. When you look at situations where you want to spread something good, the first order of business is to get rid of bad stuff. If you want to go to some of the basics, social psychology, think of some of the elements of your life. First of all, let's start with your personal relationships, because that's a good place to start. There are great long-term studies that show that -- the studies happen to be of long-term heterosexual married couples, but I think this works for everybody -- if you go below five-to-one -- so, every time you have a bad interaction with your partner, you don't make it up with one good interaction -- things aren't going to last. So, just as somebody who's been married and living with the same woman virtually forever, as soon as I heard that research, I say to myself, \"If I've been bad, I have to be good five times in a row.\" So, that five-to-one rule is very powerful.And then the other finding, more in the workplace, is there's good evidence in a small team, if you've got a deadbeat, a jerk -- I wrote a book called rule, so that's the word I use -- but if you've got one person like that in your team, it brings down the effectiveness of your team by 30% or 40%. There's two reasons. One is, bad behavior is really contagious. The other one -- maybe some of you have a bad team member in your team right now. What tends to happen is, you spend more time dealing with that difficult person, and less time actually doing the work.So, if we fast forward to scaling situations, if you look at what some of the most effective scalers do -- we were talking about last night at dinner, Carlos Brito, who's the CEO of , which has bought virtually every beer company in the world, just about now. Budweiser, Stella, and so on. His perspective is, the first order of business is to get rid of the bad stuff so you can make way for the good stuff.So, yes, bad is stronger than good. And good is wonderful, but a little bit of bad can ruin a lot of good.So, people can be fired.Yes.What is the process for looking at a suite of products or services, and beginning to analyze, \"OK, we're doing all of these things currently, should we maybe streamline these, get rid of some of these\"? And that can apply to products, services, or even marketing messages. To me, there's two parts of it. One is getting rid of the bad stuff. Some of you may know this story -- when Larry Page took over as CEO, probably eight or 10 years ago, of Google, he actually went to the Wikipedia page to see all the different products. In the old days of Google, they were massively decentralized, and everybody could do whatever they wanted. They have some guardrails now. And he used the Wikipedia page to identify all the different products that Google had. Most of them were the walking dead, they were zombie products. And so that's just the notion of getting rid of pure complexity.So, to me, there's two parts of that. One is just getting rid of bad stuff. If you have destructive people, you have products that are driving customers crazy, you've got bad processes, that's part of the bad.And the other part -- and this is a big part of scaling -- is that pure cognitive load. We do all sorts of things in organizations to unwittingly put more weight on our mind. And the more weight that we have on our mind, the harder it is for us to do what we think is right just because we're dragged down by it. That's why Huggy Rao and I are really quite obsessed with organizational friction now. You were talking before, you used the word guardrails. This gets into another part of the book that I find very interesting, and not just because I was raised Catholic, but the whole concept of Catholicism versus Buddhism is something that companies, as they grow, tend to wrestle with, shall we say. Whether it's, we've got one location and we're selling coffee, and we're looking to open up 500 locations. But I'm wondering if you can share a little bit about the struggles and the opportunities that companies have when they're wrestling with it. The Catholicism versus Buddhism, let me describe where that came from. In every organization, we work with this challenge. It's always there. It never goes away. It's an ongoing decision for management and everyone else. The challenge is, do you do the same thing the same way everywhere? Or do you allow local variation? To tell you where the story came from, because it's got some investment twists. I'm one of the founders of something called the Stanford d.school, which teaches innovation at Stanford. It's a cross sort of university unit. And in the early days, there's a guy -- you can look him up. He's got an amazing web page. His name is is Michael Dearing. His company is Harrison Metal. His last job was, he was head of North American, and then he got weird and realized he was really good at talking to three or four people, and figuring out how to fund them and get them to 20 people. And if you go down the list of companies, you can look at Harrison Metal, he sold five companies to , he did MasterClass, Harry's Razors, some you may use. He's been incredibly successful.So we're sitting there with Michael in the early days of the d.school, and he looks at us and he says,\"So are you going to be Catholics or Buddhists?\" And we look at him like, \"What the hell are you talking about?\" And he was raised a devout Catholic. And his point was, it's a constant struggle, do you allow people to do everything that they want and think is best for themselves and their team? Or do you for some conformity? And the answer to it in any one situation is, well, you have to figure out what works. All the evidence is that, at least if you want to scale fast in the beginning, at least having a playbook that people focus on -- this was key to the success of in the early days, for example; certainly and so on. On average, what the research shows is that starting out with a playbook, a way that we usually do stuff, and a few guardrails are really important, and then adjusting it as you go into new markets and hire new kinds of employees, then you've kind of got to change.It seems like that would point to the importance of having a strong culture and also being very clear about the types of people that you hire.Yes, until it gets you to the point where you just keep replicating everybody over and over again, and the world changes. And you end up having the wrong sorts of people. And just to give you an example, with Google. One of my students, Shona Brown, this is what happens at an institution like Stanford. I've known Shona so long that I loaned her $500 once. She was number four at Google for 10 years. She has like $500 million. So, in the early days, Shona, who was actually kind of an uppity Stanford student, and she was a Rhodes Scholar and everything, which permanently infects her mind, and not always in the best ways -- if she was here, I would say this in front of her -- Shona was one of the big pushers in the early days of Google, because she has a PhD and was a Rhodes Scholar, that, \"We're only going to hire absolutely the best top one-tenth of 1% of people at Google, especially people who have degrees from elite universities.\" And they kind of did this in the early days. So, they had a real clear mindset -- we're going to hire geniuses. And if you know about the early interview process at Google, they do 20 or 30 interviews, and then not give you an offer. They had a very bad reputation. So they do all this heavy screening. That worked great in the early days, at least well enough to build the company. But then they figured out two things, which is that you don't need a Rhodes Scholar, 4.0 genius from one of the three elite universities in the world to do everything in an organization. You really don't. And then, some of you may also know that Google has done a bunch of research where they have shown that there's no relationship between the grades that somebody gets as an undergrad and how good of a programmer they become. The correlation is zero.One of the things you write about in the book, and you've written about more recently, is the thought exercise around time travel. It comes up in the book with the Bridgewater Academy. Just sort of the idea of stopping and trying to figure out, \"This thing that we're doing right now, what does it look like when it's 50X, 100X times larger, or we have 50X or 100X times as many locations?\" And it seems like, to the extent that you can pull that off, that's time well spent. Let me talk a little bit about time travel. There's a bunch of research that shows one of the great things about human beings is, we're capable of looking back to the past and also imagining what it's like from the future. One of the most effective decision-making tools is something called a pre-mortem. A pre-mortem is, you imagine it's a year from now, and in particular, you imagine that things are totally screwed up. And you figure out what happened. Instead of coming up with a list of, \"Here's the things that lead to success. Here's the things that lead to failure.\"Just to give you a specific example. For career stuff, my co-author Huggy has done a randomized experiment with a large software firm. And what he did with new hires was, he had him do a failure pre-mortem. And the failure of pre-mortem was, in six months from now, you're a member of this organization -- very successful, large software firm -- everything has gone wrong. You've been fired. You can't even get another job like. What went wrong? And they did success pre-mortems too. Turns out, failure pre-mortems are more powerful. This wasn't given to management or anything. But what happens when you look down the line a couple of years, a much larger proportion of people who did failure pre-mortems got really large raises, raises over 10% than the people who were in the control conditions.So, the power of a pre-mortem when you're making a decision such as a merger, or rolling out new software stuff, is that you don't have all these excuses. You're just looking back from the future and trying to figure out what went wrong.What has been the reaction to the book from different organizations that you've met with? The book came out five years ago, and I'm curious if it's been an ongoing parade of people saying, \"Yes, everything that happened in this book is happening to us,\" or if you've gotten a reaction that surprised you. There are certain universal elements in the book. We've done talks and worked with everybody -- Google, the Girl Scouts, the Gates Foundation, lots of investment firms, lots of nonprofits. We've worked with every kind of organization, at least that I can think of. And the reaction is generally positive.But one of the things that people will say, and I think this is worth talking about, is that they will talk about the notion that, \"Oh, you present all these cases of organizations where it's so great, but in my company, or my nonprofit, we're actually screwed up. We're not great like that. Maybe I should move somewhere else and do something different.\" And one of the main bits of advice that I give here is that in general, if you go to another organization -- and I'm talking about organizations that are scaling well, not ones that are scaling badly -- on a day-to-day basis, things always seem screwed up to the people who are inside of it. We were just talking about . I would not want to work at Amazon. That's kind of a brutal place to work. , which is a company that works\u00a0quite well, they're actually really, really hard on employees. They fire people without performance improvement plans. That's one thing they're really proud of.The best example I have of this is, I gave a talk at a large law firm. King & Spalding is the name of the law firm. This isn't a secret. The way that large law firms work is, when they have a partner retreat, they have affinity groups, so they'll have a breakfast for, I don't know, the lawyers who went to Harvard, the gay lawyers, the women lawyers. This group had the grass is browner club. The grass is browner club is the people who quit King & Spalding and they came back because it sucked even worse at the place that they went to.The point is -- and this comes from my dear friend, David Kelley, the founder of the Stanford d.school, the main founder and also an innovation firm called Ideo, he talks about the notion that when you're doing something original, life is always messy. There's always setbacks, it's always confusing. And it always feels worse in the moment. When you look back on it, or you look ahead, it might be better. So, that's one lesson that I think has come out. If you think that things are better somewhere else, it might be, but usually, it isn't. To go back to your book, one of the things I was struck by, despite the fact that scaling up in an excellent way is a ground war, it can be a slog, it can take a lot of time, there can be a lot of friction within the organization, and yet there is this through line of optimism from the people in the book. As someone who is a fan of business and rooting for businesses, it was great to see that level of optimism from people, even when they are battling with significant challenges within their own organization. Did that surprise you at all? The optimism didn't shock me that much, but there's a nuance that I think is worth talking about. There's guy named Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize for inventing modern behavioral economics. And Danny will argue -- he's really a pessimistic person, by the way. His co-author, Amos Tversky, he was the optimist. But Danny will argue that overconfidence is the worst thing that any human being can suffer from. That's the worst of all the cognitive biases. But what I would say is that the way that people who are good at scaling and organizational growth and leadership are is, they have strong opinions weakly held, or they're confident, but not really sure. What that means is that if you're around them, and they announce a new product, or, \"We're going to open a new location,\" or something, that they're really, really optimistic, and get everybody all fired up about how they're going to do it; but at the same time, they're constantly looking for signs that things aren't going quite right and have to be tweaked. Or, they get rid of the whole thing all at once.Andy Grove, who some people will say is the greatest Silicon Valley executive of all time, who really made the modern , he was kind of famous for that, which was, he'd be completely optimistic, and until the moment he fired people or got rid of a product, he was just that sort of person. So, this idea about having strong opinions weakly held, or being confident but not really sure, that's the kind of thing that to me makes for great executives and great scaling. There's this restlessness, it's the hallmark of great filmmakers at Pixar, too. Yeah, it's going OK, but I don't want to hear about what's great about it, I want to hear about what's wrong and how I can make it better. And mindset of, yes, it's going to be great in the end, but right now, we have to fix this stuff in front of us to make it even better. To me, that's different than just, \"We're all so brilliant, and I only want to hear good news.\" That's more nuanced than that.We are all here for this event with the mindset of scaling up our company in an excellent way and our teams in an excellent way. So my final question is, what advice do you have for us as individuals? One of the things that happens in a company like this, I've worked with a lot of companies that scale really fast, and were just insane in this regard. What ends up happening is, it ends up being difficult to have one us when you have a whole bunch of people coming and going constantly. One of the things that makes that worse in particular, this certainly happens where I work, is that the people who have been there for a long time and have worked together for a long time, they all tend to conglomerate, and they tend to cross their arms and look at the newcomers and say, \"Who the hell are these people?\"So, I guess my basic advice is, try to talk to somebody who you don't know or don't know very well. Don't just stand and talk to the same people you always talk to. I know it's great to see old friends. But for your good and the good of the organization, I think that people who are the best learners, they talk to people who are different and people they don't know. Otherwise, when you talk to people you know, you just hear the same story, and nobody ever challenges your worldview. And also, for having one Motley Fool, I think that that's part of the interpersonal path.\u00a0Bob Sutton's book is .

If you think like that, you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re just going to do yourself in.Looking forward to what McCall has dubbed the \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cRoaring 2020s,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d it is important to be bold. Which is why Matt is looking at companies with $1 billion or less in market capitalization \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 the market segment where he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s had his biggest wins. Who would have thought that over the last 20 years, the biggest winners in the would include\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:) and\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:)? But Monster Beverage grew from $34 million to $35 billion. And Tractor Supply grew from $31 million to $10.7 billion. Small-cap and micro-cap stocks are clearly the place to be.And as McCall looks for the bull market to continue soaring for at least another decade, he has some words of caution. If you can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t handle the market, get out.

Those wins will cancel out \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 and far surpass \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 the rest of the losers.The stock market isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t the only thing rallying lately.

That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not surprising, as McCall has likened the cryptocurrency to safe-haven investments like gold and oil stocks. Bitcoin isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t the only name in the crypto world that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s having a good start to 2020.

On the plus side though, MNST stock is up about 20% for 2019.\tBecause Monster stock and so many others limped into this year, many boast incredible year-to-date returns. Heck, even the major moving averages fall into this category. While the 2019 returns look fabulous, investors need to remember that the one-year (and five-quarter and 1.5-year returns are not so upbeat).In the case of MNST stock though, shares are starting to crack through some key technical levels. While a broad-based market selloff could weigh on the stock price and/or the breakout may not take hold, Monster Beverage could be gearing up for a strong start to 2020.Let\u2019s look at the charts, then the fundamentals.Monster stock chopped in a range so tight it\u2019s hard to believe. The stock was pinned between $56 and $57 for a month, before finally .\tWhile the rally was discouraging in the sense that it failed to hold a bulk of its gains, it was also encouraging as it broke MNST stock out of that tight trading range. In the ensuing days, MNST even tested back down into prior resistance. Once it held as support \u2014 a key bullish development \u2014 then it began to rally.Despite the bulls\u2019 latest efforts, the $60 to $61 area continues to hold as resistance. That\u2019s been a notable level over the past 12 months, while the 200-day moving average currently sits at $59.50.Uptrend support and the 20-day moving average have been guiding shares higher too. While this isn\u2019t the cleanest ascending triangle pattern out there, a series of lower lows pushing a stock into a static level of resistance is generally a good sign.That setup is negated should support give way. In that instance \u2014 if the 20-day moving average and uptrend support fail \u2014 look for a decline down to the 50-day moving average. That comes into play at $57.30, just above prior resistance last month. If that doesn\u2019t buoy shares and MNST stock falls below $56, $53.50 to $54 could be in the cards.On the upside, I\u2019d love to see MNST stock rally over $60 and take out the recent high of $60.28. Over that mark puts the November high of $61.49 on the table. Those are the first steps in getting Monster stock up to range resistance, which is up at $66.Are the charts a layup-guarantee for a year-end rally or a 2020 breakout? No. But they are setting up in a way that is at least attractive \u2014 rather than in a way that is negative for the overall case to owning MNST stock.In that regard, what do the fundamentals say for MNST stock?On the plus side, Monster stock is fairly consistent. On the downside, many may consider the name expensive from a valuation perspective.Trading at roughly 28.5 times earnings isn\u2019t exactly cheap. However, some may argue that with  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:) trading at 25- and 24.5-times earnings, respectively, that MNST stock isn\u2019t that overvalued given its growth. Detractors could make a reasonable argument that MNST is not the same quality as KO or PEP, though.In any regard, the growth here is solid and consistent. Analysts expect MNST to grow revenue 9.9% this year and another 9% in 2020. On the earnings front, estimates call for 13.3% grow this year to $2.04 per share and for further growth of 10.3% in 2020.Investors do have to like the fact that MNST stock doesn\u2019t carry any long-term debt. Further, its total cash balance of $1.3 billion is more than enough to cover all of its current liabilities, which stand at $714 million. Current assets are more than triple its liability counterpart, while total assets stand at roughly five times Monster\u2019s total liabilities.In other words, this is a very healthy balance sheet and with consistent growth, bulls can make the argument that the stock\u2019s valuation shouldn\u2019t be an impediment to a potential rise in the stock price.So, what now? Let\u2019s see if we can get a definitive move over $60.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of  and is on Twitter .

The stock has returned a thrilling 896% since the end of 2009, despite a few lulls along the way. Over the last two years, for example, Monster's shares traded almost exactly sideways, with a total gain of 1%.So what's next for  in the next decade? Let's have a look.Image source: Author.The company then known as Hansen Natural posted full-year net sales of $1.14 billion in 2009. Energy drinks were still a relatively new and exciting concept, and the company's flagship brand of Monster Energy was stealing market share from arch-rival Red Bull on a regular basis. The company's net profit margins stood at 19% back then, resulting in full-year  earnings of $2.21 per diluted share. Adjusted for two stock splits adding up to a 6-for-1 ratio along the way, that number works out to $0.37 per split-adjusted share.A decade later, Monster has changed its name and replaced a ramshackle distribution system with a global partnership with  . As part of that deal, Monster now manages all of Coke's energy-drink products, while the soft-drink giant took over Hansen's non-energized juice and fruit-flavored sodas. Coca-Cola also holds a 17% ownership stake in Monster Beverage, giving Coke some representation on Monster's board of directors and plenty of incentive to maintain a solid partnership. When Monster wins, Coke gets to share some of its profits.The new and improved Monster Beverage can now look back to trailing net sales of $4.11 billion and a juicier profit margin near 27%. Bottom-line earnings added up to $1.98 per diluted share over the last four quarters. In other words, revenues nearly quadrupled in the 2010s while earnings per share raced 435% higher. Those massive stock returns were indeed based on impressive business results.Monster Beverage has encountered some new challenges in recent quarters. A brand new category of energy drinks entered the market in a big way last year, led by the workout-boosting drink known as Bang Energy from privately held company Vital Pharmaceuticals. Monster was quick to launch its own workout-energy drink, Reign Total Body Fuel. Vital Pharma and Monster have been slinging lawsuits at each other since the spring of 2019, with each company arguing that the other is using unfair business tactics of various forms., Reign held a 3% share of the total energy drink market compared to an 8% share for Bang. Both of these drinks stand far behind Monster Energy's dominant market share of 34%, but the workout drinks are growing quickly at the expense of traditional energy names such as Monster and Red Bull. Over the next few years, workout energy drinks will have carved out whatever long-term market share they can, most likely still far below the market size of ordinary energy drinks. Those lawsuits may set the tone for how that emerging sector evolves, either cementing Monster's market-leading stature even further or introducing a significant new name for the long term if the legal challenges go Vital Pharmaceuticals' way.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola introduced a Coke-branded energy drink in dozens of international markets with plans to . Monster's management analyzed the international Coke Energy launches and  that the new drink doesn't pose much of a threat to Monster Energy or Reign.Coca-Cola's incredible brand strength may make a sustainable product line out of this new idea, but it appears to be carving out its own mass-market niche rather than stealing share from any of the existing energy brands. Time will tell how that analysis stands up to market realities, of course.At the same time, Monster is riding Coca-Cola's unmatched global-distribution platform into lots of brand-new geographical markets. Monster's third-quarter sales increased 40% year over year in Europe and 43% in the Asia Pacific market.Management sees particularly strong long-term growth opportunities in the enormous consumer markets of India and China. Domestic sales accounted for 66% of total revenues in the third quarter, down from 72% in the year-ago quarter but still a clear-cut majority of Monster's overall business. The company hopes to change that through international distribution improvements, addressing a much larger  in a more efficient and profitable way.Monster Beverage has transformed from a fast-growing minnow into a stable domestic giant with an eye on international growth. The overseas expansion effort will continue for the foreseeable future, and the company may come up with new product ideas to keep some sparkle in the U.S. market, as well.The balance sheet is debt-free, while Monster's cash reserves nearly doubled over the last three years. I wouldn't be surprised to see this company introduce a modest dividend policy soon, sharing some of that cash with stockholders. Otherwise, Monster might be looking for opportunities to expand by acquisition. Either way, Monster's bulging cash coffers should be put to good use in the coming years.This is a growing business with plenty of fuel for further gains. The next decade may not match the roughly 900% gains of the last 10 years, but Monster still looks like a fantastic investment, even at a lower-octane pace of growth.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Monster has an impressive array of brands such as Monster Energy, Burn, Predator, Full Throttle, and Relentless, all of which have varying levels of caffeine and taurine to provide different levels of stimulation for the consumer.With the    a new energy drink called Coca-Cola Energy recently, it seems the lucrative energy drinks market is seeing even more new entrants eager to grab a slice of the pie. The question here is whether Monster is able to sustain its market share and hold while continuing to find opportunities to grow its revenue and profits. Can the company still be considered a ?Investors should be justifiably concerned, as energy drinks are viewed as a niche product that may see limited growth prospects as it caters to a small segment of the population. Can Monster find the energy it needs to grow the business further?Image Source: Getty ImagesMonster has had a stellar growth track record. From 2014 to 2018, the company grew sales from $2.47 billion to $3.81 billion (a 54% increase), while net income more than doubled from $483 million to $993 million over the same period. Gross margin has been increasing over the years, from 54.4% in 2014 to a peak of 63.7% in 2016. This has since moderated to around 60% in 2018, but is still significantly higher than the 51.7% achieved in 2012.Source: Monster Beverage Annual Reports 2016-2018, Author's CompilationFor the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019 (9M 2019), Monster has continued to report strong numbers, with revenue up 10% year over year to $3.2 billion, while net income has improved by 13% year over year to $853 million. The rise in gross margins over the years points to strong pricing power by the company for its products, over and above the increase in the cost of goods sold. Net margin has also grown significantly, from just 19.6% in 2014 to 26.8% for 9M 2019.A new report by Allied Market Research projects that the energy drinks market will grow from $53 billion in 2018 to reach $86 billion by 2026, for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2%. The strongest growth is expected in Asia-Pacific, where CAGR is expected to be 7.3% from 2019 to 2026. This forecast is good news for Monster, as there is good potential for it to continue growing alongside the industry's projected growth.In terms of market share, Monster's Q3 2019  provides some details. Monster's market share remained constant at 33.9%, and it was ranked as the number two player in the energy drinks market. Red Bull saw its market share declining by 0.2 percentage points to 37.5%, but remains in pole position. Number three player Rockstar increased its market share by 0.8 percentage points to 15.7%. It's comforting to note that Monster has managed to hold on to its market share as the other two major competitors lost some market share to new entrants.There have been concerns raised over the years about the effects of energy drinks on heart function. Energy drink consumption has been associated with many heart problems, and a recent news article has highlighted that even one energy drink alone may  blood vessel function. Though evidence seems to be mounting for the dangers associated with consuming energy drinks, there has thus far not been any clear evidence of harm caused by specific chemicals within energy drinks. Hence, although this remains a risk for investors, I do not think it will be a significant one for the industry in the near future.Monster has ambitious plans to introduce a whole host of new products into various markets around the world. Some examples are a new salted caramel espresso variant to be introduced in eight EMEA markets in Q4 2019 and 2020, Pipeline Punch in Korea, Ultra White in India, and other new products in Asia-Pacific. It's positive to see Monster's efforts being focused in Asia-Pacific, as this is where the strongest growth is projected.Management is also confident of the growth potential for the brand in China and India, and the company will proceed with plans to launch more affordable energy drinks internationally.The facts presented above should assure investors that Monster does indeed have the potential for further growth, as evidenced by its strengthening gross and net margins, industry growth prospects, and the line-up of new products to be launched. Though energy drinks have been called out for their potential to cause heart attacks, I believe the risk of an outright ban is low and that the company should be able to power its growth in the years ahead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With 15% year-over-year earnings growth and 11% higher sales, the company edged out Wall Street's estimates across the board. The stock jumped as much as 8.6% higher the next day before calming down to a 2.7% gain at the ringing of the closing bell.Those are the headline figures you'll see all over the place. Let's take a closer look at Monster's quarterly report and , where we're likely to find the real meat of this market-moving event. Going that extra mile helps you separate  from lesser wannabes.Are you listening to what Monster's management is saying? Image source: Getty Images.The company moved its energy drinks to 's  global bottling and distribution network in three new markets during the third quarter, namely Honduras, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic. More territories will follow in the fourth quarter and beyond. The lower-priced Predator drink launched in Slovakia and Botswana with more Eastern European and African territories to follow. The Chinese product portfolio was expanded by two flavors, and Sweden got its first shipment of Reign Total Body Fuel.In other words, Monster is putting its back into a global expansion strategy. This makes perfect sense, because the lion's share of Monster's business takes place in a fairly saturated domestic market.The U.S. and Canada accounted for 69% of total third-quarter sales, compared with 75% in the year-ago period. Monster got there by expanding sales by more than 40% year over year in the Asian and Latin American segments, posting 34% revenue growth in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa division, and notching a modest 3% increase in the domestic market.On the eve of this report, Monster's board of directors added $500 million to the company's share buyback policy. Using up the full amount would retire approximately 1.6% of Monster's total share count at current prices. It would also consume roughly 46% of the company's annual free cash flows.That might sound like a lot, and I do agree that we're looking at a significant shareholder-friendly investment here. But it's not a very large commitment in the context of Monster's buyback history.Monster Energy has invested $393 million in net share repurchases in 2019, which was a large step down from $1.3 billion in 2018. The company took it relatively easy with a $308 million buyback budget in 2017, but 2016 saw a $2.2 billion splurge.The company has returned billions of dollars to shareholders in the form of buybacks in recent years, and that policy continues today. So a $500 bump in the budget is nice, widely expected, and nothing unusual.Last year, Monster Beverage's drinks combined for a 38% share of the domestic energy drink market. Privately held Vital Pharma quintupled its sales of a workout-boosting energy drink named Bang in 2018 but was still sent home with just a 1.9% slice of the market.  and quickly released its own take on Vital Pharma's concept of energy drinks for workout sessions. That product, Reign Total Body Fuel, held a 3% market share in the third quarter, having launched as recently as the first quarter of 2019.On the , Monster CEO Rodney Sacks reported that Monster sales fell 5% year over year, losing revenue to Bang and its own Reign drink.\"Monster's share [in the third quarter] decreased 4.1 share points to 33.5% and Reign's share was 3%,\" Sacks said. \"Bang's share increased 4.2 points to 8.2%.\"So a competitor inspired Monster to launch a new type of product, which is doing well but still collects lower revenues than the third-party original. Workout-related energy drinks are reshaping Monster's product mix both from external sources and Reign cannibalizing the larger Monster brand.Monster and Vital Pharma are battling each other in court, where Vital Pharma claims the larger rival's Reign product infringes on its trademark rights. Monster, in turn, argues that the Bang drink is being promoted by false advertising claims. Both lawsuits are ongoing, and Vital Pharma wants to up the stakes by introducing a new drink using Monster's Reign brand.Things are getting heated over here. Bang vs. Reign is a high-stakes battle with serious money on the line, and any settlement or final verdict in the related lawsuits could decide the outcome of that fight in a hurry. There was no game-changing news on that front in the third quarter, but Monster Beverage investors need to keep an eye on this rivalry.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In its most recent financial report, the company managed to see sales growth accelerate compared to its performance in the recent past, outpacing rival 's gains. Among key products has been Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which represents Coca-Cola's answer to demands for healthier beverages.At the same time, Coca-Cola is trying to innovate. Despite having made a strategic investment in energy-drink giant , Coca-Cola is moving ahead with plans for a branded energy drink of its own. The beverage company has also offered up smaller cans, aiming to help calorie-conscious consumers, but also boosting margins for its business.Some of those innovations will take investment, so Coca-Cola isn't expecting to see any significant earnings gains in 2019. That's making some investors worry that any dividend increase from the beverage company in 2020 might be small, at best.With signs of faster growth and a legacy of past dividend increases to protect, Coca-Cola is almost certain to boost its dividend in 2020. The big question is whether the company will go with a $0.01 per-share increase or return to its past practice of healthier payout increases.If earnings don't deliver a positive surprise, then there's a real possibility that Coca-Cola will stick with the smaller boost. Dividend investors should hope for the bigger number, though, in order to maximize Coca-Cola's already impressive dividend yield.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the third quarter of 2019 net sales were $1.13 billion up 11.6% from $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements net sales for the quarter would have been up 12.8%. The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States portion of our products effective November 1 2018.Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements net sales for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 14.6%. Turning now to gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the 2019 third quarter was 59.4% compared with 59.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Such decrease was partially offset by price increases as well as reduced input costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.3% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 4.1% in the 2018 third quarter. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.2% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales was 6.5% compared to 6.2% in the same period in 2018.Payroll costs increased $10.4 million primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $16 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $14.1 million in the same quarter in 2018. Our effective tax rate increased from 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter to 25% in the 2019 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions as well as a decrease in the equity compensation deduction. In addition the comparative effective tax rate for the 2018 third quarter included a nonrecurring tax benefit. Net income was $298.9 million in the 2019 third quarter compared to net income of $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter an increase of 11.6%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 third quarter increased 14% to $0.55 from $0.48 in the third quarter of 2018. Now we turn to The Coca-Cola Company transition update. In the third quarter of 2019 Monster Energy was launched by or transition to Coke bottlers in the Dominican Republic El Salvador and Honduras. We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator our affordable energy brand in the third quarter of 2019 in Botswana and in Slovakia. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2019. In China we completed the rollout of both Monster Ultra White and Monster Mango in the third quarter.We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continue the rollout of Monster across India and began the launch of Ultra White into approximately 20% of our accounts in September. We will continue Ultra's expansion into the fourth quarter as well as commencing the launch of Mango Loco to leverage consumer taste preferences in India. I'll now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals VPX the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing. In August 2019 VPX filed another lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida alleging a host of legal challenges including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX. Monster will seek the dismissal of VPX's most recent lawsuit.In October 2019 the U.S. court -- the U.S. District Court for the Southern District denied VPX's motion for a preliminary injunction against our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In its decision the court ruled that VPX failed to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and fail to established that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims. VPX recently announced an intention to launch its own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. We recently filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and to prevent VPX from infringing Monster's trademark rights in this way. In one of the court filings in May 2019 we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million.Our sales of Reign through October was solid as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers were lower than our initial expectations. As with any new product launches sales may be affected by many factors including retail authorizations the dates on which listings are secured for products at major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. As our litigation with VPX is sub judice we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. Now we're going to turn to the Nielsen reports in North America. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 26 2019 for all outlets combined namely convenience grocery drug mass merchandisers sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 9.1% versus the same period a year ago.

Our company's shares of the coffee plus energy category which includes Java Monster Cafe Monster Expresso Monster Starbucks Doubleshot and Rockstar Roasted for the 4 weeks ended October 26 2019 was 49.3% down 7 points. Java Monster share on its own for the 4 weeks ended October 26 2019 was 44.7% down 2.6 points while Starbucks energy share was 47.9% up 4.3 points. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 14 2019 the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 5% versus a year ago.The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 37.6% down 0.7 points.

According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico. The energy drink category grew 14% for the month of September 2019 Monster sales increased 10.5%. Our market share in value decreased by 0.9 points to 29.3% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Burn were down 48%.

Bolt sales increased 53.5% and its market share increased 4.5 share points to 17.5% while Boost sales decreased 3.5% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 6.9%. Amper an affordable energy brand launched in March increased its market share to 8.7% in the month of September 2019.The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. And now we turn to EMEA. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country.According to Nielsen the 13 weeks ended October 5 2019 Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.3% to 12.9% in Belgium from 23.3% to 27.6% in France from 20.9% to 21.5% in Great Britain from 7.1% to 7.2% in The Netherlands from 18% to 23.7% in Norway and from 30.3% to 33.4% in Spain. In the same period Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 13.7% to 13.1% in Sweden. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended in September 2019 Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15.6% to 15.8% in Germany and from 10.7% to 15% in Poland. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended in August 2019 Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.8% to 13.9% in the Czech Republic from 34.1% to 36.6% in Greece from 15.8% to 19.3% in Ireland from 16.7% to 20.4% in Italy and from 14.8% to 17.4% in South Africa. Turning to Nielsen in South America.According to Nielsen for the month of September 2019 in Chile Monster's retail market share in value increased from 34.5% to 38% compared to the same month the previous year. According to Nielsen in Brazil Monster's retail market share for the month of September 2019 increased 17.7% to 26.2% as compared to the same month the previous year. According to Nielsen in Argentina for the month of September 2019 Monster's retail market share in value increased from 13.9% to 27.9% compared to the same month the previous year. Turning to Asia Pacific according to IRI in Australia Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended September 29 2019 increased from 9.1% to 9.6% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 13.7% to 12.9% during the same period.

According to Nielsen in South Korea Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined for the quarter ended September 2019 grew from 38.3% to 40.5% as compared to the same period in the previous year. Monster is now the leading energy brand by market share in value in all measured outlets in South Korea. According to INTAGE in Japan Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the 13-week period ended September 30 2019 grew from 48.9% to 51.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week period may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. So now we're going to turn to sales in the segments.Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2019 which include Reign increased 13.5% from $935.1 million to $1.06 billion from the comparable period in 2018. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $10.8 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the quarter would have been up 14.7%. The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products effective November 1 2018. Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 16.6%. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment which includes Predator our affordable energy brand was $66.3 million for the third quarter as compared to $74.4 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movement. Net sales for the Other segment which includes third-party sales made by AFF were $5.9 million in the third quarter as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $379.8 million that's 33.5% of total net sales in the 2019 third quarter compared to $283 million or 28.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018.Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $12.2 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. Now we turn to sales in EMEA. In EMEA supply chain and production issues have largely been resolved. In EMEA net sales in the third quarter increased 34.1% in dollars and increased 40.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.3% compared to 41.3% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix as well as increases in manufacturing costs. We're also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium the Czech Republic France Germany Great Britain Greece Ireland Italy The Netherlands Norway Poland South Africa and Spain. Now turning to Asia Pacific. In Asia Pacific net sales in the third quarter increased 43.6% in dollars and 43.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 40.5% versus 44.1% over the same period in 2018 as a result of country and product mix. In Japan net sales in the quarter increased 60% in dollars and 55.5% in local currency. In South Korea net sales increased 15.9% in dollars and 23.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2018. In Oceania which includes Australia New Zealand Tahiti French Polynesia New Caledonia Papua New Guinea and Guam net sales decreased 12.8% in dollars and 7.2% in local currencies although I'd like to point out that Monster increased 4.5% in dollars and 10.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2018.Now turning to sales in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Latin America including Mexico and the Caribbean net sales in the third quarter increased 41.5% in dollars and 51% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44% for both periods. In Brazil net sales in the quarter increased by 80.2% in dollars and increased 82.3% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 70.9% in dollars and increased 84.2% in local currency in the quarter. So now turning to new products in North America. In the United States we launched Monster Mule Ginger Brew nationally Reign Orange Dreamsicle Monster MAXX Mango Magic and Monster MAXX Rad Red extra strength with zero sugar at the end of September. In October we launched Java Monster Farmer's Oats which contains oat milk and is nondairy and vegan as well as 2 new flavors in the Reign brand family Strawberry Sublime and Mango Magic. In 2020 in the United States we will be discontinuing a Cafe Monster line of products and repositioning our Espresso Monster line.In Canada in the third quarter of 2019 we launched Monster Pacific Punch nationally in July as well as Monster Mill Nationally in September. During the third quarter of 2019 in Mexico we launched Pipeline Punch. During the third quarter of 2019 in Brazil we launched Absolutely Zero Ultra Violet as well as Mango Loco. Now turning to new products in EMEA. Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Bosnia Bulgaria Cyprus Croatia Greece Poland and Slovenia in the third quarter of 2019 and is now available in 15 markets across EMEA. Espresso Monster was made available in 6 markets in EMEA France Great Britain Germany Norway Spain and Sweden in both milk and vanilla variants during the 2019 third quarter. We also recently launched both variants in Belgium and Ireland in October 2019 and we'll launch both in Poland this month. We are pleased with the performance of Espresso Monster in EMEA. We are planning to roll out 2 flavors of Espresso Monster into a further 12 markets in the fourth quarter of 2019 and throughout 2020.Additionally we are looking to launch our new salted caramel espresso variant in 8 EMEA markets over the course of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2020. Reign was launched in Sweden in the third quarter of 2019 and we're planning to launch Reign in a further 2 markets by the end of 2019. We're planning to launch Monster in Israel in the fourth quarter of 2019. We're planning to launch Predator our affordable energy brand in Ethiopia Kenya Poland Uganda and Zambia in the 2019 fourth quarter. Turning to new products in Asia Pacific. We launched Monster Green in 500-milliliter resealable aluminum bottles in Japan during the 2019 third quarter. In Korea we launched Pipeline Punch with initial positive results. We launched Ultra White in India and completed its rollout in Vietnam during the 2019 third quarter. Ultra Paradise launched in Australia in July and in New Zealand in September and Mango Loco was successfully relaunched in July after resolution of local production capabilities. We are planning to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific over the upcoming months including a full relaunch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in the spring of 2020.Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $717.6 million at September 30 2019 compared to $637.5 million at December 31 2018. Short-term investments were $587.4 million at September 30 2019 compared to $320.7 million at December 31 2018. Net accounts receivable increased to $648 million at September 30 2019 from $484.6 million at December 31 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 44.6 days at September 30 2019 compared to 41.4 days at December 31 2018. Inventories increased to $317.7 million at September 30 2019 from $277.7 million at December 31 2018. Average days of inventory was 62.1 days at September 30 2019 compared to 67.2 days at December 31 2018. Now we're going to talk a little about our October 2019 gross sales. We estimate October 2019 gross sales to be approximately 7.3% higher than in October 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis October 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 8.6% higher than comparable October 2018 gross sales. The comparative gross sales in October 2018 included advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products effective November 1 2018.Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements we estimate gross sales for the month of October 2019 would have been approximately 14.6% higher than in October 2018. In this regard we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days days of the week in which holidays fall timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and you need to actually determine their production schedules which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. Share repurchase programs during the 2019 third quarter the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $58.6 per share for a total of $254.3 million excluding broker commissions. As of November 6 2019 approximately $36.6 million remains available for -- $36.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On November 6 2019 the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. In conclusion I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods.Number two the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Number three we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year as well as our innovation pipeline in 2020. Fourthly we are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks not only within the U.S. but looking further abroad. Number five we're pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets. Net sales in the third quarter in EMEA increased 40.1% in local currency. In Asia Pacific increased 43.4% in local currency and in Latin America and the Caribbean increased 51% in local currency. We reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. And lastly we're proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy drink brands internationally. We're also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter.[Operator Instructions] And the first question is going to come from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. -- And Rodney I wish you a fast recovery. And so if you can help us with the positioning of the core Monster which I understand correct -- if I understand correctly it was down 2.4% on outlets and declined 5% in convenience do you believe that is related to the promotional environment of your main competitor? Or just a function of Reign gaining more shelf space? And how are you planning to react to that? With -- will you feel the need for more promotions for it to become more promotion as well? Or you are just happy with the total performance? -- I'll take that because of -- Hilton I think that if you look at the category what we've noticed is you've had an impact on all of the -- pretty much on all of the SKUs that are -- have been existing in the market over the past couple of months. You're seeing the increases coming from us and our main competitor coming from new products. So -- but if you look at the total category the total category remains healthy it's up 9% which is really good growth. So the category is growing there's been a shift within the category. We -- you've got to look at brands and whatever we have in the category. So you look at the fact that we're down or some of the individual SKUs are down but overall the category is growing our overall corporate sales are growing. We will address obviously individual SKUs. And I think this is an experience that's being experienced by general consumer products for established brands.There's a movement generally on consumers to want to try new products new flavors new innovation. And we do have a new innovation which we -- some of it we've announced we've recently launched. We have plans to launch quite a lot of new innovation. I think that in some cases some of our new innovation that we launched earlier this year perhaps didn't get enough shelf space or they've been some shelf space taken from our existing products which I think has affected sales. So looking at -- one of the sort of main things I think we will look at going forward is improving the quality of our distribution getting out to our innovation more efficiently and more effectively on the shelves. And as we go forward we believe there will be additional space allocated to the performance energy category which will relieve pressure on the space we're looking for for our existing energy brands and the innovation under the Monster line. -- So just to add to what Rodney is saying if you ask if we are happy with the way things are and obviously we're not. We want to see the Monster brand growing. What we have evidence of is that the price increase is stuck. And when you'll get our queue tomorrow and you can even see it I think in the release that the promotional allowances are very much in line with where they should be and we're not overpromoting. Having said that I just want to reiterate that the category if you look back 52 weeks the energy category has shown incremental growth per Nielsen of $1.3 billion. So this is a growing category. And it's a category that now has a new segment which is performance energy and performance energy is growing within that category. And as I look at some of our other competitors and this is no defense. But as we look for example even at Red Bull which is growing and we mentioned on the call that it's growing. The Red Bull core brands are also not showing growth. The diet -- their diet SKUs are and their additions are. But in general the Red Bull core brands are also not showing growth and are in decline. Having said that we have got plans with our distribution which has been a challenge to dramatically improve distribution and distribution on shelf and in the coolers. -- Perhaps there's just one other aspect I'd like to add to that this is sort of broad view. These comments we've made really focus on the U.S. And the U.S. has been our major market. But as we develop as a company the opportunity for us for our energy brands Monster in particular plus our other brands is international. And if you look at the information we just gave on this call about how we've accelerated international growth in existing international markets and new markets that's where we look to in the future for the company our sales as -- we -- U.S. was about 72% of our sales last year this quarter and it's now down to $67 million. So if you take that with -- as a growth position it's going to continue to grow. So we see a lot of runway to grow internationally and to grow the brand and these markets are continuing to grow and are very healthy. So we need to address challenges we have in the U.S. at the moment. But overall we still believe in the health and we still believe in the growth of the brand both internationally and even within the U.S. as well and our other industry brands. -- And then one thing we really should -- turning back a few years for a moment sorry. The one thing we really should not forget about is the unmeasured channels which we've been absolutely emphatic about foodservice is unmeasured Amazon is unmeasured Costco is unmeasured and a slew of other Home Depot Lowe's all of those channels are unmeasured. And the amount of sales that are going through those channels is really -- is a significant number.And our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. -- Maybe a little bit more on the U.S. can you talk about growth in the quarter coming in a touch below 3% versus the Nielsen data over the course of the quarter pointing closer to 6%? I think we all know you had tough comparisons in the year-ago quarter but at the same time there was an extra selling day this quarter. So just how do you think about that 3% number in light of those factors building on Andrea's question. And then if I could a related question building on what you just said but in the context of Coke Energy I think that we all appreciate what you and Coke have each said about the intended interplay between Monster and really Monster and Reign and Coke Energy and that they're targeted different consumers and designed to minimize cannibalization risk. But given that they'll be going through common distributors just how confident are you that those new Coke SKUs won't take away from some of your smaller SKUs whether Monster Reign NOS Full Throttle or otherwise rather than having them successfully find incremental space in the cooler or take away from competition distributed by others? -- So let me start with your first question. When you look at Nielsen and you look at our own financial numbers you cannot draw an exact interpolation from one to the other. Nielsen sells out ourselves sells to the distributors the bottlers. We have a slew of unmeasured channels that I mentioned. And while it's a good indication of what -- of the movement of sales it's not an absolute science. And one has to be very wary and we've said this on many calls in the past. One's got to be very careful of trying to balance ourselves to our bottlers and our distributors with sales out to the consumer. Nielsen read a sample. They don't read all the channels they don't read as I said the foodservice they don't read Amazon they don't read Costco they don't need the Home Depots and the Lowe's and all the other channels where our products are distributed. So it's difficult to draw a comparison from one to the other. All we can do is give you the facts and you guys make your own assessments from there. -- As regards to Coke Energy. I think that most of the analysts are very up-to-date and astute on analyzing Nielsen. Well they should be looking at analyzing Nielsen around the world and that would give everybody their own view on what's been happening with the rollout of Coke Energy around the world. We've seen the brand rollout and we've also seen the rate of sale not keeping pace with initial sales. The percentage market share has been small and hasn't really had an impact on us. The main impact that I think we've repeatedly said is that we did have concerns or is the sort of noise and the -- in the market and focus from diversion of focus. But ultimately in Europe things are settling down. Our growth rates of our brands are on track and have continued. And I think that by and large the Coke system has pretty much focused on not trying to cannibalize our existing product and take phasings from us and it's worked reasonably well. There've been a few countries where there have been some challenges and we've addressed them. So again we don't know. We can't tell what Coke Energy will be in the United States. It's formulated a little differently. It's a little different in sizes. There's 2 variants. But ultimately we think that we just need to manage the lack of focus or conflict of focusing from -- to bottlers. Ultimately we don't think it will have a major impact on our brand and we will manage it and going forward and how you feel... -- Yes. I mean what I would do if I were an analyst I would get the information from the markets in which they've launched. And there are a number of them. And frankly they have not -- the numbers that I've seen and I can't talk for numbers that other people may have seen. The numbers that I've seen has shown that they have not performed particularly well and that our brands have continued to grow and our brands have continued to develop in those markets. But get the home work. -- We don't know what the U.S. will be. It's its own market. And so we're all -- we'll see how things go and we'll manage it.And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. -- Tom good to hear from you on the call today. So I guess I wanted to ask about gross margin. International continues to be a bit of a sore spot there. U.S. again continue to be pretty good. So you touched on some of the supply chain issues in EMEA having been resolved and kind of talking directionally to stabilization or at least that's maybe my interpretation of it. Latam was obviously flat in gross margin. So is the worst behind you at this point? Do you have any more visibility on that? I'm not asking for guidance. I'd love a personal point of view of kind of how we should all think about that since I think it's one of those areas that is a bit more of a black box than others. So any help there would be appreciated. -- It's not really a black box. I mean we sell concentrates at high margins and through the strategic brands and we sell finished products at different margins that really are based for a number of factors on the relationships we have developed with the bottlers and distributors in various countries and the cost of production. So it's always -- every quarter the issue is how much did we sell internationally which has lower margins and I'll get on to that. And I think I discussed it on a previous call. And how much strategic brands did we sell as a corporation versus finished goods at Monster Energy. So when we established our model in the United States the distributors were allocated a margin which was satisfactory to them and we had the lion's share of the margin. As we've grown internationally in more virgin territories the bottlers in the Coke system where we've transitioned or launched with they've demanded a higher share of the value chain.And this is something that we've had to deal with understanding that if we want to launch in various countries internationally that's going to cost us more in margin than in the U.S. where we had a very established business. And the Coca-Cola bottlers segued into this established business with the same margins. We also have different cost impacts around the world which we try to manage as best as we can. And then one of the other issues that we are facing is that our juice products are doing very well. Our coffee products are doing very well and they themselves have lower margins than the traditional Monster beverages which have -- and of course the diets have the best margin of all. So you have this issue of competing margins. However there are things we can do with the juice products we can establish greater efficiencies. We had a big improvement this year in this quarter in the U.S.In fact in freight getting product and raw materials to our co-packers. That was a big benefit. The other benefit that we had in the U.S. was in aluminum. So there's a difficult range of factors that go into what the overall consolidated margin is. It's not just a simple one calculation. But we are working on it. And as we've done in the U.S. and as we've done with freight in we continue to look at our model internationally and see where we can improve on our gross margin percentages. And as I've always said Mark we sell products and we make gross profit dollars we don't make gross profit percentages. -- I think that the only thing I would like to add to that is -- very briefly is that in the international markets there are a lot of markets and we've had to -- and we've traditionally shipped into many markets many countries from other countries. We have -- and as we continue to expand and have sufficient volumes in countries we are switching to local production in those countries. We've opened up quite a number of additional production facilities in Europe this year and have got a number -- a large number going forward. And as we go forward we think that will certainly help our margins internationally as well. But at this point we just don't think there's any numbers we can point you to. -- Yes. And also the community knows that we purchased REFILE the concentrate facility from the Coca-Cola company with the intention of producing ingredients in EMEA which will reduce -- improve efficiencies improve costs and reduce the huge distances that we're shipping these ingredients right now. -- We'll also address some of the challenges we had last year and a little bit this year even in out of stocks and where we have increased demand for particular products where we had very long lead times in order to ship ingredients to pack us to try and increase volumes. This will obviously improve those efficiencies and will help us going forward. So that's been a -- we think and we're very excited about the fact that that will help us in the whole of the EMEA and Middle East and Africa.This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Mr. Hilton Schlosberg for further remarks. -- So thank you. You got my name right. We tested them before that so well done on that thank you. On behalf of Monster I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in what we're doing in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate develop and differentiate our brands and expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We're also excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our strategic brands as well as Hydro Predator and Reign and the new innovation plan for 2020. Thank you very much for your attendance.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Coca-Cola acquired a 17% stake in\u00a0Monster in 2015, and that stake has constantly stoked rumors of a full takeover of the energy drink maker.Under the non-compete terms of that investment, all energy drinks between the two companies would be released by Monster, while all non-energy drinks would be released by Coca-Cola. However, Coca-Cola recently tested the limits of that deal by launching its own energy drink, Coca-Cola Energy.Image source: Coca-Cola.Monster claimed that Coca-Cola violated their deal, and entered arbitration with the company last\u00a0October, but the American Arbitration Association ruled\u00a0that Coca-Cola hadn't breached its contract --\u00a0the drink was technically an extension of the Coca-Cola brand instead of a new energy drink.That ruling raised serious concerns about Monster's future, but the company dismissed those threats in its latest . Let's see why Monster isn't losing much sleep over Coca-Cola Energy.During the call, Monster CEO Rodney Sacks stated that Coca-Cola was \"not trying to cannibalize our existing products and take pricing from us\" with Coca-Cola Energy and that each company staying in its own lane \"worked reasonably well.\"Sacks noted that the company faced \"some challenges\" in \"a few countries,\" but that those issues have mostly been addressed. Sacks also claimed that Coca-Cola Energy's rollout was \"not keeping pace with initial sales, the percentage market share has been small, and hasn't really had an impact on us.\" Sacks pointed out that Monster's sales in Europe remained \"on track\" even as Coca-Cola aggressively rolled out its energy drink.Sacks admitted that Monster still \"can't tell what Coca-Cola Energy will be in the United States\" (in terms of formula, sizes, and marketing) when it launches next year, but that it will remain focused on avoiding conflicts and cannibalization.Monster's confidence in its brand is reassuring , but Sacks glosses over a few nagging issues.First, Coca-Cola's latest \u00a0suggests that the company's formula for Coca-Cola Energy will change in the near future. CEO James Quincey stated that the company was developing a \"2.0\" version for the U.S. that tastes more similar to Coca-Cola Classic, and that it might modify the drink to suit consumer tastes in its initial launch markets -- which could pull consumers from Monster.Image source: Getty Images.Monster and Coca-Cola also share common distributors, so keeping its energy drinks separate from Coca-Cola Energy will become increasingly difficult as Coca-Cola scales up the brand. Coca-Cola Energy also costs less than Monster, so it could be considered a cheaper alternative for a quick pick-me-up.However, Coca-Cola also insisted that it wasn't interested in competing against Monster -- at least in the U.S. Quincey noted that the U.S. energy drink market was \"much more developed than many of the other markets,\" so it was \"trying to bring new consumers into the category rather than competing for the current ones.\"Monster's revenue growth has remained robust over the past year, even after Coca-Cola launched its energy drink in over two dozen international markets.YOY = Year-over-year. Source: Monster quarterly reports.During the third quarter, its core energy drinks revenue -- which accounted for 94% of its sales -- rose nearly 14% on its robust growth in overseas markets.Monster's revenue grew less than 3% annually in the U.S. but surged 34% in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), 44% in Asia, and 42% in Latin America and the Caribbean. All that growth offset its 13% drop in the Oceania region. Analysts expect Monster's growth to continue with\u00a09% sales growth and 11% earnings growth next year.The energy drink market could still grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.1% between 2019 and 2024 to\u00a0become an $83.4 billion market, according to Mordor Intelligence, so it could still have plenty of room to grow as the sugary soda market fizzles out.Monster has weathered tough competition from rivals like Red Bull and Rockstar in the past, so it probably isn't losing much sleep over Coca-Cola Energy. In short, Monster's investors should be mindful of Coca-Cola's moves into the energy drink market -- but they shouldn't overreact and consider it a game-changing threat.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

You need innovation, you need marketing, you need relevance, you need packaging, you need execution, and you need to be able to engage.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MNST options chain for the new January 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $48.40 (before broker commissions).

Earlier this week, the company had its credit downgraded to junk status, but Ford stock posted a resilient rally.On Friday, the stock briefly reclaimed the 50-day moving average, the same one which rejected F earlier in the week. A move above it puts $9.65 on watch and above that, a potential gap fill up to $10.20.On the downside, see that Ford maintains above $9.40-ish. Just below is the 38.2% and rising 20-day moving average to help buoy shares on a possible pullback. Below this week\u2019s low opens up the possibility of $8.75.\u00a0Shares of  (NYSE:) have had a quiet week, but that comes after last week\u2019s strong gap up action. Consolidating between $38.50 and $39.50, GM stock is bound to move out of this range at some point.Should it resolve higher, the first target is $40.50. Above that and a run to the July highs is possible, up near $41.48. If it trades lower and falls out of this consolidation pattern, look for support from the 50-day and 20-day moving averages.If they fail as support, it puts the 200-day moving average on watch, with range support at $35.50 below that. (NASDAQ:) has a really interesting setup for traders. Uptrend support (blue line) continues to squeeze shares against static resistance at $59. That\u2019s known as an ascending triangle, a bullish technical pattern.At $59.27, the stock also has the 38.2% retracement it\u2019s trying to reclaim. Should it finally breakout, look for a possible run to the 50-day moving average. Above that and $63 is possible.If the 200-day and $59 resistance reject MNST stock, look for a pullback into uptrend support.After the , many were hoping for a more impressive rebound. This bounce has been tepid, and that\u2019s putting it kindly. Just look at the action in  (NYSE:) for instance.Short of a flood of buy orders, Twilio and others look set to roll over once again. Should TWLO get hit, I would love to see a correction down to the $96 to $98 area, and see whether that draws in buyers.High-growth selloffs are tough. If there are a few companies you really like and are willing to hold for the long term \u2014 and embrace the risk \u2014 nibbling on these declines can be rewarding.

Assuming its equity method investments were one entity and also sold at 7.1 times sales, they would have a market cap of $536 billion, or more than double Coca-Cola\u2019s entire valuation.\u00a0Not mentioned in the six equity method investments from above is Coca-Cola Consolidated (NASDAQ:), the  Coca-Cola bottler in the U.S. Coca-Cola owns  of its stock.\u00a0Here\u2019s the market cap valuation of all seven equity method investments (Source:  and ):\nCompany\nMarket Cap\nCoca-Cola\u2019s Interest\nCoca-Cola European Partners\n$26.0B\n$5.0B\nMonster Beverage\n$31.6B\n$6.1B\nAC Bebidas\u00a0\nN/A\nN/A\nCoca-Cola Femsa\n$12.3B\n$3.4B\nCoca-Cola HBC\n$11.0B\n$2.5B\nCoca-Cola Bottlers Japan\n$3.9B\n$702.0M\nCoca-Cola Consolidated\n$3.2B\n$1.1B\nThe only holding that I wasn\u2019t able to come up with an approximate valuation is AC Bebidas.

So, let\u2019s assume its valuation is 89% of its $9.2 billion market cap, which means Coke\u2019s 20% interest is worth approximately $1.6 billion.\u00a0In total, the seven equity method investments are worth approximately $20.4 billion, $1 billion higher than the carrying value of $19.4 billion, which doesn\u2019t include minority investments in BodyArmor and its other growth ventures.\u00a0KO Stock Performance vs. Equity InvestmentsAs I said in the beginning, Coca-Cola stock has generated a total return of 27% over the past year, 193 basis points better than the U.S. total market.\u00a0How have the other stocks performed?(Source: Morningstar 1-Year returns)\nCompany\n1-Year Total Return\nCoca-Cola European Partners\n34.5%\nMonster Beverage\n-3.7%\nAC Bebidas\u00a0\n-17.4%*\nCoca-Cola Femsa\n0.6%\nCoca-Cola HBC\n5.5%\nCoca-Cola Bottlers Japan\n-26.9%\nCoca-Cola Consolidated\n99.1%\nYou\u2019ll notice an asterisk beside AC Bebidas\u2019s total return. That\u2019s because I used its parent, Arca Continental\u2019s one-year return, and that\u2019s based on its performance on the Pink Sheets.

It has since been updated and republished.]First, let\u2019s get something straight. The definition of penny stocks is entirely subjective. What I think constitutes a risky penny stock, you might feel is a robust, thriving enterprise. Therefore, before I answer the question of whether you can make money in penny stocks, I\u2019m going to explain what I believe is the best definition of a penny stock. From there, I\u2019ll tackle the five rules investors should follow to be successful in trading penny stocks.The Definition: Merriam-Webster  penny stock as \u201ca usually unlisted highly speculative stock usually selling for a dollar or less.\u201d Hence, the penny-stock moniker. Others are more liberal in their interpretation of what constitutes a penny stock.The Successful Investor, an investment newsletter publisher I do some work for here in Canada,  the ceiling price can go as high as $5.Here\u2019s what the SEC has to say about penny stocks:\u201cThe term \u2018penny stock\u2019 generally refers to a security issued by a very small company that trades at less than $5 per share,\u201d  the SEC website. \u201cPenny stocks generally are quoted over-the-counter, such as on the\u00a0; penny stocks may, however, also trade on securities exchanges, including foreign securities exchanges.\u201dSo, I\u2019ve got reputable sources from both the U.S. and Canada who accurately define what penny stocks are, including the price at which they trade.At $5 or less, I do believe you can make money in stocks, but it helps if you follow these five simple rules.For every success story like Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:), which traded below $5 as recently as 2006, there are hundreds of penny stock failures littered along the investment highway.Treat penny stocks just as you would any other publicly traded investment, and your chances for success increase exponentially. Source: Shutterstock\n\tLike any equity investment, it\u2019s important that you establish the financial strength of the company. When I look for stocks to invest in whether the share price is $5 or $500, I focus on companies with strong balance sheets. Although no debt is desirable when interest rates are rising, it\u2019s not very practical. This is especially true when it comes to penny stocks, many of which are still in the early stages of development. Here are two rules:1. Only invest in companies whose long-term debt (LTD) is 50% of shareholder equity or less. If a company has $1 million in debt, its shareholder equity should be at least $2 million. 2. Try to keep your penny-stock bets to those companies whose LTD is less than its market cap;\u00a0 the lower, the better.Source: \u00a9iStock.com/graphicnoi\n\tAs with any equity investment, it\u2019s important that you limit your investments to profitable businesses. There are two schools of thought on this. On the one hand, investing in publicly-traded companies, whether they\u2019re penny stocks or not, provides you with greater liquidity than private investments. Therefore, the ability to exit quicker justifies the higher risk many in this arena are willing to accept to generate outsize future gains.\u00a0On the other hand, private investments have longer holding periods built into them \u2014 often 3-5 years or more \u2014 which means investors aren\u2019t nearly as concerned about profitability as they are with growth.It really comes down to your ability to handle uncertainty.\u00a0For me, I\u2019m always looking for companies making money in the here and now. Anything less is called speculation, and while there\u2019s nothing wrong with this approach, it\u2019s not something novice investors ought to consider.Source: Shutterstock\n\tLike any equity investment, it\u2019s important that you understand the businesses you invest in. There\u2019s a saying that if you can\u2019t explain what a company\u2019s business does in a sentence or two, you probably shouldn\u2019t be investing.Imagine you\u2019re explaining the investment to your  who attends elementary school. It\u2019s easy to describe what Coca-Cola\u00a0(NYSE:) does: it makes soda pop. It\u2019s not nearly as simple to  what business Bio-Techne\u00a0(NASDAQ:) is in.At least it\u2019s not for me. Stick to what you know and understand. That\u2019s especially true with penny stocks with smaller market caps.Source: \n\tLike any equity investment, it\u2019s important that you diversify your penny stocks. How many penny stocks should you own? That\u2019s the million-dollar question, no matter how big or small the investment. Some professional investors believe you\u2019ve got to have a  of your best ideas \u2014 say 10 to 20 \u2014 while others think you should spread your bets far wider over 100 stocks or more. It\u2019s a subjective answer for sure.What I do know is that you want to be in at least three or four sectors of the economy that generally are healthy and growing.Since the risk/reward ratio of penny stocks can be significantly higher than that of large-cap stocks such as Coca-Cola, it\u2019s far more important to diversify your investments.Source: Shutterstock\n\tLike any equity investment, it\u2019s important that you understand there are no guarantees and\u00a0that you\u2019re risking the money you can afford to lose.If your child\u2019s going off to university in a couple of years and the funds you\u2019ve allocated for investing will pay his or her tuition, you might want to keep your funds parked in something more stable.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["  is the largest  bottler in the United States, but as an investment, it tends to get overshadowed by Coca-Cola -- its biggest customer.

Indeed, the bottler's stock gained more than 10% in the Wednesday trading session following release of second-quarter 2019 earnings Tuesday evening.

We are making excellent progress in leveraging the scale of our business, improving our margins and driving consistent marketplace execution across our expanded territories.Chief Operating Officer David Katz also emphasized the importance of execution in helping Coca-Cola, Monster, BodyArmor, and other major customers like  launch innovative products in an increasingly competitive beverage marketplace:Our strong revenue performance reflects our commitment to margin improvement, the strength of our brands and the passion of our teammates. Importantly, our Sparkling portfolio is performing very well in the marketplace, enabling us to grow our value share in this category. We continue to work closely with our brand partners to drive excitement and higher levels of growth for our Still products as we respond to increasing consumer demand for drinks with unique flavors and functional benefits.Coca-Cola Consolidated doesn't issue forward quantitative guidance. However, shareholders can expect that the company will continue to realize the benefit of cost-cutting and investments in efficiency in the remaining two quarters of 2019. While it may be difficult to envision shares rallying much beyond their stellar appreciation in the first half of 2019, the company's stock still holds significant long-term potential. Higher margins coupled with a loyal base of top-tier beverage companies have unexpectedly turned Coca-Cola Consolidated into an exciting consumer goods investment idea in 2019.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Sure, Monster missed estimates on both sales and earnings -- but those results are still up year over year. Compared to Q2 2018, Monster's sales number came in 9% higher, and its profits grew an even more impressive 12% per diluted share.How did Monster do that? The answer may surprise you. While earnings growth ahead of sales growth often indicates an improvement in profit , in Monster's case, the opposite was true. Gross profit margin actually declined by 120 basis points year over year, to 59.9%, and operating profit margin was down 90 basis points, to 34.3%. Consequently, total net profit didn't actually grow as fast as sales.Monster made up the difference and caused \u00a0by buying back shares, reducing its share count and thus concentrating the profits it did make among fewer shares outstanding. Over the past year, Monster has shrunk its share count by approximately 3.3%.Curiously, all of those buybacks took place in previous quarters -- Monster says it made no share repurchases in Q2.But with a share-buyback authorization of more than $520 million and a share price that's now 7% cheaper than it was just 24 hours ago, I wouldn't be surprised if in Q3 we see quite a bit more buyback activity at Monster -- and maybe, some better profits per diluted share in Q3 as a result.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

To most investors, however, esports remains a mystery. Terms like , , and \u00a0are typically not part of an investor's vocabulary.When you delve deeper into this  though, you will see that esports has a lot in common with traditional sports: highly skilled players, competitive teams, and a huge amount of money generated from sponsorships and endorsements -- in 2017, total prize pools came to $1.1 billion.While you may have never seen a game of esports, the growth is certainly there. In 2018, esports viewership grew 13.8% to 380 million people worldwide. Esports analyst Newzoo expects this number to reach 557 million in 2021.Image source: Unsplash.The growth in revenue is there to match, too. In 2018, revenue for the industry grew 38.2% to $906 million. In 2019, it is expected that revenue will exceed the $1 billion mark. If this trend keeps up, analysts forecast revenue of up to $3.2 billion in 2022.That revenue figure is broken down as follows: 40% comes from sponsorships, 19% from advertising, 18% from media rights, 13% from game publisher fees, and 11% from merchandising and tickets, with media rights being the fastest-growing of these revenue streams.There are many companies that are benefiting from the growth of esports.Some of the most obvious beneficiaries are video game publishers such as   and . These companies publish esports-friendly games such as \u00a0and , respectively, which promote recurring user spending on high-margin in-game products, thus increasing the longevity of these games. , on the other hand, simply takes a cut from the event. The ticket seller also reported that after going to an esports event, attendees are 47% more likely to purchase new content for the game. So not only can you buy a jersey of your favorite esports team, but you can also buy a matching digital skin for your in-game character. This has been reflected in revenue figures, with Activision Blizzard's online revenue at five times its retail revenue.The increasing awareness of esports is also beneficial to gaming as a whole. Companies responsible for consumer-level gaming hardware such as   and   have partnered with popular esports teams such as Fnatic and G2 to promote their products. These partnerships are significant as 67% of esports fans play video games for 3 or more hours a day and are likely to be customers of NVIDIA or AMD.The rise of esports brings with it a unique marketing opportunity. Eventbrite reported that 82% of attendees were male and 75% were under the age of 34, giving companies the ability to market to a very specific millennial audience.In 2018, $534.54 million in revenue came from direct sponsorships and advertisements, with some of the biggest sponsors being   and . Although most sponsorships come from endemic brands -- brands whose products are used specifically in the playing of esports -- many non-endemic brands are also noticing the potential.In the U.S., companies such as 's\u00a0 Geico and 's\u00a0  have sponsored esports events in an attempt to capture the younger esports audience, while Tencent's King Pro League in China and Korea have also been sponsored by numerous big-name non-endemic brands such as   and \u00a0.What really gives esports its potential is its worldwide appeal. People from all around the world can watch esports online through 's Twitch streaming platform. In June 2019 fans watched 23.2 million hours of  esports alone.Whether you are a gamer or not, as an investor, you should definitely be paying attention to the rise of esports.Image source: MyWallSt.\u00a0\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the second quarter of 2019, net sales were $1.1 billion, up 8.7% from $1.02 billion in the second quarter of 2018. Net sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $25.9 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 11.2%.Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 second quarter was 59.9% compared with 61.1% in the 2018 second quarter. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in the United States and Canada, as well as by reduced aluminum costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales were primarily negatively affected by geographical and product sales mix and increases in certain input costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 3.7% in the 2018 second quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 11.4% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.9% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 10.7% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.6% compared to 6.5% in the same period in 2018.Payroll costs increased $7.4 million in dollars, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash item, was $15.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $14.9 million in the same quarter in 2018. Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter to 23.4% in the 2019 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rates was primarily due to the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the United States. Net income was $292.5 million in the 2019 second quarter, compared to the net income of $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter and increase of 8.3%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 second quarter increased 11.9% to $0.53 from $0.48 in the second quarter of 2018.We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy drinks from Big Geyser's territory, which is located in New York metro markets to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has been fully transitioned to Coca-Cola network bottlers. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy was launched by Coke Bottlers in Azerbaijan, Paraguay and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the second quarter of 2019 in markets in Europe, namely Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus. We are planning to launch prototype connected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019.In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the second quarter and also launched Monster Mango. We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with three SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continued the rollout of Monster across India, and are planning additional SK launches in India later in 2019.I will now briefly discuss arbitration with the Coca-Cola Company and litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. As we have previously disclosed, in October 2018, Monster Beverage Corporation and the Coca-Cola Company mutually agreed to submit to arbitration the issue of where that Coca-Cola is permits to manufacturer, market sell or distribute, energy drink products, it had developed under the Coca-Cola brand.On June 28, 2019, the arbitration panel issued a final awarding flavor of Coca-Cola. Regardless of this outcome Monster and Coca-Cola value the relationship and look forward to continuing their partnership. I've also previously addressed the lawsuit filed against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPXs trademark lawsuit against Monster filed in March, 2019, but proceedings are ongoing. In one of the court filings in May, 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019, we're projected to exceed $235 million. Ourselves of Reign for June and July was solid as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers were lower than our initial expectations as any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors, including authorizations, the date or dates on which listings are secured for products with major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The Company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. As our litigation with VPX is subjugate. We will not be answering questions on this matter on today's call. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through July 27, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.9% versus the same period a year-ago.Sales of the Company's energy brands including Reign grew 5.6% in the 13-week period.

Sales of our other coffee plus energy drinks were 3% lower, while sales of Starbucks Energy were 18.3% higher. Our Company's share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the four weeks ended July 20, 2019, was 49.1%, down 6.5 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the four weeks ended July 27, 2019, was 43.9%, down 1.3 points, while Starbucks Energy share was 47.7%, up 3.4 points.

Amp and affordable energy brand launch in March increased its market share to 6.2% in June 2019. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and also are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended July 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.2% to 12.7% in Belgium, from 22.1% to 27.4% in France, from 19.5% to 20.9% in Great Britain, and from 7.2% to 7.3% in the Netherlands, from 17.8% to 24.5% in Norway, and from 30.3% to 32.5% in Spain.

In EMEA, supply chain and production issues were considerably reduced versus previous quarters, but still continue to effect performance in the second quarter.

In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2019 second quarter, no shares repurchased under the previously authorized share repurchase program. As of August 7, 2019 approximately $520.6 million remained available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase programs. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods.The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. We are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, and note that Reign launched at Wal-Mart last week. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India.We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. We are proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally. We are also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the USA.I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.Question-and-Answer Session[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Your line is open. -- Thanks, and good afternoon. -- Good afternoon. -- Hi. Just hoping you could give a little background on what you see happening in the performance energy category, whether you were doing the BOGOs in the second quarter and if those pull back. Just what the impact of Reign had on your business and whether you see any slowdown in BOGOs progress? Just anything you can talk about with that sort of disruptive area. -- Well, obviously the performance category has had an impact on the overall energy category. And Reign has continued to perform up to our expectations. We are comfortable with the performance. It's a new product. It just got out and it's obviously going to find its feet in different markets and in different channels. The BOGO did not hit all at one time and some parts of the BOGO took place through the end of June and I think 7/11 and there were some others that did bleed into July continuing. When we look at the BOGO, if you look at the average Reign sales on a weekly basis in Nielsen, it's been reasonably consistent over the past number of weeks. And so we don't believe that the BOGO and the tailing off of the BOGO had really marked influence on the sell rates. So we are comfortable with the ongoing sell rate of Reign. A lot of it depends on timing, getting our products onto the shelves, getting shelves space. As we've launched it, we've had to create shelves space.In many cases, the products are not still worked into schematics, they are still being -- schematics are being reset now and later in the year. So those things will continue to, I think affect the performance of the performance energy category. Now there are a number of other performance energy drinks, there's Bang, and there are also some other performance energy drinks that are seeking to obtain listings in space in the convenience channel, such as Celsius and C4 and others. And so we think that they will ultimately be an additional space allocated to the performance energy drinks. As part of the broader energy drink category, the existing space or probably you will start seeing some additional space being allocated in C stores and coolers in alongside or adjacent to the energy space. We think there will be some development of a sort of subset or category of performance-based drinks that will be lumped together. They will also take into account product. We think like Hydro and other performance, energy drinks that just generally fall outside of the pure carbonated sparkling sort of traditional energy drinks.And I think we should not meet the Walmart listing, which has really been a few good days now. And the team has done incredible job of getting out and really stacking products that it will mind. So I think good things from that come as well. -- But as with everything, it's timing, and so that only happened in the last few days as opposed to earlier in the year. So we do think that that will start having a positive again on Reign's sales and numbers. And we've also got good listings with Dollar General and a lot of other non-traditional retail stores for Reign.Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Just -- thank you. Just to clarify, the July figure includes the selling to Walmart for Reign and can you help us quantify the benefits of Reign in the acquiring both sales and the negative impact of the margin for the BOGO promotion? Thank you. -- So please remember that we don't sell to Walmart direct. It goes to the distributors. So it's hard for us to extrapolate those numbers at this time for July. Those are regular July numbers that the distributors would order from us. -- But you can confirm that you started -- that you've got a distribution at Walmart for Reign? -- Yes. They anticipated the distribution for Walmart, but they knew it was going to happen. We knew it was going to happen. And they built up inventory according to their schedules to accommodate that listing, which is a big listing as you know. -- Yes. Let's start it in the beginning of August. So obviously there would be some sales. -- So listing -- -- Yes. The listing -- there will be some. We don't know. -- And then may be sales in June as well and we don't know. -- Yes.Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. -- Hi, good afternoon. I was hoping to get your thoughts on what's happening with the, with the core Monster brand and whether you've done any diagnosis around some of the pressure there. Is it primarily from Bang? Is it more from Reign and if it's the ladder, how is cannibalization tracking relative to your expectations? Thank you very much. -- Are you talking about the U.S. or internationally? I'm just trying to get an understanding of what you're referring to? -- The U.S. please. -- Okay. The emergence of the performance energy sort of subcategory or subset within the energy category clearly has had an effect on sales of Monster generally, which is -- as well as on the sales of other energy drinks that have really been in the market is historically, which is the Red Bull and Rockstar and others, even our other brands, NOS and Full Throttle. So there's been an effect on all of those brands. When you look at -- on a stack basis, Monster Energy category had a really good year in 2018. And so you've got to look at it all over. That clearly has been an impact in this year, and in the second quarter. We are seeing some stabilizing of the other brands and -- but overall, we look at the business on an overall basis and on an overall basis, the category is continuing to grow. We are still participating in an overall brands within the category are continuing to grow. And this is not too dissimilar to certain other markets internationally where you've got disruptors or lower affordable energy brands going to the market that you take a market like, Mexico for example, while they were in premium energy category, the shares, our shares were higher as an affordable energy brands got into that market. They grew the market overall and our sales grew continued to grow. Although our share of market if you take those affordable brands and then recategorize and market into a broader market, obviously our share percentage-wise started to and did dropped and lower in Mexico while we've continued to see continued increases and positive sales in Mexico throughout the periods that the category has gone through this redefinition. And so that's where we think, we are all seeing the category in the U.S. and it will continue to grow and evolve. But overall, we obviously are looking to new innovation, we've got new innovation plan for later this year and next year and we do believe that we'll continue to have -- Monster will continue to grow in the U.S. as well as the other products in our portfolio. -- But U.S. has been some cannibalization on Monster. These being Reign is taking share from other brands as well and did as has Bang. So you look here, the category, the energy category, which includes both the traditional energy that we know, and the performance energy drinks and that together makes up the total energy drink category today.Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Yes. Hey, good afternoon, guys. -- Hi, Mark. -- Lots of questions, I guess just starting on the U.S., so I'm curious just the cadence of the quarter. We obviously see what month of April that it implies May, June we're up like 4% on an all-in basis. U.S. sales 6%, I guess sort of in line with scanner data, but if you exclude your commentary about Reign selling basically implies you didn't sell another product in the quarter So maybe you give a bit more detail about -- just what channel inventories look like, what shipments look like or whether some sort of issue in the quarter and shipping product from a retailer standpoint. And then completely different just what happened in international gross margins I heard what you said, but what specifically is going on there that's driving the overall continued weakness there. -- So maybe I can start with the second question about gross margins internationally. So there were a number of reasons for the decline in international margins and many of these reasons we've actually spoken about on previous calls. So we said that our Monster energy drinks have a lower gross profit percentage. They're not strategic brands which are largely sales of concentrate. So as international sales Monster grows at a faster pace, then the strategic brands overall gross profit percentages are negatively impacted. Our international innovation in the quarter was in part driven by the juice SKUs, which we spoke about on this call and Espresso Monster principally in EMEA which also have lower margins in our non-juice Monster SKUs. There's also had an impact on the gross profit percentage in the quarter. Country mix is another factor; we sell in some countries that have lower percentage margins than in other countries. Mark, I'm giving the whole shopping list.In the quarter Forex negatively impacted the cost of goods in certain countries, particularly in LATAM that import finished products from the U.S. and from Mexico. This impact obviously was less when certain ingredients only are important not the finish goods. In certain overseas countries as you know, we operate different value sharing models with certain bottlers and that could and did have an impact in the quarter. Production issues and capacity constraints in EMEA also impacted margins in the quarter. So some of these items should not be re reoccurring and frankly we are confident with the operating model. We've had a number of issues EMEA which we prefer to, we are getting to the end of those we believe, but we are comfortable with the model and also with our ability to manage our costs.So I hope that answered your question probably in more detail than you wanted.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. -- I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the Company. We continue to believe in the Company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the Company both at home and abroad and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola Bottling system internationally. We're also particularly excited about new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our Strategic Brands as well as Hydro, Predator and Reign. Thank you very much for your attendance.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Stemming from its origins as a maker of natural soda products, Monster saw early on that consumers' tastes could shift away from traditional favorites toward new categories. Between it and arch-rival Red Bull, Monster was able not just to create a new category but to take an impressive share of the new market for years. Yet Monster's success has finally encouraged others to try to break into the energy drink market, and that could pose a new threat to Monster's long-term domination of the industry.Coming into Wednesday's second-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors wanted to see  in revenue and earnings. Monster's numbers weren't quite as good as most had hoped, and that has some questioning whether competition is actually having more of an impact on the energy drink giant's results than previously thought.Monster Beverage's second-quarter results were solid but relatively unimpressive. Revenue rose 8.7% to $1.10 billion, lagging behind the 11% growth rate that most of those following the stock had wanted to see. Net income of $292.5 million was up 8.3% from year-ago levels, and that produced earnings of $0.53 per share. That figure fell short of the consensus earnings forecast among investors of $0.56 per share.Image source: Monster Beverage.The usual dynamics among Monster's main segments reasserted themselves during the quarter. The Monster Energy drink division, which includes all of the company's legacy beverages, saw a nearly 10% rise in sales. That would've been even larger had it not been for the strong U.S. dollar, which took away about two percentage points of additional top-line growth. Solid performance from Monster Energy branded beverages and Reign Total Body Fuel contributed to the segment's results.By contrast, Monster's other segments didn't match up to the energy segment's standards. The strategic brands division, which includes energy drinks that were acquired as part of Monster's partnership with , saw revenue fall 0.8% from year-ago levels. Here, too, currency effects had a negative impact, but it's clear that Monster hasn't been emphasizing growth in these brands to a particularly large extent. Elsewhere, the third-party products segment remained insignificant, although its sales dropped more than 10% compared to last year's second quarter.Monster did continue to attract international customers. Net sales jumped 17% internationally to $343.3 million, making up more than 30% of Monster's total revenue. Also, case sales improved, rising more than 9.5 million cases to 119.6 million. Average sales prices inched higher by $0.01 to $9.18 per case.CEO Rodney Sacks seemed happy with the report. \"We are pleased to report record gross and net sales in the 2019 second quarter,\" Sacks noted, \"driven by our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks, which we launched in the first quarter.\" The CEO also attributed gains in the legacy Monster Energy brand for the company's overall success.Looking ahead, Monster still sees plenty of room for growth. New Monster Energy brand drinks will get introduced in the U.S. and elsewhere, and the more affordable Predator line should see greater availability worldwide in the near future. That'll be especially important as other companies start to come into the energy drink arena. Coca-Cola, for instance, recently announced its plans to launch an  -- a move that took many by surprise given the two companies' partnership.With the stock having climbed recently toward its best levels in years, however, Monster pulled back on its stock repurchase activity. Monster reported no buybacks during the period, leaving it still with about $520 million in authorized repurchases if it decides to start doing so again.Monster Beverage shareholders didn't like the news, initially sending the stock down more than 10% before recovering to about a 4% decline in the first hour of after-hours trading following the announcement. As Coca-Cola and other competitors start to make their mark in energy drinks, it'll be vital for Monster to defend its turf and keep moving forward with innovative new products.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Therefore, some might think it may eventually run out of steam; after all, the modern consumer has been shifting more toward healthier drinks. But Coca-Cola's current overall strategy is to become a \"total beverage company,\" indicating it wants to diversify away from soft drinks.\u00a0 Over the past several years, the company has acquired brands in still bottled water, , energy drinks, sports drinks, and even coffee, with the huge  last year.Yet while several of these new categories are performing well, to find the real key behind company's  and soaring stock price, look no further than the namesake Coca-Cola brand. This isn't your grandfather's Coca-Cola, but rather several fresh takes on Coke, expanding the iconic brand to healthier drinks, entirely new categories, and finding new audiences.In the quarter, the company grew volumes in the trademark Coca-Cola brand, buoying the total company volume growth of 4% with another 2% growth from pricing and mix, to drive 6% overall revenue growth. Given that many feel the carbonated soft drink market is declining, those are pretty impressive numbers.Image source: Coca-Cola.So, how did Coke do it? Chalk it up to good old management execution, both on the innovation side and the marketing side. Here are all of the ways the company is taking its brand strength and adapting it to modern times.Coca-Cola Zero Sugar is the latest sugar-free Coke option from the beverage giant. Though Diet Coke, first released in 1982, is also sugar-free and calorie-free, Coke Zero Sugar was formulated to taste more like the original Coke. Coke Zero Sugar was unveiled just in 2016, but it has grown double digits in each of the past seven quarters. On the  with analysts, CEO James Quincey said, \"Our performance was largely driven by consumer demand for no-sugar versions of some of our best-known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for the smaller packages with less sugar.\" In fact, Coke Zero Sugar has been a hit not only in the U.S. but globally, as management called out Coke Zero Sugar in Europe as \"creating sustained momentum in the majority of our markets.\" What's another way to lower the sugar content of Coke? To give consumers less of it. Yes, a few years ago, Coca-Cola had the very innovative idea to make its cans smaller, in response to changing consumer tastes and to quell anti-obesity and anti-sugar advocates. Ultimately, that has led to Coke being able to charge more per ounce of Coke sold, allowing the company to grow core Coca-Cola revenue even as consumers opt for the smaller but less efficient can sizes.  Thus, while Coca-Cola's North American volumes declined 1% last quarter, North American price/mix grew 4%, driven by the core sparkling drinks. The smaller packages thus make Coca-Cola more like a sweet treat rather than a large, filling beverage. Continuing the innovation around making Coca-Cola more of a \"treat,\" in February the company unveiled its first new flavor of Coke in over a decade: Coca-Cola Orange Vanilla.The flavor went through extensive testing, and the summer-themed popsicle rollout is apparently having the desired effect, with the company highlighting innovations such as Orange Vanilla as contributing to the stronger-than-expected North American performance. While this was the first new flavor for \"regular\" Coke, Diet Coke had already gotten the same treatment back in 2018. Perhaps taking a page from the flavored sparkling water craze, Coke unveiled a bunch of new Diet Coke flavors: Ginger Lime, Feisty Cherry, Zesty Blood Orange, and Twisted Mango. Management followed up the new-age flavor trend for Diet Coke this year with Strawberry Guava and Blueberry Acai. Image source: Coca-Cola.In recent years, Coca-Cola has been diversifying its lineup away from soft drinks and into energy drinks and coffee, with the    and the purchase of Costa last year. However, that hasn't stopped Coke from expanding the Coca-Cola brand into each of these categories last quarter.In April, the company launched Coke Energy, its new energy drink based on the Coca-Cola brand, in Spain and 14 other test markets. Though the move may raise some eyebrows given its stake in Monster, management said:The energy occasion is fast growing and expanding in multiple spaces to satisfy more consumers. We remain fully committed to our partnership with Monster. And we believe there are opportunities to capture even more value in the energy category for the Coca-Cola system and to bring new drinkers into our rapidly evolving category. In other words, it appears that Coke sees a way to lure more people to try energy drinks who wouldn't otherwise opt for them, by framing the drink under the Coca-Cola brand.Additionally, the company also unveiled Coca-Cola Plus Coffee, a mix of Coke with real coffee that has higher caffeine content than regular Coke, rolling it out to 26 countries. The company also mentioned Coca-Cola with coffee as an innovation that further spurred growth in the core sparkling segment last quarter.Finally, in a display of hip, self-deprecating marketing, Coke also re-released New Coke on July 4 in partnership with , which featured the retro drink in the recent season of '80s throwback show . In case you're not aware, 1985 marked the year when Coke tried to change its core formula and release it as \"New Coke\"...with famously disastrous results. Bringing New Coke back not only was a cool way for Coke to poke fun at itself, but also to get Coke marketing back into the cultural zeitgeist.Coca-Cola ranked sixth this year on ' list of most valuable brand list,  with all five above it being tech giants. Coke is also the oldest on ' list, which is a testament to management's ability to keep the brand relevant over the years.That doesn't happen by accident. By innovating with consumer tastes, extending the brand to new parallel categories, and having savvy, on-point marketing, Coca-Cola management has put on a clinic as to how to nurture a brand...with the financial results to back it up.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It is home to some of the world's biggest, most valuable brands and involves products like tissue paper, shampoo, and soda, which tend to stay in high demand even during recessions.There are 33 companies that make up the S&P 500 consumer staples sector, and they span industries from beverage manufacturers to supermarket chains to tobacco giants. Together, they comprise a critical part of the U.S. economy, with a combined market capitalization of more than $3 trillion.Below, we'll take a closer look at the 10 largest consumer staples stocks by .Grocery retailers are an example of consumer staples stocks. Image source: Getty Images.Consumer staples are products that have two defining characteristics: They are used frequently, and they occupy a favored position in the household budget. These are products that a shopper consumes on a weekly or even daily basis and that they would tend to continue purchasing even if their income situation worsened during a recession.The main classes of consumer staples are food, beverages, home and personal care, alcohol, and tobacco. Product examples include toothpaste, soda, shampoo, toilet paper, and laundry detergent. The industry covers both the manufacturers of these products and the retailers that sell them to the public.These stocks differ from consumer discretionary stocks, which involve products that are very sensitive to moves in the wider economy. These are goods and services that tend to jump during boom times but are among the first things that consumers cut from the budget when recessions hit. Discretionary stock companies sell products like automobiles and luxury apparel and services such as travel bookings and full-service dining experiences.The main reason investors are attracted to the consumer staples sector is its relative strength during an economic downturn. While most other industries tend to contract sharply, a consumer staples business is more stable. In part because of that stability, stocks in this segment tend to pay generous dividend yields that have a long history of rising each year.Those two factors help explain why consumer staples stocks are often referred to as \"defensive\" or \"recession proof.\" The trade-off investors have to accept is that in most cases, this market segment underperforms other areas like technology and consumer discretionary during economic boom times. Yet that's an attractive option if you're seeking stability during market downturns, a goal that applies to all but the most aggressive investors.Here are the 10 largest companies that comprise the consumer staples segment as ranked by market capitalization, or the value that investors have assigned the business.Here are some highlights from each of these consumer staples giants.Walmart is the world's biggest retailer, handling more than half a trillion dollars of annual revenue. Consumers shop in its supercenters and neighborhood markets to fill their grocery needs and to stock up on other consumer staples like cleaning and pet supplies, beauty aids, and baby products.The retailer's strength comes from its low-cost operating approach that is supported by its massive sales base. As the industry's biggest player, it enjoys advantages like economies of scale and negotiating power that allow it to pass along lower prices than peers such as . Its connection with consumers, meanwhile, gives Walmart a platform to launch and support its own company-branded products.Walmart's transition into more of a  that competes online as well as through its physical store network has helped it continue growing, but with lower profitability than investors have seen in the past. The company makes up for that sluggish growth profile in part with a dividend that has risen for more than 40 consecutive years.Procter & Gamble has for decades manufactured many of the world's leading consumer staples brands. From Tide detergent to Gillette razors to Head & Shoulders shampoo, its products can be found in most households both in the U.S. and in almost every other country.P&G's market position is staggering in many of these segments. As of mid-2019, it was responsible for 20% of the global hair-care market, 25% of laundry detergent, and 25% of all global sales of diapers and baby wipes. P&G's annual sales are far lower than Walmart's -- but over the long term, it has averaged a high-teens profit margin compared to the retailer's low-single-digit profitability.P&G endured a long period of sluggish growth after it began a transformation strategy in 2012, aimed at laying the foundation for faster sales gains and improved profitability. The company subsequently gave investors a few reasons to be more optimistic, with sales accelerating when compared to key competitor . That steady market share boost is a critical part of P&G's goal to  to investors. The stock is also known for its healthy dividend, with a payout growth streak that sits at more than 60 years.The scale of Coca-Cola's business is hard to overstate. It not only markets many of the world's biggest beverage franchises (e.g., Coke, Sprite, Dasani, Powerade) but also maintains a global distribution network that's essentially impossible to challenge. Those advantages help explain how the company can account for 1.9 billion servings, or a whopping 3% of all beverages consumed worldwide . It runs a fantastic business, too, with operating earnings consistently trouncing those of smaller peers.Coca-Cola is facing major business challenges as consumer preference shifts away from drinks and ingredients that are perceived to be too sugary and/or loaded with unnatural ingredients. That demand move opened the door for challengers like  and its LaCroix sparkling water brand to gain market share. National Beverage posted a 20% volume increase in 2018 compared to Coke's 1% uptick in the U.S.Yet the beverage giant's strength lies in its ability to adjust to shifting consumer preferences. Those moves ensure that rivals can't turn short-term growth opportunities into significant market share gains against Coca-Cola's portfolio of beverages. Coke's dividend streak, which stretches back more than five decades, is just one reason many investors are attracted to this .It's often mentioned alongside its larger beverage competitor, Coca-Cola, but PepsiCo has an impressive global business in its own right. Its brand portfolio includes hit beverages like Pepsi, Tropicana, and Mountain Dew, in addition to a wide range of snack franchises such as Doritos chips and Quaker cereal products. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola each accounted for roughly 20% of all beverage retail sales in the U.S. in 2018.Pepsi faces some of the same challenges as Coke on the beverage side of the business, but its snack segment helps steady the broader business. Investors who buy the stock today are expecting the consumer staples titan to navigate through demand issues just as it has during past industry disruptions. In any case, they are highly likely to collect significant direct shareholder returns. Pepsi routinely spends almost all of its annual free cash flow on a mixture of stock repurchases and its hefty dividend payment.The tobacco industry is in steady decline, but Philip Morris, one of the world's largest producers of cigarettes and other nicotine-based products, still earns a tidy profit from their sale. In fact, its business is a textbook example of pricing power at work. Philip Morris' sales volumes have been declining, but revenue still improves thanks to rising prices. The company, which sells only to markets outside the U.S., earned $7.9 billion on $29.6 billion of revenue in fiscal 2018, equating to a profit margin of a whopping 27% of sales.There's no shortage of risks surrounding this business, including negative attitudes toward smoking, falling demand for cigarettes, and concerns that e-cigs might attract more regulation by governments around the world. Yet Philip Morris has been  more or less consistently for years. Investors accept those drawbacks in part because of the generous cash return program that the company promises. They're also attracted to the business's leading brands and unmatched supply chain, which allow it to withstand challenges from rivals without losing space on retail shelves.Philip Morris pays a larger percentage of its earnings out as dividends than the 50% rate that is common among the broader consumer staples industry. That helps explain why it is among the highest-yielding stocks in this group and a favorite among income investors.Costco has come a long way since its founding in the early 80s, when the warehouse club retailing model was just getting started. From nine locations topping $1 billion of annual sales in 1984, the company is now the second-largest retailer on the market, responsible for more than $150 billion of revenue each year.Costco's subscription club business differs in several important ways from Walmart's. Most of its earnings come from membership fees, for example, which tend to be much more stable than product markups. That steadily growing income stream, meanwhile, has allowed the warehouse giant to increase profits at a time when rivals like Walmart and Kroger have seen margins shrink.All of that success is reflected in Costco's premium stock pricing when compared to peers. To buy this stock, you'll have to pay more than you would for Walmart or Kroger. You'll get a relatively meager dividend yield compared to those retailers, too.But many investors happily pay that premium in exchange for Costco's market-thumping sales growth, its steadier income stream, and its ability to sell staples like bulk toilet paper right alongside more profitable .Altria Group is comparable to Philip Morris, but it concentrates its focus on selling top cigarette brands like Marlboro in the United States. That premium, branded focus has helped it navigate the long-term downtrend in tobacco consumption rates in richer economies like the U.S.Thanks to  and higher demand for smokeless products like e-cigarettes, Altria's revenue can hold stable even as unit volumes decline. Operating income routinely hovers at nearly 40% of sales, too.Just as in the case with Philip Morris, investors are largely attracted to Altria's financial strength and its hefty cash return program rather than its prospect for robust growth. The stock carries one of the biggest yields among large companies, too. The payout amounts to a significant chunk of Altria's earnings but not so much that income investors need to worry about  anytime soon.Mondelez is one of the world's biggest snack companies. It markets several iconic food brands, including Cadbury, Oreo, and Toblerone. Chances are there are at least a few of Mondelez's products in your cupboards today. A key advantage to owning this company is its geographic diversity. Mondelez generates roughly half of its sales and profits from Europe, with the U.S. market accounting for closer to 25%.Its growth strategy aims to outpace the broader food industry by targeting consumers who are on the go and looking for convenient snacks. The approach tends to deliver solid results and higher profit margins, since consumers are willing to pay up for quality taste and snack packaging.CEO Dirk Van de Put and his team believe that  while expanding profits at an even faster pace through a combination of innovative product releases, more targeted marketing spending, and cost cuts. Such results are only possible if Mondelez can protect its prime positioning in the food segments it dominates.The massive global market for beauty supplies has allowed Estee Lauder to build an impressive business over the years. Its network of more than 25 brands spans the skin-care, fragrance, and makeup niches, which are staples in many homes around the world.Estee Lauder's portfolio is diverse, with about 40% of sales coming from skin care, 40% from prestige makeup, and 13% from its perfume business. The company distributes these products through a network of retailers that supports the premium image it hopes to maintain. Customers can find its products in spas and salons and in travel locations including airports and cruise ships -- but usually not in discount or off-price stores. That upscale image supports hefty profit margins, with gross profitability routinely reaching 80% of sales.The company's long-term success rests on  that resonate with beauty shoppers while maintaining the premium position of its brands even during market downturns. That's a tall order, but the company has achieved that balance through many economic cycles. If it can continue satisfying customers, then its affordable-luxury approach can keep its skin-care and makeup brands firmly on the \"must-buy\" portion of consumers' shopping lists.Colgate-Palmolive is the market share leader in a massive global industry, responsible for 42% of annual toothpaste sales as of 2018. Its dominant position in that niche, and in complimentary ones like manual and electric toothbrushes, has helped it generate impressive returns for investors, with gross profit margin routinely hovering around 60% of sales.Colgate-Palmolive's growth depends on its ability to continue satisfying customers by constantly raising the bar when it comes to quality. There's little room for disappointment in a product that users consume daily, after all.The company has seen sales growth slow in recent years, but management has responded by cutting costs and directing the savings toward extra marketing support for its key brands. If history is any guide, those adjustments should help Colgate-Palmolive retain its massive industry lead while giving it resources to funnel steadily growing dividends to its shareholders.Investor options when it comes to consumer staples companies go far beyond the above list to include many more manufacturers and retailers of products that most households can't live without. However, this selection of the biggest players spans a healthy range of business models, product niches, and operating outlooks.

The money acquired from a loan can give a business a wide range of investment opportunities and, oftentimes, the interest is tax-deductible.That being said, an investor should always be wary of the debt a company on their watch list has. A company with significant debt must have a plan in action to cover this debt and sufficient cash flow to meet its repayment obligations.Image source: Unsplash.In a bid to avoid financial headaches, some companies avoid debt altogether. These three companies are currently staying out of debt -- and it's working for them.Debt plays a big role in the history of , the business responsible for the Monster Energy drinks. The founding company, Hansen Natural, filed for bankruptcy in 1988, but since then, Monster has showcased how remaining debt-free can be a great thing for a company.For 26 consecutive years, Monster has been able to increase gross sales. In the first quarter of 2019, net sales grew 11.2% to $946 million. This growth has been attributed to Monster's international appeal and successful launch of new products.While the consumption of energy drinks rose to 5.5% of young adults in 2016, the threat of consumers no longer wanting energy drinks, as happened to diet soda, always looms over Monster. To counter this potential risk, Monster has diversified into health-related products. In 2019, for example, it launched Reign Total Body Fuel, a product marketed toward gym-goers and fitness experts.One of Monster's most valuable assets is its brand. By sponsoring famous athletes and events, as well as partnering with  to ship internationally, Monster has created a brand that is recognized in over 142 countries.Monster's iconic brand, diversification and lack of debt, ensure that it will be around for many years into the future. , the , is another company that is thriving without debt. For the fiscal year of 2018, Take-Two repurchased 1.5 million shares and, as of March 2019, had $1.57 billion in cash and short-term investments. How's that for a powerful balance sheet?A large portion of Take-Two's success is due to digital sales. While net revenue increased by about 1% in 2018, digital revenue grew 23% to $1.13 billion. Despite being released in 2013, games such as \u00a0are still generating large amounts of revenue for Take-Two through additional downloadable content. Recurring spending on these high-margin digital items now makes up 42% of Take-Two's net revenue.The release of future titles will further strengthen Take-Two's video game portfolio. In the first two months after its launch, \u00a0sold 23 million copies and will continue to generate revenue years into the future through these digital microtransactions.Even with share repurchase programs and expensive game development, Take-Two still has a tremendous amount of cash and will not need to go into debt any time soon.Invisalign, 's  replacement for traditional train track braces, has become a household name over the past few years and, unlike many other businesses, Align is debt-free.Even without taking on debt, Align Technology\u00a0has been able to expand its business consistently. In Q2 2019, revenue grew 22.5% year over year, with Invisalign volume reaching 377,100 cases in the same period. Align Technology is also seeing significant growth abroad with revenue from China increasing 91% in 2018, accounting for 8% of total revenue.Today, , which offer a cheaper, direct-to-home alternative. What gives Align an edge over its competitors is not only the brand's household recognition but its geographic distribution and an extensive collection of patents. Unlike SmileDirectClub, which is only available in the U.S., Align Technology is available worldwide with over 480 patents globally.Align's acquisition of Cadent in 2011 came with the iTero scanner, a device used by dentists worldwide. This diversification away from solely clear teeth aligners, combined with its lack of debt, will allow Align to succeed even when the economy slows down.Image source: MyWallSt.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, declining soda consumption has throttled Coca-Cola's sales growth in recent years, forcing it to aggressively expand its portfolio with new beverages, including teas, juices, sports drinks, and bottled water.That diversification helped Coca-Cola keep growing -- its\u00a0organic sales rose 5% last year, its free cash flow grew\u00a014%, and its adjusted earnings improved 9%.\u00a0Looking ahead, the 133-year-old company continues to expand its reach into adjacent markets with new products. Let's examine three new strategies and how they could boost the beverage maker's growth.Image source: Coca-Cola.Coca-Cola closed its\u00a0$5.1 billion takeover of British coffee chain  earlier this year, which included Costa's roastery, nearly 4,000 retail outlets, coffee vending operations, and for-home coffee products. Coca-Cola stated that the acquisition would be \"slightly accretive\" to its earnings in the first year.During last quarter's , Coca-Cola stated that it would launch its first ready-to-drink Costa Coffee products in the second quarter. Fortune Business Insights estimates that the ready-to-drink coffee market, which is particularly strong in Asia, could grow\u00a0from $19.1 billion in 2017 to $36.6 billion in 2025 -- so it could eventually become a big growth engine for Coca-Cola.But that's not Coca-Cola's only coffee play. There's also Coca-Cola Coffee, which blends coke\u00a0with coffee. The company initially tested the\u00a0drink in Japan, a major market for bottled coffee, and recently decided to launch the drink in over 25 new markets by the end of 2019.Coca-Cola owns nearly a fifth of , and that stake often fuels speculation concerning a takeover. After all, the energy drink market is still growing even as the soda market fizzles out.\u00a0Research firm Mordor Intelligence estimates that market could grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 7.1% between 2019 and 2024 to\u00a0become an $83.4 billion market. Wall Street expects Monster's revenue to rise 11% this year.But instead of buying Monster, Coca-Cola recently launched its own energy drink called Coca-Cola Energy. Monster argued that Coca-Cola violated its contract by launching an energy drink, and entered arbitration with the company last October.Image source: Coca-Cola.However, the American Arbitration Association recently ruled\u00a0that Coca-Cola hadn't breached its contract, clearing the way for Coca-Cola Energy's global launch. It's unclear if Coca-Cola Energy will gain a foothold against energy drink leaders like Red Bull and Monster, but if it does it could help Coca-Cola rebrand itself as a maker of energy drinks instead of sugary sodas.Japan's diverse drink market is a great place for Coca-Cola to test out new products like Coca-Cola Coffee. That's why it recently announced that it will launch Lemon-Do, an \"alcopop\" which was\u00a0well-received during its test run, across all of Japan in October.Alcopops are soda cocktails infused with spirits like vodka. They are cheaper than canned beer, and popular with women and younger drinkers. A 12 oz. can of Lemon-Do costs about $1.40, and different versions contain 3%, 5%, and 7% alcohol.\u00a0If Lemon-Do continues to gain drinkers across Japan, it's highly likely that Coca-Cola will expand it to other markets -- which could open the door for more alcoholic drinks.Coca-Cola's coffee, energy drink, and alcohol efforts are attracting the most attention, but the company is also constantly testing out new variants of its flagship sodas. Notable examples include Coca-Cola Fiber, which\u00a0includes extra dietary fiber, new flavors like\u00a0orange vanilla Coke, and a myriad of reduced sugar and sugar-free variants.Simply put, Coca-Cola isn't simply sitting still and  to lose interest in its flagship sodas. It's still innovating and expanding into adjacent markets, and some of these experiments could evolve into the beverage maker's new growth engines.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is PLUG stock enjoying a temporary high or is this sub-$5 \u201cpenny stock\u201d poised to climb further? \t\n\t\t\nSource: Shutterstock\n\tFortunately, investors can use technical indicators in a case like this. At least, that\u2019s what I would recommend doing instead of buying PLUG stock blindly and hoping it delivers huge returns. Charts can do more than help predict price targets. They can also help determine the level of risk investors are taking and the prices at which they should buy stock.\u00a0Let\u2019s explore the charts of PLUG stock a bit first, then discuss some of the fundamentals that kicked PLUG stock price\u00a0 into overdrive at the start of the year. Too many investors ignore either the fundamentals or the technicals. Blending them together often creates a more well-rounded investment thesis and helps identify superior opportunities.\u00a0PLUG stock put together a robust rally off its December lows, but lay dormant for most of January. That changed in February, when PLUG stock price began climbing, rising from $1.35 to $2.65 by mid-March. Since then, PLUG stock price has been moving between its $2.20 support and its $2.65 resistance.\u00a0These levels have set up a great trade between the range support of Plug Power stock and its range resistance. Nimble short-term investors can buy PLUG stock at its support and sell into its resistance. This trade has been working for months now. However, it\u2019s bound to end eventually, and that will occur when the range breaks.\u00a0On the weekly chart above, some of the candles have a few long \u201cwicks.\u201d Below the current PLUG stock price, the wicks extend to $2.16 and $1.86, respectively. Above the current PLUG stock price, there were some runs to $2.86 and $2.87, respectively. However, PLUG stock price never ended any week above its range resistance or below its range support.\u00a0If PLUG stock eventually\u00a0 breaks out over its resistance or breaks down below its support, traders can bet on PLUG stock continuing the trend. Meanwhile, investors can buy PLUG stock and use a stop-loss on a close below $2.20. Or they can wait for a move over the ten-week moving average and then buy the shares. PLUG has been below the ten-week for six straight weeks. But once PLUG stock exceeds that level, the shares can explode higher.\u00a0As you can see, the charts aren\u2019t setting up all that badly for Plug Power stock. But let\u2019s be honest: a stock does not trade for $2-and-change if there aren\u2019t some concerns or issues about it. Granted, there are always one or two names that could be the next  (NASDAQ:) or  (NASDAQ:). But all things being equal, we need to value PLUG stock based on its current fundamentals.PLUG\u2019s balance sheet doesn\u2019t inspire a ton of confidence, although it\u2019s not a deal-breaker either. Its total current assets of $166.4 million is roughly double its total current liabilities. However, its total assets of $396 million are barely ahead of the company\u2019s $365.7 million of total liabilities.\u00a0Plug\u2019s cash flows are improving, although both its operating income and free cash flow are still negative. That said, PLUG is growing. Analysts, on average, expect its revenue to increase more than 25% this year to $231.3 million. The average top-line estimate for 2020 calls for an acceleration up to 32.7% growth and revenue of about $307 million.\u00a0But PLUG isn\u2019t profitable yet. Analysts, on average, expect a loss of 36 cents per share this year, in-line with last year\u2019s results. In 2020, they\u2019re calling for an improvement, but still expect a loss of 21 cents per share.\u00a0Of course, all of this is predicated on the analysts actually being right, even though more times than not, that\u2019s not the case. For those who want stronger fundamentals and less volatility, they should look elsewhere. For believers in PLUG stock, wait for the charts to confirm the beginning of a rally.\u00a0Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of  and is on Twitter .

What is your mission, your vision, and what do you do? As You Sow is a nonprofit organization that since 1992 has been a leader in moving corporations to become more responsible on a broad range of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Our theory of change states that corporate power has become the most dominant force on the planet, and to achieve our vision of a safe, just, and sustainable world for all, we MUST engage corporations to be part of the solution by shifting their policies and practices to reduce risk. As You Sow is effective in creating change because corporations have a legal duty to their shareholders. We use this legal standing to advocate as shareholders for the benefit of all stakeholders including employees, customers, communities where the company operates, ecosystems, the planet, and of course shareholders. We believe that this stakeholder-centric vision of capitalism in fact optimizes benefit for the company and shareholders. As You Sow believes that this is one of the most powerful paths for creating positive, lasting changes to achieve a safe, just, and sustainable world for all.Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow. Image Source: Andrew Behar. As CEO of As You Sow, what are your priorities, and where do you focus your time and attention? Primarily I focus on empowering my amazing staff of issue experts to figure out how best to achieve our vision of a safe, just, and sustainable world for all. Humanity has all the tools to do this, and we also have case studies showing how to do this. We can power the planet without any destructive fossil fuels; we can grow enough food using regenerative agriculture without poisoning ourselves and our families with toxic pesticides; we do not need single-use plastics that are destroying the ocean and whose only real purpose is propping up an obsolete oil and gas industry; we can pay people a living wage; and we can operate businesses without slavery and forced labor. We can do all of this sustainably while reducing risks to corporations and incentivizing executive management. I spend a lot of time thinking about overarching systems and how all of this is interconnected -- looking for leverage points to find a glide path to the new paradigm. Can you mention some of the specific  your work focuses on with regards to the environment, consumer protection, and human rights? As You Sow has six main program areas with multiple initiatives under each. Danielle Fugere, our president and chief counsel, oversees these programs. Let's start with Energy. The Energy Program team is led by Liza Holman and focuses on climate change, hydraulic fracturing, fugitive methane, the conversion of utilities from coal to renewables, and now we are getting involved in the expansion of the petrochemical industry that is building new plants to process fracked gas into plastic feedstocks.If you are following the entire oil and gas manufacturing chain, then the Waste and Ocean Plastics team led by Conrad MacKerron takes over from there at the petrochemical plants. In fact, we just had a major win a few months ago regarding these plastic pellets when we compelled ,  , and   to agree to disclose spills of the pellets also known as nurdles. Believe it or not, nurdle spills are common, and companies have never publicly reported them -- imagine if Exxon never mentioned the  oil spill or   was not required to tell the world about the  disaster. We filed shareholder resolutions, and after several meetings and a bunch of press on the issue, the three companies agreed to public disclosure. The waste team is working on a major plastic scorecard due out toward the end of 2019 -- this will be the sixth report we have researched and published on the issue of plastic waste starting back in 2006 with a report on plastic bottles and aluminum can recycling by the beverage industry.The waste team works on all aspects of postconsumer packaging waste with a major focus on the ocean plastic problem. We recently convinced   to stop using one billion Styrofoam cups each year, same for   -- no Styrofoam in their global operations, chalk up another billion cups that will not be produced every year. We were involved with many partners to get   to stop using 3 billion plastic straws every year; we brought the shareholder resolution to the floor of the Starbucks annual meeting earlier this year. We also compelled  ,  ,  , and   to phase out all nonrecyclable packaging. We work directly with dozens of major brands, helping them figure this out, including  , Safeway, -owned Whole Foods , all of the fast-food companies, and major food manufacturers. In the past few years, there has also been a groundswell of public support to save the oceans and stop the spread of plastic pollution. This dynamic of connecting customers and shareholders has proved to be very effective. Basically, everyone is on board except the oil and gas industry that is committed to expanding plastic production five-fold in the next decade. They see it as existential, as ramping up plastics is the only way their business can survive. If you do the economic projection analysis, it's pretty clear that demand for fossil fuels used in transport has no future, as we see commitments by China and India to ban the internal combustion engine in a few years; so they are willing to sacrifice the world's oceans to keep extracting oil and gas.Our Environmental Health Program is known internally as \"Make Food Safe To Eat.\" We focus on a few specific issues including getting antibiotics out of meat; in the past three years, KFC, which is owned by , Burger King, which is owned by , , and McDonald's all agreed to switch to poultry raised without medically important antibiotics based on our efforts and those of our partners and allies. Because , Perdue, and   then had no market for their products, they all followed suit and switched. This is the power of supply chains. Families eating fast-food chicken nuggets became fearful of superbugs that were a result of antibiotic overuse; shareholders (As You Sow) saw the risk to the company's bottom line and raised the issue; the companies responded with new policies and practices to maintain their market share; their supply chain responded to them. The only losers are the superbugs. The Ehealth team also files notices under California's Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 with companies that have carcinogens and reproductive toxicants in their products. We have filed thousands of these cases that have led to labeling and reformulation of protein powders, seaweed snacks, nail polish, children's jewelry, portable school classrooms, fresh fish, herbal supplements, earbuds, and hundreds of more products that you see on your store's shelves.Another program area led by Rosanna Landis Weaver focuses on egregious CEO pay. We publish a report every February called  What is remarkable is the inverse correlation between pay and competence. Each year we compare the S&P with and without the companies with the top 10 most overpaid CEOs. And each year we see that if you want to outperform, you should underweight the companies that overpay. But it goes much deeper than that; we see pay ratios showing that it would take an average worker 1,000 years to earn what the CEO earns in one. The income inequality issue festers in every part of the economic system and is a problem that needs to be addressed.Our Social program focuses on slavery in supply chain and historically has been doing a deep dive on the cotton and mineral industries. Through our project called The Responsible Sourcing Network, we brought together a multistakeholder group to help write the Dodd-Frank 1502 rules on reporting the use of conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold). We publish a report annually on corporate disclosure of conflict mineral use. We have also led the fight to outlaw child slavery in the cotton fields of Uzbekistan and have over 300 global apparel brands that have signed a pledge to not use slavery or forced labor in their supply chains. We have just completed a pilot of a program called YESS (Yarn Ethically and Sustainably Sourced) that trains and audits spinners in Bangladesh and India, teaching and certifying them to reject cotton that has been harvested with forced labor.We recently have been working on gender equality, and last week, we sent an investor statement to 3,000 companies signed by 99 investors with $1.61 trillion in assets to send a clear message that gender equality and diversity are material issues that must be publically disclosed. We are now beginning direct engagement with the laggard companies across multiple business sectors.To round all of this off, we have created a suite of tools called  that empower all investors of mutual funds and ETFs to align their investing with their values. Currently, the $8.4 trillion in 401(k) plans are invested blindly. Very few people, if any, know what companies are held within their mutual funds. Our tools show you exactly which fossil fuels, coal-fired utilities, palm oil producers, banks that fund climate destruction, cluster munitions, nuclear weapons, assault rifles, tobacco, private prisons, and companies with poor disclosure and practices on gender equality, to name a few, are held in your retirement account. This suite of tools empowers people to move their money to capitalize on a future that they believe in. Please tell us about toxic chocolate. We began testing cacao after our research team read some academic papers on lead and cadmium in chocolate. This led to our testing hundreds and hundreds of chocolate bars and filing notices with the manufacturers. Over the course of about four years, we reached a settlement, and the industry has agreed to fund a scientific study to figure out where the contaminations are coming from and ultimately find a solution. It has been a long, hard path, and we are only six months into the two-year study but we are hopeful that there are feasible solutions, as the chocolate industry wants to solve this as much as we do. How do you share your work with the world? Is it primarily through the research and reports that you publish? Do you also rank funds based on their ESG profile? We publish about five reports every year and generally do a webinar and press outreach when we release them. This year we have two new ones coming up, one on pesticides in the food system and one on ocean plastics. We share the work through traditional and online press as well as social media. Our process is that we generally start with deep research and then we reach out to companies directly to talk about our findings. Sometimes they are very grateful and agree to fix the issue in a reasonable time period. Sometimes they are reluctant, and so we need to escalate to filing a shareholder resolution. At that point, the issue is public, as it is filed with the SEC, so we may do some press interviews and blogging around it. If the company does not want to work with us and it is going to go to a vote at the annual meeting, we step up the public outreach, as we want all shareholders to know about it and support us with their vote. After the annual meeting, we speak to the company again and often find a mutually agreed solution, or we keep talking, and the longer it goes on the more company shareholders, employees, and customers hear about it, which creates negative brand associations. Eventually, the company sees that we are advocating to help them with a risk or problem that they may not have identified, and so we come to an agreement.An example of this is the   resolution we filed in 2018 on slavery in supply chains. Monster received a zero (dead last) on the  scorecard. We contacted them, and they told us it was not a top issue for them. This escalated to a shareholder resolution, and we got quite a bit of press around it as we approached the annual general meeting (AGM). Their suppliers like   and many customers (we brought them a petition with over 21,000 signatures) were not happy. We refiled for the next year, but within 10 months of the annual meeting, they had audited 80% of their suppliers and built a training platform and trained 170 staffers, so we withdrew the resolution and put out a press release about how Monster had a total turnaround, and other companies that say they can't address this issue now have a case study showing them how to do it. What is shareholder advocacy, and how do you use it as a tool for ? Shareholders have legal standing with corporations in which they own shares and may bring a proposal to their company management about how to reduce risk and be a better company. This is a tool that we use to help corporations see risk that they might not otherwise see. A recent example is the case of gender equality; any company that does not see this coming is pretty blind, as this issue defines a culture -- to attract and retain the best and brightest employees, companies must have a well-thought-out and -implemented, publicly disclosed gender equality plan. What is a shareholder resolution, and can you briefly discuss some of the successful outcomes that resulted from your corporate engagement efforts? A shareholder resolution is a 500-word proposal submitted by a shareholder or a shareholder's authorized representative to a company's management. The shareholder must own at least $2,000 worth of stock for at least one year prior to the filing deadline, which is generally six months prior to the annual general meeting.Successful outcomes -- there are many listed above. One thing to note is that people who work in this space are extremely tenacious, and we see ourselves and the companies we work with as on the path. Some of these adjustments to corporate policy and practice take years and years. Also, many people do not understand the nature of the votes. These resolutions are for the most part nonbinding, which means that even with a 100% vote, the company has no legal obligation to make a change. That said, we have seen major shifts with 6% votes, and we have also seen failed resolutions with a majority or even at 99%.So here are a few more stories. One involved genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that was filed with . Basically, we felt that it would be a huge market advantage for Abbott to offer non-GMO Similac infant formula in the U.S. We knew that Abbott could manufacture it, as they sold it in the EU, where GMO labeling is required and no parent would buy formula with a big GMO warning label. They said that it was not possible to produce. We filed resolutions over three years; brought them over 75,000 signatures of parents who wanted to buy non-GMO Similac if it was made available; ran studies on GMO labeling. Finally (after a 6.2% vote), they agreed, and it has become one of their best-selling products -- in fact, there are five types, including for tender tummies, available. Abbott has a monopoly on the market and has benefited from sales and positive brand association.Another example is the resolution we filed with Dunkin' about the use of nanomaterial in their donuts. We found nano titanium dioxide in the white powdered sugar on Dunkin' donuts. Some background -- nanomaterials are so small that they can pass through the blood-brain barrier and have never been tested or shown to be safe in humans. We know that they cause brain edemas in rats. But here in the U.S., we do not believe in the precautionary principle like they do in the EU, which requires that chemicals put into food be tested for safety. So we asked Dunkin' about this. They did not want to discuss it, so we released our lab data and a video about it to the press and filed a shareholder resolution that got an 18% vote. This attracted a great deal of attention, and in dialogue they said that they did not realize it was in their products and asked their supplier, who also denied knowledge of it. Long story short, we withdrew the second-year resolution because they switched to powdered sugar that was 100% sugar, published a no-nano policy, and became an industry leader. We shared this with many other food manufacturers, and many adopted the policy and questioned their suppliers, which led to suppliers stopping the proliferation of an untested additive. Does As You Sow ever partner with large institutional investors to push for change at corporations? If so, would you mind giving an example? As You Sow always partners with all investors including large institutional ones. We are UNPRI members, and most of our resolutions align with the Principles of Responsible Investing -- so we start with the assumption that $70 trillion in assets under management (AUM) will vote with us. Of course, to be realistic, many investors at the PRI are not really actively engaged on these issues. First, a great deal of the AUM are held by companies like  , Vanguard, and   (call it $20 trillion), companies that basically talk a good game on sustainability but are deeply conflicted and so rarely vote. In fact, the only time that they voted on a climate resolution was Exxon in 2017, and it earned a 62% majority, but they lacked the stamina to follow through when Exxon delivered a defective report, and none would hold the board accountable.We also work closely with the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) and all of the faith-based investors particularly on social issues and climate change. Generally, they vote for our resolutions, as we have very close alignment. We are also CERES members and coordinate on climate change and water. The CA 100+ (Climate Action 100+) has $34 trillion in AUM, and for the most part, they vote with our climate resolutions, although it's often hard to get them to vote as a block, especially when we file resolutions that push the envelope. Beyond that, we call the major shareholders of companies that we file with. We publish exempt solicitations and publish them on EDGAR, and we reach out through the press to \"get out the vote.\" What is your message for the small retail investor that may not think he/she owns enough shares of a company to advocate for change? In a word: VOTE! It really matters. About 30% of all shares are held by individuals, and if everyone voted, we could help companies avoid risk and be more profitable. At a minimum, if your financial advisor is voting for you, have them switch to ISS-SRI; they pretty much recommend a YES vote on progressive resolutions, whereas regular ISS, for the most part, votes with management. So one phone call to switch can be very significant. If you are still getting loads of paper ballots, then ask your advisor to send them by email. It's very easy to click on an email and vote. Also, every March, we publish  with partners  and  that explains all of the upcoming resolutions. What environmental, social, or governance (ESG) risk concerns As You Sow the most, and what are you trying to do about it? The big picture is shifting the dominant interpretation of capitalism, which states that corporations exist only for the benefit of shareholder returns, to a stakeholder-centric view that states that employees, customers, and communities where they operate are equally important. We believe that in fact, when all of these stakeholders are taken into consideration, it will reduce corporate risk and optimize for shareholder returns as well as preserve a livable planet. What is ? Fossil Free Funds is the first of our  suite of financial transparency tools. It empowers any shareholder to enter a mutual fund name or ticker and see exactly what companies you hold that are oil and gas, fossil-fired utilities, pipelines, or oil-field services. Basically total transparency. Even in so-called , we see 35 fossil fuel companies. We have learned to not believe a fund's name and to be very cautious about how we read the prospectus. We update the tools once a month and provide financial performance as well as aggregate carbon footprints for each fund so you can compare apples to apples. What is ? Similar to Fossil Free Funds but focused on companies that produce palm oil, the banks that fund them, and the companies with palm oil in their snack food products. We partner with Friends of the Earth and Rainforest Action Network on this site. What is the ? CarbonClean200 is a thought exercise that we collaborate on with . It came about three years ago when we kept hearing people say that there were no good cleantech companies to invest in. So we created a simple rubric and did the analysis of all global companies with greater than $1 billion revenues, excluded non-SRI-compliant ones, then put them in order by revenue from green/clean energy. We update it every six months, and the next one is due out August 15th. It is remarkable to see the shift as the clean energy future is actually the present. These are the companies that will be on the S&P500 when Exxon, Chevron, and   fall off because they did not transition their business plan in time. Please tell us about your . This is the most recently launched of the Invest our Values tools. We collaborated with , a data provider out of Amsterdam that gathers 19 key performance indicators of gender equality. This is way beyond just women on the board. It looks at policies and practices throughout the company, equal pay, sexual harassment, retaliation, maternity leave, training, recruitment, etc. We aggregate 12 of these data points on 4,000 companies sorted by mutual fund holdings and display the score. It's remarkable to see that, for example. the mutual fund that is owned by most government employees in the Thrift Savings Plan scores a 3 out of 100 on this tool. I predict that we will see this wave of gender-lens investing turn into a tsunami of capital flowing to companies highly ranked on this issue. What is the business case for ESG? In other words, what effect have you found that ESG has on corporate profitability? Can you think of an example in which a company improved its ESG profile, and that  I can't think of one where it has not. Better management cares about risk, and ESG is focused on risk. Environmental risk; if you dump in the commons, it will come back to bite you with penalties for violations, bad brand association, and potentially toxic exposure by your workforce. Social; gender equality, diversity, and slavery in a supply chain define a company's culture. To attract and retain the best and the brightest, these are required. And Governance is critical for trust and long-term relationships. Without good governance there is no oversight. ESG should be called \"basic good business.\" Can you please tell us about As You Sow's  list? How do you determine if a CEO is overpaid, and do you have any research showing how those companies have performed over time?This is a project we began six years ago. One of our goals was to see how shareholders were using what was then a fairly new right: the opportunity to vote on CEO pay.We've used a few methodologies but have settled on two ranking methodologies to identify overpaid CEOs. The first is the regression that computes excess CEO pay assuming relative to total shareholder return (TSR). HIP Investor runs this regression for us. The second-ranking identified the companies where the most shares were voted against the CEO pay package. These two rankings were weighted 2:1, with the regression analysis being the majority.After we'd done a few years of these reports, we decided to check how our first list had performed subsequently. We found then that the 10 companies we identified as having the most overpaid CEOs, in aggregate, underperformed the S&P 500 index by an incredible 10.5 percentage points. Last year, these 10 firms again, in aggregate, dramatically underperformed the S&P 500 index, this time by an embarrassing 15.6 percentage points. In analyzing almost four years of returns for these 10 companies, we find that they lag the S&P 500 by 14.3 percentage points, posting an overall loss in value of over 11%. Please tell us about your book, . Why did you write it, and what is the main message you are trying to get across? The main message of  is that the owners of all corporations, whether directly by holding stock or through a mutual fund, have the power to shape policy and practices to create a safe, just, and sustainable world for all. We have the power; we just need to realize it and learn how to use it. Through the book, I tell stories of shareholder advocates' work over the past 40 years and make the idea of being an empowered shareholder easy to understand. Can you give us an example of a company that you admire for its strong ESG profile? Certainly. The top tier includes Patagonia for being totally conscious on all aspects of their business;   has the Ray Anderson legacy of being transformational;   took a brave position on tobacco and has seen this transform all other aspects of their business -- although the recent opioid data is troubling; for the product and innovations, although they could do a better job on social issues with employees and disclosure. What is next for As You Sow? The recent and ongoing destruction of federal government regulations has given much more importance to corporate policy. We are seeing companies realizing that these regulations were actually to their benefit. For example, 17 automakers sent a letter to the Trump administration asking that CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards not be removed, as it could destroy their businesses. They want to compete in China and the rest of the world and will simply not be able to, plus the abrupt change disrupted a decade of product planning. This is happening broadly, as climate change is disrupting supply chains, destroying infrastructure, and making \"normal business\" a thing of the past. Insurance companies no longer know what a 100-year flood means, as they are happening every three.We see our role in helping bring companies together to self-regulate for their self-benefit. This is an ideal role for shareholder advocates, as we care deeply about the companies we own and know that they must be part of the solution. Where do you see ESG investing going over the next 5 or 10 years? In 10 years, I hope to see a total reversal of today, where \"Value-Destruction Investing\" is a small fringe group and ESG is the norm. Right now, according to US SIF, ESG is 25% of all invested dollars. Why would anyone invest in a company with substandard management that does not want to avoid risk and optimize for a safe, just, and sustainable world? Is there anything that investors should be aware of as they start to learn more about ESG investing and as ESG investing grows in size? In other words, are there any pitfalls to ESG? Be careful of ESG-washing. Many companies hold up their UN Sustainable Development Goal and say \"We are all good,\" when in fact they are not. About a year ago I was at an event, and it was random seating for the opening dinner and they plunked me in a chair at a big round table of 10 people. I turned to my right and say hello to the CSR (corporate social responsibility) director of  , (we had just published a report called \"Roundup Revealed\" about the poisoning of the food system by pre-harvest glyphosate). I turn to my left, the senior VP from  . The woman from Monsanto was so proud about how they had adopted SDG goal 2, Zero Hunger. The gentleman from Philip Morris was equality excited about their SDG commitments. What can I say? Monsanto more than any other company I can think of has toxified the food system and destroyed precious soil, abused seed sovereignty, and generally was as far from working on zero hunger as a company could get. The SDGs have no reporting structure for companies, they have no audits or any way to stop a company from claiming one as their own. We had a similar issue when Chevron gave themselves an award for SDG 13, Climate Action.Also, be careful about self-dealing and conflict of interest. The whole business world was aflutter when BlackRock CEO Larry Fink called on company executives to think hard not just about how it could deliver financial performance but also how it could serve a social purpose. \"Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential,\" . Nice words, but actions speak louder. When  on multiple climate resolutions with big-oil and coal-fired utilities asking for a plan to enable the planet and the company to survive, a clearer picture emerges -- one that will not be pleasant for the investors in Fink's index funds when the economy crumbles under the weight of climate catastrophe. Is there anything else you'd like us to know about As You Sow? Just one note about how incredible my team is. The staff, fellows, interns, advisors, and our board are dedicated to our vision and interact seamlessly with many other organizations of like-minded, optimistic people. It is truly inspiring.

That makes it a Dividend King, an elite title given to S&P 500 companies that have hiked their payouts for at least 50 straight years.Warren Buffett's    is also Coca-Cola's top shareholder, with\u00a0a stake of about 9.4%. Buffett once famously quipped that he drank so much Coca-Cola that he was \"one quarter Coke.\"Those two facts suggest that Coca-Cola is a sound investment. A fact suggesting the opposite is the growing number of consumers who now shun soft drinks from companies like Coca-Cola in favor of healthier alternatives, which raises concerns about its long-term growth.Let's examine some of the headwinds and tailwinds affecting the company to see where Coca-Cola might end up in five years.Image source: Getty Images.Coca-Cola's biggest long-term headwind is declining soft drink sales. Soda consumption in the U.S. is currently at\u00a0a three-decade low according to Beverage Digest, and that weakness is reflected in other countries. Tougher regulations, including soda taxes in several markets, are also discouraging consumers from buying sugary sodas.Coca-Cola is trying to counter that downturn by diversifying its portfolio of non-carbonated drinks (including tea, juice, bottled water, and energy drinks); refreshing its carbonated products with lower-calorie versions, smaller serving sizes, and new flavors; and expanding through investments and acquisitions, including its near-19%\u00a0stake in   and its recent acquisition of Costa Coffee.The success of that plan is a polarizing issue for investors. The bulls note that Coca-Cola's organic growth -- which excludes currency headwinds and the impact of acquisitions, divestments, and the refranchising of its bottling operations -- stayed positive in\u00a0recent years. The bears note that its reported growth, which includes all those bumps, tells a different story:Coca-Cola's year-over-year revenue growth. Source: Coca-Cola financial reports.Coca-Cola's reported revenue growth faced two major headwinds: the strength of the U.S. dollar and the refranchising of its bottling operations. Coca-Cola previously bottled and sold a large portion of its beverages, which generates up to five times as much revenue per drink as concentrated syrup. But that's a capital intensive business which throttles its margins -- so it refranchised a large portion of its bottling operations to independent bottlers in recent years. That strategy boosted its margins but widened the gap between its organic and reported sales.On the bright side, those top-line headwinds could fade soon. The dollar could weaken, regional currencies could recover, and Coca-Cola already concluded its refranchising efforts in most of its major markets -- including North America, China, Japan, Canada, and Latin America.If we examine Coca-Cola's unit case volume and regional growth, its core business still looks healthy. Coca-Cola's unit case volume grew annually across all its global regions in 2018 except for Latin America, which posted flat growth. Its organic revenue rose across all regions except for North America, where growth stayed flat. Those results indicated that Coca-Cola's portfolio expansion was paying off and that it was offsetting the weakness of its flagship soda brands with other beverages.Image source: Getty Images.Coca-Cola's comparable gross margin also expanded from 62.7% in 2017 to 63.1% in 2018, and its comparable operating margin rose from 26.9% to 30.8%. It attributed those margin improvements to the divestments of several bottling operations, ongoing productivity and cost-cutting efforts, and the de-prioritization of lower-margin products (like water and tea) in certain markets. Those improvements indicate that Coca-Cola's earnings aren't headed off a cliff. its organic revenue to rise 4% this year, and for its comparable EPS to stay roughly flat. It expects its takeover of Costa to\u00a0be \"slightly \" to its 2019 earnings, but it hasn't provided any longer-term guidance for the new subsidiary.Wall Street expects Coca-Cola's earnings to rise an\u00a0average of 5% annually over the next five years. Its rival , which has a more diversified portfolio of drinks and packaged foods, is expected to\u00a0generate 4% annual earnings growth during the same period.Based on those forecasts, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have 5-year  of 5.0 and 6.4, respectively. Stocks with PEG ratios under 1 are considered undervalued, so neither soda stock looks cheap relative to its long-term earnings growth. In fact, both stocks look a bit overvalued at current prices -- presumably because investors flocked to them as defensive plays amid macro headwinds.Investors should take analysts' long-term forecasts with a grain of salt, but mid-single-digit earnings growth sounds accurate for Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. Neither company will fade away within the next five years, but both must carefully optimize their brands, cut costs, and make smart acquisitions or investments to keep squeezing out positive growth.Coca-Cola is still a sound long-term investment, but investors shouldn't be in a hurry to buy the stock right now at 23 times forward earnings, especially when there are plenty of  and  with higher yields and lower valuations.Coca-Cola's stock will probably be trading higher in five years, but I'm not convinced that it will outperform the broader market -- especially if positive news (like a trade deal with China) causes investors to dump defensive stalwarts like Coca-Cola to buy more aggressive growth stocks again.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company initially floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 1919 at $40 a share.Given its age, it's unsurprising that Coca-Cola has flirted with innovation over the years with varying degrees of success. Who could forget about the disaster of New Coke, for example, or that the company purchased Columbia Pictures for $750 million in 1982?In more recent times, however, Coca-Cola has found itself at odds with the growing trend for all things healthy and organic. This has prompted the company to move beyond its typical staple of sugary drinks toward other alternatives. Now, the classic Coke stands at the center of a huge, 500-strong portfolio of brands, ranging from vitamin drinks and juices to flavored milk and iced tea.\"We've got to experiment,\" said CEO James Quincey in an interview with CNN, \"we've got to try new things.\"At the start of this year, Coca-Cola purchased Costa Coffee for $4.9 billion and immediately positioned itself as a dominant player in the global coffee industry alongside the likes of   and \u00a0.The company has also been given the green light to start selling its new energy drink, Coca-Cola Energy, globally -- despite objections from  .

Indeed, founder Henry Ford was the pioneer of the modern production line, copying a process he had witnessed in the slaughterhouses of Chicago to reduce the time it took to build a car from more than 12 hours to 2 hours and 30 minutes.After the company went public in January 1956, it went from strength to strength, becoming one of the most recognizable car brands in the world. During the Financial Crisis of 2008, however, Ford reported a $14.6 billion annual loss and came close to bankruptcy.Despite this, Ford still commands a strong market position in the U.S. According to data compiled by Kelley Blue Book and Business Insider, the Ford F-Series was the No.1 selling the vehicle in the U.S. in 2018, when the company also generated around $160 billion in revenue. New CEO Jim Hackett has made some big changes at the company too, like scrapping the production of passenger cars (excluding the Mustang) in the North American market in favor of the more profitable SUV market.The company has also made some impressive future-proofing plans, with $11 billion being dedicated to the development of electric and hybrid vehicles and the intention of having a portfolio of 40 electrified vehicles by 2022.  was established in 1876 as a telegraph repair shop in Stockholm, Sweden.

At the time of incorporation in 1896, Lars Magnus Ericsson's company had grown into a major enterprise with more than 500 employees and had produced over 100,000 telephones.Despite the highs and lows of its almost 150-year existence -- including its ill-fated cellphone business with  -- Ericsson has become very future-relevant again in recent times. With networks, digital services and managed services that cover 5G infrastructure, Ericsson is now riding at the top of the new cellular wave.In particular, network security is where Ericsson holds leadership in an infrastructure battlefield that has attracted the attention of both the president of the U.S. and prime minister of Britain. In recent months, the U.S. has made clear its deep suspicion that Huawei's technology would offer the Chinese government the ability to monitor internet traffic on 5G, making it a massive security risk.Ericsson is one of the companies best-placed to capitalize on Huawei's misfortunes. The move to 5G networks is not simply a case of turning up 4G or reconfiguring existing equipment, but will require a massive rollout of major elements that will cost billions of dollars globally.

Verizon is able to command higher prices and therefore better margins than competitors, and that pays off with greater profits. data by .Higher profitability . Verizon will be able to bundle higher performance for mobile phones with connections to cars, watches, and even home broadband services. The number of devices we'll have connected to networks like Verizon's will only grow, and that should help its profits long term. The dividend yield is a healthy 4.2% today, but over the next decade I think there's a lot of growth left in that payout.  Foot Locker's stock tumbled about 30% over the past three months, mostly after its first-quarter numbers missed estimates on both the top and bottom lines in late May. However, that sell-off reduced Foot Locker's forward P/E ratio to 8 and boosted its forward yield to nearly 4%. The retailer spent only 31% of its free cash flow and 29% of its earnings on that dividend over the past 12 months, and it's raised its payout annually for eight straight years.I believe Foot Locker's sell-off was a major overreaction for . First, Foot Locker's 4.6% comps growth in the first quarter was solid, and marked its fourth straight quarter of positive growth. It also reaffirmed its full-year guidance for mid-single-digit comps growth.Second, Foot Locker's gross margin expanded sequentially  annually during the first quarter, and it expects that momentum to continue with a 20 to 40 basis point expansion for the full year. Foot Locker's inventories also held steady, rising a mere 0.1% annually during the quarter.Lastly, investors seemed to dump Foot Locker because it scaled back its buyback plans for the full year, which reduced its prior forecast for double-digit EPS for the full year to the high single digits. Conservative buybacks aren't necessarily a bad thing, and high single-digit growth matches its forward multiple.Therefore, Foot Locker probably won't rally anytime soon, but its low valuation, high yield, and promising growth prospects should set a firm floor under the stock. Coca-Cola benefits from the shift in the calendar to hot weather, but quenching consumers' thirst this summer isn't the only reason to consider buying shares in the beverage giant. An arbitration ruling was recently made in Coca-Cola's favor, allowing it to build a bigger footprint in the highly successful energy drink market. Last year,  and Coca-Cola agreed to arbitration over a disagreement in contract language associated with their , which includes Coca-Cola's owning a 17% equity stake and distributing Monster beverages. According to Monster, the contract prohibited Coca-Cola from developing its own energy drink competitors to Monster. However, the arbitration panel determined Coca-Cola could indeed launch energy drinks if it did so under its existing brands. The two companies say they respect the decision and value their existing relationship, so a divorce isn't on the table -- at least not yet. Therefore, the decision means Coca-Cola can expand deeper into the category, boosting sales while also pocketing money from its relationship with Monster.There's no guarantee Coca-Cola's new drinks will be winners. Nevertheless, the potential for a new revenue driver alongside the natural seasonal sales tailwind could make it a good time to buy shares and pocket Coke's 3.1% dividend yield.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MNST options chain for the new August 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $58.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MNST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $63.58/share today.\n\nBecause the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 73%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of MNST stock at the current price level of $63.58/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.09% if the stock gets called away at the August 16th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MNST shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing MNST's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

In France, there's champagne and, of course, wine\u200a\u2014\u200avarieties of which echo across much of southern Europe in countries like Spain and Italy. Russia equates to vodka in the minds of many, Mexico with tequila, while over in Japan, sake forms part of the national experience for visitors.In these blunt terms, America is often associated with good old beer. Miller, Coors, Rolling Rock, Budweiser\u200a\u2014\u200athere are a host of iconic beer brands that are deeply ingrained in the cultural image of the U.S. across TV, cinema, and music. That all looks like it's about to change, however.Image Source: UnsplashAs discussed in an , new data is emerging which signals that Americans are increasingly turning their backs on alcohol.The IWSR, an industry tracker for the drinks market, reported that total U.S. alcohol volumes dropped by 0.8% in 2018\u200a\u2014\u200aa slightly steeper decline than the 0.7% drop in 2017 and the third straight year of overall decline.Much of this fall is attributed to beer, the worst hit category of all alcoholic beverages. Beer sales volumes were down 1.5% in 2018 compared with a 1.1% decline in 2017. Elsewhere, growth in spirits and wine sales fell too, with wine growing by just 0.4%\u200a\u2014\u200adown from 1% growth the year before\u200a\u2014\u200aand spirits climbing 1.9% compared with 2.2% in 2017.These figures might seem marginal, but they are representative of a larger trend of declining alcohol consumption across the U.S.The primary reason for this is that medical research has helped us to recognize how many common activities are detrimental to our health \u2014alcohol consumption included. A similar shift affected the tobacco industry previously, resulting in a complete sea change in cultural perception over the course of a few decades. According to recent data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 14% of adults in the US (34.3 million people) smoked cigarettes in 2017. This record low represents a 67% decline from the rates of smoking in 1965 when the National Health Interview Survey estimated that about 42.4% of adults smoked.Alcohol hasn't experienced such a drastic decline as tobacco because its negative effects have been countered somewhat by the belief that there were some positives too. We've all heard the stories that a glass of red wine a week can help the heart, and indeed most governments and health bodies issue alcohol consumption guidelines which indicate that, if kept within certain bounds of moderation, alcohol consumption is quite safe and even beneficial.This notion has come  lately, however, as science advances and scrutiny grows. Indeed, the cancer risks associated with alcohol consumption are becoming more recognized, with the UK Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies saying in an interview on national television, \"There is no safe level of drinking.\"Even still, it's unlikely that alcohol consumption will ever be completely eradicated, at least not in our lifetime. It is probable that people will begin to take a much more tempered and conservative approach toward consumption in the future though, with the data from the U.S. signaling the beginning of this. So how will major alcohol producers react to such a changing landscape?One notable way that alcohol companies are tackling the trend of falling alcohol consumption is a strategy called 'premiumization'.Premiumization is a 'less-but-better' approach. Instead of focusing entirely on selling high volumes of standard beer and wines, companies have shifted to selling more high-margin products\u200a\u2014\u200aspecifically premium-label spirits\u2014 at lower volumes and increased prices.Quite often, these premium beverages also contain a lower level of alcohol too.  , for example, recently launched a lower-alcohol, botanical version of Ketel One vodka, which it said has 25% fewer calories than the regular vodka and an alcohol content level of 30% compared to 40% in regular Ketel One.Diageo CEO Ivan Menezes said last year that adults opting for lower alcohol options was \"an important trend over the next many years\" and that the company was \"putting a lot of focus behind it.\" Diageo also recently bought the Casamigos tequila brand founded by actor George Clooney, a bottle of which can retail between $40 to $120.This notion of premiumization extends to craft beers too and the seasonal brews that companies like the  are renowned for. With this, they put a focus on the consumer enjoying the tasting experience rather than the act of drinking, albeit for a higher price.The ISWR report says \"premiumization remains one of the single largest market drivers across most developed economies and across almost all product categories.\" owns some of the world's most recognizable premium whiskey brands in Jack Daniels and Woodford Reserve. Special editions of these brands\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, this \u200a\u2014\u200aallow the company to sell its already well-known brands for a higher markup.Like tobacco and alcohol, the sugar industry is also experiencing health-related challenges. Medical research over the past few years has shown up sugar as an ingredient that has essentially no health benefits to the consumer, resulting in a worldwide drop in the sales of sugary drinks. However, companies like , , or  haven't just rolled over and died\u200a\u2014\u200athey've started broadening their portfolios to include non-sugar products.Brewers have taken a similar approach to nonalcoholic drinks. For example, \u200a\u2014\u200athe owners of all-American brands like Budweiser and Rolling Rock\u200a\u2014\u200ahas recently created a new global position, 'Head of Nonalcoholic Beverages', to lead its efforts to diversify into nonalcoholic drinks. This segment includes energy drinks and non-alcoholic beers and already makes up more than 10% of the companies brewer's volumes.Diageo is also racing to expand in the non-alcoholic category through its venture arm Distill Ventures. It has already invested in alcohol-free gin brand Seedlip and has made a number of undisclosed investments targeting alcohol-free beverages.Of course, there's more than one way to self-medicate.With its recent legalization in Canada and its gradual acceptance across the U.S. (10 states and counting), the burgeoning marijuana industry could very likely be the future way that the ordinary citizen uses substances to relax.Before you jump on the trend, however, it's important to remember that the sale, supply, and consumption of cannabis is still illegal at a federal level in the U.S., and this doesn't look likely to change significantly any time over the next few years. But as a long-term bet, many larger companies\u200a\u2014\u200abrewers included\u200a\u2014\u200aare taking significant stakes in small marijuana and CBD (cannabidiol) producers as a means of keeping abreast of this growing trend. made a $4 billion investment into the Canadian cannabis grower  last year, meaning that they have a significant stake in the world's largest cannabis company. Future plans that the companies have outlined include crossovers between products like cannabis-infused beverages and sleep aids.Similarly,  has partnered with the Canadian cannabis producer,  \u00a0, to create a joint partnership that will \"pursue opportunities to develop non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages for the Canadian market.\"With the branding expertise and distribution channels already in place, we can expect to see many of today's major brewers become the major growers and suppliers in tomorrow's global cannabis industry.Finally, it's important to acknowledge that, in other parts of the world, alcohol consumption is still growing.With a population of almost 1.4 billion and a rapidly expanding middle-class, China might seem like the golden ticket for tech companies, but alcohol consumption is also predicted to continue growing in China through 2020. This means that China will become the primary market for many international liquor companies going forward.In the first half of 2018, for example, beer sales in China rose 34% year-on-year to hit $84 million. Sales of other types of alcohol including canned cocktails, whiskey, and wines are also growing massively in the country, with drinking culture\u200a\u2014\u200atoasting in particular\u200a\u2014\u200aa very important and pervasive social ritual in the country.From an American brewer perspective, China represents a lucrative future in alcohol sales, though potential tariffs from a trade war between the countries would severely damage this.But is this the end of alcohol in the U.S.?It's very unlikely, but just as tobacco consumption is falling and related activities like vaping are growing, companies involved in the production and selling of alcohol need to adapt quickly and pre-empt major shifts in consumer tastes. It's those that can adapt best which will prosper.It might be no longer feasible for brewers to push out the same old lines of beers, wines, and spirits, but there is ample opportunity for companies willing to innovate and experiment with the experience of alcohol consumption.Image Source: MyWallStThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors in Monster Beverage Corp  (Symbol: MNST) saw new options become available this week, for the March 2020 expiration.

It\u2019s the foundation for putting more things through that *marketing) funnel,\u201d he added.\u00a0However, while the acquisition is more about the talent NBEV is acquiring than the products it\u2019s getting, these new brands widen the number of better-for-you functional beverages it can offer its food service and retail customers. Over the long-term, that\u2019s positive for NBEV stock.In addition, it\u2019s important to point out that Nestea has brand awareness of 89% in the U.S. That high level of brand awareness is going to open a lot of doors for the rest of New Age\u2019s lineup of products at big chains such as Costco (NASDAQ:) and Walmart (NYSE:) where Nestea is already a popular drink\nWhat Did It Cost NBEV?\nNew Age paid $500,000 in cash and 700,000 shares of NBEV stock, while assuming $2.5 million in debt, for an enterprise value of $6.4 million based on a\u00a0 price of $4.85 per share for NBEV stock. The deal brings New Age\u2019s annual revenues to over $320 million and will raise its bottom line. It\u2019s not a big deal, and under normal circumstances, New Age would likely have passed on the transaction because it\u2019s still integrating Morinda, the direct-selling juice company it acquired for  in December. \u00a0\u201cI told our board at our March meeting that we would probably go on an acquisition moratorium for a year while we\u2019re integrating Morinda, building these businesses, launching CBD, launching our Health Sciences division,\u201d Willis  after buying Brands Within Reach. \u201cI told them we were going to focus on pure execution \u2014 that lasted about 45 days. But this is just financially too good of an opportunity for us to pass up.\u201dThe best acquisitions are often the ones that almost weren\u2019t made. This latest acquisition cost less than 2%of the market cap of NBEV stock. Most investors probably didn\u2019t hear about the deal. However, any deal that strengthens a company\u2019s distribution network and logistics is worth making. Kudos to Brent Willis for pulling the trigger. \nFuture Growth \nAlthough New Age\u2019s Q1 results missed  on both the top and bottom line, there\u2019s a lot to like about the company\u2019s financials.In Q1, New Age had a net loss of $1.62 million on $58.3 million of net revenue,  from Morinda. On a year-over-year basis, NBEV\u2019s sales surged 404%. But excluding Morinda\u2019s revenues, its sales fell by 13% YoY. However, the  of the company\u2019s CBD beverages portfolio in the second half of the year should help reignite its sales. While there\u2019s a lot of work to be done before New Age\u2019s portfolio of brands becomes household names, it\u2019s headed in the right direction. From a financial perspective, New Age went from negative free cash flow of $191,000 in Q1 to positive free cash flow of $11.2 million, and that doesn\u2019t include a $31.4 million gain from the sale of property. NBEV is still technically losing money, but the fact that it\u2019s generating positive cash flow is good news for the owners of NBEV stock. \nThe Bottom Line on NBEV Stock\nBrent Willis and the rest of the New Age team continue to make the moves necessary to build a national beverage company. Focusing on being a one-stop-shop for healthy beverages is a smart way to grow the company until one of its products becomes a hit. I continue to believe only speculative and aggressive investors should own NBEV stock. Once NBEV becomes profitable and one or more of its products takes off, then I think it\u2019s okay for less risk-averse investors to jump into New Age Beverages stock. For now, if you want to play the beverage game, Monster Beverages (NASDAQ:) is still a better choice than NBEV stock.

Case sales of 101.3 million were up almost 9 million cases from year-ago levels, while average sales prices rose $0.12, to $9.29 per case.CEO Rodney Sacks didn't overly complicate the success story at Monster. \"Record gross and net sales in the 2019 first quarter,\" Sacks noted, \"were again driven by growth in our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, new Monster Energy brand energy drink introductions, as well as the launch of our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks.\" The CEO also noted that the strategic alignment with Coca-Cola system bottlers is now complete.Monster sees further product introductions for 2019. In particular, the company's Predator brand, which it calls its \"strategically preferred affordable energy brand,\" will see launches in several additional markets over the course of the year. Meanwhile, in the U.S., new products included Monster Energy Ultra Paradise and Monster Dragon Tea, as well as expansion of Java Monster Swiss Chocolate.Monster's buyback activity slowed during the quarter, however. The energy-drink giant paid just $139 million to buy 2.6 million shares, spending just over $54 per share, on average. That was down by almost 75% from last quarter's repurchase volume, but Monster still has about $520 million in total authorizations remaining.Monster Beverage investors celebrated the news, and the stock climbed 8% in after-hours trading following the announcement. With no signs of any slowdown in its momentum, Monster has the financial and business support it needs to carry its positive performance into coming quarters for the foreseeable future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MNST options chain for the new June 14th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $57.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.15.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $57.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.85 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MNST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $57.62/share today.\n\nBecause the $57.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.77% return on the cash commitment, or 32.02% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , and highlighting in green where the $57.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $59.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of MNST stock at the current price level of $57.62/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $59.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.69% if the stock gets called away at the June 14th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MNST shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing MNST's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $59.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $59.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.30% boost of extra return to the investor, or 27.99% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example above is 37%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $57.62) to be 28%.

New Age Beverages stock gained 38% on April 8 on the announcement. \u201cThis is just the first initiative that we expect to do with them on the Marley brand and other New Age products on which we are in active discussions,\u201d said Craig Thibodeau, New Age\u2019s VP of Key Accounts, in the press release.\u00a0It\u2019s a big deal for sure. And Walmart expects a lot, as InvestorPlace contributor Will Healy noted in January, advising that all owners of NBEV stock might want to reconsider their expectations in the weeks and months ahead.\u201cI think the speculation lies in company execution more than in its product,\u201d Healy  January 29. \u201cThe Tilray-InBev alliance focuses on research. Also, the investment by  (NYSE:) in  (NYSE:) has not yet brought a CBD-infused beverage to market. Hence, NBEV appears poised to take the first-mover advantage.\u201dHealy was speaking about New Age\u2019s Marley+CBD Mellow Mood brand and its opportunity to capture the first-mover advantage in the CBD-infused beverage market. He\u2019s right. It does have a vast opportunity available. That\u2019s why I  in December that NBEV could be the next Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:).\u201cI see a ton of similarities between New Age and Monster,\u201d I \u201d Dec. 21. \u201cThat said, a lot has to go right for New Age to move from Monster-wannabe to the real deal. It\u2019s also important to remember that the drinks won\u2019t have THC in them so the novelty or desire to try won\u2019t be nearly as great.\u201dNew Age has got to execute on the Walmart deal, or it could be one and done for the company. I can remember a friend of mine in the specialty apparel business being reluctant to enter into an agreement with Walmart because the expectations get ratcheted up exponentially. If you don\u2019t perform, your products are off the floor. Not to mention Walmart drives a hard bargain when it comes to wholesale prices. If New Age doesn\u2019t do huge volume with Walmart, it will face a significant loss and will lose its first-mover advantageThe stakes are real.Just four days before the Walmart deal, New Age  a distribution deal with Hudson News, the folks who run all the airport newsstands, that puts the company\u2019s products in more than 15,000 outlets across the Northeast and select key national accounts.All great news. But you\u2019ve got to execute because Walmart and Hudson won\u2019t hesitate to cut New Age loose if they aren\u2019t delivering the salesMonster executed at a very high level. Can New Age do the same?In the fourth quarter, New Age\u2019s revenues were almost , ahead of the consensus forecast of $13.54 million. That was the good news. The bad news was that its operating loss more than doubled to $10.1 million from $4.9 million in Q4 2017. Thanks to the Walmart deal and NBEV\u2019s $85 million acquisition of , CEO Brent Willis expects revenue to grow to around  in 2019. Of course, he didn\u2019t say how much it will lose. As I see it, New Age will lose plenty. In 2018, it had an operating loss of $19.4 million on $52.2 million in revenue. That\u2019s up considerably from a $6.3 million loss in 2017 on approximately the same amount of revenue. So, if New Age had an operating margin of -37% in 2018 and you extrapolate that to 2019, its operating loss could be over $100 million in 2019. I say \u201ccould\u201d because it\u2019s unlikely. A more realistic figure for a 2019 operating loss would be around $60 million or three times last year\u2019s operating loss. Now, if the Walmart deal gains traction, it\u2019s possible that the operating loss will be smaller than $60 million, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. Depending on how you definite small-cap stocks, NBEV stock is either a small small-cap or a large micro-cap. Either way, it\u2019s a money loser. On the plus side, New Age Beverages has some exciting brands and potentially lucrative distribution deals. On the downside, its CBD drinks will be competing with an increasing number of competitors, many of them with greater financial resources. I do like NBEV stock as a speculative play, but until it gets more on the bone from its strongest brands, only those who can afford to lose their entire investment should be thinking about New Age Beverages stock at this point. For everyone else, buy Monster Beverage and accept reasonable returns and a much lower level of risk until New Age is making money.\u00a0Then buy.\u00a0At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: The Motley Fool.\u00a0 Q1 2019 , Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin. -- Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the SecuritiesAct of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made during this call.Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2019, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 2, 2019. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products.In the first quarter of 2019, net sales were $946 million, up 11.2% from $850.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Net sales in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 60.6% compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2018. For the quarter ended March 21, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in North America and, to a lesser extent, product sales mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical sales mix and increases in certain input costs.Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.8% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 3.9% in the 2018 first quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 11.5% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 12.3% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.7% compared to 7.5% in the same period in 2018.Payroll costs increased $8.6 million in dollars, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes. Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $13.4 million in the same quarter in 2018. Our effective tax rate decreased from 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter to 16.8% in the 2019 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the deductions for equity compensation as well as the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the United States.Net income was $261.5 million in the 2019 first quarter compared to net income of $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of 21%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 first quarter increased 26.7% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2018. We continue to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. In March 2019, we agreed to the assignment of the Kalil Bottling Group's distribution territories to Coca-Cola Bottlers in the southwestern United States. We incurred no distributed termination costs and received no deferred revenue in connection with this assignment. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy drinks from Big Geyser's territory, which is located in New York metro markets, to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has been fully transitioned to old Coca-Cola network bottlers. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia.We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA. We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand, in Namibia and Mozambique in the first quarter of 2019. We're also planning launches of Predator in certain markets in Eastern Europe in the second quarter of 2019 as well as in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019.We launched Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We also launched Monster in Paraguay last week and anticipate launching in the Dominican Republic in the second quarter. In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we also began the launch of Monster Mango, which we'll continue throughout the second quarter of 2019. We've significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continued the rollout of Monster across India, and Monster is now available in approximately 90% of the country. We are planning additional SKU launches in India later in 2019I will now provide a quick update on our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company. As we've stated, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions, including an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has developed 3 energy drink product that it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. By mutual agreement, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018 for a determination of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market, sell or distribute these products. The arbitration proceedings are still ongoing.On the schedule, the bodies agreed 2 months ago. Monster expects a decision from the arbitrators before the end of the second quarter. Although Coca-Cola has announced it is proceeding to launch its new energy drinks in certain countries without waiting for the arbitration panel to rule on the issue, Coca-Cola's entitlement to continue to sell such drinks will be governed by the outcome of the arbitration. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate to work together as partners.I also wanted to take a moment to address a matter that has received some attention, Monster's litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising, including false and unsupported claims, that Bang contains ingredients that it does not have and provides benefit that it does not generate. VPX has continually attempted to delay our lawsuit. In April, we filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which is scheduled for hearing in June 2019. In March 2019, VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster. I have 2 comments to make. Firstly, the lawsuit is meritless.Months after Monster publicly announced the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in mid January 2019, a company related to VPX allegedly purchased an unrelated Reign trademark for a different class of products, namely powdered dietary supplements. Monster holds trademark and use priority over VPX for its Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in the clause that covers these beverages. We recently filed a reply to VPX's complaint which sets forth our opposition in detail and asserts counterclaims against VPX for trademark infringement and unfair competition. Secondly, this lawsuit will not impede or slow the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel.As our litigation with VPX and the arbitration with Coca-Cola are subjudicate, we will not be answering questions on these matters on the call. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 20, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.8% versus the same period a year ago.

VPX Bang's share is 8.3% and Reign's share is 1.7%. In view of the recent launch of Reign, we are giving an update on its performance. According to Nielsen, for the 1-week ended April 20, 2019, in the convenience and gas channel, Reign's market share in dollars for the one-week is already 2.5%, while Bang's market share in dollars in that week is 8.3%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, sales of coffee plus the energy drinks, which now includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 7.8% over the same period the previous year.Sales of our Java Monster alone were 9.1% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 1.3% higher, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 9.3% higher. Our company's share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 53.5%, down 3.5 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 47.3%, up 0.5 of a point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy share was 43.4%, up 0.6 of a point.

Vault's sales increased 75.6% and its market share increased 6.1 share points to 16.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.6 points to 7.7%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 11.5% to 13.2% in Belgium, from 25.6% to 26.4% in France, from 16% to 17.2% in Germany, from 18.7% to 20% in Great Britain, from 7% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 16.3% to 18.8% in Norway, from 8.3% to 12.4% in Poland, from 15.6% to 16.3% in South Africa, from 29.3% to 30.3% in Spain, and from 12% to 13.2% in Sweden.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended February 2019.

Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter of 2019 was negatively impacted by approximately $18.2 million of foreign currency movements.Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment was $70.3 million for the first quarter as compared to $65.8 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the first quarter of 2019 was negatively impacted by approximately $3.8 million of foreign currency movements.

Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $284.1 million, 30% of total net sales in the 2019 first quarter from $242.1 million which was 28.5% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $22 million.Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 fourth quarter, which not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory.We are managing through these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are securing additional production capacity. In EMEA, net sales in the first quarter increased 12.5% in dollars and increased 22.3% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 43.2% compared to 44.5% in the same quarter in 2018.Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates of our Strategic Brands in the region. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 29.6% in dollars and 34.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2018.

We have successfully launched Monster Energy Ultra Paradise, a line extension in our Monster Ultra family in February 2019 as well as 2 -- an additional 2 flavors of Hydro, Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green, in 25.4 ounce PET bottles. In addition, we brought out the NOS family in the quarter with the launch of NOS Sonic Sour and the rebranding of NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch.We also extended the Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, lead launch from 2018, to all customers in February 2019 and added 2 flavors in our Dragon Tea line, Green Tea and Yerba Mate, which launched in March. We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line. Finally, in March, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel in 6 flavors. Initial results have been positive. During January 2019 in Canada, we launched 2 additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Passion and Zero Sugar, as well as Monster White Dragon Tea.In March, we launched our CaffeMonster line in 13.7-ounce resealable glass packages. In Mexico, we launched Mango Loco in April 2019. During the first quarter of 2019, we launched Pacific Punch in the Caribbean and extended our range in Puerto Rico. In Chile, during the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Absolutely Zero. In Argentina, we launched Monster Ultra. Initial results have been positive. In the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy and the Baltics. Monster Mango Loco will be launched in another 12 EMEA markets in the second quarter of 2019.Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Ireland. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in Germany and Spain. We are planning to continue the rollout of our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the second quarter of 2019. We launched Black Monster Ultra in Russia in the first quarter of 2019 and continued the rollout of additional SKUs in the Monster Ultra range in EMEA markets, specifically Monster Ultra Blue in Great Britain and Ireland and Monster Ultra Violet in the Baltics in the first quarter of 2019.Various SKUs in the Monster Ultra line are now sold in 39 EMEA markets. In Australia, we successfully launched a new Mother flavor, Tropical Blast, in February with good initial results. We launched Monster Mango in China in March and continue with our rollout of Monster Ultra. We plan to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific later this year. As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our U.S. customers effective November 1, 2018. We are satisfied with the initial results of the implementation of this price increase. Promotional expenses as a percentage of gross sales decreased in the first quarter of 2019. We increased the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019, by approximately 1.5%.We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for the Monster Energy NOS and Full Throttle lines. We estimate April 2019 gross sales to be approximately 15.6% higher than in April 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, April 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 18.9% higher than comparable April 2018 gross sales.There was one more selling day in April 2019 than in April 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2019 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million, excluding broker commissions.As of May 2, 2019, approximately 520.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods.Two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Four, in particular initial results for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, which launched in March, are positive, and we are encouraged by the prospects for this line. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India.Six, we're continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. Seven, we're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally and also evaluating the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in countries outside of the U.S.A. in the second half of 2019. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. -- I guess there's lot to ask about, but I guess, maybe just start on your thoughts on U.S. pricing relative to competition. And now that you've got your innovation out in the marketplace, should we expect to see incremental promotional dollars allocated to those initiatives? And I guess how much do you think those initiatives will be allocated against Reign versus against the base Monster franchise? I guess, what I'm really asking about is how much, if at all, do you think incremental promotional investment is likely to offset the list price increases you took late last year as you go forward throughout the balance of '19? -- Okay. Well Steve, you will see that in this quarter when you analyze the results that we actually improved promotional allowances in this quarter. So the promotional allowances are reducing. However, in the next quarter, we're planning, and this is really planned, nothing to do with any sales or sales mixes, but we had already planned a BOGO which is a buy one get one, ready to get Reign activated more intensively than it was in the -- with the launch as part of the launching plan. And you will see that happen in the second quarter. Apart from anything else, we are watching the market. We're watching Red Bull's pricing very carefully. And we'll make adjustments if we think it will have a long-term impact. However, what we see and you'll see that as well is the majority of Red Bull's growth is actually coming from innovation. -- Okay. Great. So just a follow up quickly. The big incremental innovation is tied to the launch of Reign, which I think makes sense. And then now you have Ultra Paradise and some of your newer Monster SKUs in the marketplace. Any incremental promotion? It sounds like from your -- from what you just said, we should assume goes to those new innovations as opposed to -- against the base SKUs. Is that a fair way to think about it? -- I'm not sure I've said that. When we promote Monster, we promote the line. But what I did say was that with regard to Reign, you'll see a special promotion in the ensuing quarter, which will be due to a previously planned BOGO, which is buy one get one to really kick-start the launch of Reign. -- During the quarter, we will be -- we had some timing differences on our promotions last year in the first quarter where we didn't have the same depth of promotion this year. But going into the second quarter, we will be promoting Monster pretty much in accordance with the normal promotional schedule that we plan for summer. -- Yes, I think, Steve, the question was whether -- because of the pricing, the increased pricing, it will be more excessive and the answer is not. -- Correct, yes. -- Yeah. Okay. That's clear. Thanks guys.And our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Hi, everyone. -- Hi, Judy. -- I guess I wanted to ask about Reign, more specifically whether or how much it contributed to 1Q sales as well as the April sales, because obviously there is a pretty big divergence in terms of the Nielsen numbers than your reported numbers. And then, I guess, more broadly on Reign, can you maybe just talk a little bit more about the performance of the brand so far? How much do you think it's taking share away from Bang versus maybe expanding the category? Or how much is sort of cannibalizing your brands? And how quickly do you think that we can get to full distribution? -- On the contribution of Reign, Reign contributed about $25.5 million of sales to the first quarter. -- Net sales. -- Net sales. Yes. We don't have the -- we're not going to go into the number in April. That's just a -- we give the gross numbers as opposed to breaking that up. And I think, Judy, to answer the balance of your question, I think, it's just too early for us to tell exactly what is taking from what. You can see the numbers from Nielsen. There has been some effectives. Obviously, there is a new entrant and participant in the category. It's taking share from all the products. But ultimately, we do believe that Reign will continue to increase itself and establish itself. That is the reason why we're actually looking at the first promotion we got with Reign. It hasn't been promoted until now. And so you've got to get the first promotion coming through in the second quarter on Reign. And we will continue to pull that. We did get some pretty good distribution initially from the Coke bottlers, but it will continue to hold out as we go into the second quarter. -- Just to add to that, Judy, really the launch has exceeded our expectations.And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. -- I wanted to ask a question on white space and opportunity for products. So you'd commented on Ultra being available in, I think, 38 EMEA markets. It got me thinking. So how do you think about U.S. innovation in terms of what the white space would be for existing franchises, while it's just new franchises where you're putting the stuff on shelves? Meaning, it seems like Reign is getting on a new shelf. Is that fair? How do you think about the existing energy shelves? And then outside of the U.S., how do you think about taking successful innovation like Hydro, Java and taking it global? Where are you in the rollout of SKUs versus where it could be? Obviously, there is a lot to that and still maybe just kind of broader strokes of how you think about what the opportunity can be. I think that would be helpful. -- I think we mentioned this, Mark, on previous calls, where a determination is made together with the local management about -- in each country about which SKUs we should launch, which SKUs are appropriate to the consumer needs in that country. And there is a rollout, which is dependent on opportunities, and you've seen we've done that. I mean, on this call, we mentioned a number of countries where we have launched additional SKUs, and we will continue to do so. But one thing we will not do is roll out all our SKUs in all our countries because that's not a good approach to addressing a market. In China, for example, we already have 3 SKUs. We have the original Monster. We have Ultra. And we have Mango. So we have 3 SKUs now in China. And if you look at other countries, we've successfully and successively done that. In EMEA, we've done that, and we're continuing to do that. -- In most of these countries, we really are -- there isn't a cookie cutter sort of formula. We look at the countries. We obviously try and launch with Monster Green to establish the Monster brand because that's what it stands for. But from then on, we look at the individual countries, the flavor preferences, and you'll find that our second and third SKU in many countries differ from country-to-country. And then depending on the response we get, in some countries, we've had really good response to Ultra, we then change the track and basically start to launch more of the Ultra products.And perhaps some years ago, we were launching more of the juice product. And so the order has changed a little bit. Mango has got very well received. Power Punch has been very well received in some instance that we really elevated those SKUs basically looking in some countries. There are some countries where we are finding directly there is a good reception to our Rehab line. Now Rehab, it may not go into that form. It may go in the form of a tea line, because Rehab has less meaning in foreign countries than it has in the U.S. because of the origin of Rehab. But there is some opportunities for tea lines in some countries, and we are looking at that into noncore.And as you then see, we have taken the step, offer some testing to look at coffee. In Europe, we think that market is -- we're going to expand that market with Espresso. And we are also looking at some other potential coffee products into the U.K. market. Again, looking at shelves and keeping abreast of growth and innovation. In those markets, we do see good opportunity for that. And once we look at that and again reach the right progression in other countries, we will look at other growth opportunities in -- but we're going to follow our policy of looking at it country-by-country as we have launched in the country, as the bottler is able to handle it and we feel it's right to continue to grow.Then we'll continue to build out over years -- our portfolio is going to continue to grow -- continue to build out internationally. In the U.S., while we've launched and we believe there is -- the energy shelf is pretty impacted at the moment. So we're looking to get new space for this high-performance category incremental. In some cases, in order to -- because of timing and because of resets, in order to get products on shelf, it has been put on to the energy shelf. But in many cases, we are achieving additional space, and we also have -- we believe most of the retailers are agreed that there should be additional space allocated to this high-performance category.It is a profitable category for the retailers. It's hiring. And so we believe we will see additional space being allocated to energy basically to accommodate the new high-performance products that we believe we will end up with -- overall end up with increased shelf space. -- And Mark, to reinforce that earlier comment that certain flavor profiles that do really well overseas and don't do well in the U.S. For example, one of my favorite Monster product is the Ultra Citron. And a decision was taken that we probably should discontinue it in favor of other Ultra products. And that Ultra Citron has been launched in a bunch of international countries, Japan, Korea and a bunch of countries across Europe because of its less sweet profile. So each country will determine with obviously with direction from consumer the product that best suit the consumer needs in those countries. -- I think it hasn't been launched yet in Japan, Korea. -- I think It has. -- Between us, they are serving it. -- I believe it has. Because I mean -- the concept is that the major product that we'll see in other countries that we may not even launch in the U.S. or they may launch in may -- be discontinued in the U.S. -- Yeah, agreed.And our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Good afternoon everyone. -- Hi. -- Hi. -- Rodney, if we take the Reign out from Q1 sales and look at the rest of the U.S. portfolio, around 4.2%, 4.3% growth, all right. And most of that coming from pricing? And you talked about that you will watch Red Bull price. Like at what point do you get worried about the volume performance of the core Monster brand in the U.S. and not just prices accordingly? -- I think we've got a whole beverage portfolio. And you're going to take the portfolio as a whole in time. I think that we did mention I think earlier that, for timing reasons, there were certain promotions that we had done last year that fell into earlier periods where we had some Nielsen updates that didn't get repeated this year. They are falling into -- probably into the second quarter now. So overall, we are comfortable with the brands. There is a sort of change going on in the industry at the moment. There's a change in, obviously, finding shelf space.People are trying some of these new high-performance drinks. We think a lot of that will stop. The noise will stop settling down. We think there will be growth. Overall, we're still -- we're comfortable with our innovation. Ultra Paradise has now got on to the shelves and is really doing well. Innovation in coffee. The Swiss coffee is doing well. We have additional innovation planned in the months to the line later in the year. And so we are comfortable that overall we will continue to grow. -- Amit, just remember that our launches took place February the 21 for Hydro, so there's 2 new flavors in 7.50, for Java, the Swiss Chocolate; for Ultra Paradise, NOS sell Apple, that is all February 21. And in March 21, we had Reign and we had Dragon Tea. So the launches took place really toward the end of the quarter. And -- but as I said earlier, we will be monitoring Red Bull, and we'll take whatever steps necessary to ensure that the business continues to grow.And our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. -- Congrats on a strong quarter. I would try to have a second shot at Reign because we don't have so much I mean Nielsen reliable numbers for now. So I think you said Reign was representing about 2.5% in the last week of April when Bang was about 8.3%. I guess I'm -- yes, that's correct, yes. -- Market share, yes. -- In convenience. -- Market share, yes, in market share. So it seems like if you add up those 2 -- it seems like 23% of the new -- Reign represent about 23% of the new category. That's a great result just after 6 weeks, especially as you are roughly in just half of the stores Bang is available by your count. So do you have any qualitative feedback at least from retailers in term of sales, especially in stores that sell both Bang and Reign that you could share with us, that would be helpful. -- Well, we've got some information from some of our major convenience retail partners on SKUs -- sort of comparative SKUs. And they are trending by and large at a higher percentage than is shown in the Nielsen numbers. But because of the fact that we bought and it's not something that we generally go into and verify as carefully -- we don't want to quote them on this call. But we do -- the numbers we are seeing out of the top change is showing a higher -- as I said a higher comparable number, which is positive for us. And I think we just got to be a bit patient and wait for the numbers to start coming through generally. And then we'll start seeing the south point as well as the distribution overall.And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rodney for any closing remarks. -- On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank, everyone, for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola Bottlers system internationally. We're also particularly excited about new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our Strategic Brands as well as Hydro, Mutant, Predator and Reign. Thank you very much for your attention and attendance.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude today's program, and you may all disconnect.

Now, following a period of \u2018bad for your health\u2019 criticism and bad-mouthing of shares, MNST stock is setting up to find its energetic mojo on the price chart once more. Let me explain.Monster stock has not been \u2018it\u2019 with bullish investors of late. In the face of a , complete with a new $500 million share repurchase program and bubbly post-earnings bids from Wall Street, MNST nevertheless abruptly lost its fizz falling by nearly 17% to its recent corrective worst.Behind the bitterness, a couple analyst downgrades and legitimate fears of growing competition from workout-focused energy drink beverages like Bang have certainly lent a hand. More recently, beverage heavyweight  (NYSE:) announced it\u2019s  despite its 16% interest and distribution partnership with Monster.To say the least, the news has been a drag on Monster stock. But bulls in this notorious  are showing signs MNST stock could be setting up once again for a period where investors find themselves guzzling shares and enjoying bubbly price behavior on the Monster chart.Looking at the weekly chart of MNST stock, I\u2019ll be the first to admit the bubbly post-earnings bid looked good for continued momentum. Shares broke cleanly above pattern resistance from a double-bottom base and there was little reason to believe a challenge of the prior highs weren\u2019t near.I was wrong, of course. I also wasn\u2019t interested in learning the hard way if Monster\u2019s bullish gap would become a victim of  and all gaps get filled.Now, following the unwanted gap confirmation, I am a buyer of MNST stock if shares can rally back above $55.12 without breaking the current pivot low of $52.23. This entry represents a second attempt for Monster Beverage stock bulls to purchase shares 25 cents above the high of last week\u2019s bottoming candlestick.This purchase is backed by Monster shares closing in on an oversold stochastics position and price action having found support from the 76% retracement level and 200-week simple moving average. In our technical view, that\u2019s enough evidence to consider a long position, along with what\u2019s likely been a frustrating initial signal for other bulls and making the second entry likely a less-crowded affair.Bottom-line: Should this entry signal through $55.12 in the coming days, this MNST stock position \u2018isn\u2019t it!\u2019 or the be-all and end-all. As the daily chart emphasizes, on top of respecting the mentioned Fibonacci and moving average-based bottom currently in place, there\u2019s also another one of those storied gaps \u2014 and potential price confirmation we\u2019d rather not stick around for, i.e., making us \u201clong-and-wrong\u201d.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler\u2019s management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

While it is witnessing softness in the Coffee Systems business, its strategy focused on partnerships and acquisitions bodes well for long-term growth. The company is also seeing strong in-market gains and market share growth for the CSD portfolio, single-serve coffee and other categories, which helped it reach the target for 2018.Let's analyze the stock.Though Keurig Dr Pepper's sales lagged estimates in fourth-quarter 2018, top and bottom lines improved year over year due to gains from the merger between Keurig and Dr Pepper in July 2018. Earnings were aided by an increase in adjusted pro forma operating income and a considerable decline in interest expenses due to reduced indebtedness and unwinding of several interest rate swap contracts. Sales mostly gained from merger benefits and robust volume/mix growth.Keurig Dr Pepper remains focused on partnerships and acquisitions, which form an important part of its growth strategy. Since the completion of the merger, it acquired Big Red and agreed to acquire CORE Hydration, adding these partner brands to its owned portfolio. It also added Forto Coffee Energy Shots as new partner and expanded distribution terms with Peet's for ready-to-drink Iced Expresso. Additionally, the company recently signed a long-term agreement to sell, distribute and merchandise the Evian brand across the United States.The company also added the iconic Canadian coffee brand, Tim Horton's, and the U.S.-based bakery-cafe brand, Panera as Keurig partners. Furthermore, it signed an agreement with Met caf\u00e9 in Canada, which was an unlicensed brand previously and will begin distribution of products in 2020. Meanwhile, Keurig Dr Pepper exited FIJI Water and BODYARMOR drink brands as part of the recent reorganization of its allied brands.Keurig Dr Pepper remains on track with long-term targets set out at the time of the merger in July 2018. Though its earnings view for 2019 lagged analysts' expectations, the earnings growth forecast of 15-17% was in line with the long-term target for the 2018-2021 period. Further, the company estimates net sales growth of about 2% in 2019, in sync with its long-term sales growth target of 2-3%. Additionally, it expects significant cash flow generation and rapid deleveraging, targeting leverage ratio of less than 3.0 in two to three years from the closing of the merger.Though the aforementioned factors position the company for growth, persistent softness in the Coffee Systems business due to lower volume for coffee brewers is hurting the top line. As a result, sales missed estimates in fourth-quarter 2018, contributing to the dismal top-line surprise trend. With this, the company delivered negative sales surprise in four of the last six quarters.Notably, all of Keurig Dr Pepper's segments reported sales growth, except for Coffee Systems, which witnessed a sales decline of 0.5%. The segment's volume/mix gains from the increase in K-Cup pod volume were offset by lower volume for brewers due to the timing of shipments between third and fourth quarters of 2018, and the discontinuation of certain legacy Keurig brewer models. Lower pricing and currency headwinds were other deterrents for sales growth for the segment.Further, the company is not immune to the industry headwinds related to the CSD category and higher input costs, which is hurting its peers, including Monster Beverage  , Coca-Cola  and PepsiCo  . Also, the company's cross-border presence exposes it to unfavorable currency movements due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.In addition to the stocks discussed above, wouldn't you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?From more than 4,000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank, these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market.

Momentum in the company's energy drinks business, with brand strength and product launches, has been the key growth driver. It is also witnessing robust growth in international markets and remains on track to launch products in 2019. Moreover, it is optimistic about its alignment with Coca-Cola's  bottlers, which has expanded its distribution network.On the flip side, other players in the soft-drinks industry continue to battle soft sales trends, owing to the unpopularity of the carbonated-drinks category (CSD). With growing consciousness related to health and wellness, consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and obesity concerns. This is hurting growth of the CSD category, which has been witnessed by all major soft drink makers - including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo  and Keurig Dr Pepper  - leading to lower volumes and weak sales.Notably, Monster Beverage has been tackling these headwinds due to its growing portfolio of energy drinks, which are being preferred by consumers at this moment. Additionally, the company managed to post strong top and bottom-line results despite adverse impacts from input cost inflation for aluminum cans, unfavorable product mix and increased freight costs on gross margins. Further, its sales continue to increase despite adverse currency translations.Driven by these positives, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock increased 9% in the last three months, outperforming the  's growth of 4.3%.You can see  .Let's get a detailed view of factors that may aid the stock's growth moving ahead.Monster Beverage offers a wide range of energy drink brands such as Monster Energy, Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, among others, which is providing an edge over competitors. Further, the addition of Coca-Cola's energy drink brands to Monster Beverage's portfolio strengthened its position in the global energy drinks market. In the United States, management completely transitioned Monster Energy brand from distributors of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV  to Coca-Cola bottlers.Management remains optimistic about the energy drinks category to continue gaining momentum in the months ahead, with the Monster brand growing significantly. Also, product launches across the Monster family will drive the company's overall top and bottom lines. Evidently, net sales at the Monster Energy Drinks segment grew 15.9% in the fourth quarter of 2018.Monster Beverage has a solid international presence and remains on track to enhance the global footprint to expand market share. The deal with Coca-Cola in 2015 (also referred to as the \"TCCC Transaction\") provides Monster Beverage with full access to Coca-Cola's world-class global distribution network. Under this deal, Coca-Cola and its bottling partners act as Monster Beverage's preferred distribution partners globally, thereby ensuring greater reach for its products.Notably, Monster Beverage has been expanding international operations into various markets, including China, India, and countries in Africa and the Middle East. Evidently, net sales to customers outside the United States were up 30.4% in the fourth quarter of 2018.Product innovation plays a significant role in Monster Beverage's success. There is a consistent demand for new products that are tasty as well as healthy. The company regularly introduces flavors of existing products while removing non-performing products. Notably, it launched Monster in Ecuador in the fourth quarter. Further, it is on track to roll out the brand in Bolivia in first-quarter 2019, and the Dominican Republic and Paraguay in the second quarter. Monster Beverage is also on track to launch Monster Energy Ultra Paradise and Java Monster Swiss Chocolate in the United States.Management remains optimistic about the prospects of its brands and product launches. These are likely to drive top-line growth and increase overall profitability.A detailed review of the company's growth strategies suggests that the stock is definitely poised to regain traction in the future.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Monster Beverage Corp , but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $48.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $72.00. The standard deviation is $7.716.But the whole reason to look at the  MNST price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MNST crossing above that average target price of $62.92/share, investors in MNST have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $62.92 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

(Last month's  helped with that, providing  to shares.)Recently, however, Wall Street has been feeling a little less sure about Monster's prospects. At $34.4 billion in market capitalization, shares cost more than 35 times earnings -- a bit pricey for a stock that  pegs for just 15% annualized earnings growth over the next five years.And yet, one analyst isn't fazed by the growth estimates -- or the valuation, either.Image source: Getty Images.Yesterday afternoon, investment banker Credit Suisse announced it is starting coverage of Monster Beverage stock with an outperform rating and a $78 price target. Working off today's share price of $62 and change, this means the analyst expects Monster to deliver another 26% profit for investors over the next 12 months, to match the 26% profit it's already provided since the year began.Why does Credit Suisse feel so confident in Monster's chances?Monster, says Credit Suisse in a note covered on  (subscription required), is the fastest-growing company it's currently covering in the food and beverages space, and is likely to grow both sales and earnings in the low double digits going forward. Admittedly, this estimate only matches the same predictions voiced by other analysts, as recorded by S&P Global. But Credit Suisse sees other things to like about the company, in addition to sales and earnings growth.Cash, for one thing. And a lack of debt to offset it.As Credit Suisse points out, Monster's balance sheet is rock-solid, sporting $958 million worth of cash and equivalents without a lick of debt. Helping the company to accrue this positive cash balance is a powerful cash machine, which generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow last year -- $1.11 for every $1 o  ed  earnings.And Credit Suisse believes Monster can do even better than that. In last night's write-up, the analyst actually made the case that at some point in the future, the company could achieve as much as $3.5 billion in annual free cash flow -- more than triple the amount of cash it churns out today. Weighed against that number, even Monster's $34.4 billion market cap doesn't look too expensive -- less than 10 times FCF.This is a pretty bullish case Credit Suisse is making for Monster Beverage. And yet, the shares are down 4% since this week began, so clearly  is worrying investors. What is that something?Well for one thing, citing valuation, Citigroup on March 1 removed Monster from its \"focus list\" of its favorite stock picks. Then two days ago, analysts at Evercore ISI warned investors of \"a new and very real competitor in the U.S. that is taking category share and taking some MNST consumers.\"The competitor in question would appear to be privately owned Vital Pharmaceuticals, which does business as VPX Sports, and manufactures the \"Bang\" energy drink. On Monday, analysts at RBC Capital named Bang as an energy drink with rising popularity. At the same time, however, RBC believes that while Bang  taking market share in energy drinks, it isn't taking share from  . Rather, RBC sees Bang stealing away market share from competing brands like  's Amp,  Dr Pepper's Venom, and Rockstar -- and if this is the case, then Bang may not be much of a threat to Monster at all!To the contrary, by weakening the brands of Monster's better-funded rivals (Keurig's annual sales are nearly twice Monster's, while Pepsi is bigger still), Bang and its owner may actually be doing Monster a favor, by temporarily clearing the field of more serious threats to Monster's franchise.So does all of this make Monster Beverage stock a buy? I have to admit that, so long as Monster is selling for 35 times earnings, I'm going to be pretty cautious on the stock myself. That being said, if and when Credit Suisse is proven right, and Monster reaches $3.5 billion in annual free cash flow...well, when that happens, I'm going to reserve the right to change my opinion.Until it happens, though -- fingers crossed, but eyes open.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Source: Let me explain.Earnings with their associated volatility and sometimes perverse reactions to the news can be a tough trade for investors to play. But there are times when the Street's digesting of a corporate report on the price chart goes mouth-in-hand with the results. Such appears to be the situation in KO stock and MNST stock.With contrasting earnings confessionals and price feedback from Coca-Cola and Monster investors over the past couple weeks, it's time for a pairs trade in the two beverage rivals.Coca-Cola is and has been \"it\" with famed investor Warren Buffet and his equally celebrated  (NYSE:  , NYSE:  ) for just more than three decades. And the returns have been staggering with gains of around 1,700% since the company initially purchased KO stock in the aftermath of 1987's market crash. But that was then and this is now.In mid-February, KO released its latest earnings confessional for the fourth-quarter and it was anything but sweet. Overall, the report came in  That's definitely not a flavor-of-the-day combination on Wall Street. Maybe worse though, the report also offered a weak outlook and real lack of the fizz, i.e., growth, in key product markets such as plant-based and water beverages.The disappointing results left a bad taste in Wall Street's mouth with investors punishing KO stock. In the immediate aftermath, shares tumbled nearly 8.5% while gapping below its former all-time-high. But that wasn't the worst of it.Click to EnlargeDespite the broader market's own continued bubbly price action, subsequent selling sent Coke underneath the key 200-day simple moving average used by many longer-term investors to define a stock's trend. Now and just over two week's removed from the report, with shares consolidating in bear territory just beneath the moving average, KO stock is ready to be shorted as part of our pairs trade.This week, MNST stock is a strong bet with bullish investors and  The \"new\" kid on the block delivered stronger-than-forecast double-digit growth, proving it's not your granddaddy's dusty old investment.Monster also issued a new $500 million share repurchase program. The combination pleased Wall Street as investors sent MNST stock gapping strongly and finishing higher by more than 8.50%. But it gets even better for bulls on the Monster price chart.Aside from the bubbly one-day gain in share price, MNST stock's earnings reaction also signaled a bullish breakout of a pattern mid-pivot within a corrective double-bottom base, as well as the 62% retracement level.Click to EnlargeLooking forward, it is honestly tough to know with absolute conviction whether prior resistance will act as definitive technical support. There is that price gap, which if Wall Street folklore holds true, could always get filled despite MNST stock's solid report. But, as a purchase alongside KO stock and given price action that would still maintain the overall bullish technical integrity of the price chart, this pairs trade is one to consider seriously.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported fourth-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings matched estimates while sales missed.

Further, the company's guidance for adjusted earnings per share was $1.20-$1.22 for 2019, which was short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24.Nonetheless, management pointed out that the earnings growth forecast of 15-17% was in line with the long-term target for the 2018-2021 period, which was set out at the time of the merger.Overall, shares of Keurig Dr Pepper belonging to the Zacks  industry have declined 4.6% in the past three months as compared with the S&P 500 that increased 0.7%.Adjusted earnings per share of 30 cents improved 25% year over year and were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The improvement was aided by an increase in adjusted pro forma operating income and considerable decline in interest expenses due to reduced indebtedness and unwinding of several interest rate swap contracts. | Notably, the company repaid about $940 million of bank debt after the closing of the merger, driven by strong operating performance as well as effective working capital management.Net sales of $2,813 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,852 million but more than doubled (up 140.4%) from the year-ago quarter figure of $1,170 million. The solid year-over-year improvement was attributed to benefits of the merger. Pro forma net sales improved 0.5% on the back of 2.7% growth in volume/mix, offset by 1.8% adverse effects from changes in Allied Brands portfolio in the Packaged Beverages segment and 0.4% impacts from currency headwinds.During the fourth quarter, the company also benefited from strong retail market performance measured by IRI. I  ed market share gains in both units and dollars for its CSD portfolio, backed by strength in Dr Pepper and Canada Dry brands. Further, its coffee portfolio gathered market share in units and dollars, driven by share gains for pods produced by Keurig Dr Pepper.Adjusted pro forma operating income grew 12.9% year over year to $720 million, driven by solid sales growth, strong productivity, reduced SG&A expenses and lower marketing costs, offset by higher input and logistics costs. Additionally, negative comparison from $21-million gain on Bai recorded in the year-ago quarter impacted operating income. Moreover, adjusted operating margin expanded 280 basis points (bps) to 25.6%.Revenues for the  segment rose 4.8% year over year to $352 million, backed by higher realized prices and favorable volume/mix, offset by unfavorable currency rates.Sales for the  segment were $1.18 billion, up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected from volume/mix gains and increased price realization, partly offset by negative effects of the changes in Allied Brands portfolio and currency translations.Revenues from the  segment improved 1.7% to $120 million, driven by higher price realization and volume/mix growth, offset by unfavorable currency.The  segment's sales dipped 0.5% to $1.16 billion from $1.17 billion in the year-ago quarter. The decline stemmed from lower pricing as well as adverse currency effects, partly compensated by volume/mix growth. Volume/mix grew 2.9%, benefiting from increase in K-Cup pod volume, offset by lower volume for brewers due to shipment timing between the third and fourth quarters of 2018, and the discontinuation of certain legacy Keurig brewer models. However, recently launched innovation products are witnessing favorable trends in the market.Keurig Dr Pepper ended 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $83 million as of Dec 31, 2018, compared with $90 million as of Dec 31, 2017. Long-term obligations totaled $14,201 million and stockholders equity was $22,533 million. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled nearly $1,613 million as of Dec 31, 2018.Despite a strong end to 2018, Keurig Dr Pepper expects the operating environment to be more challenging in 2019.The aforementioned earnings view for 2019 is supported by net sales growth of about 2%, which is also in line with the company's long-term sales growth target of 2-3%.Further, it anticipates capturing merger synergies of nearly $200 million in 2019, consistent with the long-term target of capturing $200-million synergies every year between 2019 and 2021.Other non-operating income/expense is projected to be $30 million in 2019. Adjusted net interest expense is likely to be $570-$590 million, driven by ongoing efforts to lower debt and benefits from the unwinding of interest swap contracts. Adjusted effective tax is expected to be 25-25.5%, with outstanding shares estimated at 1,420 million.Additionally, the company expects significant cash flow generation and rapid deleveraging, targeting a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 in two to three years from the closing of the merger in July 2018.Monster Beverage Corporation  has a long-term earnings growth rate of 16% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Comcast (CMCSA), Deere (DE) and Exelon (EXC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have outperformed the S&P 500 in the past year, gaining +6.4% vs. +2.9%. The Zacks analyst thinks Comcast is benefiting from solid growth in residential high-speed Internet customers. Expanding Wi-Fi coverage along with innovative xFi control features is improving customer experience. The company's Xfinity Mobile is now used by more than one million customers.Additionally,  's Best Picture Oscar win bodes well for Comcast division Universal Pictures. Further, the Sky acquisition expands Comcast's international reach. Notably, the company will enter the streaming market through NBCUniversal's upcoming service.However, the streaming market is highly competitive and significant investment is needed to gain footprint. Hence, incremental spending on content can hurt Comcast's margin expansion. Moreover, the company continues to lose voice and video subscribers due to cord-cutting. Additionally, high debt level is a headwind.(You can  ).Shares of  have increased +11.7% over the past six months, outperforming the S&P 500, which has declined -3.6% over the same period. Deere's first-quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings and revenues rose on a year-over-year basis aided by demand growth in key markets. Earnings missed expectations while revenues beat the same.For fiscal 2019, Deere projects net sales growth of 7% year over year and net income of $3.6 billion. The Zacks analyst thinks the company will benefit from improving construction markets and growing replacement demand for agricultural equipment. The acquisition of Wirtgen, which enhances Deere's exposure to global transportation infrastructure, will be a catalyst. Introduction of advanced technologies in its products will fuel growth.Raw material cost inflation, elevated expenses and unfavorable foreign currency impact will hurt margins in the near term. Nevertheless, Deere remains well poised for long-term growth backed by population and urbanization growth.(You can  ).

Although Exelon's earnings per share during the fourth quarter were in line with estimates, the bottom line improved from the year-ago level. The improvement was due to new rates at PHI and higher energy efficiency earnings at ComEd.The Zacks analyst thinks Exelon is likely to benefit from its $23-billion planned capital investment, focus on zero-emission electricity generation and cost savings. The company continues with its hedging program to manage market risks and protect the value of its generation. Strong cash flow generation capacity will help it lower debt levels and increase value of its shareholders.However, Exelon is subject to the impact of commodity price volatility and price fluctuation in the wholesale markets.

Notably, this marked the third straight positive earnings surprise with second consecutive sales beat.Following the earnings release, shares of the company increased about 7% in after-hours trading on Feb 27.Monster Beverage's earnings came in at 43 cents per share, up 22.7% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents.Net sales of $924.2 million grew 14.1% year over year and exceeded the consensus mark of $895.8 million. Also, gross sales improved 13.7% to $1.06 billion in the quarter under review.However, net and gross sales were hurt by $16 million and $18 million, respectively, due to advance purchases by customers in the previous quarter. A pre-announced price hike from Nov 1 on certain Monster Energy drinks led to advance purchases. Net sales were also adversely impacted by $14.4 million from foreign currency translations and by $8.5 million from the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606. Excluding the adoption of ASC 606, the top line grew 15.1% in the fourth quarter.Outside the United States, net sales to customers totaled $274.3 million, up 30.4% year over year. Net sales at this segment, which includes Monster Energy drinks, increased 15.9% from the year-ago quarter figure to $853.3 million. Nonetheless, the metric was hurt by $3.2 million due to the adoption of ASC 606 and $12.4 million from adverse foreign currency rates. This segment includes a range of energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company  . Net sales at this segment declined 5.4% to $65.8 million in the fourth quarter. The downside can be primarily attributed to adverse impact from the adoption of ASC 606 and foreign currency. Net sales at this segment, which includes some products of American Fruits & Flavors sold to independent third parties, grew 8.5% year over year to $5.1 million.Fourth-quarter 2018 gross margin contracted 240 basis points (bps) to 59.7%. The decline can be attributed to higher certain input costs like aluminum cans, freight and other input costs; lower net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; geographical mix; and domestic product sales mix. This was somewhat mitigated by rise in domestic sales prices coupled with lower promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales.Operating expenses increased 3.8% year over year to $245.7 million. However, selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.3%, down 230 bps from fourth-quarter 2017 figure.Operating income amounted to $306.5 million, up about 14.8% year over year. Also, the operating margin expanded 20 bps to 33.2%.Monster Beverage ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $637.5 million, and total stockholders' equity of $3,610.9 million.Effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.1% compared with 24.8% in the prior-year quarter.Moreover, the company bought back shares about 9.4 million shares worth $536.9 million (excluding broker commissions) in the reported quarter. It had an outstanding authorization to buy back shares worth nearly $20.6 million as of Feb 26, 2019, under its August 2018 repurchase plan. On the same day, the board also authorized a new repurchase program of up to an additional $500 million.Monster Beverage remains confident about its performance, reporting record net sales for the fourth quarter as well as the full year.

Moreover, the company is well on track with its strategic alignment with Coca-Cola system bottlers.Furthermore, management remains committed toward product launches to boost growth. Apparently, Monster Beverage is on track to launch Monster Energy Ultra Paradise and Java Monster Swiss Chocolate in the United States.

Consumer preference beverage -- consumer beverage preferences and types are continuing to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. Net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by 8.5 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606.Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses. Net and gross sales for the three months ended December 31, 2018, were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the third quarter of 2018 due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 2018, which affected our fourth quarter. The company estimates such impact to net and gross sales was approximately 16 and 18 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales were 924.2 million, up 14.1% from 810.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 15.1%. Net sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately 14.4 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded fourth-quarter gross sales of 1.06 billion, up 13.7% from 934.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately16.2 million of foreign currency movements.Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter was 59.7%, compared to 62.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.1% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in input -- certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; geographical sales mix as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of total net sales, our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins; domestic product sales mix; and the 8.5 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increases in domestic sales prices as well as the decrease in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales.Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 3.6% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 13.6% in the same quarter in 2017. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 11.9% in the same quarter in 2017. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.2%, compared to 7.7% in the same period in 2017.Payroll costs increased $4.9 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and noncash item was 14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $13 million in the same quarter in 2017. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $3.1 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter to 23.1% in the 2018 fourth quarter.The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Reform Act, signed into law on December 22, 2017, as well as a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. In addition, the comparative 2017 fourth-quarter effective tax rate included a onetime provisional charge related to the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, and the onetime charge for the deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act.The decrease in the provision for income taxes was also partially offset by a decrease in the stock-based compensation tax deduction. Net income was 239.1 million in the 2018 fourth quarter, compared to net income of 201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, an increase of 18.8%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 to 556.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 fourth quarter increased 22.7% to $0.43 from $0.55 in the fourth quarter of 2017.We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia.We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA. We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand in South Africa, in the fourth quarter and plan to launch in certain surrounding countries in the first quarter of 2019. We are also planning launches of Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador.We are now on track to launch Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We are planning to launch Monster in the Dominican Republic and Paraguay in the second quarter of 2019. In China, we had a limited launch of Monster Ultra White in the fourth quarter to further appeal to Monster's primary target of young affluent consumers. Ultra's innovation has facilitated expanded shelf space in the targeted top 40 cities and key accounts.We are continuing to expand the rollout of Monster all through this quarter and are planning further innovation through the launch of Mango Loco in China during the second quarter of 2019. We continued the rollout of Monster across India with expansion to top 50 cities. Monster is now selling in approximately 90% of the country with marketing initiatives now in full swing. I wanted to take a moment to address an issue previously covered on our last call, and that's our investor presentation in New York in January concerning our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company.As we reported, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions. Coca-Cola has developed three energy products that it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply to those energy products. As a result, we have a disagreement with Coca-Cola over the interpretation of that exception.By mutual agreement, to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018, and that process is under way with the parties participating cooperatively. Coca-Cola had indicated that it had suspended the proposed launch of its proposed energy product until April 2019. We cannot predict with certainty when the result of the arbitration will be published but reasonably expect a resolution of the issue in the second quarter of 2019. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners.According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through January 26, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 11.3% versus the same period a year ago.Sales of Monster grew 11.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 5.6%, and sales of Full Throttle increased 2.8%.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market.Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.

Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.In EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 third quarter, which not only affected our sales but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing throughout the supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in part to these issues are back on track.Furthermore, we have secured and are securing additional production capacity. In EMEA, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and increased 23.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.8% in dollars and 28.1% in local currencies.

Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates of our strategic brands in the region. We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets.We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.

Average days of inventory were 67.2 days at December 31, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Java Swiss Chocolate, a line extension of our Java Monster family, as an exclusive launch with certain customers and are now in the process of a national launch of Java Swiss Chocolate. Initial results have been positive.We're currently in the process of launching Ultra Paradise, a line extension in our Ultra family, as well as Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green in 25.4-ounce PET bottles. In addition, we are currently launching NOS Sonic Sour, a new flavor in the NOS family, as well as rebranding NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch. In March, we are planning to launch our Reign total body fuel in six flavors. We are also planning on launching two flavors in our Dragon Tea line in March, namely Green Tea and Yerba Mate.We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line as White Tea. During January 2019, in Canada, we launched two additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Passion and Zero Sugar, as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March of 2019, we are planning on launching three flavors of our Caffe Monster line in the 13.7-ounce resealable glass package in Canada. In Mexico, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton energy drink.Initial results have been positive. We are planning on launching Monster Mango Loco this quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Belgium, Ireland and South Africa. Monster Mango Loco will be widely available across Europe in the first half of 2019.Monster Mega was launched in the Adriatics. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in selected accounts in Great Britain. Espresso Monster has also just launched in Germany this month. We are planning to launch our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the first half of 2019.In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Burn Lemonade in Russia, BPM Orange Zero in Ireland, Power Play Mango in South Africa and Burn Mango in the Baltics. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we executed a limited launch of Monster Energy Pipeline Punch with the convenience and gas retailer in Australia. In January of 2019, we distributed Monster Energy Pipeline Punch nationally. In the fourth quarter of 2018 in New Zealand, we launched Pipeline Punch and Mango Loco marketwide.We have experienced manufacturing issues related to our Mango Loco product in Australia. We are anticipating that we will be able to resolve these issues and resume product supply to both Australia and New Zealand in the second quarter and relaunch at retail in the third quarter of 2019. As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our U.S. customers effective November 1, 2018.We are pleased with the initial results of the implementation of this price increase. Promotional expenses as a percentage of gross sales decreased in the quarter. We increased in the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019, by approximately 1.5%. We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle lines.We estimate the January 2019 gross sales to be approximately 2.7% higher than January 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 4.6% higher in comparable January 2018 gross sales. In this regard, we note, and as explained on our fourth-quarter 2017 call, that the increase in gross sales of 27.9% in January 2018 as compared to January 2017 FOREX adjusted to 25.1% was in part due to the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 by certain of our international distributors; b, initial shipments of Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster, which we launched in January 2018; and c, more of innovation in 2017 had a more substantial impact on January 2018 sales than innovation in 2018 has had on our January 2019 sales. No new innovation was launched by us in the U.S.in January 2019. This year, our innovation in the U.S., namely Monster Ultra Paradise and Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, is being launched nationally this week. And Reign and two additional varieties of Monster Dragon Tea will be launched in March. Thus, the increase in January 2019 sales over January 2018 sales mentioned above should be evaluated in the context of the above factors that impacted January 2018 sales.In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2018 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of 56.99 per share for a total of 536.9 million, excluding broker commissions. Between January 1, 2019, and February 26, 2019, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of 54.18 per share for a total of 139 million, excluding broker commissions.As of February 26, 2019, approximately 20.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On February 26, 2019, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional 500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods.The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brand and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing with our plan to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets.We're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and year-end. Thank you.[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Just a quick question on -- a clarification, if you could repeat the January sales, that would be helpful. I think I heard 2 and 4%.I just want to clarify. And then if you could just tell us a little bit more about how things are going in China. You mentioned about $3 million in losses in the quarter. How has that progressed over the course of last year? Are the losses about where you expected them to be? Do you think we will have another loss year next year? And how do you feel about the progress in China overall? -- OK. Let's just deal with the January sales. January sales were up 2.7% in January and on a foreign currency adjusted basis, 4.6%. -- So Caroline, you got the points about January '18 sales being higher than ordinarily they should have been. So we spent a bit of time just talking about that. Go back to the same call we had a year ago and pick up some of the sentiments that we experienced exactly the same at that time. -- And then taking that into account, we have obviously also given you the Nielsen numbers for January, and you'll obviously get February. So we do caution about this being a single month on a highly stacked January from last year. -- So Caroline, just talking very briefly about China. The loss for the quarter was very much in line with what we'd expected. We are seeing a lot of what we call green shoots in China and the major change of volumes per outlet are very respectable compared to what we've seen for Red Bull. And the launch of Ultra was particularly pleasing, and it's growing in strength.As regards this year, we again are budgeting for a loss in China, and we actually committed -- absolutely committed to success in that territory. So we know it will be an investment. We know it will take some time to realize profitability in China, and our Coke colleagues have expressed and shared with us some of the same sentiments. But we are committed, and we believe that we will be successful in China. -- I'd like to just add one thing to help those comments on China that since introducing Ultra White, we've got only about three months of information in some of the modern trade, the bigger accounts. And what we are also seeing is that Ultra is being accretive. It's not cannibalizing Green, which is also positive for us. And it actually has been well received from a taste profile.So we are quite positive about Ultra and actually very excited about the launch of Mango Loco there, which has got a really attractive can. We think that the three products in the black, white and turquoise cans, still could -- cans will start to have a much bigger impact on shelf and give us much more recognition on shelf. So we are continuing to be positive about China and the prospect for increased sales in China. -- And just to add that the bottlers, likewise, are excited about the opportunities that the Monster brand presents for them in China. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. So, I guess maybe one sort of question broadly on gross margins. I don't want to ask you for guidance or anything like that, Hilton. But I guess the numbers are still a little bit weaker than we or probably others would have expected.So, I guess how much of it is aluminum -- I mean, I get the freight piece. I think most will get the freight piece. But what we don't see is how much inventory for aluminum you bought in 2018 potentially had much higher prices. So maybe if you could talk a bit about the cadence of that kind of cycling through and when kind of directionally some of that's should lessen.So, without actually giving guidance but just in terms of the input, puts and takes to how long before you start seeing lower-priced inventory kind of work through would be helpful. -- Well, as we look at aluminum, aluminum did start coming down toward the latter quarter of last year. We, from time to time, execute hedges with our aluminum can companies. And we had some hedges in place for the fourth quarter of last year really to protect ourselves against aluminum going significantly growing up as it had been for most of the year. So that's the picture of aluminum.Aluminum coming down. We are buying at various prices, including one of our hedges hitting in at a higher price than the market price for a portion, not for all but for a portion of our aluminum. So, as we head into 2019, aluminum, in our books, will definitely start coming down. But by how much, I really can't say and I'm not at liberty to say.But it will be coming down in 2019. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- I appreciate that you update us on the price increase internationally, and you mentioned Canada up 3% starting on February 1. Do you think -- I'm just layering your comments before that your price - very respectfully, your price elasticity in some places. So, do you think we should be thinking of that being the last price increase so far given what Hilton just said about aluminum potentially coming down? Or is that. -- No. I think that there are some selected countries in EMEA where we have taken certain price increases and we'll continue to take some price increases this year. But I just don't have a list of them with me. And at this point, we wouldn't like to expand further on that.So, there will be some, but obviously, we will also take that into account when we look at the aluminum prices and what the costs are there going forward. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets. Your question please. -- Hi. Good afternoon everyone. A quick clarification and then a question on -- from EMEA, the supply chain disruptions and production issues, how much did it cost in terms of your sales growth for that segment, right, in the quarter? And then as we think about gross margin in the U.S., clearly it was weaker than what we were expecting. And I hear your point on the commodity, but there is also a sales mix aspect of it.Can you unpack that a little bit? Provide us some clarity on how much of a headwind that is and how it could continue even after you overcome the commodity headwinds. -- OK. So regarding EMEA, it's not a precise science. And unfortunately, I just don't want to give you a number for what the impact of the supply chain issues in EMEA were in the fourth quarter. We have made some steps at the number.We've been reviewing it continuously since the middle of 2018. But I'd rather just stay away from giving some indication of what the number is. I don't think it will be appropriate to do so. But what I can say to you is that we believe the number was in excess of one million cases, and I'm going to stop there, in the fourth quarter. -- Perfect. And then gross profit impact from sales mix in the U.S.? -- So there definitely is an impact on sales in the U.S. And what we try to do on the call is prioritize the reasons for the decrease in gross profit. And you'll notice from the call that, No. 1 was the increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans trading in other input costs.Secondly was our geographic sales mix, where our international sales are increasing as a percentage of our total sales, and our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins, as you heard on the call. And the third reason was the domestic product sales mix. So, while it was definitely a factor and will continue to be a factor with the different products that the company has launched, but in the fourth quarter, it was the third reason and was not the first or the second reason. And I'd also like to stop there because when you look at our new products that will be rolled out this year, particularly the new Ultra Paradise and the Reign product, they will all be at the more traditional Monster margins and not at the coffee margins.So they will be higher than the coffee margins. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim. Your line is open. -- Yes, good afternoon, Rodney and Hilton. I do have a question on Reign. I noticed from the packaging doesn't carry any reference to Monster or the claw. Or even on the back it says, I mean, the company manufacturing it is the Reign Beverage Company.So I'm curious to understand why you are not leveraging your brand name as it would be probably a bit more A&M intensive to launch a new brand from scratch. I'd like to understand also the first reaction from the trade on the Reign. -- Well, let me just talk about that. The positioning of Reign is different to the positioning of Monster. And we've made the strategic decision to not, in fact, make Reign a line extension of Monster. It needs to -- we think it should be positioned, have its own positioning, its own marketing, create its own personality.And that, we believe, will give us it its best chance of success. We already have an extensive range of products in Monster that appeal to consumers. They have their own personality and identity. So we just felt that this was the appropriate thing for us to do.This doesn't mean that in the future, depending on this performance category, its longevity and the size that it grows to, what it -- we believe it will expand the energy category, what it does, we will look to what we want to do in the Monster range. There is no limitation on us in having line extensions or maybe a subfamily of products in this performance energy range with BCAAs or whatever else we want to do with sort of a slightly different energy formula -- formulation. And that's something that we're looking at and open to doing. So that doesn't preclude us.We just feel that -- and in fact, it's better and it does enable us to position the brand differently and give more shelf space. We think that it would have been more pressure on our existing shelf space had we simply launched line extensions. And we do have a number of additional line extensions which we are planning for Monster. We already described a number of them to you that are being launched.We actually have additional launches and subbranches planned for Monster later in the year. So, we've got quite a full plate for Monster. And you can't do everything under one brand, and that's the reason that we positioned it as we have. -- And I think it's also important to note that we're continuing with rollouts of brands under the Strategic Brands and new flavors. So, we're not neglecting the strategic brands segment either. -- Just with regard to retail, again, it's being rolled out in March. So it's premature. But the acceptance from retailers and to the brand, to the positioning, to the taste profile that we've done and the packaging has been very positive. We are actually very happy with it, and we are going to have a focused and concerted rollout in March. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your question please. -- Quick cleanup question, I hope. I know your inclination and penchant historically has not been to guide. But Hilton, can you just confirm for us that given the moving parts -- and we understand the comment around input costs and mix, but you have a full-year pricing going in. Do you expect gross margins to be higher? If you can just confirm that that will be helpful.And then, Rodney, on pricing, can you talk about Red Bull's pricing posture? So, from a U.S. perspective, it clearly hasn't followed yet. Is it concerning? Is there a point at which you'd consider rolling back pricing or promoting it back to trade? And then maybe internationally, what are you seeing from that? Do you think there will be further opportunity to price beyond what you've outlined on this call? -- Well, Kevin, I'll just take the last question first. Red Bull obviously has made a strategic decision once we had announced our increase to be aggressive in some of their promotions more so than in previous year and to try and pick up some volume and share, which they have been losing for some time. We've seen that. It doesn't affect us.We've, I think, been successful at what we strategically intended to achieve. And we are not intending to roll back any pricing at this time. We are satisfied with where we've got with pricing, and we think the pricing is fine. And so, we don't believe that Red Bull will continue because it's going to hurt their margins.And they won't continue indefinitely, but we can't speculate as to what's in their heads. But whether they do so or not, we don't believe that would be a factor for us of any materiality, quite frankly. And so we're moving forward with our plans. -- So just to add a little bit to that. The price increase that was planned was very carefully planned in relation to Red Bull's pricing, where there were significant gaps between our price on shelf and where Red Bull was at that time. And what we were able to do with our price increase was move us closer to the Red Bull pricing. So, if you look at the pricing and the 4% that we implemented, the objective was to get pretty close to where Red Bull had their products priced in the market.And obviously, we're only talking about the U.S. And then on your other points on gross margin, Kevin, I don't have to give you guidance because we don't give guidance. But you've got all the facts. You know that aluminum's coming down.We've said that freight costs are continuing to increase. You know our geographical sales mix because we've spoken about that. And we've also spoken about our new products and that the new products are largely going to be focused on better margin products. So, you can come to your own conclusion.I think you know where I'm heading. I'm not going to give any guidance or any discussion on margin, but I think that's enough for you to be able to work it out.Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks. -- Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottlers system internationally.

Net income rose 19% to $239.1 million, and that produced earnings of $0.43 per share, beating the consensus forecast among investors for $0.40.Investors have gotten used to the dichotomy between Monster's two key segments. The legacy Monster Energy drink unit, which includes all of the company's more established brands, enjoyed a 16% rise in sales.

The catch-all other revenue category saw a modest gain of $400,000 to $5.1 million in segment revenue, representing about half a percent of Monster's overall sales.International growth took back its place in the driver's seat for Monster Beverage's overall revenue gains. Sales abroad jumped 30% during the fourth quarter, making up almost 30% of the company's total top line.Monster saw a nice pickup in its volume and pricing metrics. The company sold 97.5 million cases, up almost 13% from year-ago levels. Monster also brought in $9.43 in sales per case, up $0.12 from prices from the previous year's fourth quarter.CEO Rodney Sacks kept his assessment of 2018's success simple. \"We are pleased to report record net sales for both our 2018 fiscal fourth quarter and 2018 full year,\" Sacks noted, \"driven by growth in our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and new energy drink introductions.\" The CEO also gave some credit to Monster's relationship with Coca-Cola's system bottlers for its progress.2019 looks to be another year of Monster following its long-term strategic roadmap.

(OXXO stores) has made a new commercial pact to sell Grupo Modelo's beer brands. Per the deal, OXXO stores will now sell Grupo Modelo's leading beer brands, including Corona and Pacifico. This agreement is likely to be formalized in March 2019.Grupo Modelo's portfolio includes some of Mexico's most popular beer brands including Corona, Pacifico, Victoria and Modelo. Further, this Anheuser-Busch InBev  subsidiary imports Budweiser and Bud Light.

(\"HEINEKEN Mexico\")-under its 10-year commercial agreement that dates back to 2010. Concurrent to signing of the deal with Grupo Modelo, FEMSA extended its existing commercial pact with HEINEKEN Mexico for another five years with some key changes. This extension marks a renegotiation well ahead of the expiry, scheduled for 2020.The extended deal includes provisions for the sale of beer brands from both Heineken and Grupo Modelo in Mexico beginning April 2019, with a gradual expansion thereafter. Starting 2019, OXXO stores will simultaneously sell both brand portfolios in Mexico's biggest cities including Mexico City and Guadalajara. This will be extended to stores nationwide by 2022.Here it is imperative to mention that these deals will not only enhance the productivity of the beer category, but also add value to the Mexican beer industry.

Its revenue fell 6% annually to $7.1 billion, topping expectations by $30 million. Its non-GAAP EPS rose 9% to $0.43, which matched the consensus estimate.Those growth rates seem solid, but Coca-Cola expects its organic sales to rise just 4% in 2019 and for its non-GAAP EPS to stay roughly flat, compared to 5% organic sales growth and 9% EPS growth in 2018. CEO James Quincey stated that the company was \"being prudent\" in its outlook for 2019 based on \"the multiple reductions in global economic growth outlook\" and its \"own experiences\" in certain emerging and developing markets.Image source: Getty Images.That downbeat forecast caused investors to dump Coca-Cola stock, which is often considered a safe haven during market downturns. Let's take a look at five other major reasons Coca-Cola's stock is fizzling out.Soda consumption in the US is currently at its lowest levels in over three decades, according to Beverage-Digest. That trend, which can be attributed to a consumer shift toward healthier beverages, is also reflected in other developed countries.Coca-Cola diversified away from sodas with teas, sports drinks, juices, and bottled water to offset those declines. However, its case volume still remained flat year-over-year during the fourth quarter, and its sales growth can mainly be attributed to higher prices. This strategy will help Coca-Cola tread water over the short term, but it's unsustainable over the long term.Coca-Cola refers to its organic sales growth -- which excludes currency impacts, acquisitions, divestments, and other \"one-time\" charges -- as a measure of its overall health. Unfortunately, many of these \"one-time\" charges, like currency headwinds and the refranchising of its bottling operations, have been recurring over multiple quarters. That's why there's a big gap between Coca-Cola's organic and reported sales growth, and why the former looks much stronger than the latter:\n  \nCoca-Cola's year-over-year revenue growth. Source: Coca-Cola quarterly reports.The bulls will argue that Coca-Cola's reported sales growth will improve once it concludes its refranchising activities and the dollar weakens. However,  's (NASDAQ: PEP) organic and reported sales growth both remained more consistent than Coca-Cola's over the past year, which arguably makes it a more attractive alternative:\n  \nPepsiCo's year-over-year revenue growth. Source: PepsiCo quarterly reports.PepsiCo's growth isn't weighed down by long-term bottling refranchising issues, and it's better diversified with Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker packaged foods -- which generated nearly 30% of its revenue in 2018.Coca-Cola is a  that's raised its payout annually for over five decades, and it pays a decent forward yield of 3.4% at today's stock price. However, Coca-Cola paid out its dividends with more than 100% of its earnings and free cash flow (FCF) over the past 12 months, mainly due to the refranchising of its bottling operations.Coca-Cola probably won't stop raising its dividends or lose its Aristocrat title, and its payout ratios should drop again once it finishes its refranchising plans. However, it might offer lower dividend hikes every year until that happens.Meanwhile, PepsiCo spent 39% of its earnings and 80% of its FCF on its dividends over the past 12 months, and pays a comparable forward yield of 3.3%. So once again PepsiCo seems like a better investment than Coca-Cola.Image source: Getty Images.Coca-Cola repeatedly acquired smaller companies and invested in others to diversify its business away from its flagship sodas. Notable acquisitions have included Minute Maid, Barq's, Fuze, Honest Tea, and Moxie. It also acquired a major stake in energy drink maker  (NASDAQ: MNST) in 2015.Many analysts argued that Coca-Cola should simply buy Monster, which is expected to generate double-digit sales and earnings growth this year. But in a polarizing move, Coca-Cola decided to buy  , the leading coffee chain in the UK, for $4.9 billion.Many analysts weren't impressed by the deal. Credit Suisse analyst Tim Ramskill noted that Coca-Cola paid a \"huge premium\" for the coffee chain, while Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett noted that Coca-Cola valued Costa's earnings \"higher than those of the mighty  .\" That acquisition and other investments could throttle Coca-Cola's earnings growth.Lastly, Coca-Cola trades at 20 times forward earnings, which is pricey relative to its forecast for fla  growth this year. PepsiCo expects its core earnings to slip 3% this year, but its stock is slightly cheaper than Coca-Cola's at 19 times forward earnings.Coca-Cola's multiple was likely inflated because it's considered a bear-market-friendly stock in a turbulent market. However, there  consumer staples stocks that trade at lower multiples and pay higher dividends -- which indicate that it isn't an ideal defensive play.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Moreover, it delivered average positive earnings surprise of 1.4% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 40 cents remained unchanged in the last 30 days. It represents 14.3% year-over-year improvement. | Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming earnings release.Monster Beverage has been witnessing solid momentum in the energy drinks business amid a challenging industry backdrop. This momentum is aided by the company's wide range of energy drink brand offerings - including Monster Energy, Java Monster and Worx Energy among others. Additionally, optimism regarding its alliance with Coca-Cola's bottlers globally, which broadened its distribution network, is aiding growth. Moreover, the company's top line is poised to benefit from the product innovation strategy and regular product launches.Monster Beverage expects the momentum in the energy drinks category to continue in the months ahead, courtesy of gains from Monster Energy, Monster Hydro and Mutant drinks brands. Moreover, additions to the Monster brand are expected to generate incremental sales and boost profitability. This should benefit the company's top line in the fourth quarter.Simultaneously, Monster Beverage's solid international presence and plans for further expansion are working in its favor. Notably, the company expanded international operations into various markets - including China, India, and countries in Africa and the Middle East. Further, product innovation plays a significant role in the company's success. Monster Beverage launched its brands across various countries in the third quarter of 2018. Management remains optimistic about the prospects of its brands and product launches.All these factors should continue to boost the company's top line in the fourth quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the fourth quarter stands at $895.8 million, reflecting an increase of 10.5% year over year.Moreover, the stock has gained 6.7% in the past month against the  's 0.7% decline. This reflects a positive sentiment on the stock ahead of the earnings release.However, higher raw material costs, mainly aluminum, and unfavorable product mix continue to remain hurdles.

With this, the company reported sales beat in six of the last eight quarters. Further, it recorded positive earnings surprise in the preceding 11 quarters.The improvement in earnings can be mainly attributed to strong performances in the company's international divisions, driven by solid revenue growth in developing and emerging markets. Additionally, strong net revenues and operating profit growth at Frito-Lay North America, along with improvement in the North America Beverages segment, aided results.PepsiCo's shares did not show much reaction to strong fourth-quarter results. However, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 1.9% in the past year against the  's 7.1% decline.PepsiCo's fourth-quarter core earnings per share (EPS) of $1.49 were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 13.7% year over year. In constant-currency terms, core earnings improved 17% from the year-ago period. | The company's reported earnings of $4.83 per share improved substantially from loss of 50 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. Foreign exchange translation unfavorably impacted reported EPS by 2 percentage points.Net revenues of $19,524 million were flat with the prior-year quarter but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19,515 million. Notably, revenues included negative impact of 4 percentage points from foreign exchange (Fx), and 1 percentage point from acquisitions and divestitures. Excluding the impacts of Fx, acquisitions, divestitures, structural and other changes, revenues increased 4.6% on an organic basis.This was primarily driven by strength in the majority of the company's businesses - including Frito-Lay  North America, each of the international divisions and North America Beverages. Notably, Latin America; Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA); Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA); North America Beverages (NAB); and Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) segments reported organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter.Total volume was flat in the reported quarter compared with 2% growth witnessed in the third quarter of 2018. While organic snacks/food volume increased 1% (down from 3% growth witnessed in the third quarter), beverage volume was flat (down from 2.5% increase in the third quarter).Reported revenues declined 8% at AMENA, 3% at ESSA, 1% at Latin America and 0.5% at QFNA segments. Meanwhile, net revenues improved 2% at NAB and 4% at FLNA segments. Organic revenues improved 4% at FLNA, 2% at NAB, 10% at Latin America, 7% at ESSSA and 5% at AMENA.

The company plans to continue investing in capabilities that will position it for growth in the future.For 2019, the company anticipates organic revenue growth of 4%, with nearly 1% decline in core constant currency EPS. The decline in EPS is likely to be driven by impacts of incremental investments to strengthen its business in 2019, higher effective tax rate guidance, and lapping of a number of asset sale and refranchising gains that occurred in 2018. Notably, effective tax rate is estimated to be nearly 21% in 2019 compared with 18.8% in 2018.Moreover, the company estimates currency to impact both reported revenues and EPS by nearly 2 percentage points in 2019, based on current rates. Due to the above factors, it anticipates core earnings of $5.50 per share in 2019, reflecting a 3% decline from $5.66 reported in 2018.However, it expects core constant currency EPS to increase high-single digit in 2020.Further, management plans to return $8 billion to shareholders through dividends worth $5 billion and share repurchases worth $3 billion. Free cash flow is estimated at around $5 billion. Operating cash flow is expected to be nearly $9 billion, with net capital spending of $4.5 billion.For the longer term, the company projects organic revenue growth of 4-6%, with core operating margin expansion of 20-30 bps. Further, core constant currency EPS is expected to increase in a high-single digit.Moreover, the company now estimates generating productivity savings of at least $1 billion annually through 2023 (an expansion from the prior target of $1 billion annual savings through 2019). As part of its restructuring actions, it is likely to incur pre-tax charges of nearly $2.5 billion through 2023 (with cash portion of nearly $1.6 billion).Monster Beverage Corporation  , with long-term earnings growth rate of 16%, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Further, PepsiCo's long-standing distribution deal with CytoSport gives it an edge to own and expand this business.The transaction, which awaits the satisfaction of customary conditions, is expected to be sealed in 30 to 60 days. However, the terms of the deal remained under covers.Notably, Hormel's CytoSport business will be the latest in PepsiCo's acquisitions under the 'Performance with Purpose' vision, which encourages health and wellness through cost-effective and environment-friendly beverages.PepsiCo's shares reacted a little to the buyout news. But it has gained 5.9% in the past year against the  's decline of 7.8%.

The company is also focused on broadening the beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to decrease its dependence on colas.

For this, it primarily depends on either innovation or acquisition of new brands.As part of these efforts, the company acquired Health Warrior Inc. in October 2018. Health Warrior makes plant-based products - including nutrition bars and on-trend offerings. This acquisition expands PepsiCo's nutrition portfolio, offering additional options to consumers in the nutrition bar category, which is a growing space.Additionally, the company bought all outstanding shares of SodaStream International Ltd. for a cash outlay of $3.2 billion ($144 per share) in December 2018.

Fourth-quarter results gained from the effective execution of the company's strategies to evolve as a consumer-centric total beverage company.Alongside the introduction of products, the company is focused on lifting and shifting successful brands globally. It also benefited from the acceleration of the sparkling soft drinks category through investment and innovation. However, adverse impacts of currency fluctuation and refranchising of company-owned bottling operations hurt top and bottom lines.Shares of Coca-Cola dropped as much as 4.2% in the pre-market session, owing to a soft outlook for 2019 due to concerns regarding increased impacts of foreign currency. This is likely to reduce organic revenues and earnings in 2019.The company expects increased impacts of adverse currency in the first quarter and 2019. Currency headwinds are likely to hurt comparable revenues by 6-7% and comparable operating income by 10-11% in the first quarter. For the year, foreign currency is likely to affect comparable revenues by 3-4% and operating income by 6-7%.Consequently, the company estimates organic revenues to rise nearly 4% in 2019, lower than 5% increase witnessed in 2018. Comparable earnings are expected to either decline 1% or increase 1% from earnings of $2.08 per share reported in 2018.Nonetheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged 11.1% in the past year against the  's decline of 7%. This is mostly attributed to the company's growth strategies.Coca-Cola's fourth-quarter 2018 comparable earnings were 43 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

This represented the company's 15th consecutive quarterly decline.However, organic revenues grew 5% as concentrate sales improved 1% and price/mix increased 4%. For the sixth straight quarter, organic revenues grew within the company's long-term target.Coca-Cola's total unit case volume remained flat in the fourth quarter as strong growth in Central and Eastern Europe as, well as India, was negated by the challenging economic conditions in some emerging markets, including Argentina and Central America. Price/mix increase of 4% was backed by continued strength in the core business and a 1-point benefit of segment mix from bottling investments.Category Cluster Performance: Sparkling soft drinks unit case volume declined 1% (compared with 2% decrease in the prior quarter). Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages witnessed a 2% decline (compared with 3% decrease in the las  ed quarter).

Organic revenues for North America were flat while it improved 5% for EMEA, and 7% for both Latin America and the Asia Pacific segments. Bottling Investments segment recorded organic revenue growth of 11%.Comparable currency neutral operating income grew 8% on the back of strong organic revenue growth and ongoing benefits from productivity initiatives. Comparable operating margin expanded 13 basis points (bps), given the divestitures of lower-margin bottling businesses and ongoing productivity efforts. The upside was partly offset by the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard and currency headwinds.For 2019, the company estimates organic revenue rise of nearly 4%. Comparable currency neutral revenues are expected to increase 12-13%, aided by 8-9% benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and structural items. However, unfavorable currency is likely to affect revenues by 3-4%.Comparable currency neutral operating income for 2019 is expected to increase 10-11%. Acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes will positively impact operating income by a low-single digit. However, foreign exchange is expected to hurt comparable operating income by 6-7%.The company expects comparable earnings to be down 1% to up 1% from $2.08 recorded in 2018. Underlying effective tax rate is estimate at 19.5%.Moreover, the company expects cash from operations of at least $8 billion in 2019, with capital expenditure of nearly $2 billion.Monster Beverage Corp.  , with long-term earnings growth rate of 16%, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Monster Beverage, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Monster Beverage will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Monster Beverage would pos  of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.50, delivering a surprise of +8.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Monster Beverage doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This marked the company's third straight quarter of positive earnings surprise. Meanwhile, sales missed estimates after two consecutive beats. The top line was impacted by soft volume in the United States and Canada, which also led to a decline in global brand volume.Consequently, shares of Molson Coors declined nearly 5.1% in the  session. However, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 1.3% in the past three months against the  's 3.9% decline.Molson Coors' underlying adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share rose about 35.5% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents. The increase was attributed to positive global net pricing, increase in brand volume and base business performance in Europe and International, optimization of  ing, lower G&A expenses, cost savings, lower interest expenses and reduced income tax expenses. This was partly negated by soft volume and cost inflation in the United States and Canada. | The aforementioned factors, except for lower interest expenses and reduced income tax expenses, also drove the company's underlying EBITDA. Underlying EBITDA was $487.7 million, reflecting an increase of 1.4% from the year-ago period. Further, underlying EBITDA rose 3.9% in constant currency.Net sales declined 6.2% to $2,418.7 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,530 million. The top-line miss can be attributed to lower volume in the United States and Canada, partly negated by higher pricing. On a constant-currency basis, net sales grew 5%.Notably, net sales per hectoliter inched up 0.3% on a reported financial-volume basis. However, net sales per hectoliter on brand-volume basis declined 0.4% in constant currency, owing to unfavorable sales mix across segments. This was partly offset by increased pricing. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, net sales per hectoliter (brand-volume basis) was down 0.3%.Molson Coors' worldwide brand volume declined 1.5% to 22 million hectoliters due to soft volume in the United States and Canada, offset by the strength in Europe and International businesses. Global priority brand volume dipped 1.7% while financial volume declined 6.5% to 21.6 million hectoliters. Financial volume was hurt by volume decline in the United States due to the timing of wholesaler inventories, alongside soft volume in Canada and International. This was partly compensated by volume growth in Europe.The company operates through the following geographical segments. Molson Coors' Canada net sales dipped 8.8% to $322 million. Net sales per hectoliter (brand-volume basis) slipped 0.7% in local currency due to the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard. Further, Canada brand volume fell 2% on account of volume constraints in the West and Ontario, offset by growth in Quebec. Meanwhile, financial volume decreased 5.7%, owing to soft contract manufacturing and brand volume as well as distributor inventory reductions. Underlying EBITDA declined 12% to $64.7 million. Molson Coors now has complete ownership rights to all the brands in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. market. Net sales for the segment decreased 7% to $1,603.8 million. Domestic net sales per hectoliter (on a brand-volume basis), which excludes contract brewing and company-owned-distributor sales, improved 2.7%.Excluding the new revenue accounting standard, net sales per hectoliter (on brand volume) increased 2.1%. The upside stemmed from favorable pricing, which was partly countered by a negative mix.However, U.S. brand volume decreased 5.1%, accountable to soft premium light and economy segment volumes. Sales-to-wholesalers volumes (STWs), excluding contract brewing, declined 8.9% on account of lower brand volume and quarterly timing of wholesaler inventories. Nonetheless, the segment's underlying EBITDA grew 6.4% to $370.1 million. The segmen  ed net sales decline of 1.9% to $464.3 million. Europe net sales per hectoliter (brand-volume basis) fell 2.5% in local currency due to negative pricing, resulting from the adoption of the new excise-tax guidelines in one of the company's European markets and higher investment in First Choice Agenda this year.Europe brand volume rose 3.3%, courtesy of growth in above-premium and core brands. Financial volume increased 3%. Underlying EBITDA declined 7.8% year over year to $80.7 million. Net sales for the segment declined 19.2% to $57.7 million. Net sales per hectoliter, on a brand-volume basis, declined 20.2%, owing to unfavorable sales mix and shifting to local production in Mexico. This was partly negated by positive pricing. Further, International brand volume inched up 1.1%, backed by organic growth in focus markets. The segment's underlying EBITDA was $2.8 million versus $0.4 million in the year-ago period.Molson Coors ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1,058 million and total debt of $10,488 million.

The company boasts an impressive surprise history, having surpassed earnings estimates in the last six quarters and delivering sales beat for the last five quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 43 cents, which reflects an increase of 10.3% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, estimates moved up by a penny in the last 30 days. | Further, the consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $7,055 million, mirroring a year-over-year decline of 6.1%.Notably, Coca-Cola witnessed a year-over-year decline in revenues for the 14 straight quarters. In the las  ed quarter, revenues declined 9% year over year due to adverse impact of the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Coca-Cola remains committed to the productivity and reinvestment program that focuses on initiatives like restructuring the global supply chain, investing in technology to streamline operations, implementing a zero-based budgeting program, headcount reductions and driving efficiency in direct marketing investments. Notably, the company is on track to deliver savings of about $3.8 billion by 2019 through productivity programs.The company's quarterly results persistently gained from ongoing productivity efforts and disciplined growth strategies in the last few quarters. Its strategy of introducing new products, alongside focus on lifting and shifting successful brands globally, is aiding performance. The company's earnings and sales are also benefiting from the acceleration of sparkling soft drinks category through investment and innovation. All these initiatives are expected to drive the top line and profitability in the fourth quarter.Driven by these positives, the Coca-Cola stock showed resilience. The stock has surged 14.3% in the past year against the  's decline of 5.5%.However, Coca-Cola undertook price increases across its system, effective from the third quarter, with a view to address the pressure from higher import and freight costs. Higher tariff on aluminum import is among the many other factors that led to the price increase. Escalating freight costs and increase in other input costs, which is impacting the bottling system and some of the company's finished products, are other factors. While these price increases led to sequential improvements in price/mix in many regions, higher freight and import costs continued to partly offset results.Further, the company expects unfavorable currency to hurt revenues and operating margin in the fourth quarter. Currency headwinds are likely to affect fourth-quarter revenues by 4-5% and comparable operating income by 10-11%. For 2018, the company is expected to witness currency headwinds of 1% and 4%, respectively, on revenues and comparable operating income.Coca-Cola's EMEA division delivered positive results in the last reported quarter, courtesy of solid price/mix and higher unit case volume. Revenues at this segment increased 1% year over year in third-quarter 2018. Further, the company maintained value in total NARTD beverages and gained value share juice, dairy and plant-based beverages cluster.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the EMEA segment's revenues is pegged at $1,643 million, reflecting a decrease of 5.9% year over year and a decline of 16.7% from the last reported quarter.Further, estimates for the segment's operating income is pegged at $755 million, reflecting nearly 1% decline from the prior-year quarter and 19.7% decline from third-quarter 2018.In the Latin America division, Coca-Cola has been gaining from strong performance in Mexico and pricing in Argentina. The segment's revenues improved 11% in the last quarter. Further, the company maintained value in total NARTD beverages and gained value share in all category clusters, except for juice, dairy and plant-based beverages cluster.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment's fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $942 million, mirroring a decline of 15.7% from the prior-year quarter and a decline of 6.1% from the last reported quarter.Further, estimates for the segment's operating income stands at $520 million, down 11.7% year over year and 18.9% sequentially.Coca-Cola delivered robust performance in the North America region. Revenues in the region grew 2% year over year. However, the segment's price/mix was slightly positive as gains from pricing in the market were offset by higher freight costs and business mix. Nevertheless, the consensus mark for revenues stands at $2,964 million, which reflects substantial growth from $1,268 million reported in the year-ago quarter but, represents a decline of 5.2% on a sequential basis.The consensus estimate for the segment's operating income stands at $790 million, up 29.3% year over year and 7.3% sequentially.Revenues at the Asia Pacific segment rose 3% year over year in the third quarter. While price/mix remained flat, volume gains in China and India mainly aided top-line growth. However, the consensus estimate for revenues for the division is pegged at $1,005 million, down 2.3% from fourth-quarter 2017 and 29.4% from third-quarter 2018.Moreover, estimates for the segment's operating income stands at $337 million, up 2.7% from the prior-year quarter but, reflects a sequential decline of 45%.Revenues at the Bottling Investments segment improved 13% in third-quarter 2018. Further, the consensus mark for the division's revenues is expected to be $638 million, down 42.9% year over year and 29.8% sequentially.Despite the odds, we expect the company's strategic efforts - including improved marketing, innovation, strong brand power, focus on driving revenues by improved price/mix and refranchising initiatives - to boost fourth-quarter 2018 results.Our proven model does not show that Coca-Cola is likely to bea  estimates this quarter.

Also, higher trade and promotional investments in the United States along with escalated freight and commodity costs have been hurdles to profitability.Adding to the woes, rising SG&A expenses have been weighing on the company's profitability. In fact, SG&A costs increased 10 basis points (bps) to 14.7% as a percentage of sales in the first quarter. As a result, adjusted EBITDA plunged 36%, while adjusted EBITDA margin shrunk 300 bps to 6.1%.All said, we expect the company to get some respite from Project Terra, which generated cost savings of $60 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Going ahead, the company expects savings of roughly $90-$115 million in fiscal 2019.

Notably, the company divested the non-protein businesses (such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van's) to focus more on the growing protein-packed food arena. Moreover, for fiscal 2019, the USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to rise year over year which also gives us positive signals for the impending quarter.Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding its fresh prepared foods offering to cater to consumers' rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without any added hormones or antibiotics.Also, Tyson Foods has long been focusing on acquisitions to strengthen its portfolio, which remains a tailwind to the company's revenue. The company has completed the buyout of the Keystone Foods business, which supplies a broad array of meat and chicken products across the globe. The move is likely to bolster' international presence, with improved sales as well as distribution network in growth markets. Earlier, Tyson Foods acquired AdvancePierre, Original Philly Holdings, Hillshire as well as Mexican food restaurant chains - Circle Foods and Don Julio Foods.These upsides paint an impressive picture about the company's top line in the quarter to be reported. Markedly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prepared Foods, Beef, Pork and Chicken segment's sales is pegged at $2,386 million, $3,993 million, $1,306 million and $3,019 million, reflecting a 4.1%, 2.8%, 1.8% and 0.7% increase, respectively, from the prior-year quarter's reported sales.Volatile market conditions for chicken and pork is concerning for Tyson Foods. These units have been affected by fluctuations in domestic and export prices of chicken and pork due to uncertainties in trade policies and raised tariffs. Thanks to such factors, the company is struggling to balance demand and supply conditions in the pork category.Additionally, the company is witnessing escalated freight expenses. Notably, higher freight costs are negatively impacting operating income in the Beef, Chicken, Pork and Prepared Foods segments for a while.

We expect the company's nex  to be released on February 27, 2019.With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Going by segments, management expects impressive results at Origination, Oilseeds and Nutrition in 2018.All the aforementioned factors are likely to provide a boost to the company's top and bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.However, softness in the Carbohydrate Solutions segment due to weaker ethanol business and bio-products results is concerning.

For revenues, the consensus mark stands at $1.44 billion, mirroring roughly an 8% decrease from the prior-year quarter.Let's find out how things are shaping up for this announcement.Avon has been witnessing soft Representatives growth over the past few quarters now. In third-quarter 2018, the Active and Ending Representatives fell 5% and 6%, respectively, with decline in both the Representatives across each of the company's segments. Although management is focused on boosting Representatives growth, increased costs toward reviving its direct selling business model are denting margins.Higher cost of investments in Representatives, sales leader and field expenses along with elevated supply-chain costs remain added deterrents. In the las  ed quarter, the new revenue standard had a negative impact on margins. These factors might hurt margins and overall profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.In addition, foreign currency translations continue to adversely impact Avon's performance. In the third quarter, revenues included a 10% negative impact from currency. Unfortunately, management expects the impacts from foreign currency to be similar in the fourth quarter.Further, the consensus estimates for revenues for Europe, Middle East & Africa, South Latin America, North Latin America and Asia Pacific segments, stand at $580 million, $478 million, $197 million and $134 million, respectively. These figures represent a respective decline of 9.7%, 16.9%, 3.9% and 3.6% for the segments on a year-over-year basis.Nevertheless, Avon is focused on accomplishing long-term financial targets for 2021 backed by the \"Open Up Avon\" strategy. This initiative is aimed at bringing Avon back on the growth trajectory by focusing on reviving its direct selling business, renovating the brand, enhancing e-commerce and other capabilities to aid a performance-driven transformation. Additionally, the company remains committed to its cost-saving endeavors to drive margins. Management expects to achieve the targeted run-rate savings of $350 million for 2018.Recently, the company announced plans to improve operating efficiency, slash inventory levels and reduce portfolio complexity. It plans to do so by certain restructuring efforts, including 25% decrease in Stock Keeping Units, 15% reduction in inventory levels and 10% job cuts.Avon has also been making significant improvements in servicing the Representatives by improving delivery and services at its distribution centers.

Further, the company delivered earnings beat in three of the trailing four quarters, with average negative surprise of 2.5%.Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 79 cents, mirroring 27.4% year-over-year growth. Notably, the consensus estimate has been revised downward in the past 30 days. | Let's see how things are shaping prior to the earnings announcement.Though tough industry conditions arising from consumers' changing preferences, aging population and strong competition have been hurting beer volume in the United States, Molson Coors managed to put up strong top and bottom-line performances lately. This strength mainly comes from the focus on cost savings and premiumization of its portfolio.Driven by these positives, the Molson Coors stock has shown resilience lately. The stock surged 5.1% in the last three months, outperforming the  's growth of 0.7%.Molson Coors remains on track to witness continued segment share gains in premium brands; increased volumes in above-premium brands and bring stability to volumes and market share of its below-premium brands. Additionally, Molson Coors' restructuring initiatives to reduce costs and boost profitability bode well.Simultaneously, Molson Coors is well on track with the First Choice plan, which significantly aided performance in the las  ed quarter. The company witnessed higher volume outside North America in third-quarter 2018, mainly owing to the smooth progress of the First Choice strategy. This strategy aims at solidifying and preimmunizing portfolio, enhancing customer relations, and generating significant profits from international businesses through improved capability, productivity and continued cost savings.Notably, Molson Coors' First Choice approach supports its key priorities, including cash generation, margin improvement and enhancing shareholder returns. Apart from this, the company remains focused on disciplined capital allocation, driven by its Profit after Capital Charge or PACC approach.Notably, the company's top line in third-quarter 2018 benefited from favorable global pricing and higher financial volumes in Europe, the United States and Canada, along with favorable mix in Europe.However, softness in the Canada segment was a deterrent. The company's sales in this segment dropped due to lower brand volume, which resulted from volume declines in the west, offset by growth in Ontario and Quebec. Further, higher cost of goods sold (COGS) for the segment due to increased supply chain transformation investments and input cost inflation impacted profitability.For 2018, the company expects COGS per hectoliter to increase in a low-single digit in Canada and Europe segments while it is expected to decline in a low-single digit at the International segment. COGS per hectoliter in the United States are likely to grow in a mid-single digit. The higher COGS are attributed to higher aluminum and freight costs.These hurdles, along with increased tariffs on aluminum imports and beverage exports (due to the U.S.-China trade war), remain a concern for Molson Coors' bottom line. Meanwhile, persistent softness in U.S. beer volumes due to tough industry conditions and adverse currency also remains a concern.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the fourth quarter for the United States, Europe and Canada stands at $1,703 million, $466 million and $326 million, respectively. In the year-ago quarter, sales from these three segments were $1,745 million, $455 million and $346 million, respectively. Notably, the consensus estimate for overall quarterly sales is pegged at $2,530 million, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively predict that Molson Coors is likely to bea  estimates in the fourth quarter.

In 2016, Coca-Cola had acquired 40% equity stake in Chi. As previously planned, the company increased its stake in Chi to 100% after three years.Notably, Chi's diversified beverages fully complement Coca-Cola's existing portfolio and provides it solid opportunities to expand in new categories and strengthen its business in Africa. This is in sync with Coca-Cola's mantra of evolving as a total beverage company. In fact, the latest acquisition perfectly fits in with the company's long-term investment and growth plans for Africa as juices and value-added dairy categories are among the fastest-growing beverage segments in Nigeria and Africa. Investment in leading value-added dairy and juice brands like Hollandia and Chivita, should bolster Coca-Cola's beverage portfolio in Africa, where the company has operations for more than 90 years.The company has been eyeing strong consumer opportunity in Africa as clear from its plans to invest around $17 billion in the continent between 2010 and 2020.Overall, Coca-Cola commands a strong presence in the developing and emerging markets of Latin America, India, Russia and China encouraged by growth opportunities that these countries. Among these, China represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for Coca-Cola, where it is presently investing $4 billion. Markedly, this is an addition to the $9 billion of investments already made in China since 1979.Additionally, Coca-Cola plans to explore opportunities in the $500-billion coffee market, particularly the on-the-go-coffee business with its recent buyout of Costa.

Moreover, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company rallied 7.7% in the past year against the  's decline of 22.4%. Clearly, this alcohol giant is riding on the focus on innovations, achieving growth through buyouts and penetration in emerging markets.On a reported basis, net sales and operating profit moved up 5.8% and 11%, respectively, owing to organic growth, partly negated by unfavorable exchange rates. Top-line growth also included slight negative impacts of the sale of a portfolio of 19 brands to Sazerac in December 2018.Organic sales increased 7.5%, benefiting from broad-based volume and sales growth across all regions, and categories. Notably, organic volume was up 3.5% and positive price mix grew 4%. Volume growth was mainly attributed to gains in India, which contributed about 60% of the total volume growth. Additionally, strong volume gains came from gin and scotch categories. Price/mix was positive across all regions, with particular growth coming from strength in U.S. spirits and scotch.Gross margin expanded nearly 50 basis points (bps) during the first half as negative impacts of inflation in the cost of goods sold (COGS) were more than offset by favorable price/mix and productivity efficiencies. During the first half, the company witnessed inflationary pressures from commodity costs, including Agave, cereals, utilities and glass. Furthermore, higher transportation costs in the United States offset gross margin gains.Improved price/mix and efficiencies from the productivity program aided organic operating profit, which grew 12.3%, higher than top-line growth. Notably, impacts of cost inflation and higher marketing expenses were fully offset by aforementioned positives. Further, organic operating margin expanded 152 bps, driven by phasing benefits.Diageo continues to generate solid cash flows, with net cash from operating activities of \u00a31.6 billion improving year over year. Furthermore, the company reported strong free cash flow of about \u00a31.3 billion, up \u00a3317 million from the last year.Diageo remains committed to its disciplined approach to capital allocation, primarily to enhance shareholder value. In sync with that, the company returned \u00a31.3 billion to shareholders in the first half of fiscal 2019 through share repurchases.Backed by strong free cash flow, the company approved additional share buybacks worth \u00a3660 million under its existing share-buyback program. As a result, it will now repurchase shares worth up to \u00a33 billion for the year ending on 30 Jun, 2019. It also increased interim dividend by 5%.Diageo expects synergies from productivity initiatives to persist in fiscal 2019. The company anticipates net sales growth in the second half of fiscal 2019 to be lower than the first half. However, it now expects organic net sales for fiscal 2019 to be at the high-end of its prior guidance of mid-single-digit growth. Based on current rates, the company expects currency headwinds to significantly impact net sales by \u00a380 million and operating profit by \u00a310 million.The company expects inflationary cost pressures from commodity and transportation to continue in the second half of fiscal 2019. This should continue to slightly weigh on the gross margin. Further, it expects operating margin growth to be muted in the second half, owing to the phasing of productivity costs and marketing expenses.Nonetheless, the company expects to deliver on its targeted operating margin expansion of 175 bps for the three years ending on Jun 30, 2019.Some better-ranked stocks in the consumer staples sector are Ambev S.A.  , Coca-Cola European Partners PLC  and Monster Beverage Corporation  , each currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, travel retail sales continued to accelerate backed by broad-based growth across countries and brands. Currently, the channel is benefiting from unique product range, impressive marketing strategies and higher conversions through better customer insights.We also note that strategic buyouts undertaken by the company have been playing key role in enhancing the company's top-line performance. The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced have strengthened the company's fastest growing prestige portfolio. The investment in DECIEM, a fast-growing multi-brand company, is likely to aid beauty sales. Apart from skin care, Estee Lauder has acquired high-end fragrance and lifestyle brands.Additionally, Estee Lauder has a strong online presence and expects it to continue in the quarters ahead. The company has successfully expanded its online business footprint in about 40 countries. It plans to continue boosting sales in this channel by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.Certainly, rising demand for skincare products, which account for a significant chunk of sales, is an added positive. The company is also poised to gain from strength in the haircare category along with improved trends in the makeup and fragrance businesses.Markedly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Skin Care, Makeup, Fragrance and Hair Care segment's net sales is pegged at $1,624 million, $1,567 million, $570 million and $146 million, up 8.7%, 3.4%, 0.9% and 1.4%, respectively, from the prior-year quarter.While these tailwinds raise optimism, Estee Lauder is consistently coping up with changing consumer preferences. Along with this the availability of cheaper alternatives gives rise to stiff competition. Going ahead, the company expects prestige beauty growth to moderate in China, especially in the second half of the fiscal year.Nevertheless, management expects continued opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is currently anticipated to grow 5-6% in fiscal 2019. Also, the company is on track with the implementation of the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, directed toward efficient management of costs and operations.

Source: ShutterstockBack in October, I recommended  .Admittedly, I made this call one month early. Legal status in Canada became a \"sell the news\" event for any stock involved with cannabis.NBEV lost more than half of its value over the next month.Since mid-November, NBEV has more than doubled in value. In that time, interest in the market has risen.  (NYSE:  ) has partnered with  (NASDAQ:  ) to research cannabis drinks. The U.S. has also legalized hemp. This allows New Age to sell CBD-infused beverages in all 50 states.As the maker of Aspen Pure, Xing Energy, and Bucha Live Kombucha, it would not make for a particularly exciting stock. However, its Marley+CBD Mellow Mood brand could become a game changer.This CBD-infused drink will first become available in four states with legalized cannabis. Now, success in those states could lead to its availability nationwide soon. Moreover, its CFO Gregory Gould comes in with a biotech and life sciences background. Such knowledge gives NBEV a leg up in bringing CBD-infused products to market.Infused beverages have seen a mixed history. As my colleague  ,  (NYSE:  ) got its start in infused beverages as it contained cocaine for a brief part of its history.Also, as our own  , NBEV could follow the path of  (NASDAQ:  ). This company, formerly known as Hansen's Natural Corporation, changed its name due to the success of its energy drink.Still, for every Monster Beverage-type success, we see multiple stories comparable to that of  (OTCMKTS:  ). Their use of unique flavors dazzled the market for a time, but an attempted move into the canned soda market pushed it back into obscurity.So this begs the question of whether NBEV will follow the path of MNST or JSDA? The short answer is \"we do not know.\" This leaves NBEV in the realm of speculation.Still, I think the speculation lies in company execution more than in its product. The Tilray-InBev alliance focuses on research. Also, the investment by  (NYSE:  ) in  (NYSE:  ) has not yet brought a CBD-infused beverage to market. Hence, NBEV appears poised to take the first-mover advantage.This could help establish a moat, at least from a brand perspective.Investors should also remember that even though Monster's lead product holds a smaller market share than Red Bull, MNST still became a $30-plus billion company. With New Age's new product, the $510 million NBEV could become the Monster or Red Bull of CBD-infused drinks.Still, these beverages have now become legal nationwide. Hence, it will have to get its product out to the 50 states and beyond quickly. It will also have to build a loyal customer base that will remain as peers roll out competing products.We do not yet know which companies will lead the way in this market. Also, whether consumers show a sustained interest in CBD-infused drinks remains unknown. However, if New Age Beverage stock can make itself the investment name in CBD-infused beverages, it could enjoy a bright future.Although speculative, CBD-infused drinks could become the product that sends NBEV stock higher in the years to come. Thanks to hemp legalization, New Age can now offer CBD-infused products across the country.NBEV stock has risen in recent weeks following hemp achieving legal status. However, with this industry in its infancy, it remains unclear whether New Age Beverage stock will become the Monster Beverage of CBD-infused drinks.New Age has a new product and a leadership team with experience in a related industry. However, it must move quickly to have any hope of establishing a brand moat before competitors enter the market.Still, if one holds some speculative cash and believes in the management team, they might see huge gains over the next few years by buying NBEV stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is progressing well with its 'Open Up' Avon strategy.

It plans to do so by certain restructuring efforts, including 25% decrease in Stock Keeping Units (SKU), 15% reduction in inventory levels and 10% job cuts.As part of its efforts to reduce inventory and SKUs, the company expects to record one-time inventory obsolescence expenses of nearly $88 million. This, in turn, will help the company to simplify operations and improve cost savings by reducing raw material and buying expenses. This should facilitate enhanced focus on products with higher turnover and better margins, resulting in improved income levels for Representatives.Simultaneously, the company intends to align its workforce with the changes in operating model and its objective of creating a leaner organization. This calls for a 10% reduction in its global headcount. Avon expects to complete the headcount reduction and other actions by 2019 end. It should be noted that 10% job cuts stated above are in addition to the 8% reduction in global workforce carried out in 2018.The recent jobs cuts are estimated to fetch Avon annualized pre-tax savings of nearly $97 million by 2019 end. However, the aforementioned actions are likely to attract total charges of about $100 million before tax. These charges will be an addition to the nearly $51 million charges expected to be recorded as part of the actions approved under the 'Open Up' Avon strategy so far.Notably, the 'Open Up' Avon strategy is focused on bringing Avon back on the growth trajectory by reviving its direct selling business, renovating the brand, enhancing e-commerce and other capabilities. By 2021, management expects to generate total cost savings of $400 million through this strategy backed by optimization of manufacturing and distribution; outsourcing efficiencies; zero-based redesigning of back-office functions; and managing revenues, interest and tax. Additionally, it expects to plough in roughly $300 million in commercial, digital & IT infrastructure projects. Avon expects to achieve revenue growth in a low-single digit and margins in low-double digits by 2021.Backed by the company's efforts to spring back to growth with the 'Open Up' Avon strategy, it has gained 36% in the past six months against the  's 8.8% decline.However, the company still carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on account of the sluggish Representatives growth, which has been hurting its quarterly performance. Further, the company is plagued with higher supply chain and raw material costs as well as increasing investment costs to replenish Representatives. Though management remains on track to reboot its direct selling model, higher cost of investments toward Representatives growth might continue to impact near-term profitability.Monster Beverage Corporation  has long-term earnings growth rate of 16% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Overall, the reporting cycle has so far been soft with sluggish earnings and sales of companies apart from a handful of positive surprises.On the earnings front, we would focus on the Zacks  industry, which supplies non-alcoholic beverages like sparkling soft drinks, juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks besides dairy and plant-based beverages to the market.A key concern for players in the soft drinks industry has been the growing consumer preference for health drinks and the consequent boycott of carbonated drinks. This has entailed grave consequences for makers of carbonated drinks, who are witnessing a sharp decline in revenues and profits. Many players have reinvented their portfolios to include more health drinks and other variations for overcoming this descent. However, we still believe that the revenue streams of companies in this space will persistently be affected by the soft carbonated drinks category during the fourth quarter.Further, these companies will continue to struggle with escalated raw material and transportation costs, much like others in the broader  sector. These cost elevations along with the impacts of trade-war tensions between the United States and China as well as stiff competition are likely to weigh on the top lines and margins of soft drinks makers in the fourth quarter.These trends have spelt doom for stocks in the soft drinks industry. Consequently, the stocks have collectively dropped 15.9% in the past year, significantly wider than the S&P 500 index's decrease of 5.5%. However, the industry has fared better than the broader sector's fall of 19.4%. Further, the industry is placed among the bottom 22% of the 256 Zacks industries.Nonetheless, we expect these companies to capitalize on synergies drawn from the ongoing efforts to boost productivity, product launches and an accelerated focus on the sparkling soft drinks category alongside investments and innovation. These endeavors should go a long way in helping these companies regain the lost market share and also drive volumes, which should cushion the revenue base in the upcoming quarterly results. Further, the industry participants are likely to gain traction from a strong footing outside the United States, particularly the developing and the emerging markets. Additionally, cost-containment measures and the discontinuation of troubled brands are expected to aid margins and provide sufficient support to the companies' bottom lines.The soft drinks industry, which is part of the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, might bear the brunt of the aforementioned headwinds. However, we are hopeful that the players' initiatives will somewhat offset these shortcomings. Per the latest  , the Consumer Staples sector's aggregate fourth-quarter EPS is projected to increase 4.9% with revenues anticipated to witness 1.8% growth.Despite the odds, it is not wise to fully shy away from investing in the industry. There are a few positive trends in the industry that promise strong earnings growth in the quarters ahead.To that end, we bring you three stocks from the Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry, which may show potential based on a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive  .

Moreover, the company's expected long-term earnings growth rate of 16% suggests a positive earnings momentum in the upcoming quarters.Despite the overall softness in the beverage industry, Monster Beverage displayed strong momentum in the energy drinks category, with a wide range of brands - including Monster Energy, Java Monster and Worx Energy among others. The addition of Coca-Cola's energy drink brands to the company's portfolio strengthened its position in the global energy drinks market. In the third quarter of 2018, the company fully transitioned Monster Energy brand from the Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV  distributors to Coca-Cola bottlers in the United States.Furthermore, the company extended the distribution of Monster Energy to 40 major cities in India. The company expects the momentum in the energy drinks category to continue in the months ahead, courtesy of gains from Monster Energy, Monster Hydro and Mutant drinks brands. Moreover, additions to the Monster brand are expected to generate incremental sales and boost profitability.Simultaneously, Monster Beverage's solid international presence and plans for further expansion are working in its favor. Notably, the company expanded international operations into various markets - including China, India, and countries in Africa and the Middle East. Net sales to customers outside the United States were up 8.8% in the third quarter of 2018.All these factors, clubbed with the company's product innovation strategy, proved advantageous as in the beverage industry there is a consistent demand for new products that are tasty and healthy. Monster Beverage regularly introduces new flavors of existing products while removing non-performing products. Management remains optimistic about the prospects of its brands and product launches. These are likely to drive top-line growth and increase overall profitability.Moreover, analysts became increasingly bullish on the Monster Beverage stock in the recent months, owing to the robust surprise trend. The company reported positive earnings surprise in the preceding two quarters, with sales reverting to a positive trend in third-quarter 2018, after three consecutive misses. The top line benefited from solid sales at the Monster Energy Drinks segment and advance purchases made by customers due to a pre-announced price hike.You may consider another top-ranked stock in the Consumer Staples sector, Archer Daniels Midland Company  .

The company is witnessing momentum, owing to its strong fundamentals, continuous innovation and focus on expansion. These factors are likely to aid the company's earnings for the first half of fiscal 2019.Notably, this alcoholic beverage company, which reports on a half-yearly basis, posted strong results for fiscal 2018. It recorded earnings growth of 9.3% in fiscal 2018, with 0.9% improvement in sales.Diageo explores opportunities to expand geographically through acquisitions. This, along with innovation efforts, fueled Diageo's results in fiscal 2018, wherein both sales and earnings improved year over year. While the bottom line gained from higher organic operating profit and reduced finance costs, the top line was driven by broad-based growth across all regions and categories, except for vodka.Moreover, the company is witnessing improved operating margins, thanks to increased productivity savings in overheads and lower related costs. It expects synergies from productivity initiatives to continue in fiscal 2019 as well. Driven by the company's productivity program, Diageo expects to deliver on its targeted operating margin expansion of 175 basis points for the three years ending Jun 30, 2019. Furthermore, it expects organic net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range for fiscal 2019.Additionally, the company's strong results reflect its strategy of exploring opportunities to expand through acquisitions. It is focused on penetrating the emerging markets of Africa, Latin America and Asia, and bolstering presence by catering to the local tastes of these regions. This is significantly aiding volume growth for the company, resulting in the robust top line.Backed by these positives, Diageo stock has outpaced the industry in the past three months. Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock gained 4.6% against the  's decline of 2.2%.However, exchange rate fluctuations remain a cause of concern for the company. Fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar, Turkish lira and other emerging market currencies mostly marred its sales and operating profit in fiscal 2018. Based on current rates, the company expects currency headwinds to impact net sales and operating profit in fiscal 2019 by nearly \u00a370 million and \u00a310 million, respectively.Some better-ranked stocks are Archer Daniels Midland Company  , currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Ambev S.A.  and Monster Beverage Corporation  , carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

A glimpse of the company's earnings performance shows that it delivered positive surprise in the trailing eight quarters. It recorded average positive earnings surprise of 3.3% in the last four quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the fiscal second quarter is pegged at $1.32, which reflects growth of 7.3% year over year. Earnings estimates remained unchanged in the last 30 days. Let's see how things are shaping prior to the earnings announcement. | Clorox has been gaining from solid growth initiatives - including 2020 Strategy, Go Lean Strategy, enhancement of e-commerce business and disciplined capital allocation. The company's 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at improving categories and boosting overall market share, is well on track. This strategy targets net sales growth of 3-5%, increasing EBIT margin by 25-50 basis points (bps) and generating free cash flow of 10-12% of sales, all on a yearly basis.Further, the company's Go Lean Strategy is likely to boost margins through operational efficiencies. Moreover, it remains committed to investing in product and brand differentiation in order to safeguard value proposition. Additionally, Clorox's focus on solid investments in demand building through digital marketing, e-commerce and product innovation pipeline is encouraging.Notably, these actions have been aiding the company's quarterly results, which is clear from the robust surprise trend over the past few quarters. Furthermore, it delivered sales beat in four of the trailing six quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fiscal second quarter is $1.48 billion, mirroring a 4.4% increase from the year-ago quarter.Backed by these positives, shares of Clorox have rallied 9.7% in the past six months, outperforming the  's 4.8% growth.Despite gains from cost-saving and productivity initiatives, the company continues to witness significant pressure on gross margin, owing to elevated commodity, manufacturing and logistics expenses. This remains a major concern in the to-be-reported quarter as clear from its guidance. Though management expects gross margin expansion in the second half of fiscal 2019, gross margin is likely to remain soft in the first half, owing to higher costs.For fiscal 2019, the company estimates gross margin to be flat as gains from higher prices and cost-savings efforts are expected to be offset by increased costs, and adverse foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, the company lowered earnings projections for fiscal 2019 due to expectations of making fewer share repurchases in fiscal 2019 than nearly 50% of the $2-billion share repurchase authorization mentioned earlier. Adverse impacts from foreign currency and higher costs also hurt the earnings forecast.Consequently, management anticipates earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.20-$6.40 in fiscal 2019.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Clorox is likely to bea  estimates in second-quarter fiscal 2019.

Since then, we've successfully sold one covered call on MNST. Now, we'd like to do it again.MNST jumped up yesterday on positive news. If we sell calls at this point, we can collect premium that can be rolled out again if the stock drops back to a more moderate level.Back in November, news of a dispute between the  (NYSE:  ) and MNST overshadowed MNST's strong third-quarter earnings. KO acts as MNST's distributor, and KO announced it was launching its own energy drink in 2019.That news led to speculation about the health of the two companies' partnership, and the companies are heading into arbitration to determine whether KO has violated their agreement with MNST.The stock jumped yesterday after Suntrust analysts upgraded MNST from \"hold\" to \"buy.\" They believe, as we do, that concerns about the KO deal have led to the stock being oversold.Our argument is that it makes much more sense for KO to see MNST as an acquisition target this year than it does to compete with energy drinks of their own. A merger like that has accretive value and it avoids the legal liability that KO is flirting with right now.However, to be clear we don't expect an acquisition to occur in the short-term, and yesterday's rally may be partially due to a short squeeze.If we look at the chart below, we see that MNST struggled in December. We think the probability for a recession or continued bear market in the 1st or 2nd quarter this year is very low. However, we don't think the market will continue higher without one or two more interruptions this month. There is too much uncertainty.MNST may be up after the upgrade from analysts, but back in November, analysts were sure the dispute between KO and MNST would cause trouble for the stock. MNST rose steadily into early December before selling off along with the rest of the market.We think continuing to collect premium against our long MNST position now that it has gapped up is a good strategy.

However, some dividend aristocrats are better long-term investments than others -- since they might have more sustainable business models, wider moats, and healthier cash flows. Let's take a look at three dividend aristocrats investors can consider holding forever --  (NYSE: KO) ,  (NASDAQ: PEP) , and  (NYSE: ENB) .Image source: Getty Images. Coca-Cola might not be considered a great \"forever\" investment, since health-conscious consumers are shunning its flagship sodas across the world. Soda consumption in the US, for example, recently fell to its lowest point in over  . However, Coca-Cola expanded its beverage portfolio well beyond its flagship sodas to counter that shift.The company now sells a wide range of juices, teas, energy drinks, bottled water, and other noncarbonated beverages. It owns a major stake in energy drink maker  (NASDAQ: MNST) , and it recently acquired UK coffee chain Costa Coffee. It has also launched low-calorie and zero-calorie versions of its sodas, and repackaged them in smaller cans and bottles.That's why Coca-Cola still expects its organic sales to rise at least 4% this year and its adjusted earnings to grow up to 10%. It currently pays a forward dividend yield of 3.3%, and it's hiked that payout annually for 55 straight years.Coca-Cola's earnings and free cash flow-based payout ratios both exceeded 100% over the past 12 months, but those figures were distorted by the refranchising of its bottling operations, asset impairment charges, restructuring costs, investments, and other one-time charges. Excluding those charges brings its payout ratios back below 100% -- which indicates that Coca-Cola won't lose its \"aristocrat\" title anytime soon. Consumer goods stocks are a great place to look for dividend winners, and as Leo notes with his pick of Coca-Cola, beverage companies in particular have fared quite well. But I'm coming out on the other side of the Pepsi Challenge with my pick, because despite having a slightly smaller drinks business, PepsiCo has the power of diversification on its side.PepsiCo makes a lot more than just its namesake cola. The company's Frito-Lay division is a giant in the food industry, producing potato chips, pretzels, and countless other snacks. Under previous CEO Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo embraced the trend toward healthier food early on, allowing it to get a competitive advantage over Coca-Cola on the beverage side of the business while pivoting its snack offerings to cater to health-conscious consumers. Now  will have a chance to put his distinctive mark on PepsiCo's business, and it'll be interesting to see what if any differences in strategic vision emerge.For dividend investors, though, PepsiCo has plenty of credibility. For 46 straight years, the beverage and snack company has delivered increased dividends, including its most recent 15% payout boost back in June. The stock's yield of 3.4% just edges out Coca-Cola, and shares have held up quite well in the recent market downturn. For those seeking a long-term play on much-loved consumer products, PepsiCo makes a great stock investors can comfortably hold for the long run. Canadian energy infrastructure giant Enbridge isn't yet a dividend aristocrat since it has increased its payout for  24 consecutive years. However, the company recently  , including plans for another dividend increase next year. Further, the pipeline company provided an initial glimpse at its longer-term view, which suggests it should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its dividend.Enbridge's latest dividend increase was 10%, which is its targeted raise for next year as well. The company can fully support that payout since it's on pace to grow its cash flow per share at that same rate. Further, with 98% of its cash flow supported by stable sources like long-term contracts, and a conservative payout ratio of less than 65% to go along with a strong investment-grade balance sheet, Enbridge's dividend is on rock-solid ground.Meanwhile, Enbridge stated that it expects to grow its cash flow at a 5% to 7% annual rate post-2020 while maintaining an ultraconservative financial profile. Driving that growth are the expansion projects the company recently secured as well as those it has in development. Enbridge should have no shortage of opportunities beyond those it has already identified, given that the North American energy industry needs to invest more than  in building new  infrastructure through 2035. These future expansions should give Enbridge the funds to continue increasing its dividend for years to come.With a long history of sending more money to investors, a sound financial profile, and ample fuel to keep growing, Enbridge is an ideal dividend stock to buy and hold for the long haul.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, we note that the Zacks  sector has been somewhat troubled over the past year, by hurdles like elevated input and freight costs along with intense competition.Unfortunately, a lot of consumer staples companies, including food, beverage, cosmetic and cleaning material companies, have been grappling with escalated commodity and transportation costs. Also, several players are facing heightened competition, which has created significant pricing pressure, compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. All these factors have kept margins of many consumer staples companies under pressure for a while now.Owing to these hurdles and tariff-related risks stemming from trade war with China, the consumer staples sector has tumbled 14.1% in a year compared with the S&P 500's drop of 5%. Further, the sector is placed among the bottom 32% out of the 16 Zacks sectors. Nevertheless, the Zacks Consumer Staples sector is anticipated to witness bottom-line growth of 0.3% this season, while the top line is expected to increase 0.9%, per the latest  . Certainly, the space that is popular as the defensive zone among investors is not devoid of bright spots.Despite the aforementioned barriers, there are many players in this space that appear lucrative this season, thanks to their efforts to counter the odds. Notably, companies have been trying all means to stay firm on the back of solid pricing initiatives, focus on innovation, product launches and diversification. Also, prudent takeovers, divestitures and alliances have helped many companies refine their portfolio. These positives along with stringent cost-containment and productivity enhancement efforts do paint a bright picture for some consumer staples players amid the otherwise not so rosy landscape.On that note, we used the Zacks methodology and identified consumer staples stocks that are poised to bea  estimates this reporting cycle.

Though tough industry conditions - owing to consumers' changing preferences, aging population and strong competition - have been hurting beer volume in the United States, the company has managed to put up strong top and bottom-line performances. This strength mainly comes from its focus on cost savings and premiumization of its portfolio.While the Molson Coors stock dipped 8.4% in the last three months, it significantly outperformed the  's decline of 15.7%. The soft industry performance clearly reflects the ongoing turmoil in the alcohol space due to consumers shifting to healthy drinks and wines, which is particularly hitting the beer makers hard. Amid such backdrop, Molson Coors' recent performance surely reflects its ability to steer through this turmoil.Let's get a closer look at the factors that position Molson Coors for a strong year ahead.Molson Coors is one of the largest brewers in the world and boasts a strong portfolio of well-established brands. As already mentioned, the company's focus on premiumization and cost savings has been significantly aiding its performance. In fact, it remains committed to growing its market share through innovation and premiumization.In the third quarter of 2018, Molson Coors' above-premium brands portfolio constituted about 21% of its total portfolio. Further, the above-premium brands rose 3.6% in the quarter, driven by its craft brands, Peroni and Sol in particular, along with Arnold Palmer Spiked and Henry's Hard Sparkling.Further, management has long been focused on gaining share in the Premium Light segment in the United States through Coors Light and Miller Lite brands as the demand for premium beer is growing. Notably, it witnessed improved trends on a sequential basis in Premium Light, primarily backed by robust performance of Miller Lite. Molson Coors remains on track to witness continued segment share gains in premium brands, increase in volume in above-premium brands, and bring stability to its below-premium brands' volumes and market share.Additionally, the company's restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability bode well. These included closure of underperforming breweries, improving efficiencies in finance, administration and human resources, and reducing labor and general overhead costs. These cost-saving efforts are likely to help the company expand EBITDA margin by offsetting higher commodity inflation costs.The company is also focused on initiatives to improve its supply-chain network and build on efficiencies across the business to generate additional resources to invest in brand building and innovation. This, along with its First Choice plan, should significantly aid performance. The First Choice strategy aims at solidifying and preimmunizing portfolio, enhancing customer relations, and generating significant profits from international businesses through improved capability, productivity and continued cost savings.In sync with its growth strategy and commitment of being the First Choice for consumers, the company formed a joint venture (JV) with leading Canadian cannabis producer, The Hydropothecary Corporation (\"HEXO\"), which was announced in August 2018. The JV, known as Truss, will operate as a standalone company, exploring opportunities in the highly anticipated consumable cannabis market, which is expected to be legalized in Canada in 2019.We believe the aforementioned strategies and actions, including its cannabis JV, position Molson Coors for further growth in 2019.

Additionally, the company's promising outlook for 2018, and its strategy of making partnerships and acquisitions indicate that the stock should retain the ongoing momentum in the coming days.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company increased 7.1% in the last three months, outperforming the  's decline of 6.4%. However, lower realized prices due to pricing actions initiated in the third quarter and unfavorable currency remain headwinds. The company is also not immune to the CSD category headwinds.Here are some factors indicating that Keurig Dr Pepper has the potential for growth despite these headwinds.Keurig Dr Pepper's top and bottom lines improved year over year while earnings beat estimates in the third quarter of 2018. The top line gained from robust volume/mix and significant market share gains across major categories while operating income growth and lower taxes benefited the bottom line. Notably, the company reported significant market share gains for the CSD portfolio, including Dr Pepper and Canada Dry as well as the coffee portfolio.Further, the company expanded its coffee portfolio on the back of unit growth for single-serve pod category as well as improved market share for pods produced by Keurig Dr Pepper.For 2018, Keurig Dr Pepper continues to anticipate adjusted earnings per share of $1.02-$1.07. Net sales for the year are expected to increase 1-2%, with operating income growth of 7-8%.For the long term, it expects to generate deal synergies of nearly $600 million between 2019 and 2021, with about $200 million savings anticipated every year. It also expects to deliver average annualized adjusted pro forma EPS growth rate of 15-17% between 2018 and 2021. Additionally, the company expects significant cash flow generation and rapid deleveraging, targeting leverage ratio of less than 3.0 in two to three years.Focus on partnerships and acquisitions remains Keurig Dr Pepper's key growth strategy. Since the completion of the merger, the company acquired Big Red and agreed to acquire CORE Hydration, adding these two partner brands to its owned portfolio. It also added Forto Coffee Energy Shots as a new partner and expanded distribution terms with Peet's for ready-to-drink Iced Expresso. It will distribute Forto throughout its network and Peet's, primarily through its network of convenience stores.Additionally, the company recently signed a long-term agreement to sell, distribute and merchandise the Evian brand across the United States. It also added the iconic Canadian coffee brand, Tim Horton's, and the U.S.-based bakery-cafe brand Panera as Keurig partners. Furthermore, Keurig Dr Pepper exited FIJI Water and BODYARMOR drink brands as part of the recent reorganization of its allied brands. Consequently, the company currently has over 75 owned, licensed and partnered brands in the Keurig system.Though Keurig Dr Pepper's strong quarter and strategy look good, lower realized prices and unfavorable currency offset gains from improved volume/mix for the Coffee Systems segment. Pricing actions initiated in the third quarter could not fully offset higher input costs and logistics. Notably, pricing continued to be moderate significantly on a sequential basis mainly due to strategic pod pricing investment.Further, the company is not immune to the industry headwinds related to the CSD category and higher input costs, particularly for aluminum cans. Moreover, rising raw material costs, specifically aluminum, has been hurting its performance.While the near-term headwinds may persist, Keurig Dr Pepper is well positioned for growth backed by the aforementioned strategy. Further, the company's impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 17.1% supports our view.Some better-ranked stocks are Monster Beverage Corp.  , Archer Daniels Midland Company  , and Church & Dwight Co., Inc.  , each currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Monster Beverage delivered average positive earnings surprise of 1.4% in the trailing four quarters. The company has long-term earnings growth rate of 16%.Archer Daniels delivered average positive earnings surprise of 26.9% in the last four quarters. Further, the stock has rallied 8.2% year to date.Church & Dwight stock grew nearly 30.5% year to date.

If not for Sacks' determination to push into the energy drink space, one of the most successful non-alcoholic drink categories of all time, energy drinks might not be nearly as popular as they are today.In 2003, the first full year of Monster beverage sales, it sold $50 million in energy drinks, which accounted for  .Zero to 36% of sales in 21 months. That's got to be a record.Like Hansen's, New Age has an extensive portfolio of beverage brands, none of them taking off, with total revenues of  through the first nine months of fiscal 2018, 6.6% lower than a year earlier.The company, needing to get bigger in a hurry, and lacking an explosive-growth product like Monster to wow retailers, went the merger route instead, paying $75 million in cash and issuing $10 million in restricted stock to buy Morinda.It's a smart play to keep the stock rolling higher.However, the company has way too many brands to succeed long term. It's got to find one or two that can scale on a global basis and stick with those; selling the rest.To me, its CBD drinks have the most potential. Indeed, the positive reaction by investors to the  (NASDAQ:  ) partnership with  (NYSE:  ) would suggest this to be the case.Launched in October at the North American Convenience Store Show in Las Vegas by the company's Health Sciences division, the demand for these products is likely to be significant.The big question mark is whether it can execute a successful rollout of the products. Morinda's experience will help.\"We intend to provide a full portfolio of offerings in this emerging growth segment, and expect the range of choices for retailers, distributors and consumers best position New Age to be the leader and authority in the sector,\" said New Age senior vice president of sales, Michael Cunningham.I see a ton of similarities between New Age and Monster.That said, a lot has to go right for New Age to move from Monster-wannabe to the real deal. It's also important to remember that the drinks won't have THC in them so the novelty or desire to try won't be nearly as great.New Age will have to spend a significant amount on marketing and distribution which suggest profitability might be sacrificed in the short-term to ensure the successful rollout.As small-cap stocks go, I like it, but don't use your retirement funds at this point in the game if you do buy.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n the current bearish markets, investors often try to undertake complex investment strategies to generate solid returns. But this may not yield desired results all the time. So, using conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals to select stocks, is a safe and sound approach for making profits.One such strategy is sales growth. Often overlooked by investors in favor of earnings, steady sales growth is vital for survival of business. While earnings are vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily manipulated and inflated, there are very less chances of inflating sales numbers.The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage, as strong sales generally get converted into growth. Flat or declining sales growth indicates obstacles and offers limited scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit, but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without impressive sales growth, bottom-line improvement will not be sustainable over the long term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires strong sales growth.Nonetheless, sales growth in isolation doesn't indicate much about a company's future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits.Hence, taking into consideration a company's cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected  and  as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company's revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales. Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price. Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs - an optimal situation for it. This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.

And its name is  (NASDAQ: MNST) .Shares of the Monster Energy drinks purveyor got rocked with a 6.5% sell-off Thursday after UBS announced it was initiating coverage of Monster Beverage stock with a \"sell\" rating and a $48 price target.A new stock report from UBS is giving Monster investors nightmares. Image source: Getty Images.Monster Beverage stock cost more than $57 before UBS's report came out, so what the report basically amounted to was a prediction that Monster stock was likely to lose 16% of its value over the next 12 months. That was a frightening thought for shareholders, made more frightening still, perhaps, by the knowledge that  among the top 10% of analysts we track here at Motley Fool CAPS.Why does UBS hate Monster so much? The analyst's \"sell\" rating cites overvaluation as a primary rationale -- Monster stock costs 32 times earnings right now, even after today's sell-off. That's a high price to pay given that most analysts agree the stock won't grow earnings any faster than 17% annually over the next five years. Worse, UBS says it thinks Monster will suffer a \"meaningful\" deceleration in growth sooner rather than later.I don't know if I agree with that last bit. According to data from  , Monster Beverage actually boasts pretty strong quality of earnings, with trailing free cash flow of $953 million almost precisely matching trailing reported net income of $955 million. That doesn't seem to foreshadow an earnings decline to me. That being said, even if Monster grows fully as fast as most of Wall Street is expecting it to, 32 times earnings is still an awful lot to pay for 17% growth.For price-averse investors looking for a reason to cash out of Monster, UBS just gave them a fine excuse to do so.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.  , Monster Beverage Corp.  ,Blue Apron Holdings Inc.  , Calyxt Inc.  and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings Inc.  .Wall Street has witnessed a sharp decline in the second half of 2018 as a result of intensifying market turmoil. The broad-based market decline can be attributed to lingering tariff related conflicts with China, plummeting crude  , several geopolitical problems and yield curve inversion of sovereign bonds.The negative sentiment has dented investor confidence to such an extent that strong consumer spending and labor market data have failed to instill optimism. At this juncture, it will be prudent to invest in stocks from defensive industries like consumer staples with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential.U.S. stocks have had a rough run so far in 2018 after providing fabulous returns in 2017. Out of three major stock market indexes, the Dow 30 and S&P 500 are currently in the negative territory with a decline of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively, year to date. Only the Nasdaq Composite has gained 2.4% so far in 2018.However, in the second half of 2018, the performances of these three indexes have been more disappointing. The Dow 30, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite declined 2.3%, 4.7% and 8.9%, respectively, erasing the gains of the first half of 2018.An amicable solution to the trade related conflict between the United States-China following the Dec 1 meeting between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping is yet to come by.However, confusion has increased around China's intentions of taking adequate measures to stop technology theft from the United States. Uncertainty also persists about the extent to which it will open up markets to U.S. companies and provide concessions to reduce trade imbalance between the two countries. Moreover, on Dec 9, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said that he considers Mar 1 \"a hard deadline\" to reach a deal with China, failing which, the tariff war is likely to go on.The consumer staples sector includes companies that provide necessities and products used in daily lives, which make them defensive in nature. With the companies providing necessary products, the consumer staples industry has always been the go-to place for investors who want to play it safe during extreme market fluctuations.Consequently, adding stocks from the consumer staples basket usually lends more stability to portfolios in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector remains a lucrative space for income-seeking investors given its strong dividend yield.In the third quarter of 2018, all consumer staple companies within the S&P 500 index reported results with 8.9% year-over-year earnings growth on 0.9% revenue growth. Notably, in the past six months S&P 500's Consumer Staple Select Sector SPDR (XLP) has gained 8.3%, trailing only Utilities Select Sector SPDR's (XLU) gain of 16.1%.Stock markets are likely to remain volatile in the near future due to trade concerns, geopolitical conflicts and interest rate movements. Consequently, investment in defensive sectors such as consumer staples will be fruitful.We have narrowed down our search to five consumer staples stocks each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The energy drink specialist reported  and also disclosed a simmering disagreement with distribution partner  (NYSE: KO) , but investors quickly shrugged off the Coke dispute to focus on the upside.Monster grew its third-quarter sales 12% above the year-ago result, landing at $1.02 billion.

The earnings figure was right in line with analyst expectation, but Monster's top-line result was a positive surprise.On the , Monster CEO Rodney Sacks said that Coca-Cola is working up two new energy drinks under its own familiar brands, possibly breaking a signed agreement to leave the energy drinks business to Monster and focus on less-caffeinated drinks under brands like Sprite, Coca-Cola, and Dasani.

Several analysts called it a buying opportunity and investors soon united under that bullish banner.Image source: The author.Monster is posting solid sales growth in America while rolling out distribution and marketing in new markets such as India, China, and Eastern Europe. The U.S. remains Monster's most important market by a long shot -- international sales accounted for just 25% of total third-quarter revenues.The stock has traded largely sideways all year long after running 43% higher in 2017. The international growth opportunities should provide plenty of fuel for Monster's fires next year, and I'd be shocked if Coke actually launched another line of energy drinks and actually made a dent in Monster's and Red Bull's market-leading sales.

Maybe they took on too much leverage with low-quality loans. Perhaps they invested heavily near the peak of their respective cycles, such as with low-quality oil companies. Either way, poorly managed companies didn't make it out alive. Further, not only did the stocks with the strongest balance sheets survive, but they were the first to thrive when the economy improved.While many investors may think of companies with high-quality balance sheets as boring investments, look at it on a more personal level. While often times investors are only in a name for the short term, think of long-term investments differently. Would you invest in the local pizza joint that shuts down and changes owners every 12 to 18 months, or the one that has been up and running for 40 years straight? Which do you think will best weather an economic slowdown?If you had to ask one of two friends to hold onto $1,000 for you, would you choose the one who continually changes jobs and has been evicted twice, or the one who has been in the same house for a decade with steady employment?These companies are stewards of your money. Don't give it to the unscrupulous ones. We may not head into a recession in the next year, but that doesn't matter. We still don't want our funds tied up lousy companies, even if it's simply a period of higher volatility. We want the best.With that said, here's a look at a few of the best stocks with the strongest balance sheets.Leading off the list are a pair of FANG stocks, starting with  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ). When investors think of Alphabet, they think of its great assets. Things like YouTube.com and Google.com, along with its Waymo, cloud and advertising divisions. They also think of the company's great growth prospects, with analysts forecasting revenue growth of 23% this year and 19% next year.They may even make the argument that Alphabet is a cheap stock, or at least a reasonably priced one. GOOGL stock currently trades at 23 times forward estimates, which call for $41.75 per share. That's up almost 30% from fiscal 2017.But rarely do people think of Alphabet for its balance sheet power. While this giant has made some large acquisitions in the past, it has done a good job of padding its bottom line and avoiding debt. Alphabet has more than $106 billion in cash and short-term investments and total long-term debt of just $3.9 billion.In other words, GOOGL could pay that amount off in a snap and still have more than $100 billion locked away in its vault. The figure is notable given Alphabet's $750 billion market cap.Generating more than $21 billion in free cash flow over the last twelve months and with operating margins of roughly 20%, Alphabet has a robust and profitable business. Its balance sheet is a rock and investors should feel comfortable  for this blue-chip tech investment.The other FANG stock on the list is  (NASDAQ:  ). This isn't a stock many investors are willing to pay a premium for right now, even though like Alphabet it has premium online and mobile properties. The Facebook and Instagram platforms are two of the most popular social media outlets in the world.That leads to big-time advertising dollars and because of its business, it leads to massive margins. Facebook has gross margins north of 80% - what?! - and profit margins of 37.5%. To put that in perspective, GOOGL has profit margins of just under 15% and it's considered an incredible company.I'll readily admit that Google has a deeper moat than Facebook, but we can't ignore the latter's grip on social media or its profitability. This leads to robust demand for online advertising, a high-margin engine that funnels cash to the bottom line.In all, Facebook holds more than $41 billion in cash and short-term investments and no debt whatsoever. While that's significantly less cash than GOOGL, keep in mind that FB stock has a market cap of \"just\" $440 million.Further, keep in mind that over the last 12 months, FB stock has generated roughly $17.5 billion in free-cash flow. Facebook essentially generates far more cash than it needs to in a given quarter. Ultimately, that allows the company to invest in multiple initiatives, both on offense and defense. For that reason, (  ) some will consider FB stock a buy.Shifting gears away from FANG, our next stock is  (NASDAQ:  ). This stock doesn't have the lower valuation that Alphabet and Facebook sport, but that's about the only knock on the company.With its PayPal and Venmo platform, this company continues to churn out strong revenue and earnings growth. Estimates call for 18% revenue growth this year and 17% next year. For earnings, estimates call for 26% growth and 20% growth during the same periods, respectively. Furthermore, free cash flow remains robust.On the balance sheet front, PayPal's sitting on $9.5 billion in cash and short-term investments and zero long-term debt. The company has $247 million in accounts payable and over $2.5  in net receivables.The cash horde may not be that of Alphabet's, but it's still notable for a $100 billion company. While growth will likely take a hit during an economic slowdown, know that PYPL has staying power when it comes to its financials.Many consider  (NASDAQ:  ) to be a takeover target, particularly by a larger beverage rival looking for more growth and to fill a niche role in its product portfolio. Of course,  (NYSE:  ) makes sense, given that the two have worked together for quite some time and KO has a 16.7% stake in Monster.Still, we don't know if a deal will ever come. After all, it hasn't yet. But in the meantime,  that Monster has a strong balance sheet.Although $1.8 billion in cash isn't the largest sum, the company has no long-term debt despite its rapid expansion plans. Accounts receivable are more than double the size of its accounts payable, while its $2.1 billion in current assets dwarfs current liabilities of $656 million.Monster is generating almost $1 billion in free cash flow per year now, making this a lucrative prospect. Remember, we don't need to have $100 billion in cash to be a strong financial company. Monster has no debt, plenty of money and generates a ton of cash from its operations. That's something investors need to look at.I'm not sure why  (NASDAQ:  ) doesn't get more love. Since it's down about 40% from its highs, perhaps SWKS stock isn't the one to seek shelter in amid a downturn. But if you can pick this name up on the cheap or ride out the storm, it's worth considering.First, the balance sheet. With $1.03 billion in cash and short-term investments, this $12 billion company is sitting pretty - particularly given that it has no long- or short-term debt. In fact, current assets total $2.26 billion to just $390 million in current liabilities. That's a great ratio!Total assets vs. total liabilities is also great, at $4.8 billion vs. $732 million.While we're dealing with smaller numbers than with GOOGL, understand that for its size, these are great measures for SWKS. To make matters more attractive, this company generated over $800 million in free cash flow over the last year. While down from the $1 billion it did the year prior, this is still a notable amount for a company of this size.Although estimates call for modest earnings and revenue growth this year, next year is set for a big improvement. Expectations call for 11% earnings growth alongside 8% sales growth.  , SWKS stock trades at just 14 times this year's earnings. It also yields 2.2%.Three years ago,  (NASDAQ:  ) generated just over $400 million in free cash flow. In 2018, that figure has swelled to more than $1 billion. And while REGN stock has seen its share of price swoons, investors should take a closer look at this biotech giant.Sporting a $41 billion market cap, REGN stock trades at a reasonable 17 times forward earnings, given that estimates call for revenue to grow by around 10% this year and next. While earnings growth of 32% this year falls off to just 4.5% next year, this one warrants a closer look.With \"just\" $4.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, REGN doesn't jump out as an overwhelmingly strong balance sheet candidate. However, current assets of $5.7 billion and total assets of $10.8 billion dwarf the company's current liabilities and total liabilities of $1.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively.While REGN does carry $700 million in long-term debt, it generates terrific cash flow. Overall, it has a very un-levered balance sheet.  .We can't do this list and ignore  (NASDAQ:  ), right?Let's start with the bad. The company has $94 billion in long-term debt and almost $260 billion in net liabilities. However, this debt is sort of misleading. Rather than repatriate all of its funds held overseas and pay a high tax rate, Apple pays a minimal amount in interest to borrow money instead.That money is then used to buy a massive amount of stock. This year alone, Apple  . Warren Buffett has been a steady (and massive) buyer of Apple. Do you think he would do so if its balance sheet were a big risk?I will be the first to admit, I don't love seeing $100 billion in debt for a company. But measured against its assets and cash flow, it's more a financial engineering situation than outright toxic debt. Consider that Apple holds $170.8 billion in long-term investments and another $66 billion in cash and short-term investments. It has net receivables of almost $50 billion and is embarking on what is generally its strongest quarter.Over the last year, Apple has generated a laughable $64 billion in free cash flow. Yeah, laughable as in that's so much cash flow it's hardly comprehendible. That should alleviate all concerns over the debt and tell you all you need to know.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n early trading on Thursday, shares of General Electric (  ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the S&P 500 index, trading up 9.7%.

Shares have added about 7.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Monster Beverage due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Monster Beverage's earnings of 50 cents per share in third-quarter 2018 improved 25.6% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents.Net sales of $1,016.2 million increased 11.7% year over year and exceeded the consensus mark of $991 million. Further, gross sales grew 13.7% to $1,184.4 million in the quarter. Advance purchases by customers owing to a pre-announced price hike from Nov 1, on certain Monster Energy drinks, benefited net and gross sales by $16 million and $18 million, respectively. However, net sales were adversely impacted by $5.3 million from foreign currency translations and by $11.6 million from the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606. Excluding the adoption of ASC 606, the top line grew 13% in the quarter.Outside the United States, net sales to customers totaled $283 million, up 8.8% year over year. Net sales at the segment, which includes Monster Energy and Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $935.1 million. The metric was somewhat hurt by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. This segment includes a range of energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company. Net sales at the segment declined 2.8% to $74.4 million in the quarter. The downside can be primarily attributed to adverse impact from the adoption of ASC 606 and foreign currency. Net sales at the segment, which includes some products of American Fruits & Flavors, sold to independent third parties, plunged 26.9% year over year to $6.6 million.Third-quarter 2018 gross margin contracted 280 basis points (bps) to 59.8%. The decline can be attributed to higher promotional allowances, lower sales due to the adoption of ASC 606, higher input and freight costs as well as geographical and domestic product sales mix.Operating expenses, including $14.1 million of distributor termination expenses, increased 6.3% from the prior-year quarter to $268.1 million. However, selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.2%, down 150 bps from third-quarter 2017. Operating income amounted to $339.6 million, up about 7% year over year. Nonetheless, operating margin fell 150 bps to 33.4%.Monster Beverage ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $713.7 million, and total stockholders' equity of $3,893.3 million. Effective tax rate in the third quarter was 21.8% compared with 31.9% in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, the company had an outstanding authorization to buy back shares worth nearly $696.7 million as of Sep 30.Monster Beverage's impressive net sales figure of above $1 billion in the third quarter reflects benefits from strategic initiatives and brand strength. Moreover, the company is smoothly progressing on its strategic alignment with Coca-Cola system bottlers. Notably, it has completely transitioned Monster Energy from the Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV distributors to Coca-Cola bottlers in the United States. The company also transitioned the brand in the remainder of Arkansas in the reported quarter.Further, the company has extended the distribution of Monster Energy to 40 major cities in India. Going ahead, it plans more international launches later in 2018 and remains confident about its brands' robust performance.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.Currently, Monster Beverage has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

For the Invesco Russell 1000 Enhanced Equal Weight ETF (Symbol: USEQ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $30.86 per unit.With USEQ trading at a recent price near $26.88 per unit, that means that analysts see 14.82% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.

The broad-based market decline can be attributed to lingering tariff related conflicts with China, plummeting crude  , several geopolitical problems and yield curve inversion of sovereign bonds.The negative sentiment has dented investor confidence to such an extent that strong consumer spending and labor market data have failed to instill optimism. At this juncture, it will be prudent to invest in stocks from defensive industries like consumer staples with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential.U.S. stocks have had a rough run so far in 2018 after providing fabulous returns in 2017. Out of three major stock market indexes, the Dow 30 and S&P 500 are currently in the negative territory with a decline of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively, year to date. Only the Nasdaq Composite has gained 2.4% so far in 2018.However, in the second half of 2018, the performances of these three indexes have been more disappointing. The Dow 30, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite declined 2.3%, 4.7% and 8.9%, respectively, erasing the gains of the first half of 2018.An amicable solution to the trade related conflict between the United States-China following the Dec 1 meeting between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping is yet to come by.However, confusion has increased around China's intentions of taking adequate measures to stop technology theft from the United States. Uncertainty also persists about the extent to which it will open up markets to U.S. companies and provide concessions to reduce trade imbalance between the two countries. Moreover, on Dec 9, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said that he considers Mar 1 \"a hard deadline\" to reach a deal with China, failing which, the tariff war is likely to go on.The consumer staples sector includes companies that provide necessities and products used in daily lives, which make them defensive in nature. With the companies providing necessary products, the consumer staples industry has always been the go-to place for investors who want to play it safe during extreme market fluctuations.Consequently, adding stocks from the consumer staples basket usually lends more stability to portfolios in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector remains a lucrative space for income-seeking investors given its strong dividend yield.In the third quarter of 2018, all consumer staple companies within the S&P 500 index reported results with 8.9% year-over-year earnings growth on 0.9% revenue growth. Notably, in the past six months S&P 500's Consumer Staple Select Sector SPDR (XLP) has gained 8.3%, trailing only Utilities Select Sector SPDR's (XLU) gain of 16.1%.Stock markets are likely to remain volatile in the near future due to trade concerns, geopolitical conflicts and interest rate movements.

For the year so far, the shares have gained about 11%, and this mostly is in line with its long-term track record. Note that during the past ten years KO stock has posted an average annual return of 10.54%.In light of this, is it any wonder that the company is a top holding of  (NYSE:  , NYSE:  ) Warren Buffett? Of course not. Consider that he owns a whopping 400 million shares.Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance, but in the case of Coke it does look like there will continue to be steady growth.One key is that the company has been innovating its product line. Hey, just look at Coca-Cola Zero. Part of the success has been the use of sweetners like aspartame and acesulfame K, making the drink more like a traditional coke. Coca-Cola Zero also has much more engaging packaging. As a result, the drink has been posting strong growth (up double digits during the latest quarter).But there are many other offerings that have been nice drivers and should help provide continued momentum for KO stock. They include:In the meantime, Coca-Cola has been aggressive with M&A and strategic investments, which has led to an expansion of the brand portfolio. The company has purchased  (the developer of the MOJO kombucha brand) and  (the creator of various fruit-flavored beverages).Then there were investments in  , which has premium sports performance brands, and  , a maker of juice and protein smoothies.But of course, the transformative deal was the $5.1 billion acquisition of Costa, which is a UK-based retail coffee chain.Granted, it's a risky deal. Let's face it, this means KO will take on the mighty  (NASDAQ:  ). But the deal should help diversify KO's product line and also provide a strong platform to gain a footprint in emerging markets, especially China.All in all, the strategy for KO is coming together nicely. It also helps that the company still has strong pricing power. This is definitely critical as the costs of ingredients and materials continue to rise.KO stock also has a decent dividend yield, which is at 3.14%. And more importantly, the company has a long history of increases.So again, when it comes to KO stock, don't expect too much excitement. The company is likely to be more of a model of stability. Although, with the volatility in the markets, this may be a big attraction for many investors.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - November 28, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see Buy-ranked  's shares have surged +18.1% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Aerospace & Defense industry, which gained +1.7% during the same time period. The Zacks analyst emphasizes that the company is the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries.The company's 20-year market outlook forecasts commercial jetliner demand to increase by 4.1%, with single-aisle jets being the major driver behind this demand growth. Boeing expects the commercial fleet to be fueled by sustained annual growth in commercial passenger traffic along with a big wave of retiring, old planes. Boeing's strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.However, this aerospace giant may face competitive challenges if new manufacturers like China enter the commercial jet space. Engine-related issues pertaining to its 787 fleet may also hurt company's growth.(You can  ).Shares of  have gained +15.5% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Soft Beverages industry's increase of +1%, due to its robust surprise trend. Earnings topped estimates in the last 11 quarters, while it delivered positive sales surprise in five of the last seven quarters.The Zacks analyst thinks the improvement is mainly attributable to strong performances in international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets. Also, the company is benefiting from its strong and growing snacks business.However, PepsiCo is witnessing strained margins for quite some time due to operating and commodity cost inflation, including higher transportation costs and stepped-up advertising expense. This trend is likely to continue through the rest of 2018. Additionally, consumers' awareness on health and wellness, alongside new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales, which has caused sluggishness in beverage category.(You can  ). 's shares have underperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry year to date (-14.3% vs. -6.5%). However, the company possesses an impressive earnings surprise history, beating expectations in all the trailing four quarters.The Zacks analyst thinks the company's restructuring and streamlining efforts, strategic investments in core business, lower tax rate and expense management will likely support profitability. Though several issues, including litigation burden and declining fee income, are cause for apprehension, with rates rising, margin pressure seems to be easing.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include United Technologies and Monster Beverage.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Further, gross sales grew 13.7% to $1,184.4 million in the quarter. Advance purchases by customers owing to a pre-announced price hike from Nov 1, on certain Monster Energy drinks, benefited net and gross sales by $16 million and $18 million, respectively. However, net sales were adversely impacted by $5.3 million from foreign currency translations and by $11.6 million from the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606. Excluding the adoption of ASC 606, the top line grew 13% in the quarter.Outside the United States, net sales to customers totaled $283 million, up 8.8% year over year. Net sales at the segment, which includes Monster Energy and Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $935.1 million. The metric was somewhat hurt by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. This segment includes a range of energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company  . Net sales at the segment declined 2.8% to $74.4 million in the quarter. The downside can be primarily attributed to adverse impact from the adoption of ASC 606 and foreign currency. Net sales at the segment, which includes some products of American Fruits & Flavors, sold to independent third parties, plunged 26.9% year over year to $6.6 million.Third-quarter 2018 gross margin contracted 280 basis points (bps) to 59.8%. The decline can be attributed to higher promotional allowances, lower sales due to the adoption of ASC 606, higher input and freight costs as well as geographical and domestic product sales mix.Operating expenses, including $14.1 million of distributor termination expenses, increased 6.3% from the prior-year quarter to $268.1 million. However, selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.2%, down 150 bps from third-quarter 2017.Operating income amounted to $339.6 million, up about 7% year over year. Nonetheless, operating margin fell 150 bps to 33.4%.Monster Beverage ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $713.7 million, and total stockholders' equity of $3,893.3 million.Effective tax rate in the third quarter was 21.8% compared with 31.9% in the prior-year quarter.Moreover, the company did not buy back shares in the reported quarter. It had an outstanding authorization to buy back shares worth nearly $696.7 million as of Sep 30.Monster Beverage's impressive net sales figure of above $1 billion in the third quarter reflects benefits from strategic initiatives and brand strength. Moreover, the company is smoothly progressing on its strategic alignment with Coca-Cola system bottlers. Notably, it has completely transitioned Monster Energy from the Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV  distributors to Coca-Cola bottlers in the United States. The company also transitioned the brand in the remainder of Arkansas in the reported quarter.Further, the company has extended the distribution of Monster Energy to 40 major cities in India.

On top of traditional alternatives like water, juice, and tea, energy drinks have gained a core following among consumers, and  (NASDAQ: MNST) has retained a stranglehold among the small number of leading companies in the energy-drink space. That's had its pros and cons lately, though, with last-quarter's performance  about whether the company's future would be as impressive as its past.Coming into Wednesday's third-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors were hoping to see solid gains in revenue and net income while getting a positive read on consumer sentiment. Monster's results exceeded expectations on most fronts, and that helped to build some energy among shareholders who hope that the energy-drink giant will be able to produce further gains in the future.Image source: Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage's third-quarter results were better than most had expected. Net sales climbed almost 12%, to $1.02 billion, easily beating the $988 million projection among those following the stock. Net income was higher by 22%, to $267.7 million, and adjusted earnings of $0.50 per share exceeded the consensus forecast among investors for $0.46 per share on the bottom line.Monster continued to profit by focusing on its most important franchises. The company's Monster Energy drink segment, which includes all of its legacy brands, saw net sales rise 13% from the third quarter of 2017. In doing so, Monster was willing to sacrifice growth in the strategic brands that it acquired from  (NYSE: KO) in their  , as that segment saw sales decline 2% to represent only about 7% of the company's total revenue. Other revenue jumped 26% but continued to make up a minuscule part of Monster's overall business.Interestingly, Monster saw a reversal in the geographical source of its biggest growth. International sales were up just 9%, with negative impacts from adverse currency movements playing at least some role in the slowdown.Fundamentals were mixed for the company. Monster reported a nice jump in case sales, which climbed by about 14.85 million to more than 111 million. Yet average net sales per case were down $0.31, to $9.09 per case, suggesting a combination of weaker pricing power and the impact of a strong U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in the countries in which Monster does business internationally.CEO Rodney Sacks was happy to see strong sales again. \"We are pleased to report record third quarter net sales of more than $1.0 billion,\" Sacks noted, \"further demonstrating the strength of our brands.\" The CEO also pointed to the ongoing transition to Coca-Cola bottling and distribution, as well as expansion in international markets such as India, Ecuador, Ukraine, Myanmar, and Vietnam.The only big concern that came from the report was in the amount of promotional and other allowances that Monster has given recently. Gross sales climbed almost 14% from year-earlier levels, but a 27% jump in promotional expenses held back some of the sales growth on a net basis. Monster will want to watch promotional payments closely to avoid seeing this become a lasting trend.Another interesting omission was that Monster didn't mention stock-buyback activity during the quarter. Yet with weighted average share counts falling from about 566 million at the end of June to roughly 560 million currently, it certainly looks as though some repurchases might have taken place despite the lack of clear disclosure.In any event, Monster Beverage shareholders were happy with the news, and the stock climbed 6% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Bullish investors hope that today's news is only the beginning of a new leg higher for Monster's growth rates. If things go the energy-drink specialist's way, 2019 could be an even better year for the company and its prospective growth.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The report itself exceeded Wall Street's expectations, but Monster CEO Rodney Sacks also used this platform to disclose a brewing contract dispute with distribution partner  (NYSE: KO) .Monster's third-quarter sales landed at $1.02 billion, 12% above the year-ago period's result. On the bottom line, earnings rose 20% to $0.46 per share. Your average analyst would have settled for earnings near $0.46 per share on revenue in the neighborhood of $988 million.So far, so good, but then there's the Coca-Cola dispute. On the  , Sacks explained that Coke has developed two new energy drinks that it might want to market under its own brands -- sidestepping the Monster partnership that essentially transferred all of the two companies' energy-drink business to Monster while moving Monster's non-energy products to Coca-Cola's control. Coke says that the contract has exceptions for situations like this but Monster disagrees. The planned launch of the new drinks has been pushed back to April 2019 and the matter is now in arbitration.Image source: Anders Bylund.Several analysts rushed to the company's defense this morning, arguing that the Coca-Cola dispute should be resolved without any significant damage to the energy-drink specialist's business, and that dips like these could be treated as buy-in opportunities. In short, brand-new energy-drink alternatives seem unlikely to gain significant market share against the Red Bull and Monster juggernauts -- even if they're tied to well-known brands in the Coca-Cola family.That logic appears to have made a difference today. As of 2:40 p.m. EST, Monster's shares have climbed back to a 3.6% loss.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call may be recorded.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the financial Information section.There are encouraging signs in the beverage category globally and we continue to see positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the Company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method were included in operating expenses.Growth in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 were impacted by advanced purchases made by our customers due to a pre-announced price increase, effective November 1, 2018 on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The Company estimates such impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million respectively.In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7% from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements. The Company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7% from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements.Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8%, compared to 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage as adjusted for ASC 606 would have been 60.3% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans freight in and other input costs; the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; domestic product sales mix; and geographical gross profit mix.Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million, largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the US. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2%, compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributed termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter as compared with $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter. Excluding distributor termination expenses in both quarters, the comparable general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% in the third quarter of 2018, compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.2%, compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. Payroll costs increased $5.9 million, primarily due to headcount growth both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the Company's products were $1.4 million in the 2018 third quarter as compared to $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter.Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to US taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter.Net income was $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, compared to net income of $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 22.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 to $560 million for the third quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 third quarter increased 26.4% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding distributor termination expenses in the 2018 third quarter and in the comparable quarter last year, earnings per share would have increased 25.6% to $0.50 per share.We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the US in non-traditional channels, including foodservice accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the third quarter of 2018, we completed the transition of Arkansas to Coca-Cola bottlers. This concludes the Anheuser-Busch distributed transition in the United States. In EMEA, we launched in Ukraine. Further launches are planned in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 in Azerbaijan and in Armenia. Last week, we launched Predator in South Africa as our strategically preferred energy brand and plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 in select Eastern European and African markets.During the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Paraguay and Bolivia are now on track to launch in the first quarter of 2019. In China, we continue to focus our efforts toward establishing Monster around the country with an emphasis on distribution in the Top 40 cities and to key accounts targeting younger and more affluent consumer demographics. Our core range will expand its offering and appeal with the launch of Ultra White in the fourth quarter. We continued the rollout of Monster to Coca-Cola India. We have now expanded the launch to 40 of the largest cities across the country. Monster is now selling in approximately 75% of the country with national rollout expected by year-end.Mutant Energy, one of our affordable energy brands that we have positioned differently from the Mutant Super Soda previously sold in the US was launched in Myanmar and Vietnam in the third quarter. Mutant Energy is now available in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam.I wanted to take a moment to address one aspect of our agreements with Coca-Cola. Among other provisions, these agreements between the Company, Coca-Cola and certain affiliates restrict Coca-Cola from competing in the energy drink category, with certain exceptions. As some of you may have read, Coca-Cola has developed two energy products it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. While (ph) mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration last week on October 31, 2018. Coca-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such energy products until April 2019.According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 29, 2018 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 6.6% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Red Bull increased 4.8%, sales of Rockstar decreased by 7.9%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.9% and sales of Amp decreased 24.6%.According to Nielsen for the five-weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 8.8% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 2.7% and Full Throttle was up 0.4 of a percent. Sales of Red Bull were up 2%, Rockstar was down 12%, 5-Hour was down 6.6% and Amp was down 29.2%.According to Nielsen for the five-week ended September 29, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased by 1.3 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS' share declined 0.1 of a share point to 4% and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 0.9 of a percent. Red Bull's share decreased 1.0 points to 33.7%, Rockstar's share was down 1.3 points to 6.6%, 5-Hour share was lower by 0.9 of a point at 7% and Amp's share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.7%.According to Nielsen, for the five-weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales of coffee + energy drinks, which now include Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster. In dollars, in the convenience and gas channel, increased 18.8% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone was 17.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 2.5% lower. Our share of the coffee + energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted for the five-weeks ended September 29, 2018 was 56.3% at 9.6 points. Java Monster's share alone for the five-weeks ended September 29, 2018 was 46.1%, down 0.7 of a point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy share was 43.6%, down 9.5 points.According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 15, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster sales increased 12% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 1.5 share points to 33.9%. NOS' sales decreased 9% and its market share decreased 0.4 of a share point to 3%. Full Throttle sales increased 10% and its market share remained at 1.4%. Red Bull sales increased 7% and its market share increased 0.5 of a point to 37.8%.

Monster sales increased 34.5%, market share in value increased 0.9 of a point to 29.9% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn were flat. Burn's market share decreased 0.5 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 2.9% and its market share decreased by 2.4 points to 9%. Vive 100 sales increased 27.6% and its market share decreased 0.9 of a point to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.2 points to 7.8%.The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.I'd like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 30-week period ending October 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 11.4% to 12.4% in Belgium, from 22.8% to 23.3% in France, from 18.4% to 20.9% in Great Britain, from 6.4% to 7.1 % in the Netherlands, from 15.3% to 18% in Norway, from 27.5% to 29.3% in Spain, and from 10.3% to 13.6% in Sweden.According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.4% to 14.4% in the Czech Republic; from 15.4% to 16.4% in Germany; from 33.6% to 34.5% in Greece; from 13.2% to 17% in Italy ; and from 7.3% to 10.7% in Poland.

For the 13-week period ended September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value decreased however from 15.6% to 15.3 % in South Africa, although the value of sales increased in the same comparative period.According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2018 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 30.8% to 34.5% compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of September increased from 13.7% to 16.9%, as compared to the same period last year. We launched Argentina in mid-February 2018. According to Nielsen, Argentina reached a 13.8% market share in value as of September 2018.According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value increased from 7.4% to 8.9% in September 2018, as compared to the same period last year. Mother's market share in value increased from 12.9% to 13.5% in September 2018 as compared to the same period last year.

According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 48.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months.Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2018 increased 13% from $827.7 million to $935.1 million in the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 13.6%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $3.9 million of foreign currency movements.Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $74.4 million for the third quarter as compared to $76.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 5.5%. Net sales for the Company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $6.6 million in the third quarter as compared to $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales to customers outside the US was $283 million in the 2018 third quarter, compared to $260.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign exchange had the effect of decreasing net sales in US dollars by approximately $5.3 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the Company's military customers, which are delivered in the US and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.In EMEA, we had a challenging quarter, with supply chain and production issues, which not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to address these supply chain and production issues. In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased marginally in dollars and increased 0.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 4.8% in dollars and 5.3% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 41.3%, compared to 50.9% in the same quarter last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44% for the third quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates for our Strategic Brands in the region. We estimate that net sales in the quarter in dollars without the adoption of ASC 606 were adversely affected by approximately 11% due to supply chain and production issues. We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the third quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Italy and Poland, Ultra White in Macedonia, and Ultra Violet in Sweden. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and Sweden.In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 27.2% in dollars and 28.3% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 29.6% in dollars and 30.7% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.1% versus 46.5% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.1%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to concentrate sales of our Strategic Brands. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 17.4% in dollars and 17.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 155.7% in dollars and 151.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 21.4% in dollars and 27.5% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year.In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 20.5% in dollars and 32.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.4% in dollars and 35.4% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, was 44% versus 47.6% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.3%. Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 31.6% in dollars and 57.2% in local currency. Net sales in Brazil were impacted by ASC 606 and higher taxes on sales. Net sales in Chile decreased 16.2% in dollars and 16.4% in local currency in the quarter, largely due to supply issues.Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $713.7 million, compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $457.9 million, compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $1.6 million, compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017. Net accounts receivable increased to $620.2 million at September 30, 2018 from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 47.6 days at September 30, 2018. Inventories increased to $262.1 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 57.7 days at September 30, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Pacific Punch, a line extension of our Juice Monster family in the US. Initial results have been positive. In Canada in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Mango Loco nationally. In Mexico in the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink and also relaunched Monster Energy Khaos. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drinks in Romania and Finland and launched Monster Pipeline Punch in Sweden. We also launched Monster Mixed Punch in Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia, Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in Australia and Monster Mango Loco in Germany. -- Austria. -- Sorry, PET bottles in Austria and Monster Mango Loco in Germany, sorry. Thank you.In Australia, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco and are in the process of launching Monster Pipeline Punch with a major convenience and gas retailer in Australia with a national launch planned for the first quarter of 2019. In October 2018, we launched both Monster Mango Loco and Monster Pipeline Punch in New Zealand. During the quarter and in line with our agreement with the Coca-Cola Company, we transitioned the Lift Plus strategic brand in New Zealand to LIVE+ with three SKUs and new graphics. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citron in South Korea and Monster Ultra in Taiwan and Hong Kong.We've implemented an approximately 4% price increase to our US customers, effective November 1 for Monster Energy. We will implement price increase for NOS and Full Throttle on January 1, 2019. We are planning a price increase to our Canadian customers, effective February 1, 2019 for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle.We estimate that October 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18% higher than in October 2017. Gross sales for the month ended October 2018 were impacted by advanced purchases by our customers due to the price increase effective November 1, 2018 on certain Monster Energy drinks. We estimate that October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 12% higher than in October 2017 without these advanced purchases. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, October 2018 gross sales would have been approximately 14% higher than the comparable October 2017 gross sales.In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.No shares of common stock were repurchased by the Company during the 2018 third quarter. However, we do have outstanding board authorizations of approximately $696.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock.In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. The Company continues to gain market share in the US and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the Company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets.I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hi, good evening, everyone. -- Hi, Amit. -- Can you provide a little bit more context into the energy drink brands being developed by Coca-Cola? How far along are they, or any other information on it, please? -- I think that we've heard -- we have some information, but we don't have full information and I think that now that an arbitration has been filed between us to try and determine our respective rights, we just believe that it isn't appropriate for us to provide additional comments at this time. Commercial business activities and relationship is continuing as in the past and we are looking to just get a third-party determination for the correct interpretation of our respective rights.Thank you. Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Hi, everyone. -- Hi, Judy. -- So, Rodney just as a follow-up, just a quick follow-up on the last question. I mean, maybe if you could take a little bit of a step back and just kind of give your perspective on the relationship that's been evolving with the Coca-Cola Company. Obviously, the Mutant situation didn't also go as well as I think that you were hoping for. So, kind of how do you see this changing your relationship with the KO as well as the bottlers? So maybe just be helpful to just get your broader perspective.And then more specifically, my other question is just really on the EMEA supply chain issues. I guess -- I'm just wondering if this is limited to certain countries or this is really a broader regional issue and whether this is being addressed as we speak, so we get more of a bump up in sales in the fourth quarter. It seems like we've been having some of these supply chain issues in international markets time-to-time. So, how do we think about really more fully addressing the issue broadly? Thank you. -- That's a lot for one question, Judy. -- Follow-up. One more (ph) with a follow-up. -- Okay. On the relationship with Coke, I think our relationship is good and continues to be good. There is Coke obviously looking at their own portfolio and looking for where they believe they see opportunities and where their own BUs would look to expand their own portfolio. As we indicated in the call, there is an exception for certain products that are in the Coca-Cola brand and that is of and itself an area that we are looking at.We have a difference of opinion on it. We don't know and at this point we don't think it's appropriate for us to speculate on if that comes to fruition, what effect that might or might not have on our brand. I mean, we continue to be partners with Coca-Cola and with the bottlers. We continue to have our full range sold by them and we just don't think that at this point be in a position or should be in a position to speculate on what do you fix that might have. There will just be another product being sold by Coca-Cola bottlers, but the impact and effect on us would be something I think wouldn't be appropriate for us to deal with that. We don't believe it will have a majority impact on our relationship. We just believe we have to manage it in an appropriate way if and when it occurs. On the EMEA supply chain side -- -- Sorry, Rodney. Maybe I could give a different perspective to Judy (inaudible). The relationship with the Coca-Cola Company, I believe is good. And I'm not a lawyer, so I'm giving the response to you from a business perspective. There is an issue in an agreement, which we've agreed to go to arbitration civilly and determine what course of action is appropriate. So, nothing has changed in the relationship and the manner in which this situation will be dealt with will be conducted from both parties in -- on a civil basis according to the agreement. So, I honestly don't see any changes in the relationship with the Coca-Cola Company. -- Sure. All right. On the EMEA supply chain side, this did -- it affected us through a number of plants in different areas, not obviously right through all of the -- there are probably 70 or 80 countries that comprise EMEA, but there were a number of countries and a number of plants that did have supply issues for a whole host of reasons. We've taken steps to address this. We have appointed a -- we had a period of time when our previous Senior VP of Operations retired and we were looking for a successor. We have appointed a successor who is -- he has got his feet on this desk and he is in the job, he's been out in Europe. We've also appointed a new VP of Operations in Europe to give us more hands on deck there. And so, we are looking at getting our hands around it. We are in the process of doing it at this point in time. Perhaps if you'd like to add some color to that? -- No, I think that we've had issues. Remember, it was a very hot summer in Europe and a lot of the plants were working to capacity and beyond capacity. We've had certain issues, which are being addressed and will be addressed going forward. And the one thing is clear is that, our business is growing, which is a good thing, and we have to ensure that we have sufficient capacity and sufficient plants to be able to accommodate on these. -- Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is open. -- Hi, good evening. -- Hi. -- So I was hoping to talk about your US business and specifically the trends for your core Green Monster, where, at least in the Nielsen scanner data that we have, it does appear that there has been a modest softening in terms of the market share declines. So, can you offer any color on whether there has been a change in your promotional strategy heading into the price increase or is this more interaction with new product offerings that are hitting the market? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. -- Looking at the general market, Monster is continuing to increase its share. The category is growing and Monster is growing in excess of the market. If I look at regular Monster as such, (inaudible) for example, the main channel, which is convenience, it's reasonably -- there is still some growth in Monster in that -- in the original core line in its 16 ounce and then we have -- obviously, we have additional SKUs with the original Green Monster. So the core brand is continuing to grow.There has been the entry into the market of additional products, primarily probably in what we would may be call or describe as a performance energy category or a workout fitness energy category or not even really maybe in that category, and they have -- there is some sales on that, there are number of reasons that those products are all sort of starting to gain some traction. But if I look at the sales levels, they are still behind the increase in sales. So, I think overall, we are getting additional products in the category, but the category itself is continuing to grow. -- So we're still seeing growth in -- Vivien in Monster Green. It's continuing to grow. And remember, we've added a number of other SKUs into the portfolio on both juice products and the Ultra range, which is the no-sugar product. So, while we are seeing growth in Monster Green, there has been as well the proliferation of other SKUs within our portfolio. -- Yes. In that side, we've -- obviously on the coffee side, we are continuing to see growth in Java. We've just launched a line extension in Java. We have the Caffe Monster line and Espresso Monster again (ph) that continue to grow. On the Ultra line, which is growing, we do have plans to launch an additional Ultra in the spring, which we will -- which will be launched, which is Ultra Paradox (ph). So we are continuing to see growth in the category and we see additional entrants. Probably to some extent, we're not sure of the exact measurement at this point in time, but do see some increase in incremental sales coming into the category from these new entrants. -- And Monster Green does remain a very important barometer for us.Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Yes, hey, good afternoon, guys. -- Hi, Mark. -- So, I'm going to try to Coke things again you can answer or not, I guess. My understanding of the exceptions relate to the specific products or specific ingredients, which is in there. So, are we talking about a product in similarity to say a kick start from the Pepsi system, where it's effectively sort of the competitor, but not really? Are they adding some sort of caffeine component to some other beverage, which is a non-carbonated soft drink? I mean, any sort of color you can give on that, that would be helpful. -- Mark, there isn't a limitation on them just adding caffeine. They could have a higher caffeine product, there is no limitation on that. There is, if you look at the agreement, which is filed, there are certain ingredients that are if used in combination, obviously then create a definition. There is a definition of what an energy drink is. The exception goes back to the Coca-Cola brand, not Sprite, not Kickstart, not any other brand, it's the Coca-Cola brand. And if that -- and there are certain exceptions about what -- because the Coke brand has certain -- otherwise there would be certain limitations and there is an exception for that brand. But I think that it's a long explanation. There are different analyses of what that means and what that entitles Coke to do under that brand.Again, if it was just a question of adding vitamins, will then -- Coke would obviously add vitamins, there isn't an issue with that, but where the brand become -- transcends into a product that we see positioned as an energy drink, that's where we have a difference of view on the exception under the Coke brand. That is really where we are. I think there is not much more we could really add or more color we could give at this point in time. There is a section in the agreement that you guys could look up if you really had that interest. But we are dealing with it with Coke and we think we will come to a resolution reasonably quickly as to what that exception means and what it -- how it should be implemented. -- And just to add on that, Mark, what I've said earlier, the discussions are very civil and very business-light, very civil and it's a question of difference of opinion, which will be resolved in per the agreement.Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Good afternoon. -- Afternoon, Bill. -- Just a little bit further on the gross margin but for the kind of the quarter and then going forward with pricing. Trying to understand as we look, will this more than offset, I mean, can you hold gross margins relatively flat going forward? And when I say that, have we seen the full impact of cost in the third quarter, or do you still have another kind of layer or step-up of cost input inflation that kicks in fourth quarter and 2019? -- Well, what's interesting looking at aluminum and the tariffs and the imposition of tariffs were announced way after we had our discussion on this call about gross margins. So, we've had this increasing tariff, which has resulted in increase of aluminum, which is slowly coming off, right? It's not -- it's a very slow process. So, we've also had extreme increases in freight-in in costs that we account for cost of sales, where product is moved to our co-packers or move to our warehouses. That's all included in cost of sales. So, we have had significant cost increases in that regard as well.So, we have these cost increases. I think that the quarter that we've just experienced, I'm not seeing further increases in aluminum and I'm not seeing further increases in freight either, but anything is possible. Having said that, we will have price increase from November 1, and the other thing for sure is we will continue to have this ASC 606 adjustment, which we didn't have when we first spoke about the gross margin issue earlier this year.So, it's kind of a mix bag, with increases and cost increases, which is exactly why we were forced into having a price increase. So, I hope that answers your question. -- Yes. I think I understand, but I guess, it's more of, do you see any need for further price increases from here? -- Well, we've announced a price increase in NOS and Full Throttle, which we spoke about on the call. We are proposing a price increase in Canada, which we discussed on the call. And where we are now with regard to price increases, I'm not sure we will -- having implementing a price increase in November 1, I'm not sure there is runway to do it again within a short period of time unless costs dramatically and significantly increase from where they are today. -- Yes, at this point we haven't sort of envisaged price increases in other places around the world, but I think that is something we will be evaluating and looking at the markets, the elasticity where we -- if we can justify pricing. We'll evaluate that going early in the New Year. -- See, in the United States, we really are now the market leader. In the various countries around the world, we really price ourselves after Red Bull in most cases and we don't want the difference between our pricing and Red Bull's pricing to be significantly out of whack. -- Yes, thanks.Thank you. That ends our Q&A session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Sacks for any further remarks. -- Thank you. On behalf of the Company, we'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the Company and our strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the Company both at home and abroad and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We also particularly excited by the new opportunities we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our strategic brands as well as Hydro, Mutant and in particular Predator.

This Utah-based personal care products company has a mixed record of bottom-line surprises in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming quarterly announcement.A robust network of sales leaders and customers is a key element in Nu Skin's success. Notably, the company's top line has been consistently benefitting from growth in sales leaders. In fact, during the second quarter of 2018, sales leaders improved approximately 21%. This was preceded by a rise of 16% and 33% during the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.The company is on track to empower sales leaders through improved compensation, training and technological enhancements. In this respect, the company successfully rolled out sales compensation program, Velocity, in the Pacific markets in December 2017. Further, in the second quarter, this program was introduced in Taiwan and North America. In July, the same was launched in the markets of Japan and Southeast Asia. Management expects Velocity to aid expanding the company's business in the future.Moving on, Nu Skin takes pride in its expanding customer base, which boosts growth in sales leaders as well. Incidentally, the company's customers grew approximately 8% during the second quarter. This was preceded by a rise of 7% in the first quarter of 2018 and a respective 8%, 7%, 5% and 2% during the fourth, the third, the second and the first quarters of 2017. The company relies much on social media as well as well-knit product and marketing programs to widen customer reach.Nu Skin frequently engages in innovation to ensure parity of offerings with the evolving beauty and wellness space. In this respect, the company relies on advanced technologies and well-strategized programs to introduce unique product concepts. Notably, the launch of the company's revolutionary ageLOC LumiSpa is a success. | Nu Skin's top and bottom line have been improving year on year for the past three quarters. Such a stellar performance, combined with persistent growth in customers and sales leaders encouraged management to raise 2018 revenues and earnings projections, when it reported second-quarter results.Moreover, for third-quarter 2018, management anticipates revenues of $650-$670 million, including a 3% positive currency impact. This compares favorably with revenues of $563.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line for the impending quarter is currently pegged at $663.7 million.Further, management expects earnings for the third quarter in the band of 93-98 cents per share, including charges of 4 cents stemming from purchase accounting. This depicts a substantial rise from earnings of 76 cents in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line for the upcoming quarterly announcement is currently pegged at 96 cents.To top it, our proven model shows that Nu Skin is likely to beat bottom-line estimates in the upcoming quarterly release. For this to happen, a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

However, it delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 0.8% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 46 cents remained unchanged in the last 30 days. It represents 15% year-over-year improvement. | Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming earnings release.Monster Beverage has been witnessing solid momentum in the energy category amid a tepid beverage industry. The company offers a wide range of energy drink brands such as Monster Energy, Java Monster and Worx Energy among others. Further, the addition of Coca-Cola's energy drink brands to the company's portfolio strengthened its position in the global energy drinks market. Moreover, the company's top line is poised to benefit from its product innovation strategy and regular product launches.In the second quarter of 2018, management launched Monster Energy brand with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Belarus, Tanzania and Uruguay, beside relaunching the brand with a Coca-Cola bottler in certain cities across India. Monster Beverage plans for more international launches in 2018. Meanwhile, the company remains optimistic about its energy drinks category to continue gaining momentum, owing to Monster Energy, Monster Hydro and Mutant drinks. Latest additions to the Monster brand are expected to generate incremental sales and boost profitability.This apart, Monster Beverage remains optimistic about product benefits from the broader distribution network as a result of the Coca-Cola deal. In fact, the company has been expanding its international operations into a variety of new markets, including China, India, African and the Middle Eastern countries. Evidently, net sales to customers outside the United States were up 18.5% in the second quarter of 2018.All these initiatives are expected to boost the company's top line in the third quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $990.8 million, reflecting an increase of 8.9% year over year. Moreover, the stock gained 1.5% in the last six months against the  's 1.3% decline.However, higher raw material costs, mainly aluminum; and unfavorable product mix continue to remain hurdles. This, in turn, might dent the company's margins in the upcoming quarter. Further, softness in the beverage industry due to growing consciousness regarding health and wellness is hurting performance. Further, better beverage alternatives like ready-to-drink tea and bottled water, as well as the shift in consumer preferences have been impacting volumes of sodas and energy drinks.Our proven model shows that Monster Beverage is likely to beat earnings estimates in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen.

This will be the first quarterly results of the combined company, which merged on Jul 9. The merged company is the seventh-largest company in the U.S. food and beverage sector, and the third-largest beverage company in North America. | Keurig Dr Pepper is poised to gain from DPS' distribution strategy and solid innovation alongside Keurig's coffee brands and online presence. It has an edge over competitors, providing hot and cold beverages that satisfy the needs of consumers, anytime and anywhere, at home or on-the-go, at work or at play. It has a portfolio of more than 125 owned, licensed, partner and allied brands, with leadership in numerous beverage categories.Keurig Dr Pepper is on track with the integration of the combined company. During second-quarter results, it reiterated the combined company outlook for 2018 and the longer term, which it provided on Mar 20, 2018, on its Investor Day. For 2018, it anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $1.02-$1.07, after the impact of preliminary Purchase Price Accounting adjustments. Further, the company expects sales to grow 1-2% in 2018.For the long term, the company expects to generate deal synergies of nearly $600 million between 2019 and 2021, with about $200 million savings anticipated every year. These synergies, combined with strong margin expansion at Keurig Green Mountain and growth at historic levels for DPS, are likely to result in the combined company EPS growth rate of 15-17% between now and 2021. Additionally, Keurig Dr Pepper expects a significant cash flow generation and rapid deleveraging, targeting a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 in two to three years.Consequently, the company's shares rallied 10.4% in the last three months against the  's decline of 8.8%.However, we believe that the CSD category headwinds will continue to impact the company's volumes, including the diet versions, due to Dr Pepper's strong portfolio of carbonated beverages. Cross-category competition, and growing health and wellness consciousness among consumers are hurting CSD category growth. Moreover, new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales. These general constraints in the soft drinks business are likely to continue impacting the newly formed company.Further, higher aluminum prices due to the ongoing trade-war are likely to increase the cost of producing cans. This, along with escalating freight costs, should result in increased prices for sodas, which may hurt profitability.Our proven model does not show that Keurig Dr Pepper is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings ESP of 0.00% and Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) make surprise prediction inconclusive.Here are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat:Turning Point Brands, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +8.74% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  .Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.21% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Monster Beverage Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +3.01% and a Zacks Rank #3.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The company boasts an impressive surprise history, having surpassed earnings estimates in 16 of the trailing 17 quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 55 cents, which reflects an increase of 10% from 50 cents in year-ago quarter. However, estimates remained stable over the last 30 days.Further, the consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $8,227 million, mirroring a year-over-year decline of more than 9%.In the last reported quarter, revenues declined 8% year over year due to adverse impact from the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations. In fact, the company has witnessed year-over-year decline in revenues for 13 straight quarters now.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | Coca-Cola remains committed to its productivity and reinvestment program that focuses on initiatives like restructuring the global supply chain, investing in technology to streamline operations, implementing a zero-based budgeting program, headcount reductions and driving increased efficiency in direct marketing investments. Notably, the company is on track to deliver savings of about $3.8 billion by 2019 through its productivity programs.Moreover, the company is gaining from the effective execution of its strategies to evolve as a consumer-centric, total beverage company. Further, the acceleration of its sparkling soft drinks category through investments and innovations bode well. Markedly, Coca-Cola's healthier soda options including the restaged Zero Sugar and new flavors of Diet Coke have been aiding results. Also, the company introduced slimmer packaging and no-sugar beverages in smaller markets such as New Zealand in the last reported quarter. All these initiatives are expected to drive top line and profitability in the upcoming quarter.However, Coca-Cola anticipates hiking prices for its sodas owing to the recently imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum by the Trump administration, which has increased the cost of producing cans for sodas. This, along with escalating freight costs and rise in other input costs is likely to impact the company's bottling system, which might hurt profitability.Further, the company expects unfavorable currency to hurt both revenues and operating margin in the second half of 2018. This remains a major concern for the to-be-reported quarter as well.Coca-Cola's EMEA division delivered a solid performance in the last reported quarter, courtesy of solid price/mix. Revenues at this segment increased 7% year over year in second-quarter 2018. Further, the company maintained value share in the juice, dairy and plant-based beverages cluster.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the EMEA segment's revenues is pegged at $1,928 million, reflecting a decrease of 1.6% year over year and a decline of 11.2% from last quarter.Further, the segment's estimate for operating income is pegged at $929 million, reflecting 0.7% decline from the prior-year quarter and 15.2% decline from first-quarter 2018.In the Latin America division, Coca-Cola has been gaining from strong price/mix in its Mexico, Brazil and South Latin businesses. The segment's revenues improved 8% last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment's third-quarter revenues is pegged at $997 million, mirroring a decline of 3.7% from the prior-year quarter and a decline of 3.3% from last quarter.Further, the segment's operating income estimate stands at $558 million, down 0.9% year over year and 6.1% sequentially.Coca-Cola delivered robust performance in the North America region. Also, revenues at the region grew 7% year over year. However, the segment's price/mix declined year over year due to low single-digit underlying price. Moreover, higher freight costs remained a major headwind in the last quarter, primarily in North America. Nevertheless, the consensus mark for revenues stands at $3,082 million, which reflects growth of 12.1% year over year but decline of 1.1% on a sequential basis.The consensus estimate for the segment's operating income stands at $808 million, up 25.1% year over year and 8.5% sequentially.Revenues at the Asia Pacific segment inched up 1% year over year in the second quarter. Notably, volume of the Coca-Cola brand in China grew 5% in the quarter, driven by strong performance in China and India. Moreover, all business units grew volume except South Pacific. However, the consensus estimate for revenues at the division is pegged at $1,367 million, down 4.5% from second-quarter 2017 and 9.9% from first-quarter 2018.Moreover, the segment's operating income estimate stands at $578 million, almost flat with the prior-year quarter figure but reflects a sequential decline of 18.1%.Revenues at the Bottling Investments segment plunged 59% in second-quarter 2018 due to items impacting comparability. Further, the consensus mark for the division's revenues is expected to be $1,058 million, down 56.5% year over year and 14.3% sequentially.In addition, currency translation risks remain concerns for the company. In third-quarter 2018, currency headwinds are likely to hurt operating income by about 7% and net revenues by 3%, both on a non-GAAP basis.Despite the odds, we expect the company's strategic efforts, including improved marketing, innovation, strong brand power, focus on driving revenues by improved price/mix and refranchising initiatives to boost third-quarter 2018 results.Our proven model does not show that Coca-Cola is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Increasingly, younger people eschew sugary drinks for healthier alternatives. That hasn't helped  (NYSE:  ), which obviously specializes in the sugary stuff. As a result, KO stock hasn't done much for investors over the past two years.But that could change very soon. Coke has intently focused on the younger demographic, seeking more effective means of engagement. One of the most noticeable efforts is its  Now being promoted using commercials that feature a tall, lithe can sparkled with bright colors, the new Diet Coke looks a lot different than the old one. Meanwhile, the soft-drink maker earlier this year  of Diet Coke, including ginger lime and feisty cherry.Coca-Cola stock is up nearly 9% year-to-date. Plus, KO stock price closed up 1.4% yesterday. Notably, not just KO stock experienced a resurgence yesterday. Rival  (NASDAQ:  ) jumped almost 3%, while energy-boosting  (NASDAQ:  ) gained a little over 1%.That is encouraging news, but just how believable is Coca-Cola stock? After all, the iconic company is only just starting to provide shareholders with a reason to smile. While I acknowledge that Coca-Cola stock has had its difficulties, KO is finally making good on its potential.A day before Halloween, Coca-Cola released its third-quarter earnings report. Rather than a fright-filled affair, the beverage-maker  , jolting the KO stock price above its horizontal range.I can see why KO stock price rallied. Against analysts' consensus earnings-per-share estimate of 55 cents, the company's EPS came in at 58 cents. Coca-Cola also topped the consensus revenue estimate of $8.17 billion, as it reported a top line of $8.25 billion.Of course, beating the earnings print is one thing. Convincing investors that \"this time is different\" is a whole different ballgame. The latter mission could be accomplished by the company's Q3 beverage sales, which confirmed that its strategies have paid off.Coca-Cola Zero Sugar was a huge success for the company, as its sales volume grew by a double-digit percentage. Furthermore, CEO James Quincy expressed satisfaction with Diet Coke's sleeker packaging.Altogether, the sparkling soft-drink segment grew 2%. It wasn't just the healthy stuff that contributed to the top line. The company's flagship beverage performed well, dispelling myths that millennials hate sugar. After KO reported strong earnings against a tough fundamental backdrop, investors can believe in Coca-Cola stock.Even in the best of circumstances, Coca-Cola stock isn't going to have sex appeal. Instead, KO stock provides stability and predictability, an anchor to prevent your portfolio from capsizing.But as investors seek safe-haven assets amid the recent volatility increases, KO stock has suddenly become more interesting. While the 9% increase of KO stock this year isn't something to write home about, under these jittery circumstances, significant gains are fairly rare. Plus, Coca-Cola stock has a fairly generous  of 3.2%.Just as importantly, the company's brand name is both renowned and respected. At a time when the U.S. might enter into a  with the world's second-biggest economy, KO stock can emerge from such a conflict unscathed. As Q3 confirms, most people throughout the world love Coke products.Finally, if the worst happens and we enter a recession, KO stock price should remain mostly insulated. Drinking, like brushing your teeth or cleaning yourself after using the restroom, is not an optional endeavor.Moreover, the company has already achieved its most difficult goal: reaching out to millennials. Moving forward, management simply needs to avoid doing something silly to keep demand for its products consistent.When it comes to predicting the ebb and flow of the KO stock price, I find myself agreeing with  James Brumley. He wrote:Coca-Cola shares had been trapped in a trading range as of August, but  . Though we're still likely to see some back-and-forth action, a lot of hard work has been done, and the bulls have tipped their hand.Especially at this juncture, it's important to consider logical investments. As I discussed earlier, Coca-Cola stock simply makes sense. The company's most recent earnings not only comprehensively beat expectations, but they proved that its longer-term strategy has traction. And with KO stock, there won't be any nasty surprises. That's something even daredevil contrarians can appreciate.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Monster Beverageis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MNST in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 47 cents per share for MNST, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MNST, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.01% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that MNST has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see  .Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Monster Beverage, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

Let's see how things are shaping prior to the earnings announcement.Clorox has been gaining from its solid growth initiatives, including 2020 Strategy, Go Lean Strategy, enhancement of e-commerce business and disciplined capital allocation. Also, the company is progressing well with the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at aiding the improvement of categories and boosting overall market share. These apart, management is well on track with its Go Lean Strategy to expand margins. In fact, it remains committed to investing in product and brand differentiation as well, in order to safeguard value proposition.Furthermore, Clorox's focus on solid investments, including digital marketing, e-commerce and product innovation pipeline is encouraging. Notably, these strategic actions have been aiding the company's quarterly results, which is clear from its robust surprise trend over the past few quarters. Also, it delivered sales beat in three of the trailing five quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $1,537 million, mirroring a 2.4% increase from the year-ago quarter number.As a result, shares of Clorox have rallied 27.4% in the past six months, outperforming the  's 9.9% growth.Despite gains from its cost saving and productivity initiatives, the company continues to witness significant pressure on gross margin, which too remains a major concern in the to-be-reported quarter. Management also anticipates increased cost pressures from commodities and the transportation market to weigh on margins. Although Clorox expects to witness gross margin expansion in the second half of fiscal 2019, the metric is likely to remain soft in the first half due to increased commodity expenses.Nevertheless, Clorox's commitment toward brand management and cost-saving efforts to improve margins and profitability is impressive. Also, management expects product innovation, and combined effect from the Nutranext acquisition and Aplicare divestiture to boost the top line and profitability.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Clorox is likely to beat earnings estimates in first-quarter fiscal 2019.

Also, it delivered an average earnings miss of 6.8% in the trailing four quarters. | Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.57, mirroring 17.2% growth year over year. Notably the consensus mark was revised downward over the past seven days.Let's see how things are shaping prior to the earnings announcement.Molson Coors has a dismal sales trend, missing estimates in seven of the trailing eight quarters. Although the company delivered a positive sales surprise in the last reported quarter, the metric declined year over year due to lower financial volume and the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. Further, the company has been witnessing softness in the U.S. beer category. It has been posting weak beer volumes in the United States for quite some time due to tough industry conditions. These apart, consumers' changing preferences, aging population and stiff competition from other alcohol beverages have been the other primary reasons behind the company's disappointing performance.Also, Molson Coors continues to battle input cost inflation, aluminum and fuel costs in particular, which has been posing challenges for a while now. Management expects these hurdles to linger in 2018.Consequently, the company reiterated its previously issued COGS per hectoliter outlook for the Europe, Canada and International segments, while raised the view for the United States. For 2018, management anticipates COGS per hectoliter to increase in low-single-digits in the Canada and Europe segments, while the same is expected to decline low-single-digits in the International segment. Meanwhile, in the United States, Molson Coors anticipates COGS per hectoliter to increase in mid-single-digit compared with the previous low-single-digit forecast.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter sales in the United States, Europe and Canada stands at $1,918 million, $567 million and $373 million, respectively. In the year-ago quarter, sales from these three segments came in at $1,892 million, $561 million and $406 million, respectively. Notably, the consensus estimate for the overall quarterly sales is pegged at $2,895 million, up 0.7% from the year-ago actual figure.The aforementioned headwinds have led the stock to plunge 30.9% year to date, wider than the  's 21.7% decline.Nevertheless, Molson Coors' restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability look promising. These initiatives included closure of underperforming breweries, improvement of efficiencies in finance, administration and human resources, and reduction of labor and general overhead costs. Additionally, the company has been making efforts to improve its supply-chain network and build on efficiencies across the business to generate additional resources for investing in brand building and innovation. These cost-saving efforts are likely to result in the company's EBITDA margin expansion.Molson Coors also remains on track with its First Choice plan, which is likely to improve its top and bottom lines. The First Choice plan aims at solidifying and preimmunizing portfolio, enhancing customer relations and generating significant profits from international businesses through improved capability, productivity and continued cost savings. Notably, this approach supports its key priorities, including cash generation, margin improvement and enhancing shareholder returns. Additionally, the company focuses on expanding its portfolio through acquisitions besides having a robust brand portfolio.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings estimates in the third quarter.

Let's find out what's in store for Newell in the upcoming earnings release.Newell has been grappling with lower core sales, adverse pricing and commodity cost inflation, which are hurting its top-line performance. Evidently, sales lagged estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, including the last reported quarter. Apart from missing the estimates in second-quarter 2018, the metric declined 12.8% year over year on account of the new revenue recognition standard and adverse impact of last year's divestitures. The Baby division's disrupted business along with a significant inventory destocking in the Writing division's office superstore and distributive trade channels further affected the company's top line. Additionally, core sales were hurt by a sharp decline in the Learning & Development segment (Writing and Baby) and weakness across the coolers, tents and fresh preserving businesses due to the late arrival of Spring across most parts of the United States.Management expects core sales to be down low-single digits in the third quarter. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues stands at $2,323 million, reflecting a decline of 36.7% from the year-ago period.Meanwhile, Newell has been witnessing weak margins for the past few quarters. Despite gains from cost synergies and savings, the absence of earnings related to divested businesses, commodity cost inflation, adverse product mix as well as increased advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment have been weighing on its margins. Although the company anticipates the second half of 2018 to be less severe than the first half, it still expects the retail backdrop to remain challenging. These factors may act as a headwind to the company's third-quarter results as well.Consequently, shares of Newell have plunged 59.5% in a year, wider than the  's 15.9% decline.Nevertheless, Newell's Transformation Plan and robust brand portfolio are encouraging. The company remains focused on the execution of Transformation Plan through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement, and cost-saving plans. Also, it aims at right-sizing the cost structure for anticipated smaller net sales and recovering synergies lost through the divestitures. These efforts are expected to improve the company's operational performance and boost its shareholder value.Our proven model does not show that Newell is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

In constant-currency terms, adjusted earnings improved 9% from the year-ago period. | Core earnings exclude restructuring and impairment charges, and commodity mark-to-market net impact.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. In the past year, the industry's earnings estimate for the current year has declined by 10.6%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.The Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry has lagged the broader Zacks Consumer Staples Sector as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.The industry has declined 15.2% over this period compared to the S&P 500 index's rise of 7.2% and broader sector's fall of 14.7%.On the basis of forward12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing soft drinks companies, we see that the industry's currently trading at 19.07X compared to the S&P 500's 16.29X. It is also above the sector's forward-12-month P/E of 17.4X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.94X, as low as 17.04X and at the median of 20.23X, as the chart below shows.The soft drinks market should gradually recover backed by product innovation and introduction of healthier alternatives. However, the impact of tariff on steel and aluminum will remain near-term operational headwinds to these companies.None of the stocks in the Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks space currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). However, we are presenting two stocks with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that are well positioned to grow combating the challenges. There is another stock with Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that investors may currently hold on to.You can see  .

This Zacks Rank #2 stock has rallied 9% in two years.  (FMX), alias FEMSA: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock gained 3.2% in the past year.

Nevertheless, it pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 5.4% in the trailing four quarters. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings remains stable at $2.58 over the last 30 days but reflects a year-over-year growth of 4.5% from the prior-year quarter.Increased marketing expenses due to product launches and rise in transportation costs at both the beer and wine segments have been hurting Constellation Brands' operating performance. Evidently, the company reported soft margins in first-quarter fiscal 2019, with gross margin contracting 80 basis points (bps) and operating margin declining 320 bps. At the beer segment, operating margin shriveled 230 bps due to planned marketing expenses pertaining to the launch of Corona Premier and Corona Familiar alongside increased transportation and unfavorable currency. The wine and spirits segment reported operating margin contraction of 430 bps due to higher cost of goods sold and increased marketing investments on key focus brands and product innovations. Higher expenses might continue denting margins in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Furthermore, the market remains concerned about the outcome of its recent $5 billion investment to expand stake in Canada's Canopy Growth. Stiff competition, higher debt position and taxes remain added concerns.Nevertheless, Constellation Brands' robust beer business has been significantly boosting the company's performance. Solid portfolio depletions and market share gains mainly stemmed from strength in Modelo and Corona brands. New products, including Corona Premier and Familiar, have also been contributing to the segment's results. For the beer segment, management continues to expect high-single digit volume growth as well as 9-11% net sales and operating income growth in fiscal 2019. This apart, Constellation Brands' bullish outlook for the fiscal year indicates that the company is likely to report strong results in the fiscal second quarter.Constellation Brands' top-line performance in recent quarters has also been impressive. It has delivered sales beat in nine out of the trailing 11 quarters. Significant market share gains, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and solid execution have also been aiding the company's performance. Investments in digital enablement for e-commerce initiatives and the new ERP platform as part of the 'Fit for Growth' strategy are also commendable. Further, the company's solid lineup of marketing and promotional activities positions it well for growth through fiscal 2019.Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect quarterly revenues of $2.24 billion, up 7.6% year over year.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Constellation Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates in the fiscal second quarter.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Tuesday, shares of Monster Beverage Corp (Symbol: MNST) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.9, after changing hands as low as $56.18 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 67.6.

However, it has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 36.3% in the last four quarters. Meanwhile, revenues lagged estimates in four of the preceding six quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $1.02, reflecting a year-over-year plunge of 79.6%. Notably, estimates have been stable over the past 30 days. Additionally, consensus mark for revenues is $6.16 billion, down 4.2% from the year-ago quarter number.The question lingering in investors' minds is, whether or not FEMSA will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Apart from a dismal surprise history, FEMSA has been witnessing soft margins due to higher raw material costs in certain markets that are hurting its Coca-Cola FEMSA division. In the last reported quarter, soft operating margins at Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Comercio's Retail division dented the company's consolidated operating margin. At Coca-Cola, operating margin was hurt by non-cash operating foreign exchange loss in Mexico, incremental costs related to acquisitions and higher sweetener costs in the Philippines. Operating margin contraction at FEMSA Comercio's Retail division can be attributed to higher operating expenses due to initiatives to strengthen compensation for in-store personnel, higher transportation costs and accelerated store openings.Additionally, FEMSA's bottling business is likely to be affected by rising aluminum costs owing to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. These issues are likely to remain major concerns in the upcoming quarter as well.Despite these aforementioned headwinds, FEMSA's strategic efforts to expand the store base, diversify the business portfolio and focus on the core business activities are encouraging. Also, the company's efforts to achieve growth via acquisitions is commendable. In order to strengthen its retail portfolio, FEMSA acquired Big John - a grocery store, in Santiago, Chile. Moreover, FEMSA has been diversifying its retail chain format operations by acquiring businesses across Latin America.FEMSA's venture into the drugstore business also strategically fits its chain store business and will be accretive to both its top and bottom lines in the future. The company's exposure in various industries, including beverage, beer and retail, gives it an edge over competitors.Our proven model does not conclusively show that FEMSA is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

In the last-reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.6%. It also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 4%.PepsiCo has been trying to improve performance through product launches, fortifying developing/emerging market presence, aggressive marketing, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives. Success of the company's initiatives was well reflected in second-quarter 2018 earnings, which were driven by strong international performance on the back of revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.Moreover, the company's fundamental strength is evident from its solid brand portfolio, product innovation and strong snacks business. Notably, PepsiCo has delivered positive earnings surprise for nine consecutive quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the quarter to be reported is $1.56 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 5.4%. We note that the consensus mark for the to-be-reported quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.4 billion, reflecting 1.2% growth from the prior-year quarter. | However, consumers' awareness on health and wellness, new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, and rising regulatory pressure affecting CSD sales have been major killjoys for the industry. Consequently, the beverage industry is witnessing sluggish CSD (carbonated soft drinks) volumes, which is a pressing concern. CSD volumes for PepsiCo's North America Beverages ('NAB') business decreased 2% in the second quarter of 2018. Looking back, PepsiCo's CSD volumes declined 2% each in 2014 and 2015, 1% in 2016, and 5% in 2017 in the NAB business.As a result, PepsiCo stock has declined over the past month, reflecting a negative sentiment ahead of earnings. The company's shares have dipped 0.4%. However, the stock has rallied 3.4% in the last three months, outperforming the  's increase of 2.1%.Consumer taste is rapidly shifting from CSDs to non-carbonated beverages. To this end, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier alternatives. Currently, a major portion of PepsiCo's total net revenues comes from \"Guilt-Free\" products, more than half of which comes from the \"Everyday Nutrition\" category.Revenues from its Everyday Nutrition portfolio have increased to 27.5% of total revenues. This percentage is likely to increase, given the company's stepped up innovation and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences.PepsiCo has also broadened its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to decrease dependence on colas, keeping in mind the slowdown in CSD volumes. The company has been growing value share in a number of its fastest-growing categories, including tea, enhanced water and sparkling water. Meanwhile, tea portfolio under Lipton and Pure Leaf has grown retail sales in the range of a mid-single digit to as high as 21% over the past 17 quarters.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:PepsiCo does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

Now,  reports that Coke is considering a $3.9 billion bid for Horlicks, a malt-based \"health drink\" currently owned by  (NYSE: GSK) .The beverage brand, which has a 44.1% share of India's malt-based food drink market, according to  , could also attract offers from other global beverage players, including  and  . Coke, it should be made clear, has not publicly declared its interest.Horlicks is marketed as a healthy way for kids to get nutrition. Image source: GlaxoSmithKline.As soda sales have slowed, Coca-Cola has worked to diversify its portfolio. That has included a partnership with energy-drink maker  , expansion into water-based drinks and juices, and the  . Owning the coffee brand will help Coke not only expand into an area where it has been weak (hot beverages), but will also let the company plug the product into its existing channels where appropriate.Horlicks does not offer as much opportunity as Costa, but it would expand Coke's offerings into a new category, and it has the apparatus to sell it in appropriate markets. This isn't soda, coffee, or really like anything else Coca-Cola already has a major brand in. Horlicks is a ready-to-drink beverage made from wheat, malt, milk, and barley, with a blend of vitamins and minerals \"that can be easily digested,\" according to a GlaxoSmithKline web page.The drink is marketed as being for children. It's a staple in many Indian households and has been sold for 145 years. There's no direct U.S. comparison for Horlicks, but it's somewhat similar to the Carnation Breakfast Essentials line (albeit with some differing ingredients).Acquiring the brand, which Coke has made no comment on publicly, would give the company a proven leader in its market. That's something CEO James Quincey was clear about wanting when he discussed the Costa deal.\"In the long run, being the leader is the greatest source of scale and profitability and return on capital,\" Quincey said during the conference call on the Costa deal, which was transcribed by  (registration required). \"It's better to be the leader in half the world than No. 3 in all of the world, from a scale and profitability point of view.\"Quincey said that he sees the beverage world becoming more complicated because \"it will be about 'Do we have the right beverage offering to command leadership channel-by-channel?'\"Basically, he believes that you need a portfolio of beverages that lead the way in each market. Having that will allow the company to build an overall brand that's a market leader. Coca-Cola already owns Thums Up, Limca, and Gold Spot, which are well-known brands in India.Horlicks is primarily sold in India, but Coca-Cola clearly has the ability to market it in other countries. That may or may not include the U.S., where drinks as alternative nutrition have generally been marketed toward older consumers in the form of products like Ensure or the various meal-replacement shakes offered as parts of diets.This deal would give Coca-Cola a product that has proved it can be a leader in a competitive market. That would strengthen the company's brand in an important market while giving it a beverage line it can grow in other countries.It's a move that fits the company's global ambitions. In addition, because Horlicks is marketed as a healthy drink, it would give the company another product that expands its reach beyond soda, deepening its brand story.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Net sales at the segment declined 6.8% to $79.8 million in the quarter. The downside was mainly due to the adoption of ASC 606.

This has resulted in a number of prominent names getting into acquisitions and partnerships as well as reorienting their strategies with the aim of building a healthier portfolio, which now holds the key to their survival.The latest buzz is The Coca-Cola Company's  plan to buy U.S.-based soft drink brand Moxie from its bottling partner Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England. Understandably, this is a move to diversify its product portfolio. Carbonated soft drinks sales have been struggling for a while now with an increasing number of health-conscious Americans preferring non-sugary drinks.On Aug 28, Coca-Cola reportedly said that it will be buying soda-based soft drink brand Moxie from its bottling partner Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England. However, none of the companies have disclosed the value of the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018. Moxie was invented two years before Coke in 1884.Upon acquisition, Moxie will become part of Coke's venturing and emerging brands. Coca-Cola in its most recent quarterly results reported that its revenues in North America rose primarily because of double-digit growth in sales of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. Understandably, much like the other brands, Coca-Cola is trying to redesign its portfolio at a time when an increasing number of people are shunning sugary drinks. This has seen a considerable decline in sales of carbonated drinks in the United States in the last few years.It's not only Coca-Cola but also other big players that are thinking on similar lines and going for acquisitions, with an increased focus on healthier drinks. On Aug 20, PepsiCo, Inc.  announced plans of acquiring Israeli at-home carbonated drink maker SodaStream International Ltd.  for $3.2 billion. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo each caries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while SodaStream sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see The acquisition will help PepsiCo to reach out to customers in their homes instead of stores. PepsiCo has been struggling in the United States, with a major shift in consumers' preference from sugary drinks.Other companies like Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.  , Monster Beverage Corporation  and Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V  too have been increasingly focusing on creating a portfolio that will cater to health-conscious consumers. In fact, Monster Beverage in its second-quarter earnings reported 14% year-over-year growth in its Monster energy drink category.U.S. beverage sales grew by $2.1 billion in 2017. However, sales were prompted by higher volumes of bottled water sales. Bottled water overtook carbonated soft drinks as the most-preferred beverage by volume in 2016, and continued its growth in 2017. Last year, bottled water accounted for $24.1 billion in sales.Shifting preference for healthier drinks has seen the carbonated soft drink market shrinking for 13 consecutive years now. Per Euromonitor, bottled water sales in the United States are anticipated to nearly equal that of sodas in volume terms in 2018.This has made a number of companies introduce flavored sparkling water. Companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper have tasted success with flavored sparkling water. Earlier this year, Coca-Cola introduced a range of flavors in smaller packages to its diet coke brand to attract new-generation drinkers. In February, PepsiCo too launched its new sparkling water line Bubly.Following PepsiCo's announcement of acquiring SodaStream and Coca-Cola eying Moxie, it can be said that major soft beverage manufacturers are aggressively expanding their portfolio. Understandably, this is in a move to stay ahead in the race at a time when customers' are opting for healthier drinks.Zacks Research has released a report that may shock many investors.

Shares have added about 0.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Monster Beverage due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. Monster Beverage posted mixed second-quarter 2018 results, wherein the bottom line beat estimates while the top line missed. Both earnings and sales improved on a year-over-year basis.Monster Beverage's earnings came in at 48 cents per share, up 23.8% year over year and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents.Net sales of $1,015.9 million increased 12% year over year but missed the consensus mark of $1,034 million. Foreign currency translation positively impacted net sales by $16.8 million, partly offset by $12.2 million adverse impact from the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606. Excluding the adoption of ASC 606, the top line grew 13.3% in the quarter.Outside the United States, net sales to customers totaled $293.8 million, up 18.5% year over year.Net sales at the segment, which includes Monster Energy and Mutant Super Soda drinks, were up 14% from the year-ago quarter to $929.4 million. The metric was somewhat hurt by $5.1 million owing to the adoption of ASC 606.This segment includes a range of energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (KO - Research Report). Net sales at the segment declined 6.8% to $79.8 million in the quarter. The downside was mainly due to the adoption of ASC 606.Net sales at the segment, which includes some products of American Fruits & Flavors sold to independent third parties, dipped 6.5% year over year to $6.6 million.Second-quarter 2018 gross margin contracted 320 basis points (bps) to 61.1%. The decline can be attributed to higher promotional allowances, the adoption of ASC 606, higher input costs as well as geographical and domestic product sales mix.Operating expenses, including $5.5 million of distributor termination expenses, increased 12.5% from the prior-year quarter to $262.6 million. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 11.4%, down 120 bps from second-quarter 2017.Operating income was $357.6 million, up 2.2% year over year. However, operating margin contracted 340 bps to 35.2%.Monster Beverage ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $659.7 million and total stockholders' equity of $3,605.2 million.Effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.6% compared with 35.9% in the prior-year quarter.Moreover, the company bought back roughly 10.6 million shares worth $553.2 million, excluding broker commissions. It had an outstanding authorization to buy back shares worth nearly $196.7 million under its May 2018 repurchase plan as of Aug 7, 2018. Additionally, management announced a new $500-million share repurchase program on Aug 7, 2018.Management remains encouraged with the company's quarterly results and is smoothly progressing with the strategic alignment with Coca-Cola system bottlers. Notably, it has launched Monster Energy brand with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Belarus, Tanzania and Uruguay besides re-launching the brand with a Coca-Cola bottler in certain cities across India. It plans for more international launches later in 2018.Also, Monster Beverage is optimistic about product launches and robust performance in its international markets.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.At this time, Monster Beverage has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Monster Beverage has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The energy-drink pioneer reported record quarterly net revenue that crossed the billion-dollar mark for the first time, landing at $1.02 billion. Profitability was pressured by a 320 basis-point decline in gross margin, however, and was one of the significant points that company management discussed with analysts on Monster's quarterly  .Let's review the essentials on this topic, as well as two other key exchanges from Wednesday's discussion, directly below.CEO Rodney Sacks' comments followed a more specific list of gross operating profit headwinds enumerated by CFO Hilton Schlosberg. These included rising aluminum import costs due to tariffs enacted by the Trump administration, increased promotional spends due to higher cooler placement fees and shelf costs, rising sales of lower margin coffee-based beverages, and climbing international sales, which are slightly less profitable than their domestic counterparts.The year-over-year decline of approximately 3 percentage points in gross margin (from 64.3% in the prior year to 61.1%) was the primary factor behind a 3.4 percentage-point dip in operating margin, from 38.6% in the second quarter of 2017 to 35.2% in Monster's most recent quarter.In the last sequential quarter (Q1 2018), management expressed uncertainty over the impact of the numerous factors responsible for current-year margin compression. At the time, I wrote that  .As a matter of policy, Monster avoids forward margin guidance. However, in the current call, CFO Schlosberg provided a more definitive reading, indicating that gross margin would settle in the 61% to 62% range over the next few quarters. This easing of investor concerns stems, in part, from an action we'll discuss in the next section.Image source: Getty Images.Of the various profitability pressures Monster is currently enduring, rising input costs (particularly in aluminum), as well as higher shipping costs can be addressed by price increases, as the company's products enjoy  at marginal price hikes. This means that Monster's loyal customers probably won't flinch if the cost of their favorite energy drink bumps up by a handful of percentage points.Pricing power in the beverage industry typically wins points with investors. That's because price adjustments rarely revert to prior levels -- with the exception of promotional discounts -- leading to even higher revenue as volume picks up.Yet, as Schlosberg warns, investors shouldn't conclude that some of the price increase will end up boosting gross margin. Rather, this is a move to  margin. As the CFO implies, given the volatility of aluminum spot pricing, there's no guarantee that the current price hike will even fully cover higher future costs.One of the most persuasive reasons to buy Monster Beverage shares lies in the company's long-term potential as it works to expand its global presence through the  network of bottling partners.  , this is a years-long effort and often entails  in countries where energy drinks still are a nascent category.Such is the case in China, and for that matter, India. Both countries are set to be a primary focus for Monster for the foreseeable future. Between them, they account for roughly 36% of the entire global population.During the , CEO Sacks observed that the company launched its namesake Monster brand in India in April and aims to complete a nationwide rollout this year. As for the importance of this market, Sacks stated: \"Hilton and I are both planning to go to India and review the markets and launch this ourselves personally within the next few months.\"For shareholders, there's a primary counterpoint to the potential in Asia, however. Currently, Asia-Pacific sales make up just 6% of total company net revenue. As you can glean from Sacks' words above on the \"long, slow build\" of the brand in China, that counterpoint is patience.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging.However, we are seeing positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 second quarter were negatively impacted by $12.2 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, under ASC 606, commissions paid to the Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which the Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses. In the second quarter, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 12% from $907.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13.3%.Net sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $16.8 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded second-quarter gross sales of $1.19 billion, up 14.7% from $1.04 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $21.4 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 second quarter was 61.1%, compared to 64.3% in the 2017 second quarter.The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in promotion allowances as a percentage of gross sales, the $12.2 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606, increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans and other costs, domestic product sales mix, and geographical sales mix. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 second quarter, as compared to 3% in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of $10.7 million, largely due to higher carrier cost contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.4%, compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.7%, as compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year.Included in general and administrative costs were distributed termination expenses of $5.5 million for the 2018 second quarter, as compared with $0.2 million in the comparable 2017 second quarter. In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $9 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters in litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $0.7 million in the 2018 second quarter, as compared to $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India.The losses in India were due to establishment costs incurred in advance of the launch, and in connection with the current rollout as well as the inventory reserves. Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter to 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction.Net income was $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter, compared to net income of $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of 21.3%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 to 566.4 million for the second quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 second quarter increased 23.8% to $0.48 from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2017. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally.We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts, and e-commerce. We reached agreements to transition Monster to Coca-Cola Bottlers in Arkansas. In the second quarter of 2018, we've transitioned parts of Arkansas and are planning on transitioning the remainder of Arkansas in the third quarter of 2018.In EMEA, we launched in Belarus and Tanzania. Further launches are planned in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. We plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 as an affordable energy brand in select Eastern European and African markets. During the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Uruguay, and relaunched Monster in Peru.In July, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Bolivia is on track to launch later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts toward establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India, where we launched Monster in April in a lead market.We have now expanded the launch to a number of larger cities, principally in the South and West regions of India. We plan to complete the national rollout in India by year end. Mutant, one of our affordable energy brands that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia, with launches in Myanmar and Vietnam during the third quarter of 2018.

According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended June 30, 2018, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, which now includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 22.3% over the same period last year.Sales of our Java Monster alone were 25.9% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 3.9% lower.

Vive 100 sales increased 14.6%, and its market share decreased 2 points to 38%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.5 points to 7.8%.The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.

Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $293.8 million in the 2018 second quarter, compared to $247.9 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S.dollars by approximately $16.8 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the second quarter increased 21.4% in dollars and 11.2% in local currencies over the same period last year.Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 27.5% in dollars and 17.3% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales for the quarter, was 43.8%, compared to 49% in the same quarter last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 46.5% for the second quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales.We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the second quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Austria; Ultra Red in Switzerland, Romania, Slovenia, Bosnia and Croatia; Ultra Sunrise in Croatia and Slovenia; and Ultra Violets in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We're also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.In Asia Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 5.8% in dollars and 2.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales would have been 7.5% in dollars and 3.9% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, was 49% versus 50.7% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 49.8%.The decrease in the gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales.

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $659.7 million, compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017.Short-term investments were $211.1 million, compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. At the end of the quarter, we held no long-term investments. Accounts receivable increased to $592.6 million at June 30, 2018 from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 45.2 days, compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017.Inventories increased to $275.6 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory was 62.7 days at June 30, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017. In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mule, a ginger-flavored energy drink, exclusively with the large regional convenience store customer. Initial results have been positive.In Canada, in the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Green and Zero Ultra in a slim 310 ml can, and the collector's edition of Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink in a 473 ml can. We also launched Monster Mango Loco with 7-Eleven in Canada this June, and we'll roll out nationally in Canada during the third quarter of 2018. Following the launch of Monster Hydro in the first quarter in Sweden and Germany, we launched Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in France and [Inaudible] in Ireland in June 2018. In the first half of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Great Britain and Sweden, along with Monster Pipeline Punch in Great Britain, Belgium, France, and Germany; and Relentless Kiwi-- Apple Kiwi in Great Britain.We also recently launched Mutant as an affordable energy drink in Pakistan and Cambodia. In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea. We are planning for approximately a 4% increase in our pricing to our customers effective November 1, 2018, for Monster and January 1, 2019, for NOS and Full Throttle. We estimate the July 2018 growth sales to be approximately 15.9% higher than in July 2017.On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.7% higher than in July 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 has not been included in determining these figures. July had 1 extra selling day in 2018. In this regard, we caution, again, that sales have a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors.Such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally on-- for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month or even two months, should not necessarily be imputed to or be regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2018 second quarter, the company purchased approximately 10.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $52.42 per share for a total of $553.2 million, excluding growth of commissions. As of August 7, 2018, approximately $196.7 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program.On August 7, 2018, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional 500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the company's continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries.Two, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. Three, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Four, we are excited by the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate our-- the growth potential for us in China and India.Six, we are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain markets. And I would like-- now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter.Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time if you would like to ask a question-- -- Sorry, just-- sorry. Could I just make-- just one clarification. The price increase I referred to is related to the U.S.Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen-- -- Sorry. Thank you.My pleasure. [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. -- Good afternoon. -- Rodney, just talk about international sales growth a little bit. We saw some deceleration across all three regions. Anything to note there or is it just part of normal volatility in these markets? -- We think it's part of the normal operations. There have been some sort of some noise. Some countries were higher than others. We are looking at it, but we think that it's, again also distorted in some cases by monthly numbers.We are seeing quite big differences in the monthly numbers as we see them come through from overseas markets. So I think we'll just wait and see what the trend is going to be when we go through the third quarter. -- Yeah, I think that's fair. If you look at the consolidated foreign numbers, including Canada, net sales grew at 18.69%. So we also have to adjust for ASC 606. So there are some variabilities in that, and overall we haven't seen a slowing in sales.There's just been some issues in certain countries, which we believe will correct themselves in the next few months. -- Any abnormal inventory builds in any market that's worth pointing out to? -- No. Actually, there was inventory issues in the quarter, mainly in Europe, where unfortunately, there was insufficient production capacity to satisfy demand. They're having a very hot summer in Europe, as you know, and we've had some production challenges in Europe. So, to the contrary, it's lower inventories rather than higher inventories.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Hey, thanks, and good afternoon, guys. -- Hi, Mark. -- So, just a quick follow up on the last one and then another question. In Asia, it sounded like that was a little bit weaker. Maybe any sort of update on what's going on in China? Was there any sort of impact there from lapping the sell in from a year ago? And then shifting to the U.S., just curious, anything you're seeing domestically? It looked like the trends, if I looked at it correctly, were a little bit below what the scanner data said consumption looked like, you said that online and on-track was doing well. So I don't know, anything that you see there that may have explained the delta? -- Well, I think you'll always see a discrepancy between Nielsen and ourselves. And we've discussed this many times on various calls that we sell to our distributors. We also have some direct customers, but in the main, our sales go to our distributors. They sell to their customers, and their customers sell to retail.So you'll always see the discrepancy between Nielsen, which is retail sales, and our own sales. And what I've always advised is the real test is not what we're selling, but the real test is what's coming off the shelves. -- Yeah. With regard to China, we've just really focused on the top cities. There was probably a little bit of additional inventory in the pipeline and with distributors from last year going into summer, which we needed to work through, and our distributors to work through because we didn't-- in order to get them fresh inventory. We've done it under the cap promotion this summer in China, which has done nicely, and we are slowly starting to build up some core repeat business and consumers focused on the modern trade in the main-- in the top, I think, as we said, 40 cities.So it's a slow build. It's steady. We are planning to launch Monster Ultra in China later this year and to roll it out again slowly. It won't be in all the business units initially.It will be in the business units where we feel they're able to handle it better. So we do have some plans to expand the product line with an additional launch next summer early in 2019. We believe this is-- it is sort of appropriate and necessary for us. It'll help us, we think, get visibility for our brand on the shelves, which is one of the things we've referred to in earlier calls is it's been hard for us to have a smaller-sized can and get recognized with a single can in stores, and particularly in Coke coolers where some of the Coke products have similar size cans.So, we believe that the additional products will continue to help build the brand. So we're pretty positive on the build in China, but it is going to be a long, slow build. But ultimately, we think that the brand is going to continue to do well. And as we've said, the new products we've done some initial taste tests of them.They've been very well received. So we're pretty excited. The first product will be Ultra, and the next product will be our Mango Loco product for China. -- Yeah, I think the only thing I would add to that, Mark, is that remember we were rolling out China last year. So there was a buildup of inventory gain to the system last year. And Japan was good in the quarter. Korea was good in the quarter.So overall, I think we were satisfied with the numbers bearing in mind the differences in various countries. -- OK. Thanks, guys. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. -- Hi, Nik. -- Hi. A modeling question and then another question. On modeling, can you just-- I know you don't want to give guidance for margins, etc., but just to help us think about it going forward, can you just rank order the factors weighing on gross margins kind of most impactful to least just to give us a better understanding? Because I guess when we look at the P&L and we look at the year-ago compares, promotional allowances are always listed first when you talk about gross margin pressure, and I know we're going to start lapping some of the Java promotional dollars as you are getting it back on the shelf. So, that's the first question on gross margin.And then the second, the bigger picture question is, at the shareholder meeting, you talked about talking to the Coca-Cola Company about Mutant and potentially a new arrangement around that brand, and I just wanted to know if there is any progress there? Thanks. -- OK. Well, if I could just answer the first question. Remember on a previous call, I spoke about a personal view about margins what I felt about personally. So if you go back to the number that I gave you then and you look at this quarter, you adjust for ASC 606, and you adjust for the issues that we have had to sustain in increased aluminum prices relating to increases in aluminum can purchases, you'll find that the number is just kind of within-- is in that number.So the margin adjusting for those two factors alone was just above 62%. So while we talk about promotional answers and that is a fact and, yes, promotional answers are up, and one of the big reasons for that is increased shelf costs and cooler placement fees. There is a reduction in margin as we continue to sell products such as the coffee product, Muscle Monster, Caff\u00e9 Monster that are lower than the Monster cold food products. And then added to that, you have the issue of international sales where the margins are not as high as the U.S.margins. So I hope that's given you a good feel about the margin structure. -- Only thing I would add on to the margins is in addition, there's also been a switch between the proportion between we have strategic brands which have concentrated models which have higher margins and Monster. And Monster is continuing to grow ahead of the strategic brand, so that continues to put some pressure on the margin as well. So you take all those three factors on product mix, geographic mix, and mix between the actual product, the Monster versus strategic brands and that has had that effect. -- So, what I'm looking at here is that if you rank them in order, the point that Rodney mentioned was kind of at the bottom. So you've got all those other factors, plus you've got the strategic brands Monster percentages. And that should give you a full explanation to your question. -- Very helpful. And then on Mutant? -- On Mutant, we have not made progress with the Coke Company on a different model. We're sort of reevaluating Mutant. We think that Mutant in the U.S. is probably something that's-- we're probably going to tailor off and sort of refocus our attention.We're actually spending we think too much time and effort on the brand, and we just don't feel that that's where we would be best spent going forward.So I think that we're going to focus on newer products. We have some additional new product lines and some positioning in the Monster brand in the U.S. I think we're going to focus on that. We will continue to-- have regard to Mutant as I indicated earlier internationally as an energy brand and Predator depending on the different markets.But at this point, we just don't see the reward and payback for Mutant in the U.S., so that seems to be something that we're de-emphasizing and moving away from I think going forward.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. -- Thank you, all. Hi. Good afternoon, there. I just wanted to actually explore a little bit more on the pricing.First of all, if you're seeing any signs of potential moves from your competitors? And then if you can kind of elaborate more if you're thinking of pricing also internationally. I know the pressures from COGS are less so of aluminum, but perhaps because of some places where FX may be going the other way, it hasn't been the case of course for you guys, but if you see some room for international pricing as well. Thank you. -- Well, we only really recently announced the pricing increase. Yeah, so we've really not really had any input back or heard anything back from our competitors. So we really can't give you much direction in that regard. We believe that they are undoubtedly also facing the same price and cost increases that we have, so we would believe that they probably will follow similarly, but we don't have any indication on that. -- And then internationally, as we've always advised, we are the smaller player in many international markets and we price according to the leading competitor. And we just have to ensure that we are priced correctly relative to that competitor to be able to capture a good share of the market. So we would not lead-- necessarily lead internationally without the lead competitor going first. -- But that being said, with all of the uncertainty that's been happening in the world with the aluminum price and some other raw material price increases, we are keeping a watch in different countries. And as and when there are price adjustments by leading brands and other competitors in those markets, we will react to that and obviously look at the opportunities as well individually for taking up pricing as and when we think that that's appropriate. But we are certainly focusing initially now on the U.S. pricing, and then-- which is the largest impact on our business, and then we will look at-- probably early in the New Year look at the international markets.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. Good evening, guys. I was hoping for a follow up on the pricing, and then maybe some commentary on India. The follow up on the pricing is just to what extent will the pricing that you announced cover the input cost inflation that you're seeing? Is it adequate to cover all of it? Is it a large portion of it? Some commentary there would be helpful.And then help me just building on sounds like a loose guidance or your personal view before with the 62%. We've seen this with the presence of negative geographic mix, promotion, etc. So, in theory, while those things will still be present to some degree, pricing has not been obviously. So, should we be thinking about something a little bit better than that 62% as we get into Q4 and then looking out to next year? And then, Rodney, a broader question on India.Maybe talk a little bit about sort of early indications there, and how you're defining success in that market? Thank you for all that. -- OK. So, you're kind of getting greedy. The price increase should cover increases in input costs and the increases in freight. But who knows where they're going to go from there.I mean, today aluminum shot up again based on a number of factors. So as we sit here now, the pricing should contain our cost increases. Will we get more? I don't know, and I honestly I wouldn't consider even discussing more on this call because it's just too premature. -- Yeah, if we increase pricing, I mean, it's not going to have an effect through to us, certainly not in the current year. And then talking about India, we've had a controlled rollout, literally by city and surrounding region-by-region basis. It's gone well. We are seeing some good response.There is a recognition of the brand from when we were there many years before when we did sort of rollout and we were in India. We had a very limited presence but the brand was there, so we are seeing some recognition of the brand, which is good sort of very different to China where we really obviously had no brand recognition while we've launched. So, it is different, and we are-- but it really is premature. Hilton and I are both planning to go to India and review the markets and launch this ourselves personally within the next few months, but at this point it just is premature for us to comment on really what is happening there and how it's going.We're getting some good anecdotal reports but that's not sufficient for us to be comfortable to give you a direction from the company at this point yet. -- OK. Thank you. Good luck. -- Thank you.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So, now it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, for closing comments and remarks. -- Thanks, everyone. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally.We're also particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going through with our portfolio together with our strategic brands as well as Hydro, Mutant, and Predator in the affordable energy sector in many Eastern European, African, and other markets where that sector is continuing to show good growth opportunities. Thank you very much for your attendance.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  -- The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ou won't find many stocks with better long-term performance than  (NASDAQ: MNST) . The innovative beverage company played a vital role in creating a whole new category of drinks, and it has held onto its leadership role in the energy-drink space for years. Yet as Monster grew from a tiny, fast-growing small-cap stock to a big player in the beverage business, shareholders have had to get used to seeing growth rates decline and opportunities for significant expansion become more difficult to find.Coming into Wednesday's second-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors still wanted to see double-digit growth rates in sales and profits, and the company was able to deliver on that score. Yet Monster's numbers also reveal some ongoing areas in which it hasn't yet found permanent solutions to maximize its full potential. Until it does, some investors won't be satisfied even with  .Image source: Monster.Monster Beverage's second-quarter results were very much in line with expectations. Net sales were higher by 13% to $1.02 billion, matching the consensus forecast among those following the stock. Similarly, net income climbed 21% to $270.1 million, matching last quarter's growth rate. The resulting earnings of $0.48 per share topped what investors had expected to see by $0.01 per share.As  , Monster's legacy energy drink division was much stronger than some of its other businesses. For the core unit, sales were higher by 14%. By contrast, the company saw a 7% decline in revenue in its strategic brands division, which is where Monster reports the results of the brands that it got from  (NYSE: KO) as part of their broader strategic partnership. Even when you account for some revisions related to changes in accounting rules, strategic brands only managed a 1.5% rise, showing the relative lack of importance for the former Coke part of Monster's portfolio. Other revenue was higher by 7%, contributing just a tiny amount to overall gains.International growth played an outsized role for Monster, which saw an 18.5% rise in sales overseas. Higher promotional activity once again hit gross margin hard, causing a drop of more than three percentage points to 61.1%. Among other items, Monster said that higher prices for aluminum cans played a role in margin deterioration. Case volume soared 13% to 110 million, but net sales per case were down $0.10 to $9.17.CEO Rodney Sacks celebrated Monster's milestone in seeing quarterly revenue top the $1 billion mark. \"We continue to progress our strategic alignment with the Coca-Cola system bottlers,\" Sacks noted as he did last quarter, and the CEO pointed to product launches in areas like Belarus, Tanzania, Uruguay, and key cities in India as helping to drive future growth.Monster sees plenty of further growth potential. Arkansas should complete its transition to Coca-Cola bottlers this quarter, and the July launch of Monster Energy in Ecuador is just the first of several international launches that the company is planning for the remainder of 2018.Stock repurchase activity sped up for Monster. Buybacks added up to 10.6 million, with Monster paying $553.2 million for an average share price of $52.42. With another brand new $500 million authorization for further buybacks, Monster investors can expect the rapid pace of repurchases to continue into the future.Yet Monster Beverage shareholders haven't been satisfied with how the company has done lately, and today was no different, with the stock dropping 4% in after-hours trading following the announcement. To move forward more aggressively, Monster needs to figure out how to get more value out of the legacy Coke brands in its portfolio while reawakening faster growth rates for its most popular Monster brands. If it can do so, then the rest of 2018 could bring a clearer recovery for Monster Beverage's business.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The merged company is the seventh-largest company in the U.S. food and beverage sector, and the third-largest beverage company in North America. It will report second-quarter 2018 results before the market opens.With combined revenues of nearly $11 billion, the new Keurig Dr Pepper combines Dr Pepper Snapple's drink and distribution network with Keurig' Green Mountain's coffee business. Notably, the company generates a large chunk of its revenues from distributing drinks made by other companies, including brands like Fiji Water, BodyArmor and Vita Coco. This is done through Dr Pepper Snapple's \"Allied Brands\" network. Before the merger, Dr Pepper Snapple generated about 18% of its revenues in 2017 from distribution deals with beverage companies that it doesn't own - mostly its Allied Brand partners.Following the completion of the merger, the new company failed to renegotiate distribution terms with one of the key Allied brands - Fiji, which generated nearly 2% of its total revenues. While this represents big loss, the company recently signed an agreement with to add Big Red to its portfolio. It also agreed to add two coffee drinks to the Allied Brands network - Forto Coffee Energy Shots and Peet's Ready-to-Drink Iced Expresso. It will distribute Forto throughout its network and Peet's primarily through its network of convenience stores. These additions provide scope for covering up the lost revenues from the loss of Fiji.Altogether, the company's distribution strategy is likely to benefit the company, as it is open to supporting partnership brands, even if it does not own them. Moreover, the company remains poised to gain from Dr Pepper's Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) cost-saving program, solid execution innovation, and powerful marketing and productivity programs. Further, Keurig's online presence will boost sales through digital platforms.However, we believe that the CSD category headwinds will continue to impact the company's volumes, including the diet versions, due to Dr Pepper's strong portfolio of carbonated beverages. Cross-category competition, and growing health and wellness consciousness among consumers are hurting CSD category growth. Moreover, new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales. These general constraints in the soft drinks business are likely to continue impacting the newly formed company.Our proven model does not show that Keurig Dr Pepper is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

However, it has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 2% in the trailing four quarters. Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings of 47 cents has moved north in the last 30 days and represents 20.5% year-over-year improvement. | Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming earnings release.Monster Beverage's constant efforts to innovate products and brand launches are likely to boost revenues, which is impressive. The company regularly introduces new flavors of existing products and discards non-performing products. We expect the company's top line to gain from the planned launch Monster Ultra Citron in Korea and Cuba Libre in Japan in the second quarter. In 2018, management intends to launch various products in both the company's domestic and international markets. In Ecuador and Uruguay, Monster brand is expected to be launched later this year.This apart, Monster Beverage remains optimistic about product benefits from the broader distribution network, as a result of the Coca-Cola deal. In fact, the company has been expanding its international operations into a variety of new markets, including launches in China and various African and Middle Eastern countries. Notably, its gross sales to customers outside the United States were roughly 28% of consolidated gross sales for 2017.The company has also been smoothly expanding in the United States in non-traditional channels, which include foodservice, accounts and e-commerce. Additionally, energy drinks comprising Monster Energy, Monster Hydro and Mutant Super Soda drinks should continue gaining momentum.All these initiatives are expected to boost the company's top line in the second quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $1,034 million, reflecting an increase of 13% year over year. Moreover, the stock has gained 12.8% in a year's time, outperforming the  's 3% growth.However, higher raw material costs, mainly aluminum; and unfavorable product mix continue to remain hurdles.

Here's why these three Fool.com writers believe  (NYSE: SQ) ,  (NYSE: BAC) , and  (NYSE: COF) are a better bet for your portfolio. The main problem with investing in penny stocks is that you're taking a  gamble. Many penny stocks' underlying businesses don't have any real revenue, and some are outright scams. Financial disruptor Square has penny stock-like growth potential, but with an established business with excellent growth.Square's core business of payment-processing hardware is absolutely thriving, and in addition to its original target of small business customers, the company's recently introduced Square Register standalone point-of-sale system is bringing more medium- and large-sized businesses into Square's ecosystem.Speaking of Square's ecosystem, in addition to payment hardware, Square's Cash app is gaining major traction and is among the most popular peer-to-peer payments app. Square Capital, the company's business lending platform, is making more loans every quarter. And that's just naming a few of Square's products.Square's revenue grew by 43% last year, and instead of slowing down, analysts are expecting this growth to accelerate this year. And considering Square's  , it's not surprising. In fact, an analyst from  wrote that \"we believe Square has penetrated only about 1% of its addressable opportunity.\" So even if Square can capture, say, 5% of its potential, the stock could still have a long way to climb. In a nutshell, Square is a great combination of the growth potential investors hope for when buying penny stocks and an actual rock-solid business.Image source: Getty Images. Sure, you might throw a few chips on the table and win money once in a while with penny stocks, but they're more akin to gambling than investing. If you want a smarter place to park your cash, consider a tried and true winner like Bank of America.I know what you're thinking: \"Wait, isn't this the same Bank of America that nearly collapsed during the financial crisis, and then tried to charge members to use their debit cards a few years later?\" Well, yeah, it is. But it's also a banking giant that's come a long way from where it was even five years ago.Now that we've moved past the numerous fines and settlements Bank of America paid that were primarily tied to its Countrywide Financial acquisition in regard to mortgage practices, we're getting a much clearer picture of what the company is capable of.During the second quarter, Bank of America saw net income jump 33% (  ), driven by lower corporate tax rates and higher interest rates, while total loans and deposits, the backbone of banking,  , respectively.In particular, Bank of America tends to be more sensitive to interest rate fluctuations than of the money center banks. Its earnings presentation calls for an additional $2.8 billion in net interest income (most of which will go directly to its bottom line) if short- and long-term interest rates rise by 100 basis points over the next 12 months. Given a somewhat hawkish Federal Reserve of late, this isn't out of the question.And while traditional banking activity has picked up, the company has seen its legacy nonperforming loans dwindle. Even with a modest $88 million increase to net charge-offs to $996 million, representing a low net charge-off ratio of 0.43%, nonperforming assets declined by $946 million to $6.18 billion.All told, we have a money-center bank that raised its dividend by 25% and just pledged to buy back over $20 billion worth of its stock over the next 12 months. Let's see a penny stock do that! This company may be best known for its  , but Capital One is a true consumer and commercial banking institution. About 47% of its loan portfolio comes from credit cards. Commercial and consumer loans -- autos, primarily -- make up 29% and 25% of its portfolio, respectively.Capital One's main advantage is having a data-driven approach to credit. From a standing start in the 1990s, it issued roughly 50 million cards in just eight years, using data to target households one by one with specialized offers, an innovation that was others only later copied.That approach hasn't changed. The company isn't afraid to test new products, nor is it afraid to cut and run from losers. Last year, it made the difficult, but economic, decision to leave behind home equity lending, for example.Capital One has also invested heavily to build out a deposit franchise, which is paying dividends as interest rates rise. Though it pays a competitive market rate on savings deposits of roughly 1% per year, deposits are the least expensive way to fund its balance sheet. It's better to pay a market rate for deposits than a market rate on corporate bonds.Shares trade at less than 9 times consensus earnings estimates this year, as investors worry about an eventual rise in charge-offs following several years of below-average credit losses. But given Capital One's below-average loss experience over its history, especially in the depths of the financial crisis, and its beefed up allowances for loan losses, I believe Capital One can thrive even if loan losses tick up from near historical lows.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Additionally, the company's surprise history reveals that it has delivered an earnings beat in four of the last five quarters while sales lagged estimates in two of the last three quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents per share for second-quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. However, the estimate reflects year-over-year decline of 10.3%. | Let's find out what's in store for Newell in the upcoming second-quarter earnings release.Newell has been struggling lately on accounts of lower core sales, adverse pricing and commodity cost inflation, which has weighed on its top-line performance in the last few quarters. Also, it is witnessing weak margins for a few quarters now. In first-quarter 2018, the company's top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year on accounts of the adverse impact of last year's divestitures, net of buyouts. Moreover, the top line was hurt by the disrupted business of Baby division along with a considerable inventory destocking in the Writing division's office superstore and distributive trade channels.Additionally, core sales fell 3.5% due to a decline across all segments, except for the Work division. Further, soft sales at Writing and Baby segments, along with adverse pricing and commodity cost inflation, are other factors that are adversely impacting core sales growth. The company projects core sales to be flat to down in a low-single-digit rate in 2018. The Zacks Consensus revenue estimate for the second quarter is $3.84 billion, down 5.3% from the year-ago period.However, the consensus estimate for revenues of $1,196 million, $853 million, $749 million and $647 million, respectively, for Live, Learn, Play and Work segments reflect sequential growth of 11.6%, 72.3%, 21.4% and 1%.Nonetheless, Newell has been witnessing weak gross and operating margins for the last few quarters. Despite gains from cost synergies and savings, the absence of earnings related to divested businesses, commodity cost inflation, adverse product mix, as well as increased advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment, have been weighing upon margins. These factors might hurt the overall profitability in the second quarter, apprehending which investors' sentiments have taken a hit.Consequently, shares of the company have plunged 32% year to date, wider than the  's decline of 6.6%.Despite the odds, Newell remains on track with the execution of its transformation plan through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement and cost-saving plans. Further, it is looking for strategic alternatives for assets in the industrial and commercial products as well as smaller consumer businesses. The strategic alternatives for these brands will significantly lower the company's operational complexity by reducing 50% of its global factory and warehouse presence. On the completion of these plans, Newell is expected to become a nearly $11-billion focused portfolio company, with leading consumer-facing brands, impressive margins and significant growth potential in global categories.Moreover, Newell's Project Renewal Program continues to focus on saving costs in the areas of procurement by reducing the complexity of its business, and simplifying the manufacturing and distribution processes through further overhead reduction. In addition, it intends to use a major portion of the savings to accelerate growth by investing it in business while the remaining cost savings are expected to reflect in earnings. These savings are also expected to boost margins, cash flow and further investments.We remain cautious about Newell's performance in the upcoming quarter, albeit, the company is poised well for growth in the long term.Our proven model does not show that Newell is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $58.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $56.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MNST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $58.99/share today.Because the $58.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

It has pulled off an average negative earnings surprise of 12.7% in the trailing four quarters.Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.84, reflecting 10.8% growth year over year. Estimates were revised downward in the past 30 days. | Let's see how things are shaping prior to the earnings announcement.Apart from a dismal earnings trend, Molson Coors has missed sales estimates for the last seven quarters. The company has been witnessing softness in the U.S. beer category, which in turn is hurting its top- and bottom-line performance. It has been posting weak beer volumes in the United States for quite some time due to tough industry conditions. In fact, consumers' changing preferences, aging population and strong competition from other alcohol beverages have been the primary reasons behind the company's bleak performance.Furthermore, soft financial and royalty volumes, unfavorable global mix, impact of indirect tax provision cycling in Europe and adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard negatively impacted the company's sales in the first quarter of 2018. Consequently, the top line decreased 4.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.05 billion, down 1.4% from the year-ago actual figure. The estimate for net sales in the United States, Europe and Canada stands at $2,075 million, $578 million and $407 million, respectively. In the year-ago quarter, the company's revenues from these three segments came in at $2,138.9 million, $524.7 million and $407.6 million, respectively.Also, Molson Coors continues to battle input cost inflation, which has been posing challenges for a while now. Management expects these hurdles to linger in 2018, and it reiterated the company's previously issued COGS per hectoliter outlook for the United States and Canada. For 2018, the company expects cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in low-single-digits across these segments. In Europe, it anticipates cost pressure to increase on rising costs of key inputs like aluminum, and higher freight and fuel expenses. These hurdles, in turn, might hurt Molson Coors' bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.So far this year, shares of the company have lost 20.7%, wider than the  's decline of 6.5%.Nevertheless, Molson Coors' restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability are impressive. These initiatives included closure of underperforming breweries, improvement of efficiencies in finance, administration and human resources, and reduction of labor and general overhead costs. Additionally, the company has been making efforts to improve its supply-chain network and build on efficiencies across the business to generate additional resources for investing in brand building and innovation. Notably, the company has surpassed its cost-savings target by more than $80 million in 2017. For 2018, management expects cost savings of nearly $210 million. These cost-saving efforts are likely to help the company in expanding its EBITDA margins.Molson Coors also aims to augment top line through its First Choice commercial excellence plans. The company focuses on expanding its portfolio through acquisitions and agreements besides having a strong portfolio of well-established brands.Given the company's pros and cons, let's wait and see whether Molson Coors will be able to reverse its dismal surprise trend in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model conclusively shows that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings estimates in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Molson Coors has an Earnings ESP of +0.29% and a Zacks Rank #3, which makes us pretty confident of an earnings beat.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dean Foods Company  has an Earnings ESP of +11.63% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.31% and a Zacks Rank #3.Monster Beverage Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +0.31% and a Zacks Rank #3.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

These could be the stocks to buy in 2025 \u2026 or sell, depending on who you ask.Which stocks have the potential to post killer returns over the next decade? These are the stocks that are still looking cheap now when you expand your investing perspective into the future. And on the flip side, which stocks are riskier on a longer-term basis? These are the stocks to cast out from your portfolio sooner rather than later.To find these stocks you have to consider not just the fundamentals, but also the trends that are shaping the outlook for society's future. Here I turned to RBC Capital's Imagine 2025 report to pinpoint the most and least promising long-term stocks by sector.As the report states: \"Sector-specific opportunities and threats were concurrently described by each team and company-specific thoughts were distilled down to put a spotlight on perceived leaders and laggards.\"I also use  market data to get an idea of what the Street has to say about these stocks right now. Let's take a closer look at these 2025 stock leaders and laggards now:Energy drink giant  (NASDAQ:  ) is gearing up for long-term growth. The company is the owner of popular hardcore energy drink brands like Monster and Relentless.According to RBC Capital, Big Data, artificial intelligence () and virtual reality will change how consumers operate. We can expect a world with more personalized products and marketing. This requires heavy tech investment now - even if it dilutes near-term earnings. \"We also believe it is imperative that companies are agile\" adds the firm.According to RBC, Monster \"has proven its willingness to sacrifice near-term results to invest for future growth.\" This is a company that \"continues to see the bigger picture in an ever-changing retail environment.\" Overall the stock has a cautiously optimistic moderate buy analyst consensus.Specifically, RBC's Nik Modi (  ) highlights Monster as a \"Focus Pick.\" In the near-term, he sees prices rising 24% to $75. He concludes that, when it comes to MNST, \"history suggests that buying the dips is a profitable strategy.\"  (NYSE:  ) owns more brands than you can think of. For starters, consider Gillette, Pantene and Herbal Essences. However, as RBC points out, \"PG is not operating in a vacuum.\" According to Modi: \"Competition, pressures from retailers, private label, and macro dynamics could continue to lead PG to miss on expectations.\"And on a broader level, RBC describes PG as a \"hamster on a wheel.\" Large CPG [consumer packaged goods] companies - and PG in particular - \"are getting disrupted by the rise of online and smaller upstarts because they lack the courage or the conviction to take the near-term EPS hit to invest in areas that could ultimately lead to a competitive advantage.\"This means in-house digital capabilities, R&D, product quality, better digital and traditional marketing.Overall, four analysts have published hold ratings on PG in the last three months. No buy ratings here - although also no sells. RBC's Nik Modi's $79 price target predicts 2% downside from the current share price. Depressing! Say what you like about  (NASDAQ:  ) but there's no denying this company is focusing on the future. And if we turn to 2025, RBC Capital sees four megatrends in the auto industry: Connected, Autonomous, Shared and Electric (CASE). \"TSLA is a pioneer in electric vehicles and is collecting more data per production unit than anyone else\" writes the firm.However, it acknowledges, \"We give credit to companies that recognize coming change and are investing for the future but they also have tough choices ahead.\" If we turn to Tesla that story is very clear. RBC's Joseph Spak (  ) writes: \"While we don't have meaningful reason to doubt that Tesla can eventually achieve its targets, doing so in a timely manner without some growing pains could prove challenging.\" Indeed, \"Tesla is essentially learning how to become a manufacturing company on the fly.\"Overall, Tesla has a Hold analyst consensus rating. Analysts are clearly very divided on the stock. In the last three months, TSLA has received nine buy, seven hold and eight sell ratings. This is with a $300 average analyst price target.  (NYSE:  ) is a leading supplier of replacement parts. This includes manufacturing of automotive exhaust systems and components.Unfortunately, however, RBC says: \"TEN's legacy business increasingly will not be needed as vehicles get more electrified.\" It wonders how TEN's portfolio adapts to the new world.In the last three months, only one analyst has published a buy rating on TEN stock. This is versus three hold ratings. \"Valuation attractive, but don't see a catalyst\" writes RBC's Joseph Spak.He has a $50 price target on the stock (10% upside potential). Bear in mind, Spak is the best-performing analyst covering TEN stock. Big Data and Cloud Computing will become ubiquitous by 2025, as will AI and Machine Learning. This is good news for  (NASDAQ:  ), which has heavily invested in AI. Plus, it has the Big Data access and Compute Power infrastructure to benefit most from these AI and ML developments.Take its self-driving unit Waymo as an example. \"GOOGL appears particularly well situated to lead autonomous vehicle innovations, given its substantial investments in Waymo autonomous vehicle technology\" says RBC Capital. Waymo has achieved 8 million miles of driving on city streets, adding the latest 3 million in just three months.\"Moreover, we believe the commercialization of Waymo by year-end in Phoenix could be a catalyst for the stock in the near/medium term, leading to a potential rerating in GOOGL's multiple\" states five-star RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney (  ). He has a $1,400 price target on the stock (12% upside potential).Not surprisingly, GOOGL remains one of the Street's favorite stocks. No less than 30 analysts have buy ratings on GOOGL versus just three hold ratings. This is with a $1,379 average price target (10% upside potential). The outlook is far less promising for e-commerce platform  (NASDAQ:  ). It faces a big challenge when it comes to future growth: powerful rival  (NASDAQ:  ).RBC Capital writes in the report, \"The challenges for EBAY will intensify as AMZN 's substantial investments in Big Data, AI & Robotics will likely lead to a more compelling user experience, further widening the competitive gap between the two leading ecommerce companies.\"Currently, this moderate buy stock scores 16 buy, seven hold and one sell rating. RBC Capital's Mark Mahaney has a \"buy\" rating on the stock. However, he has just lowered his price target from $51 to $47.\"Q2 was a Miss & Lower Quarter for EBAY\" explains Mahaney. He blames most of the shortfall due to StubHub weakness driven by a weak concert, sports, and theater season. Red hot chip stock  (NASDAQ:  ) is only set to get hotter. This is because the incredible amount of data generated by AI, AR/VR and autonomous driving will require significantly higher memory (both NAND and DRAM). According to RBC Capital this will \"lead to strong and long-term tailwinds for MU.\"Even the current outlook for the stock is upbeat. With a bullish \"strong buy\" analyst consensus, the Street is predicting prices will surge to $83. This translates into 54% upside from current prices. Indeed, RBC Capital's Amit Daryanani (  ) has just reiterated his MU \"buy\" rating. This is with an $83 price target. Bear in mind, this is one of the Top 50 analysts ranked by TipRanks (out of over 4,800).\"Our bullish bias on MU is predicated not on there being no more cycle but rather on our belief that the cycle(s) going forward will be more muted and less volatile. This inherently means that memory companies broadly should earn more profits and FCF over the cycle than historical trends would suggest\" he argues. From a leader to a laggard. For IT stock  (NYSE:  ) \"continued migration to cloud will pose headwind (sic) to the company.\" In his most recent report, Daryanani notes the risk that \"IT customers adopting a public cloud-only model could decrease demand for on-premise and/or hybrid solutions.\" And worst of all, some of the firm's traditional partners have become competitors as they diversify product offerings.Robert W Baird's Jayson Noland (  ) echoes RBC's concerns. He writes:\"Given the monumental disruption occurring in enterprise IT caused by shifts to cloud computing and software as a service, HPE faces challenges in the majority of its core markets. Cloud providers offer competitive solutions to HPE and are difficult for the company to sell to.\"As a result, HPE may resort to pricing aggression, driving down product revenue.Even now, analysts are staying sidelined on the stock. In the last three months, eight analysts have published hold ratings. This is versus just one buy rating and three sell ratings. Meanwhile, the average analyst price target stands at $19. Global healthcare giant  (NYSE:  ) is one of the most diversified healthcare product companies in the world. Most notably, the company already provides products that are engaging with their end-customers.ABT's Libre is a sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, which lets the patient see their glucose patterns and trends to help better manage their diabetes. Unlike traditional finger prick tests, this GSM automatically measures blood sugar every minute.RBC Capital writes, \"With an aging population, unhealthy lifestyles, and rising awareness, we believe healthcare monitoring will drive growth, particularly in the diabetes and cardiac ambulatory markets.\"Indeed, Libre growth continues at a rapid pace. According to RBC's Glenn Navarro (  ), \"US Libre sales can exceed $100M in 2018, and we believe that it will be a $1B product in the US alone in the next 2-3 years.\"RBC isn't the only bull in the picture. ABT has a strong buy analyst consensus with a $73 price target (12% upside potential). Medical device stock  (NASDAQ:  ) is focused on products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders. \"Although these companies have innovated technologies within their specialties (e.g. spine - expandable cages, TAVR, etc.), these companies lack the use of big data for more personalize and real-time information for patients to leverage,\" says RBC Capital.Tellingly, both JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock in the last month. JP Morgan's Robert Marcus (  ) sees limited upside amid \"challenging\" spine end-market dynamics.Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch's Bob Hopkins (  ) now has a \"sell\" rating on NUVA. This comes with a bearish $56 price target (4% downside).He is skeptical NuVasive can maintain high single-digit revenue growth, citing robotics momentum and lack of a differentiated product.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MNST options chain for the new September 7th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $62.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $62.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $59.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MNST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $62.47/share today.Because the $62.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of MNST stock at the current price level of $62.47/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $63.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.37% if the stock gets called away at the September 7th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MNST shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

The merged company is the seventh-largest company in the U.S. food and beverage sector, and the third-largest beverage company in North America. It will report second-quarter 2018 results before the market opens.With combined revenues of nearly $11 billion, the new Keurig Dr Pepper combines Dr Pepper Snapple's drink and distribution network with Keurig' Green Mountain's coffee business. Notably, the company generates a large chunk of its revenues from distributing drinks made by other companies, including brands like Fiji Water, BodyArmor and Vita Coco. This is done through Dr Pepper Snapple's \"Allied Brands\" network. Before the merger, Dr Pepper Snapple generated about 18% of its revenues in 2017 from distribution deals with beverage companies that it doesn't own - mostly its Allied Brand partners.Following the completion of the merger, the new company failed to renegotiate distribution terms with one of the key Allied brands - Fiji, which generated nearly 2% of its total revenues. While this represents big loss, the company recently signed an agreement with to add Big Red to its portfolio. It also agreed to add two coffee drinks to the Allied Brands network - Forto Coffee Energy Shots and Peet's Ready-to-Drink Iced Expresso. It will distribute Forto throughout its network and Peet's primarily through its network of convenience stores. These additions provide scope for covering up the lost revenues from the loss of Fiji.Altogether, the company's distribution strategy is likely to benefit the company, as it is open to supporting partnership brands, even if it does not own them. Moreover, the company remains poised to gain from Dr Pepper's Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) cost-saving program, solid execution innovation, and powerful marketing and productivity programs. Further, Keurig's online presence will boost sales through digital platforms.However, we believe that the CSD category headwinds will continue to impact the company's volumes, including the diet versions, due to Dr Pepper's strong portfolio of carbonated beverages. Cross-category competition, and growing health and wellness consciousness among consumers are hurting CSD category growth. Moreover, new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales. These general constraints in the soft drinks business are likely to continue impacting the newly formed company.Consequently, shares of Keurig Dr Pepper have declined 80.6% in the past month against the  's growth of 1.1%. This shows a negative sentiment for the stock ahead of the earnings release.Our proven model does not show that Keurig Dr Pepper is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered positive earnings surprise of 2.04%.A glimpse of the company's earnings performance in the trailing four quarters shows that it has outpaced estimates by an average positive surprise of 4.1%. Additionally, the company's surprise history reveals that it has outpaced earnings estimates in the last 12 quarters while topping sales estimates in the trailing four quarters. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is pegged at 90 cents per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 5.9%. However, consensus estimates has been trending down in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate total revenues of $16.55 billion, which reflects growth of 3% year over year.Given the robust surprise trend, the stock has gained 8.9% in the last three months, outperforming the  's increase of 4.9%.Despite a robust surprise trend, we note that Procter & Gamble's top-line growth remains muted (up only 3% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018) given multiple headwinds, including slow category growth, heightened competitive environment and retailer inventory destocking.Global category growth was approximately 2.5% during the third quarter (in line with second-quarter). While developing market growth was around mid-single digit percentage, developed market growth was roughly low-single digit percentage. Although management indicated that seven out of 10 global categories are now growing or holding volume share, we remain concerned about persistent pricing weakness across P&G's business as well as the above-mentioned top-line headwinds.Importantly, fiscal third-quarter organic sales growth was entirely volume driven and pricing remained negative for P&G for the second consecutive quarter. Management indicated that U.S. Gillette pricing interventions reduced organic sales by 30 bps.Furthermore, softness across Grooming as well as Baby, Feminine and Family Care segments is likely to impact results in the upcoming quarter. Sales for the grooming segment declined 3% in fiscal 2017 and 1% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Aggressive competitive activity, changes in grooming fashions and habits, and increased online competitors in some markets like the United States are hurting the performance. In fact, in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, organic sales in the Grooming segment declined 4%.  share of the segment decreased 0.6% in the period.Meanwhile, Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment that contributes 27% to the total sales has also been performing poorly. The segment registered a decline of 9% in its top line in fiscal 2016 and 1% in fiscal 2017. In the first nine months of fiscal 2018 too, sales declined 8% from the year-ago period due to lower pricing and tepid volume.  share of the segment decreased 0.2%.Meanwhile, the company is benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products. Further, management remains focused on product improvement, packaging and marketing initiatives, and productivity cost-savings plan.The company's productivity and cost-saving plans have helped deliver robust earnings despite soft sales. Cost savings have consistently provided 200-300 bps of year-over-year margin benefit each quarter since fiscal 2012.Additionally, the company's focus on improving product portfolio through strategic initiatives, which enables it to concentrate on its fast-growing businesses, is aiding bottom line. As part of this, the company adheres to a systematic acquisition and divestiture plan to streamline portfolio, which is evident from the recent agreement to buy consumer-health business of Germany-based Merck KGaA, which will replace P&G's joint venture with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries - PGT Healthcare joint venture.Given the mixed discussion above, we would prefer to wait and see what's in store for this consumer goods company in the quarter to-be reported.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Procter & Gamble is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

The company has delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 13.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 76 cents, mirroring year-over-year growth of 33.3%. Estimates remained stable in the past 30 days. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is $15.80 billion, up 5.8% from the year-ago actual figure.Archer Daniels began 2018 on a solid note with first-quarter earnings and sales surpassing estimates and improving year over year. Notably, this marked the company's return to growth trajectory, reversing its more than three-year long trend of missing sales estimates while earnings topped for the second straight quarter. The trend is expected to continue in the second quarter as well based on improved market conditions, gains from U.S. tax reform, product innovations and Project Readiness.Archer Daniels remains focused on enhancing operational efficiency at its production and supply chain networks to curtail costs. Also, the company has been on track with business transformation, under its 1ADM program, which forms an integral part of Project Readiness. The company expects Readiness to help management have a more coordinated approach toward driving business improvement, standardizing functions and enriching consumers' experience. Notably, management rolled out the 1ADM plan to ocean freight and European corporate finance operations in the first quarter. Moreover, it remains on track with further 1ADM rollouts to cover the entire enterprise in 2018.Archer Daniels has also been undertaking strategic steps to manage its business portfolio, which are expected to help in realizing value and invest the same in best possible resources to enhance returns. In fact, the company's focus on improving its portfolio of Animal Nutrition products is commendable as well. Recently, management has agreed to acquire France-based Neovia, which provides value-added animal nutrition solutions for the feed industry. The acquisition is in sync with the company's growing Animal Nutrition footprint and capabilities, thus marking a transformative step for Archer Daniel's Animal Nutrition business as well as a key strategic investment in France. It intends to concentrate on five major platforms, animal nutrition, bioactives, carbohydrates, human nutrition and taste along with geographic regions to drive growth.Furthermore, the company is progressing well with its cost-saving initiatives. In the first quarter, the company generated operational cost savings of $70 million on a run rate basis and is on track to exceed the targeted $200 million savings for 2018. Meanwhile, the company aims at cost synergy activities by addressing redundancies and removing overlapping corporate SG&A. It will focus on lower capital spending and increasing benefits from the aforementioned investments as well.However, Archer Daniels witnessed softness across its Origination segment in the last reported quarter. The segment's revenues declined 1.4%, while its adjusted operating profit decreased 4.3%. Gains from solid Merchandising and Handling results as well as sturdy Global Trade owing to higher volumes and margins were more than offset by weak U.S. export volumes and nearly $40 million of mark-to-market impact on existing contracts. Additionally, transportation results declined year over year, leading to higher operating expenses.Additionally, significant global presence exposes the company to adverse currency translations. Also, intense competition across all its segments and volatile commodity prices remain threats.Nevertheless, Archer Daniels' smooth progress on portfolio management initiatives, cost-savings plan as well as Readiness program is anticipated to boost the upcoming quarterly results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates in the second quarter.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered negative earnings surprise of 7.6%.In fact, the company has reported earnings miss in eight of the last nine quarters. It recorded an average negative surprise of 7.7% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is pegged at $1.05 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.5%. However, estimates witnessed a downtrend in the last seven days. | Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate total revenues of $13.9 billion, which reflects a decline of 2.1% year over year. Nonetheless, the company has delivered positive sales surprise in four of the last six quarters, including consecutive beats in the last two quarters. While solid sales growth and synergies from cost savings continue to aid results, higher marketing expenses remain a deterrent.As mentioned above, the company's dismal earnings trend is a major concern for the stock. Despite the solid sales in the first quarter, we note that volumes were strained due to the decline in non-beer volumes. This stemmed mainly from the weakness in Brazil and Peru. Soft volumes, higher cost of sales and increased marketing expenses were the key deterrents in the company's otherwise strong quarter, which reflected solid sales growth and margin expansions. Moreover, the company is witnessing volatility in certain key markets, which should continue to weigh upon results.Nonetheless, the company anticipates delivering strong top-line and EBITDA growth for 2018, backed by solid brand performances and robust commercial plans. It also expects accelerated growth through the rest of 2018, particularly in the second half. Moreover, we believe, AB InBev is poised to grow in the long run, driven by the strength of the Budweiser brand and robust initiatives.AB InBev's robust brand portfolio and a solid geographical reach remain strengths. Further, given the rising demand for craft beer space, we expect the company to benefit from its constant expansion in this category. Also, it keeps introducing near-beer alternatives, along with no- and low-alcohol beers, which is encouraging.Additionally, the company remains well on track with the SABMiller integration. It expects synergies and cost savings of nearly $3.2 billion from the integration, which are expected to be realized in four years from the closing of the acquisition (or by October 2020).Though the company holds a mixed view for the upcoming results, the stock has improved 5.9% in the past month, outperforming the  's gain of 1.9%. This reflects an optimistic investor sentiment for the stock, ahead of the earnings release.Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for AB InBev this quarter.

The company will report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 25.We note that Coca-Cola's North America division is witnessing weak operating margin due to accounting change, structural headwinds and other cost pressures, which are likely to persist throughout 2018. Also, the segment's price/mix results were negatively impacted by the timing of new product launches, incremental outbound freight costs and shift of the Easter holiday in the last reported quarter.Also, Coca-Cola's North American strong beverage business has been soft due to headwinds in the carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category. Notably, cross-category competition, consumers' awareness on health and wellness alongside new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting the CSD sales. Consequently, sales of major soft drink makers namely Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Inc.  , Monster Beverage Corporation  are suffering a decline.In first-quarter 2018, the company delivered robust performance in the North America region. However, the segment's price/mix declined year over year due to low single-digit underlying price. Also, higher freight costs remained a major headwind in the last quarter, primarily in North America.Revenues at this segment totaled $2.68 billion, up 11% year over year in first-quarter 2018. Also, organic revenues grew 1% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 1% due to low single-digit underlying pricing, which was compensated with the cycling of product launches, higher freight charges and timing of the Easter holiday.Unit case volume inched up 2% in the quarter. Sparkling soft drinks volume too improved 3%, which includes double-digit growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and solid performance by the Diet Coke brand.Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages fell 2% in first-quarter 2018. The downside can be attributed to the decline in juice category due to deprioritizing low-margin juice drink brands and packaging re-sizing across juice portfolio, which was negated by the improvement in dairy and plant-based beverages. However, tea and coffee rose 5% in the quarter. Moreover, water, enhanced water and sports drinks were up 1%, including robust growth in the sparkling water portfolio owing to solid growth in smartwater sparkling and Dasani sparkling, and robust performance of Topo Chico.Despite the headwinds, management remains optimistic about realizing the price and value in the North American market. As a result, in 2018, the company expects to achieve low-single-digit price/mix for the total beverage portfolio in North America.Moreover, Coca-Cola is striving to revive the Diet Coke brand in the region. With regard to this, the company has been introducing new packaging, marketing campaign and flavors to woo consumers. Notably, it has received solid response in the initial stage and remains encouraged to drive the Diet Coke brand's growth and overall results. This apart, the company is focused on boosting growth through digital marketing and other capabilities.At the North America segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $3,141 million, which reflects growth of 9.4% year over year and 17.2% sequentially. Also, the segment's operating income stands at $851 million, up 13.2% year over year and 50.9% on a sequential basis.Coca-Cola's efforts to drive growth through brand innovation, packaging and product launches are commendable. Additionally, the company has been making investments to generate incremental revenues for increasing profits. This apart, its focus on strategic acquisitions to strengthen the company's business portfolio and maintain solid brand recognition is impressive. All these factors are likely to boost Coca-Cola's results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, currency translation risks remain concerns for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. In second-quarter 2018, currency headwinds are likely to impact operating income by about 2% and net revenues by 0-1%, both on a non-GAAP basis.You can see  . | The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents for second-quarter earnings reflects 1.7% growth from the prior-year period. However, the estimate for revenues of $8.54 billion represents about 12% decline on a year-over-year basis. (Read More:  )Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Also, sales missed the same in six of the trailing seven quarters. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 for third-quarter earnings has moved up by a penny in the last seven days. Further, the consensus mark for revenues is $900 million for the quarter, reflecting a decline of 30.9%. | Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Spectrum Brands has been undertaking strategic steps to manage its business portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. Recently, the company has completed its merger with HRG Group, Inc. - its largest shareholder with a 60% controlling stake. This deal made Spectrum Brands an independent company, thereby enhancing its shareholder base and governance structure besides driving business growth.Additionally, the company has inked a $2-billion cash deal with Energizer Holdings to offload its Global Battery and Lighting Business. Currently, Spectrum Brands is seeking regulatory approvals for this transaction. Spectrum Brands will use the divestiture proceeds for debt reduction, reinvestment in core businesses both organically and via strategic buyouts as well as share buybacks. Management also plans to redirect the capital invested in the Global Batteries & Appliances business toward development of its remaining four businesses, including Hardware & Home Improvement, Global Auto Care, Global Pet Supplies and Home & Garden. These strategic moves are likely to strengthen the company's operating structure and boost its profitability.Spectrum Brands boasts a robust brand portfolio and remains committed toward maximizing its shareholders' value by efficient capital allocation. All these factors make us optimistic about the company's upcoming quarterly performance.However, challenges related to the company's greenfield manufacturing and distribution projects along with issues in pet business, and external cost headwinds and mix adversely impacted results in second-quarter fiscal 2018.In addition, Spectrum Brands has been witnessing strained margins for the last few quarters due to higher operating and SG&A expenses. In fact, soft operating margins have been hurting the company's profitability.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Spectrum Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates in the fiscal third quarter.

However, it delivered an average positive surprise of 26.1%. Notably, the company has been losing its position, lately, due to a dismal surprise trend for both top and bottom lines. It has delivered a negative earnings surprise in six of the preceding seven quarters. Moreover, revenues lagged estimates in four of the last five quarters. | However, estimates reflect a positive picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 98 cents, which moved up 7 cents in the last seven days. Further, estimates for the to-be-reported quarter reflect 36.1% growth year over year. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $6.36 billion represents rise of 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.The question lingering in investors' minds now is, whether or not FEMSA will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.FEMSA is witnessing mixed sentiments as investors are concerned about its dismal surprise history while its strategic initiatives reflect potential. We remain impressed with FEMSA's focus on strategic measures, including expanding the store base, diversifying the business portfolio and focus on the core business activities.Moreover, the company's focus on achieving growth via acquisitions looks good. In an attempt to strengthen its retail portfolio, the company acquired the grocery store Big John in Santiago, Chile. Given its renowned status and solid growth prospects, Big John is likely to enhance FEMSA Comercio's convenience store operations in Chile.Earlier, the company expanded its footprint in South America through the Grupo Socofar buyout, which not only widened its exposure in the drugstore business but also brought beauty operations under its ambit. Additionally, the company has been diversifying its retail chain operations by acquiring businesses across Latin America. FEMSA Comercio has considerably extended its footprint in the small-format retail chains in Mexico, Chile and Colombia.Additionally, the company's exposure in various industries, including beverage, beer and retail, gives FEMSA an edge over competitors. In fact, the company's strong cash flow generation capacity enables it to make incremental investments in business expansion.These attributes have helped the stock gain 11.3% in the past month, outperforming 1.4% growth recorded by the  . This reflects a positive sentiment on the stock ahead of earnings.However, we cannot ignore the near-term headwinds that may bother the stock's growth.

The definition of penny stocks is entirely subjective. What I think constitutes a risky penny stock, you might feel is a robust, thriving enterprise.Therefore, before I answer the question of whether you can make money in penny stocks, I'm going to explain what I believe is the best definition of a penny stock. From there, I'll tackle the five rules investors should follow to be successful in trading penny stocks.Merriam-Webster  penny stock as \"a usually unlisted highly speculative stock usually selling for a dollar or less.\"Hence, the penny stock moniker.Others are more liberal in their interpretation of what constitutes a penny stock. , an investment newsletter publisher I do some work for here in Canada,  the ceiling price can go as high as $5.Here's what the SEC has to say about penny stocks:\"The term 'penny stock' generally refers to a security issued by a very small company that trades at less than $5 per share,\"  the SEC website. \"Penny stocks generally are quoted over-the-counter, such as on the  ; penny stocks may, however, also trade on securities exchanges, including foreign securities exchanges.\"So, I've got reputable sources from both the U.S. and Canada that accurately define what penny stocks are, including the price at which they trade.At $5 or less, I do believe you can make money in stocks, but it helps if you follow these five simple rules.Like any equity investment, it's important that you establish the financial strength of the company.When I look for stocks to invest in whether the share price is $5 or $500, I focus on companies with strong balance sheets. Although no debt is desirable when interest rates are rising, it's not very practical. This is especially true when it comes to penny stocks, many of which are still in the early stages of development.Here are two rules:1. Only invest in companies whose long-term debt (LTD) is 50% of shareholder equity or less. If a company has $1 million in debt, its shareholder equity should be at least $2 million.2. Try to keep your penny-stock bets to those companies whose LTD is less than its market cap - the lower, the better.Like any equity investment, it's important that you limit your investments to profitable businesses.There are two schools of thought on this.On the one hand, investing in publicly traded companies, whether they're penny stocks or not, provides you with greater liquidity than private investments. Therefore, the ability to exit quicker justifies the higher risk many in this arena are willing to accept to generate outsize future gains.On the other hand, private investments have longer holding periods built into them - often 3-5 years or more - which means investors aren't nearly as concerned about profitability as they are growth.It really comes down to your ability to handle uncertainty.For me, I'm always looking for companies making money in the here and now. Anything less is called speculation, and while there's nothing wrong with this approach, it's not something novice investors ought to consider.Like any equity investment, it's important that you understand the businesses you invest in.There's a saying that if you can't explain what a company's business does in a sentence or two, you probably shouldn't be investing.Imagine you're explaining the investment to your  who attends elementary school. It's easy to describe what  (NYSE:  ) does: it makes soda pop. It's not nearly as simple to  what business  (NASDAQ:  ) is in.At least it's not for me.Stick to what you know and understand. That's especially true with smaller-capitalized penny stocks.Like any equity investment, it's important that you diversify your penny stocks.How many penny stocks should you own? That's the million-dollar question no matter how big or small the investment.Some professional investors believe you've got to have a  of your best ideas - say 10 to 20 - while others think you should spread your bets far wider over 100 stocks or more.It's a subjective answer for sure.What I do know is that you want to be in at least three or four sectors of the economy that generally are healthy and growing.Given the risk/reward of penny stocks can be significantly higher than large-cap stocks such as Coca-Cola, it's far more important to diversify your investments.Like any equity investment, it's important that you understand there are no guarantees and that you're risking the money you can afford to lose.If your child's going off to university in a couple of years and the funds you've allocated for investing will pay his or her tuition, you might want to keep your funds parked in something more stable.For every success story like  (NASDAQ:  ), which traded below $5 as recently as 2006, there are hundreds of penny stock failures littered along the investment highway.Treat penny stocks just as you would any other publicly traded investment, and your chances for success increase exponentially.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is slated to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 25, before the opening bell. The company boasts an impressive surprise history, having surpassed earnings estimates in 15 of the trailing 16 quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is pegged at 60 cents, which reflects an improvement of 1.7% from 59 cents in the year-ago quarter. Estimates have been stable in the past 30 days. | Analysts polled by Zacks expect Coca-Cola's total quarterly revenues to be $8,571 million, reflecting a decline of 11.7% from the prior-year quarter. In fact, the company has been witnessing a year-over-year decline in revenues for the last few quarters, primarily due to weak volumes and structural headwinds.In addition, currency translation risks remain concerns for the company. In second-quarter 2018, currency headwinds are likely to impact operating income by about 2% and net revenues by 0-1%, both on a non-GAAP basis.Coca-Cola remains focused on brand innovation, packaging and routes-to-market. Also, the company is investing in newer revenue platforms to cushion sales and profits. Moreover, it is likely to gain from acquisitions. In 2017, the beverage giant made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks, with the acquisition of Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States.Also, it entered the fast-growing U.S. ready-to-drink coffee category. Furthermore, Coca-Cola's robust portfolio of globally recognized brands, along with quality beverages - including low- and no-calorie options, provides a competitive advantage. These factors are likely to contribute to upcoming quarterly results.The company has been refranchising its bottling operations, which are aiding margins. Refranchising efforts are likely to result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and improved return on invested capital.In fact, cost-saving efforts are already contributing to the company's margins. Gross margin expanded 270 basis points (bps) year over year in first-quarter 2018. Also, operating margin grew 600 bps, given the divestitures of lower-margin bottling businesses and ongoing productivity efforts. This is likely to continue in the second quarter as well.Notably, the company is on track to deliver savings of about $3.8 billion by 2019 through its productivity programs.Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEACoca-Cola's EMEA division is expected to continue with its momentum.

The segment's revenues improved 8% in the last reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment's revenues is pegged at $991 million, mirroring an increase of 4.3% from the prior-year quarter but a marginal decline of 0.7% from the last reported quarter.Further, the segment's operating income estimates stand at $586 million, up 5.2% year over year and 2.1% sequentially.North AmericaThe company delivered a robust performance in the North America region. However, the segment's price/mix declined year over year, owing to a low-single-digit underlying price. Also, higher freight costs remained a major headwind in the last reported quarter, primarily in North America. Nevertheless, management remains encouraged to earn price and value from this market. Also, revenues in the region grew 11% year over year in the last reported quarter. Further, the second quarter consensus mark for revenues stands at $3,141 million, which reflects growth of 9.4% year over year and 17.2% sequentially.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment's operating income stands at $851 million, up 13.2% year over year and 50.9% on a sequential basis.Asia PacificRevenues at the Asia Pacific segment inched up 1% year over year in the first quarter. Notably, the volume of the Coca-Cola brand in China grew more than 20% in the quarter.Consensus estimates for revenues at the division are pegged at $1,511 million, up 0.3% from second-quarter 2017 and 24.1% from first-quarter 2018.Moreover, the segment's operating income estimates stand at $735 million, up 3.1% year over year and 30.1% sequentially.Bottling InvestmentsBottling Investments segment revenues plunged 73% in first-quarter 2018, owing to lower volumes and structural headwinds.

The company has been witnessing positive trends due to its focus on reviving the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands. Notably, the company's recent launches including the Sam '76, Samuel Adams New England IPA and Angry Orchard Rose brands, received a positive response from the customers, which helped improve shipments and depletions in the first quarter of 2018.Boston Beer delivered a positive earnings surprise of 44.7% in the last reported quarter. A glimpse of the company's earnings performance in the trailing four quarters shows that it has outpaced estimates by an average positive surprise of 41.8%. Additionally, the company's surprise history reveals that it has delivered an earnings beat in five of the last six quarters and topped sales estimates consecutively in the last three quarters. | Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.77 per share for second-quarter 2018 has declined in the last seven days, the same reflects year-over-year growth of 17.9%.Let's find out what's in store for Boston Beer in the upcoming second-quarter earnings release.Boston Beer is advantageously positioned to capture a larger share in the craft beer space, given its robust craft beer portfolio. The company's continued focus on pricing and product innovation, and growth of non-beer categories, alongside brand development, is the key to driving operating performance and bolstering the market position.The company banks on rising demand for new styles and flavors of craft beer as the vast Samuel Adams beer portfolio has a lot to offer to the consumers. Ongoing investments in breweries and tap rooms should further aid in recovering the shares lost due to rising competition. Additionally, innovation in non-beer categories, including hard teas, ciders and seltzer, has been a hit among liquor drinkers, which should drive depletions growth.The company's recent innovations in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard portfolios are driving shipments and depletions growth. Further, the company is looking to expand the distribution and customer base for the Twisted Tea brand as well as maintain the leadership position for the Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand in the emerging hard sparkling water category.Depletions for the year-to-date period through the 15-week period, ended Apr 14, 2018, are estimated to have grown nearly 8% from the comparable year-ago period. For 2018, depletions and shipments are likely to range from flat to up 6%.Notably, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect second-quarter revenues to be $275.5 million, up 4.1% year over year. Moreover, estimates for the shipment volume reflect an increase of 8.8% from the year-ago period.Further, Boston Beer is also making strides to address industry challenges through improved cost structure and re-investing these savings for the brand development. In fact, this has been significantly contributing toward improving the gross margin. For 2018, Boston Beer expects the gross margin between 52% and 54%.These factors have collectively contributed to the company's solid run on the index. Boston Beer shares have surged 42.7% in the last three months, significantly outperforming the  's decline of 6%.Though the entry of a horde of smaller craft brewers and increased options for drinkers has increased competition in the industry, we believe, Boston Beer is poised to steer through this situation. We remain optimistic about the company's second-quarter results, given the optimism arising from its innovative product launches.Our proven model shows that Boston Beer is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Boston Beer's has an Earnings ESP of +13.00%. This, along with the company's Zacks Rank #1, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Here are some other companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:B&G Foods Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.58% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Monster Beverage Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +3.07% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Brown-Forman Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% and a Zacks Rank #3.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

But is that rise slowing down? MNST stock has gained more than 15% over the last year, but it has lost 10% so far this year on a rocky rollercoaster ride lower.The company has exactly met earnings in two of the last four quarters; the other two times it fell short. In March, shares of Monster stock suffered a double-digit, one-day loss after it missed on the top and bottom line during the last quarter of last year. Then in May, MNST stock fell again after the company again missed the expected sales figure - although its earnings were in-line with what Wall Street expected. Net sales increased 15%, including a 27% increase in international sales.For the next quarter, earnings of 47-cents-per-share are expected, a 20% year-over-year increase, on sales growth of 12%. Those results are slated to be released in early August.Despite the recent misses and subsequent pullback, shares of Monster Beverage don't look particularly cheap. MNST stock is sporting a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29 vs. an estimated 16% earnings gains in each of the next five years. It's slated to post 10% sales growth each year. I suspect that's because energy drinks are a fast-growing beverage market, and Monster is the biggest name out there. Investors bid MNST stock a bit ahead of its growth and then were hard on it when it disappointed.But more growth is expected for the industry, despite the controversy around energy drinks. The energy drinks market is expected to be worth over $84 billion worldwide by 2023, reports show.\"More than 50% of the world population live in urban areas. Hectic lifestyle and rising disposable income coupled with a need for instant energy are expected to drive the market growth over the forecast period,\"  .Yet health is another mega-trend - and countless studies show that energy drinks aren't great for you. A sports cardiologist  showing energy drinks decrease the functioning of blood vessels, which can increase the risk of heart attacks and other health problems. The drinks particularly can be dangerous for teens, too, Of course, plenty of things have been proven unhealthy and remained popular. Right now, expectations seem to be working their way back down for Monster stock, too. Monster is experiencing declining earnings estimates for most of the upcoming periods. While that may seem like a negative, it's actually giving the stock a lower bar, which could help prevent another disappointment.I expect Monster Beverage Corporation to meet earnings expectations this quarter and then continue its general uptrend higher. But I don't love these levels as an entry point for the stock. The media price target for MNST stock is $62, good for 9% upside. That's not terrible, but I'd prefer to buy-in at a slightly better multiple, especially for a company that has disappointed a few times recently and comes with some questions related to its overall growth.Discovered almost by accident, Louis Navellier's incredible trading breakthrough has delivered 148 double- and triple-digit winners over the past 5 years - including a stunning 487% win in just 10 months.Learn to use this formula and you can start turning every $10,000 invested  . to review Louis' urgent presentation.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported second-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings topped estimates while sales lagged. Notably, this marked the ninth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise. The improvement was mainly attributable to strong performances in its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.PepsiCo's shares have risen nearly 4% in the pre-trading session, following the earnings release. Overall, the company's shares have lost 10.1% in the last three months, wider than the  's 5% decline.PepsiCo's second-quarter core earnings per share (EPS) of $1.61 beat the consensus mark of $1.51 per share by 6.6% and increased 8% year over year.

The company reported earnings of $1.28 per share, reflecting a decline of 13% year over year. The foreign exchange translation had a positive impact of 1 percentage point on reported EPS.Net revenues of $16,090 million increased 2.4% from the year-ago level. Foreign exchange (Fx) had 1 percentage point positive impact on revenue growth. However, reported revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,125 million.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 2.6% on an organic basis, primarily driven by strength in the majority of the company's businesses, particularly international divisions that gained from persistent growth in emerging and developing markets. Among these, Latin America; Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA); Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA); and Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) segments reported organic revenue growth in the second quarter.Total volume grew 1% in the reported quarter, unchanged from the previous quarter. While organic snacks/food volume increased 1% (a declined from 3% growth witnessed in the first quarter), beverage volume rose 0.5% (versus 1% decline in the first quarter).Revenues decreased 1% at the North America Beverages (NAB) segment, 2% in AMENA and 5% in QFNA.

Currency is projected to have a neutral effect on top and bottom lines.PepsiCo expects core EPS of $5.70, reflecting 9% growth from earnings of $5.23 per share in 2017.Further, management plans to return $7 billion to shareholders through dividends worth $5 billion and share repurchases worth $2 billion.

A recent  in  notes that this year, beverage giant  (NYSE: KO) is replacing its system of periodic manual store shelf audits with technology from Singapore-headquartered retail analytics start-up Trax. The time-consuming manual audit system, in which field representatives physically visit stores and count bottles, can take months to return valuable information on retail inventory movement and competitor product placements.Trax uses image recognition technology, combined with analytics and artificial intelligence, to obtain the basic data of a shelf audit while providing more comprehensive insights. Shelf images uploaded to Trax's cloud servers are analyzed by what the company terms its \"advanced computer vision algorithms,\" and a monthly analytic dashboard is provided to clients. The software also provides insights into store trends within the packaged goods products that surround beverage aisles.According to Trax's  , it offers these services under two primary products, Shelf Pulse and Shelf Intelligence Suite. Both are enhanced with additional insights provided by global measurement specialist  and privately held consumer goods sales and marketing agency Acosta.Image source: Getty Images.Tools of the type produced by Trax will help companies like Coke obtain a much faster and more complete picture of the grocery, convenience store, and club shopping channels. According to  , Coca-Cola will now be able to increase the frequency of its corporate-initiated marketplace data survey, from twice a year to six times annually.As the world's largest beverage company has shifted its business model away from manufacturing and toward marketing, it's embarked on a widely watched journey of portfolio diversification. Most shareholders are aware of these sea changes in the company's business model.However,  , Coca-Cola is also employing three distinct tactics in the near term to improve earnings growth. First, it's leaning toward pricing power versus selling on brute volume to improve the quality of its sales. Second, the organization is \"lifting and shifting\" brands between continents to spur the rate of innovation. Finally, Coca-Cola continues to roll out low-sugar variants in its sparkling beverages portfolio to meet consumer demand.Visual intelligence can assist with each of these strategies. Coca-Cola can piece together a more complete view of competitor pricing as it adjusts its price-volume mix. It can also achieve a better understanding of local brands as it seeks to transfer winning beverages from one geographical region to another. And management can get a quicker read on how a sugar-free offering like Coke Zero, for instance, is faring as it extends across new markets.Of course, much of this data in the future will be analyzed by the company's bottlers as much as it will by Coca-Cola, as bottlers ultimately are responsible for shelf distribution. According to  , the beverage giant is already testing Trax with a handful of its North American bottling partners, and my guess is that Coke's global bottlers will also adopt the technology soon.For beverage companies, getting software like Trax in the hands of bottling distributors is almost as important as management's own use of it. Take Coca-Cola investee  (NASDAQ: MNST) , for example. As I wrote in May, the energy drink specialist is building on its long-term potential by  .In some geographical regions, Monster is working with bottlers to create an energy drink shelf where one doesn't already exist. On the company's most recent , Chief Operating Officer Hilton Schlosberg provided the example of the China market:Monster investors may be focused on  , but you can see how over the long run, creating an energy drink category on convenience shelves in China could help create exceptional value.Monster and its Coca-Cola bottling partners could use visual shelf technology to better understand which local brands it needs to displace to create this category in a mammoth market like China. They could also gain a view into which Chinese beverages actually complement Monster sales on the shelf, thus influencing ongoing product placement. Most importantly, Monster could theoretically get much faster data than is currently possible, on which of its innumerable energy brands is enjoying the most traction with Chinese consumers.Of course, there's one obvious drawback to such shiny digital tools as Trax provides. As an industry increasingly adopts the next generation of technology, any single company's advantage in using the software gets negated. But for now, replacing the slow manual process of obtaining shelf insight with an analytics-rich dashboard should serve early adopters well in the never-ending battle for product real estate.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In an environment where consumers increasingly avoid sugary beverages, DPS stock has maintained a growth trajectory.Now, the company begins anew as  beginning on Jul. 10. This will leave many wondering how the merger will affect the Dr Pepper Snapple growth story. Still, with the merger priced into DPS stock, investors should probably temper their expectations.To be sure, the beverage industry faces challenges. With all the consciousness about health and the warnings related to both sugar and sugar substitutes, consumers increasingly avoid these drinks.Moreover,  (NYSE:  ) has little room to expand.  (NASDAQ:  ) has suffered years of declining revenues and profits. So, the only company in this category that outperforms DPS is  (NASDAQ:  ). However, with its energy drinks, one could argue it exists in a class by itself.Now, these companies will compete with the new Keurig Dr. Pepper, which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"KDP.\" This will become the third-largest nonalcoholic beverage company in the country. It will also stand as the seventh-largest company in the food and beverage industry.With its larger size and orientation less focused on soft drinks, the new KDP stock should stand out as the stock of choice in the nonalcoholic beverage industry. However, this does not mean investors should buy into this industry or KDP stock.Back in March, our own  that the market should value DPS stock at between $120 and $130 per share. Mr. Lango appears to have made the correct call. Today, DPS trades at about $122 per share.Even then, he described Dr Pepper Snapple as an \"unexciting investment opportunity.\" Most of this year's growth in DPS stock came in January when DPS announced that it would merge with It remains unclear whether DPS stock becoming KDP stock will make the company any more exciting. DPS's five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 20.34. At its current price and estimated net income, the stock trades at about 23.75 times forward earnings.However, this P/E may not remain meaningful under the new KDP stock, especially since owners of DPS stock will hold a relatively small share of the new company. Those who hold DPS stock will receive 13% of the company, with Keurig shareholders getting the remaining 87%. Holders of DPS stock will also receive a special dividend of $103.75 per share.Such a payout will leave many investors with fresh cash in need of investment. Many choices exist. Given the uncertainty surrounding the new company and the lackluster numbers coming from the beverage industry, both dividend recipients and new investors should probably look at different investment options.With post-merger uncertainty and the struggles of the beverage industry in general, investors should not expect huge gains to come from this merger. DPS stock has become one of the better performers in a slow-growth industry. However, with the new KDP, investors have little information to act on other than a vague expectation for growth.The new KDP stock could go on to outperform its peers. Still, with beverage companies battling to achieve any growth at all, surpassing industry averages will not necessarily translate into high growth.Current DPS stock investors will now receive $103.75 in cash for every share owned. Until we know more about the culture, sales and performance of the new Keurig Dr Pepper, dividend recipients should probably invest their cash elsewhere.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["riday's session closes with the NASDAQ Composite Index at 7,645.51.

Analysts, on average, were only expecting earnings of $0.03 per share on revenue of $306.5 million.\"We continue to balance growth and profitability, demonstrated by our ability to consistently deliver top-line growth of over 20% even as we invest in category expansions, technology talent, and marketing,\" stated Stitch Fix founder and CEO Katrina Lake. \"Our third quarter results demonstrated continued positive momentum for Stitch Fix and the power of our unique ability to deliver personalized service at scale.\"If that wasn't enough, the company also announced the impending launch of Stitch Fix Kids, a service Lake says will \"provide unique, affordable kids clothing in a wide range of styles, giving our littlest clients the freedom to express themselves in clothing that they love and feel great wearing.\"Of course, it remains to be seen whether Stitch Fix Kids will enjoy the same positive reception as its adult-centric counterpart. But after combining this new launch with Stitch Fix's relative outperformance this quarter, it's no surprise the stock popped today.Monster Beverage shares rose 5% following encouraging comments from management at the energy drink leader's latest annual shareholder meeting. In particular, Monster Beverage leadership told investors that its business in the United States is holding strong, which could enable the company to selectively implement price hikes to combat higher aluminum costs in the coming quarters.Sure enough, several analyst firms weighed in to offer their respective votes of confidence this morning, including predictions from Stifel Nicolaus and Goldman Sachs that Monster's global sales momentum will allow it to increase prices and gradually expand gross margin. Both firms reiterated their buy ratings for Monster stock. Stifel, for its part, holds a $63-per-share price target on Monster, while Goldman Sachs increased its own from $54 to $57.Both predictions represent modest premiums from Monster Beverage's close on Friday at $55.48 per share. But thanks to a  in late February, the stock still sits well below its 52-week high at over $70 per share set early this year.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $53.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MNST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.93/share today.Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

This has resulted in steady growth in sales volume of bottled water, making it the number one preferred beverage in the United States in 2017, according to a recent release from International Bottled Water Association (\"IBWA\") and Beverage Market Corporation (\"BMC\").Understandably, Americans are refraining from carbonated and sugary drinks. According to analysts, the bottled water market is expected to grow further in the days to come. This has made carbonated soft drink (CSD) manufacturers shift focus toward bottled water and other healthier options.Bottled water has become the highest selling beverage in the United States for two years in a row. According to IBWA and BMC, bottled water volumes escalated to 13.7 billion in 2017, reflecting a 7% year-over-year increase. Bottled water sales came in at $18.5 billion, increasing 8.8% year over year.Per capita consumption of bottled water exceeded 42 gallons, increasing 6.2% over the same time period. It goes without saying that the gap between carbonated drinks and bottled water is fast widening.The sparkling water category grew 70% between 2011 and 2016 and is expected to touch $3.1 billion by 2022, according to Euromonitor. Per BMC, per capita consumption of bottled water will cross 50 gallons in the next few years.Interestingly, all segments under the bottled water category witnessed robust growth in 2017. Domestic sparkling water surged 27.5%, while domestic non-sparkling and imported water jumped 5.5% and 9.2%, respectively.Moreover, according to IBWA, three out of five Americans prefer bottled water to any other beverage. Also, according to a recent Nielsen data, sales of bottled water, flavored water and energy drinks have jumped in the four weeks to May 19. During this period, PepsiCo's share of sparkling water category grew 4.7%, up from 0.6% growth in January. Also, Dr Pepper Snapple's shelf-stable juices and drinks witnessed sales growth of 13.1%.According to Nielsen's latest data, sales growth of energy drinks, still flavored water, sparkling flavored water and bottled water grew 7%, 10.9% and 17.7% and 7.1%, respectively, in the four weeks to May 19, on a year-over-year basis.Given that more Americans prefer bottled water to other soft carbonated beverages, CSD manufacturers like the Coca Cola Company  , PepsiCo, Inc.  , Nestle S.A.  , Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V  and Monster Beverage Corporation  too are redesigning their portfolio along these lines. Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see Coca-Cola recently introduced a range of flavors in smaller packages to its diet coke brand to attract new-generation drinkers. Moreover, the company has promised to reduce the sugar-level in most of its products. It has also introduced Coke Zero Sugar, revamping its Coke Zero. The company also acquired the U.S. rights of Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water brand in October 2017.In February, Pepsico launched its new sparkling water line Bubly. A few months ago, Nestle announced that it will be rebranding its Nestle Waters' Regional Spring Water Sparkling portfolio. The new portfolio will comprise 10 new flavors, design changes in bottles and a new can format.Undoubtedly, Americans' growing health-consciousness has led to a surge in sales volume of bottled water and other healthier beverages. Moreover, the bottled water market is poised to grow further in over the next few years. This has made beverage companies reorient their business strategy and redesign their portfolio with increased focus on bottled water.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.4%. It also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 4.3%.PepsiCo has been head on heels trying to improve its performance through product launches, fortifying developing/emerging market presence, aggressive marketing, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives. The success of the company's initiatives was well reflected in first-quarter 2018 earnings, which were driven by strong international performance on revenue growth in the developing and emerging markets.Moreover, the company's fundamental strength is evident from its solid brand portfolio, product innovation and strong snacks business. Notably, PepsiCo has delivered positive earnings surprise for eight consecutive quarters. | As a result, PepsiCo stock has been gaining over the past month, reflecting a positive sentiment ahead of earnings. The company's shares have increased 7.9%, outperforming the  's 4.4% rise.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is $1.51 per share, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 0.7%. However, we note that the consensus mark for the to-be-reported quarter has moved south in the last seven days. The downward estimate movement can be attributed to the fact that the beverage industry is witnessing sluggish CSD (carbonated soft drinks) volumes, which is a pressing concern. CSD volumes for PepsiCo's North America Beverages (NAB) business decreased 4% in the first quarter of 2018. Looking back, PepsiCo's CSD volumes declined 2% each in 2014 and 2015, 1% in 2016 and 5% in 2017 in the NAB business.Furthermore, consumer taste is rapidly shifting from CSDs to non-carbonated beverages. To this end, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier alternatives. Currently, a major portion of PepsiCo's total net revenues comes from \"Guilt-Free\" products, more than half of which comes from the \"Everyday Nutrition\" category. This percentage is likely to increase, given the company's stepped-up innovation and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences.PepsiCo has also broadened its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to decrease the dependence on colas, keeping in mind the slowdown in CSD volumes. The company's non-carbonated beverage volume mix increased 7 percentage points since 2010.Nonetheless, results of the NAB segment - comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada - remained soft in the first quarter. This is because it was negatively impacted by higher input costs and operating cost inflation that substantially offset productivity gains. The results were also affected by a bonus, extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act.PepsiCo's North America Beverages or NAB business accounts for about 33% of the company's total revenues. Revenues at the segment declined 1% in first-quarter 2018, preceded by declines of 6% and 3% in the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2017. However, the metric remained unchanged in the first two quarters of 2017. The trend is unlikely to reverse in the to-be-reported quarter as well. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NAB segment revenues is pegged at $5.18 billion. This reflects an increase from $4.4 billion reported in the first quarter and a decline from $5.24 billion in the year-ago quarter.For the Frito-Lay North America or FLNA business (accounting for 25% of revenues), PepsiCo had a good balance of volume growth and net price realization. The segment's revenues improved 3% last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.8 billion, mirroring an increase from $3.6 billion in the prior quarter and $3.7 billion in the year-ago period.The Quaker Foods North America segment revenues improved marginally in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $551 million compared with $601 million in the first quarter and $553 million in the second quarter of 2017.The Europe Sub-Saharan Africa segment revenues grew 15% in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.04 billion, implying an increase from $2.8 billion in the prior-year quarter and $1.7 billion last quarter.The Latin America segment revenues were up 14% in the last reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $1.9 billion compared with $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2017 and $1.2 billion in first-quarter 2018.Revenues at the Asia, Middle East and North Africa segment improved 7% year over year in the first quarter. The metric is likely to increase to $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2018 from $1.6 billion registered in the year-ago period and $1.04 billion in the prior quarter, per the consensus estimate.Overall, for the second quarter, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to come in at $16.1 billion, reflecting 2.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:PepsiCo does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

The \"MNST\" symbol appeared to be heading for a double-digit decline, but recovered some ground on the last day of the month, as management announced a $500 million share buyback plan that is  .Monster recorded gross margin of 60.6% during the first quarter, versus 64.8% during the prior-year quarter. Even after adding back a $9.9 million impact due to a new accounting standard (Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, No. 606, which reclassifies commissions as a reduction in net sales), adjusted gross margin of roughly 61% still represents a decline of nearly 4 percentage points. It also marks a single-percentage-point dip against the previous sequential quarter (fourth quarter of 2017).All this adds up to what may be a deterioration from a multi-year gross margin peak, starting in mid-2017: data by During the company's  on May 8, analysts appeared most interested in understanding the most recent quarterly dip. In his prepared remarks at the outset of the call, CEO Rodney Sacks listed no fewer than seven headwinds on gross margin:Image source: Getty Images.Sacks' list is problematic for Wall Street analysts as the sheer number of specific factors exerting downward pressure makes forward modeling of gross margin difficult. And for the average retail investor, the reasons presented make clear that numerous forces may potentially buffet profit over the next few quarters.A little later in the call, president Hilton Schlosberg explained why the company won't provide investors with an outlook on gross margin in the coming months, nor even a reassurance that the current number will stabilize:Note the introduction of still more factors depressing gross profitability. Schlosberg was also asked if the company would raise beverage prices in the U.S., as it had done in similar past cycles. He responded by asserting that management continuously reviews pricing regardless of margin pressures, and declined to signal if Monster would soon nudge prices to offset rising costs.As you might have gathered, shareholders are unsettled by the external, or \"noncontrollable\" aspect of so many disparate factors. Rising aluminum costs exacerbated by the Trump administration's tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, commodity inflation in the form of higher sugar costs, and rising shipping costs due to tight supply in the freight industry, all strike me as palpable external profit threats. And frankly, Monster's reluctance to provide an expectation of a time frame around margin weakness has also informed investors' near-term cautiousness following the first-quarter earnings report issuance.Longer-term, management discussed several margin improvements that Monster should eventually realize. CEO Sacks explained that as the organization continues to enter new global markets through  's (NYSE: KO) distribution system, and partners with Coke's bottlers, it can gradually shift production within geographic regions to local manufacturing, saving freight and import costs.Sacks also observed that the company's \"strategic brands\" segment, which includes carbonated energy drinks such as Burn, Gladiator, Full Throttle, and NOS, is primarily a concentrate-based business, with manufacturing provided by Coca-Cola. While Coca-Cola has divested its bottling operations to local partners around the globe, it still produces its own concentrates, as well as those of Monster, its equity investee. Growth in strategic brands will improve overall margin, as gross profit is generally higher in concentrates versus bottled products.Finally, Monster intends to shift its coffee-based energy drink Espresso Monster, currently manufactured in Europe, to local production for U.S. domestic consumption, raising the beverage's margin profile.The previous details are helpful in understanding the larger opportunity around future production efficiencies. But they don't completely resolve concerns. Even committed long-term investors are unlikely to ignore the margin caution flags raised on this last earnings report: Stakeholders won't completely relax until the current margin trend stabilizes.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Monster Beverage's adjusted earnings came in at 39 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the company reported earnings of 38 cents, which include distributor termination expenses that lowered the reported earnings by approximately 1 cent, after tax. Then again, reported earnings increased 22.6% year over year.Net sales of $850.9 million missed the consensus mark of $859.8 million. The figure improved 14.7% from the prior-year quarter's tally. Foreign currency translation positively impacted net sales by $17.7 million, partially offset by $9.9-million impact due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606.Net sales to customers outside the United States increased 26.8% year over year to $242.1 million. : Net sales in the segment, which includes Monster Energy, Monster Hydro energy and Mutant Super Soda drinks, were up 16.7% from the year-ago quarter's tally to $780.5 million. : This segment includes various energy-drink brands acquired from Coca-Cola. Net sales in the segment declined 3.3% to $65.8 million in the quarter. The downside was mainly due to the adoption of ASC 606. : Net sales in the segment, which includes some products of American Fruits & Flavors sold to independent third parties, were down 15.9% year over year at $4.7 million.First-quarter 2018 gross margin fell 420 bps to 60.6% due to higher promotional allowances, the adoption of ASC 606, geographical and domestic product sales mix.Operating expenses, including $7 million in distributor termination expenses, increased 8.6% from the prior-year quarter's level to $235.3 million. Operating income in the quarter was $279.9 million, up 5.9% year over year.Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.5%, down 20 bps from first-quarter 2017.Effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.3% compared with 32.8% in the prior-year quarter.Monster Beverage ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $511.4 million compared with $528.6 million as of Dec 31, 2017.In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

Also, the new program does not have any expiry date and is expected to be made in the open market or via privately negotiated transactions. Following the news, the company's shares moved up 5.4% on Wednesday's trading session.Share repurchase is an important tool, which enables a company to boost the value of shares. Since the repurchase reduces the number of shares outstanding, it thereby increases earnings per share and boosts the market value of the remaining shares.Monster Beverage has been very active on the share repurchase front. In February 2017, the company's board authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.During the three months ended Mar 31, 2018, Monster Beverage purchased 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share, for a total amount of $249.9 million (excluding broker commissions), which exhausted the availability under the February 2017 Repurchase Plan.Again in February 2018, the company's board authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $250.0 million of the company's outstanding common stock. Notably, there is no availability remaining under this program.This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company's shares have declined 17.9% so far this year, which indicates investors' low confidence in the company. Earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 also fell 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts' concern.Of late, Monster Beverage has been grappling with multiple headwinds. Health-conscious consumers are opting for healthier alternatives. This shift in consumer preference is impacting sales of companies like Monster Beverage and other food as well as beverage giants like PepsiCo  , Coca-Cola  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc  .Again, a decline in gross margin raises concern. Higher raw material costs (mainly aluminum and sweeteners) and unfavorable product mix hurt margin. First-quarter 2018 gross margin contracted 420 basis points (bps) to 60.6% due to higher promotional allowances, geographical and domestic product sales mix. Operating expenses increased 8.6% from the prior-year quarter to $235.3 million.The new share repurchase is expected to boost Monster Beverage's earnings and raise shareholders' value.You can see  .Here's another stock idea to consider.

The beverage giant intends to invest $1.2 billion in the country within the time period of 2019-2021, as stated by the company in a statement on May 29. Earlier, Coca-Cola had plans to invest $1 billion in the 2016-2018 time frame.Coca-Cola was one of the companies to initiate a major investment in Argentina after Macri took charge in late 2015, promising business-friendly reforms.Notably, the company's performance in Latin America clearly improved in the last reported quarter, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, where modest volume growth was witnessed. In fact, improvement in the key markets like India, Argentina and Brazil was noticed in the second half of 2017 and in first-quarter 2018.The Latin America segment registered revenues of $998 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 8% from the prior-year quarter. Price/mix growth was 6% in the quarter, primarily driven by strong price/mix in Mexico and the South Latin business unit. Organic revenues grew 6%.Unit case volume increased 1%, as low to mid-single-digit growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico was offset by a decline in both Peru and Chile.Coca-Cola has a commanding presence in the developing and emerging markets of Latin America, India, Russia and China, courtesy of the growth opportunities that these countries provide. More than half of the company's revenues are generated outside the United States.Coca-Cola started 2018 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts in the first quarter. In addition to a notable increase in soda volumes, it also gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Organic sales grew 5%, led by price/mix improvement of 1% and concentrate sales growth of 4%. Currency also had a 2% positive impact on revenues. Again, lower SG&A expenses (down 24.2%), along with higher gross margin (up 270 basis points or bps) and operating margin (up 600 bps) helped it come up with better earnings (up 8%).However, total sales decreased 16% year over year, marking the 12th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues. Although the top line is yet to show sustained improvement, we are encouraged by its strategic efforts to transform its portfolio into a total beverage company, with improved marketing and innovation, focus on driving revenues by improved price/mix, digital focus, and productivity initiatives toward driving margins.Coca-Cola's shares have lost 7% year to date, comparing favorably with the  's 11.3% decline. Earnings estimates for 2018 have moved 0.5% north in the past 60 days, while the same remained stable for 2019. This reflects analysts' optimism on the stock's earnings potential.Making the most of the growth opportunities in the emerging countries, along with improved marketing and innovation will drive its revenues.Changing demographics and purchasing behavior make it essential for Coca-Cola, and other food as well as beverage giants like PepsiCo  , Monster Beverage Corporation  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  to understand and capitalize on the primary consumer insights that identify growing trends.The company currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, the company has underperformed the industry in the 4-week and 12-week time frames, which indicates the current Momentum Score of F.Moreover, Monster Beverage's earnings estimates revisions are pretty discouraging. Estimates for 2018 and 2019 have declined 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, over the last 30 days, which reflect analysts' bearish outlook over the stock.Let's delve into the factors that are taking this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company downhill.Higher raw material costs (mainly aluminum and sweeteners) and unfavorable product have been primarily hurting margins. Gross margin declined 20 basis points (bps) in 2017. Meanwhile, Monster Beverage's ramped up marketing spend, to boost the top line and attract customers, is likely to exert pressure on margins.Increase in promotional allowances, $9.9-million commissions as a reduction of net sales due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, lower margin foreign operations, change in domestic product sales mix, rise in certain import costs principally freight-in aluminum cans as well as sucralose and Hydro production issues in the United States and EMEA region hurt gross margins by 420 bps in the first quarter.The company apprehends gross margin headwinds to persist at least through the first half of 2018. Along with this, higher distribution costs from increased freight expenses are expected to put pressure on 2018 operating margin.Health-conscious consumers are opting for better beverage alternatives like ready-to-drink tea and bottled water. This shift in consumer preferences is impacting the volumes of soda beverages and energy drinks. U.S. sales have struggled for months as Monster Beverage faces tough competition from other energy drink companies and shifting consumer preferences. This change in consumer preference is also impacting sales of food and beverage giants like PepsiCo  , Coca-Cola  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc  .Monster Beverage has a Value Style Score of F, signifying that there is no upside potential left for the stock at the moment.The company currently has a trailing 12-months Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.7, while the industry's average is at 20.6. Looking at sales, the company currently trades at a Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.5, significantly higher than the industry average of 4.6. Some prefer this metric more than other value-focused ones because sales are harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.These ratios show that the company is overvalued compared with its industry peers and investors should steer clear from this stock now.The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry has underperformed the broader market in the past year. Currently, the industry ranks among the bottom 5% (242 out of 255 industries). Along with the weak past performance of the industry, a sluggish rank signals that companies in this space are likely to get affected due to unfavorable broader factors in the immediate future.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

According to a recent report by  , retail beverage sales surged $135.7 billion last year. However, an increasing number of consumers are refraining from sugary sodas and other carbonated beverages in favor of the healthier water, tea and other drinks.Keeping in mind the changing tastes and preferences of health-conscious consumers, beverage companies are redesigning their product portfolio and reorienting their business strategy.U.S. beverage sales grew by $2.1 billion in 2017. Retail beverage sales grew around 3% last year, while volume jumped 2%, according to data and consulting firm Beverage Market Corporation. The growth was prompted primarily by strong sales of carbonated drinks and bottled water. Additionally, an increase in soda prices gave a boost to revenues in that category. Revenues from carbonated beverages came in at $81.6 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the year's total revenues.However, an increasing number of Americans are opting for healthier variants, which saw a rise in sales of bottled water. Bottled water overtook carbonated soft drinks as the most-preferred beverage by volume in 2016, and continued its growth in 2017. Last year, bottled water accounted for $24.1 billion in sales.Shifting preference for healthier drinks has seen the carbonated soft drink market shrinking for 13 consecutive years now. Carbonated soft drinks volume fell 1.6% in 2017 and is projected to decline between 0.8% and 1.3% this year.Almost all beverage companies like The Coca Cola Company  , PepsiCo, Inc.  , Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V  and Monster Beverage Corporation  are redesigning their portfolio along these lines.Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Dr Pepper Snapple and Fomento Economico Mexicano, each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see A number of prominent names are getting into acquisitions and partnerships as well as reorienting their strategies with the aim of building a healthier portfolio, which now holds the key to their survival.After an eight-year run of flat sales, Coca Cola's Diet Coke finally bounced back. The company has introduced a range of flavors in smaller packages to its diet coke brand to attract new-generation drinkers. It has also introduced Coke Zero Sugar, revamping its Coke Zero, which now tastes more like the original Coke. The company also acquired the U.S. rights of Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water brand in October 2017.This definitely seems to have worked wonders for Coca Cola, with the company reporting first-quarter revenues of $7.6 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.43 billion (read more:  ).PepsiCo's focus too has been on bottled water and the healthier variants of its carbonated drinks. In February, the company launched its new sparkling water line Bubly. Also, the company's existing bottoled water brand Acquafina's sales increased 2.6% in 2017. PepsiCo too seems to be benefiting from redesigning its portfolio. The company reported net revenues of $12.56 billion, increasing 4.3% from the year-ago level.Other companies like Dr Pepper Snapple and Fomento Economico Mexicano too have been increasingly focusing on creating a portfolio that will cater to health-conscious consumers. In fact, Fomento Economico Mexicano has long been focusing on naturally healthy beverages and was the leading player in 2016 with a 42% retail value share.Monster Beverages too has been riding high on the success of a healthy portfolio. The company's net sales in the Monster Energy Drink segment, which includes Monster Energy, Monster Hydro Energy and Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 16.7% to $780.5 million in the first quarter.While health-consciousness has led to a decline in sales growth of carbonated drinks, sales volume of bottled water and other healthier beverages has expanded.

This percentage is likely to increase, given the company's stepped-up innovation and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences. The better-for-you and good-for-you products have increased the percentage of the company's total portfolio from 38% in 2006 to 50% in 2017. Retail sales of KeVita, PepsiCo's line of premium organic probiotic beverages, grew 50% in the first quarter.PepsiCo is one of the top global positions in the non-alcoholic beverage and snack food industries, anchored by cherished brands like Pepsi, Gatorade, Tropicana, Lays, Doritos, and Quaker, among others. PepsiCo has broadened its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to decrease the dependence on colas; keeping in mind the slowdown in CSD volumes. PepsiCo's non-carbonated beverage volume mix increased 7 percentage points since 2010.The company has been growing its value share in a number of its fastest-growing categories including tea, enhanced water and sparkling water.Last month, the beverage giant reported first quarter of 2018 results, wherein core earnings increased 3% year over year on 4.3% revenue growth. The improvement was mainly attributable to the strong performances by its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in the developing and emerging markets.In the first quarter of 2018, the company registered 8% organic revenue growth in its developing and emerging markets as a group, reflecting acceleration from 6.5% improvement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Within Latin America, organic revenues grew 10% in Mexico, high teens in Brazil and 20% in Argentina in the quarter. Notably, in Asia, Middle East and North Africa or AMENA division, PepsiCo witnessed strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China, India, Egypt and Pakistan.The company has almost tripled its global footprint from 28 markets at the beginning of 2015 to 77 markets at present.In first-quarter 2018, the NAB division reported dismal results with revenues and operating profit decreasing 1% and 22%, respectively. Volumes declined 2.5%, owing to 4% decline in CSDs and 1% decrease in Non CSDs.The non-carbonated beverage volume decreased mainly due to low-single-digit declines in Gatorade sports drinks, and juice and juice drinks portfolio, partially offset by a low-single-digit increase in the overall water portfolio. Acquisitions had a nominal positive contribution to the volume performance.Operating profit was affected by operating cost inflation as well as higher raw material costs, and a bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act.The company has stepped up productivity and cost-saving initiatives to boost profitability by reducing overall costs. PepsiCo's productivity program aims to deliver $1 billion in annual productivity savings.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's adjusted gross margin fell 75 basis points (bps) year over year in the last reported quarter. The downside was mainly due to higher input costs. PepsiCo's arch rival, Coca-Cola also faced a significant rise in freight costs in its North America segment in the first quarter of 2018. You can see  .Meanwhile, PepsiCo expects its gross margin to remain under pressure in fiscal 2018 due to the higher input costs. The company has been undertaking various productivity initiatives to improve its margins. However, the favorable impact of productivity measures is expected to be offset by investments in PepsiCo's growth initiatives.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"\"the world's first trillionaires,\"\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In 2017, net sales declined 1.1% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. The dismal scenario is not expected to see a turnaround in the to-be-reported quarter. Kraft Heinz's sales are expected to witness negligible growth (0.1%) in the first quarter of 2018, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Increased retail competition in developed markets, distribution losses for Planters in the club channel leading to lower volumes in United States, Ore-Ida supply deficits as well as the impact of some pricing actions and trade spend timing will inhibit top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Its flagship United States segment, accounting for more than 70% of its total net sales, requires sustained improvement in sales for the company to regain its position. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment's revenues of $4.4 billion reflects 2.9% decline on a year-over-year basis.Again, lower retail inventory and lower promotion activity in Canada will hold back organic growth potential in the quarter to be reported.

Yet that comes as little consolation for those who've bought shares of the energy-drink giant over the past three years, as the company has struggled to get itself back on its former growth trajectory. Now that health-conscious consumers have mixed feelings about energy drinks in general, Monster has had to pivot to stay in touch with its customers' preferences, and after a good year in 2017, shareholders have seen recent gains slip away.Coming into Tuesday's first-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors were at least hoping to see a pick-up in growth rates from what had been a  . Monster's results did show some signs of recovery, but they still fell short of what its most ardent supporters wanted to see. Without even better performance during the rest of 2018, investors could start to doubt whether Monster Beverage has the ability to mount a full recovery from its malaise.Mutant is one of Monster Beverage's brands. Image source: Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage's first-quarter results didn't have a lot of surprises in either direction. Net sales rose nearly 15% to $850.9 million, and that growth rate roughly doubled from  . Net income climbed 21% to $216.1 million, and that resulted in earnings of $0.38 per share. That was $0.01 less than the consensus forecast among those following the stock.There were big disparities across Monster's different lines of business. The core Monster Energy drinks division was the strongest in the company, with sales climbing nearly 17% from year-ago levels. By contrast, the strategic brands division -- consisting of beverages Monster took control of as part of its strategic alignment with  (NYSE: KO) -- saw a 3% sales decrease. Some of that downward shift stemmed from changes in accounting rules, but even if you adjust for that impact, sales growth was much weaker there than for Monster's legacy brands. The catch-all other segment, which includes the American Fruits & Flavors business, saw revenue slide 16%.Other fundamental metrics were mixed. International growth came to 27%, accounting for about half of Monster's overall revenue increase for the period. Gross margin took a four percentage point hit on the heels of higher promotional allowances to Monster's partners, as well as sales mix and accounting issues. Yet the beverage giant managed to keep many costs in check, especially general overhead expenses. Case volumes rose 15% to 92.3 million cases, and per-case sales fell only a fraction of a percent to $9.17 per case.CEO Rodney Sacks kept his eyes on his company's long-term efforts. \"We continued to progress our strategic alignment with the Coca-Cola system bottlers,\" Sacks said, taking almost the identical sentence from last quarter's report and switching the word order.Yet the CEO did go into detail about the moves that have already happened and those yet to come. In the first quarter, the state of Minnesota completed the switch, and the company launched Monster Energy in Argentina and a key market in India thanks to Coca-Cola bottlers there. In the coming months, Monster expects to roll out launches in Uruguay and several Middle Eastern and African countries, along with a transition within the Ecuadorian market.Monster's stock buyback efforts also continued. The company spent $250 million on repurchasing 4.3 million shares of stock, paying an average of almost $58 per share. That's quite a bit higher than the $53 per share that the stock fetched immediately before the earnings report, but Monster now has a new $250 million program that it can use for future buybacks.Monster Beverage shareholders weren't happy with the company's results, and the stock dropped 6% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Some acceleration in growth was good to see, but Monster will have to redouble its efforts to fully satisfy those who've been waiting for a  similar to what the beverage company enjoyed earlier in its history.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company's continuous focus on brand and packaging innovation, solid revenue per unit case growth (up 200% year over year) in sugar-free portfolio, stronger execution and customer service, and improving operating efficiency helped drive growth.This has encouraged CCEP to step up investments in brand portfolio, field sales teams, route to market and most importantly, digital capabilities.In the last reported quarter, the company's net sales increased 12.7% year over year in dollar terms.

In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings missed analysts' expectation. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the last four quarters, the average being a negative 1.2%.Let's discuss the factors that are likely to drive the company's first-quarter 2018 results.Product innovation plays a major role in boosting revenues. The company's net sales grew 10.5% in 2017 on the back of a wide portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in domestic and international markets. The company also introduced a number of products in the quarter under review, which is expected to contribute to the upcoming quarterly results.In the quarter to be reported, Monster Beverage launched Caff\u00e9 Monster in three flavors, Monster Energy Ultraviolet, Monster Hydro in three flavors and relaunched Muscle Monster in two flavors.It launched Monster Hydro in Sweden and Germany, Monster Energy Ultraviolet in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom along with Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the first quarter of 2018.Sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment, accounting for 90% of total sales, improved 10.4% in 2017. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are particularly cautious about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content products. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks will drive the company's top line.Notably, strategic deals with notable brands bolstered the company's portfolio and strengthened presence in the international energy drinks market. The Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, improved more than 10% in 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Higher raw material costs (mainly aluminum and sweeteners), unfavorable product mix that included more Java products coming online (lower-margin product) as well as inventory destocking in China dented gross margin by 390 basis points (bps) in the preceding quarter. The company expects gross margin to be similar to the fourth-quarter level going forward, as the headwinds are expected to persist at least through the first half of 2018, barring inventory reserves in China. Along with this, higher distribution costs from higher freight expenses are expected to create pressure on operating margin in 2018.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 revenues is pegged at $859.8 million, reflecting an increase of 15.9% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for earnings is 39 cents, implying 18.2% year-over-year growth.Monster Beverage does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - which increases the odds of an earnings beat. : Monster Beverage has an Earnings ESP of +0.64%.

Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Coca-Cola's shares have rallied 1.6% in the pre-trading session following the earnings release.First-quarter 2018 comparable earnings of the company were 47 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents.Earnings also improved 8% from the year-ago profit level of 43 cents, helped by ongoing productivity efforts.Revenues of $7.63 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.43 billion. However, net revenues declined 16% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items, marking the 12th consecutive quarterly fall. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had 26% negative impact on revenues. The structural changes primarily include the impact of bottler refranchising efforts.Organic revenues grew 5% in the quarter, aided by concentrate sales improvement of 4% and price/mix growth of 1%. Currency also impacted revenues positively by 2%.Coca-Cola's total unit case volume grew 3% in the quarter versus flat growth in the preceding quarter.Category Cluster Performance: Sparkling beverage unit case volume increased 4% (versus no growth in the prior quarter).

Water, enhanced water and sports drinks were up 1% (versus 2% in Q4), and Tea and Coffee were up 5% (compared with 2% growth in Q4).Notably, Diet Coke's North America volume grew in the quarter following a full brand revamp.

However, revenues at Asia Pacific segment increased modestly by 1%.Organic revenues grew across the board, increasing 1% in North America, 8% in Europe, Middle East & Africa, 6% in Latin America, 3% in Asia Pacific and 13% in Bottling Investments.Comparable gross margin expanded 270 basis points (bps) year over year to 64%. The company's comparable operating margin grew 600 bps to 30.7% in the quarter, given the divestitures of lower-margin bottling businesses and ongoing productivity efforts. The upside was partly offset by the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.Organic revenues are expected to rise 4%. Acquisitions/divestitures (mainly the bottler re-franchising efforts) are expected to hurt revenues by 17%, while Fx is likely to have a positive impact of 1% on revenues.

In February 2014, the company announced a new five-year restructuring plan to generate annual productivity savings of $1 billion each from 2015 to 2019, through productivity measures. The savings come from improved efficiency through increased manufacturing automation, closure of manufacturing facilities and increasing capacity utilization, re-structuring go-to-market systems in developed markets, expanding shared services as well as simplifying organization structures.In the past two years, the company has been using automated high-speed packaging lines across the globe, which increased packaging line speed by up to 50%.

Most of the company's latest line-up of products offer health benefits like reduced calorie beverages, non-carbonated beverages and healthier snacks. It is working to offer products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat to reap benefits from shifting consumers' preference toward healthier products.Moreover, the company has significantly stepped up its advertising & marketing (A&M) and R&D investments to strengthen its brands and accelerate product innovation. It has significantly increased investments in social and digital marketing campaigns.

Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are a concern for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies such as The Coca-Cola Company  , Monster Beverage Corporation  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  .Though PepsiCo has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost the carbonated beverage business, no significant improvement has yet been witnessed.

Organically, revenues rose 3% in the quarter while unit case volume grew 1%. Price/mix increased on the company's disciplined approach to occasion, brand, price and package strategy, as well as positive business and category mix.Notably, sparkling beverage volumes have shown no growth during the quarter with 1% decline in juice, dairy and plant-based beverages, as mid-single digit growth in Minute Maid and Simply was offset by a decline in Hi-C. The company registered an 8% rise in tea and coffee, while water, enhanced water and sports drinks accelerated to 3% growth.Precisely, the company's sparkling beverage unit case volume remained flat in the respective fourth, third and second quarters with a 1% decline witnessed in the first quarter of 2017. Notably, the sparkling beverage accounted for 69% of the company's 2017 worldwide unit case volume. Hence, such vast exposure puts Coca-Cola in a weak spot.Coca-Cola's North American sparkling beverage business has been delivering sluggish results due to headwinds in the carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category. Cross-category competition, and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting demand for CSDs. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The challenges in the CSD category have been affecting all major soft drink makers namely Coca-Cola, PepsiCo  , Monster Beverage  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group  , leading to lower volumes and soft sales.Though Coca-Cola has increased marketing investments, and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts are yet to show meaningful results with the trend unlikely to change in the first quarter as well.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate called for Coca-Cola's North American segmental revenues of $2.49 billion, reflecting an increase from $2.39 billion a year ago but a decline from $2.62 billion in the prior quarter.Apart from the North American segment, Coca-Cola's Latin American segment is likely to register revenues of $1.01 billion versus $1.12 billion in the prior quarter and $926 million in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment's revenues of $1.73 billion indicates a marginal decrease from $1.75 billion sequentially but an increase from $1.63 billion in the prior-year quarter. Bottling Investments revenues are anticipated to decrease to $1.1 billion from $1.27 billion in the third quarter and $3.87 billion a year ago. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase to $1.2 billion from $1 billion in the prior quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues are likely to remain almost flat.Overall, the beverage behemoth's first-quarter revenues are likely to decline on structural changes. Meanwhile, the company had earlier stated that the first quarter will have one less day than the same period last year. Coca-Cola expects the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to impart a 26-point headwind and 6-point headwind on net revenues and profit before tax, respectively, in the first quarter.That said, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to some extent.

Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for MNST broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 7.1% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for MNST stock.If that wasn't enough, Monster Beverage isn't looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 2 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for MNST. You can see  .It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  ,  ,  ,  and  .The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Toyota, United Parcel Service and Duke Energy. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.Strong Buy-rated  's shares have outperformed the Zacks Foreign Automotive industry in the last three months, increasing +0.8% vs. -2.9%. Toyota's operating income and revenues rose year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018, it provided a positive outlook, primarily based on cost reduction initiatives and uptrend in worldwide sales, including sales in Japan.Further, Toyota plans to sell 5.5 million of electrified vehicles by 2030 for which it is collaborating with many companies to develop batteries. Additionally, by 2025, it has planned to sell vehicles either with a dedicated electrified model or an electrified option. The company is also focusing on the reuse and recycling of batteries for which it is promoting the usage of plug-in vehicle charging and hydrogen refueling stations.Shares of  have underperformed the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry as well as rival FedEx in the last one year. While the stock has gained +1.4%, the industry has advanced +11.9%. Shares of FedEx have gained +28.6% in the period.Despite this unimpressive price performance, the Zacks analyst thinks the rapid improvement in e-commerce is aiding UPS significantly. The new tax law, which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is also a positive for the company.In February 2018, UPS announced its decision to increase quarterly dividends by 10%. A further uptick in such shareholder-friendly activities cannot be ruled out, in the light of the savings induced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The company's efforts to expand globally also raise optimism in the stock. However, high costs continue to limit bottom-line growth. UPS' forecast for 2018 capex, which is higher than 2017 levels, is expected to push up costs further. 's shares have underperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry in the last year, declining -7.7% vs -5.7%. Duke Energy ended 2017 on a mixed note. While its fourth-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues failed to meet the mark.The Zacks analyst likes the fact that Duke Energy currently boasts a robust five-year capital plan and plans to invest about $48.2 billion in growth projects over the 2018-2022 time frame. With respect to its commercial renewables business, the company continued to expand its wind and solar portfolio, ending 2017, with nearly 2,970 megawatts in 14 states.However, Duke Energy faces challenges from severe weather conditions and natural calamities like hurricanes, which may result in breakdown and damage its infrastructure. In fact, Hurricane Irma had an adverse effect on the company's operations in 2017. Moreover, the company expects to incur environmental compliance cost of $3.4 billion for the 2018-2022 time frame.Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Monster Beverage and Fiserv.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

It is well known that cola giants like Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo  are seeing declining volumes in established markets such as the United States amid growing health consciousness. This is denting demand for carbonated soft drinks (CSDs), hurting other soft drink makers like Monster Beverage  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group  as well.Among CSDs, the cola segment has been facing the brunt of consumer shift toward alternative beverage offerings. The diet drinks are also under pressure, thanks to increasing consumer awareness regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Though Coca-Cola has bumped up marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts have not brought about any meaningful improvement yet. Sparkling beverage unit case volume was down 1% in 2017, which compares with flat volume in 2016. Sparkling beverage accounted for 69% of the company's 2017 worldwide unit case volumes.Resultantly, the company's total sales fell 20% in the last reported quarter, marking the 11th consecutive quarterly decline. Coca-Cola's shares have also lost 4.3% in the past six months, comparing unfavorably with its  's decline of 2.3%.The company has been firing on all cylinders to rejuvenate its portfolio. It has ramped up its effort to transform into a total beverage company with a broad, consumer-centric brand portfolio and an asset-light business model.Coca-Cola is pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits. In 2017, the beverage giant made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the acquisition of Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States. Also, it entered the fast-growing U.S. ready-to-drink coffee category last year and closed the proposed acquisition of AdeS soy-based beverage business.Importantly, the beverage giant has launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in 20 markets, with a reformulated product, evolved marketing, new packaging and upgraded execution. This product has been contributing to revenues in the United States since its launch in the third quarter of 2017.Recently, Coca-Cola ventured into the liquor space with the plan to introduce an alcoholic drink in Japan. The company launched its first-ever alcoholic drink - Chu-Hi - made with a distilled Japanese beverage (shocho), sparkling water and flavoring.Coca-Cola is in transition, moving away from being a capital-intensive organization. In 2017, the company achieved major milestones by fully refranchising bottling system in the United States. Its refranchising plans will help it focus on building its core brands and reduce its exposure to the low-margin, capital-intensive bottling operations.Though this effort has been impacting sales/profits adversely, it will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital over the long term.The company has initiated a productivity and reinvestment program to boost profits. These initiatives include restructuring the global supply chain including optimization of the manufacturing footprint in North America, investing in technology to streamline operations, implementing a zero-based budgeting program, headcount reduction and driving increased efficiency in direct marketing investments. Currently, the company plans to save $3.8 billion by 2019.These initiatives are helping the company to come up with better numbers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, despite reporting flat soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and re-structuring efforts. Organic revenues grew 6% on growth across the board, driven by price/mix growth of 4% and concentrate sales growth of 1%. Again, lower SG&A expenses (down 21%), higher gross margin (up 480 basis points or bps) and higher operating margin (up 540 bps) helped it come up with better numbers.Constant endeavors to foray into the other alternative beverage space, restructuring and productivity efforts are expected to lift revenues as well as profits for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 have moved up 3.5% and 4.1%, respectively, over the last 30 days, indicating analysts' optimism on the stock. You can see Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"\"the world's first trillionaires,\"\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company posted 7.5% revenue growth, a relatively tame result, which it blamed partially on inventory reductions by bottling partners in Europe, Chile, and Japan.Management estimated that the inventory draw-downs may have squeezed as much as two percentage points from top-line growth during the quarter. But that's only an educated guess, as the company must rely on distributors' own estimates of ending inventory levels of Monster products. Monster sells primarily to bottling companies and third-party distributors, although it does engage in some direct retail-channel distribution. During last week's conference call, CEO Rodney Sacks hinted that preliminary data showed some rebound in distributor levels in January.As Monster's stock swooned on the 1st of March, my Foolish colleague Anders Bylund made an astute observation:I really like this point because it illuminates the paradoxical thinking that can sometimes inform the market pricing of growth stocks. Widely used models of stock valuation, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or  , predicate that investors should expect a higher rate of return from volatile stocks (those that sport a steep  ) versus those that are correlated more closely to the overall market.So, the more the risk inherent in a stock (as measured by its beta coefficient), the higher an investor's required rate of return to compensate for that risk.Risky companies with growth potential justify their steeper valuations over time through steady, rapid earnings expansion. But repeated stumbles on earnings dates tend to have the opposite effect, depressing the stock price of such companies, as investors reassess long-term growth rates and temper their expectations for return.And yet sometimes, the very lack of earnings visibility is seen by investors as an expression of a company's potential over a stretched-out time frame. I believe this phenomenon is supporting Monster's current share price.Monster is being judged on its multiyear potential to expand global sales, pursuant to its 2015 partnership agreement with the  y (NYSE: KO). In this transaction, Monster received Coca-Cola's entire energy-drink portfolio, while agreeing to use Coca-Cola's global bottling partners and distribution system to expand.Indeed, the company has ramped up global sales in recent years. Gross sales outside the U.S. reached $1.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 23% over the prior year. This mark is 67% higher than the $658 million of non-U.S. sales Monster recorded in 2014, the year before its Coca-Cola transaction.In case we forget how long it takes to tack on distribution throughout the globe, going country by country, here's a synopsis of Monster's current launch activity provided by management. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company began distribution of its namesake Monster Energy beverage through Coca-Cola bottlers in Ghana, Morocco, the Bahamas, and Grenada. First-quarter 2018 launches of Monster Energy via Coca-Cola bottlers include Armenia, Belarus, and Tanzania. And during the first and second quarters of this year, the company will introduce Monster in important Latin American markets, including Argentina, Ecuador, and Uruguay.Image source: Getty Images.The gradual scaling into Coca-Cola's network makes it difficult to predict revenue from quarter to quarter. Monster itself doesn't have an extremely fine sense of the inventory levels different distributors will end up with at the end of each period, especially as it tries to get a sense of seasonal  for each new partner. This kind of muscle memory can take a few years to build.But Monster  illustrate growth for investors by examining its products' retail sales in the open market. In other words, once distributors place beverages on store shelves, how do Monster's labels fare? Sacks spent several minutes on Thursday's conference call reading independent measurements of Monster's retail-channel sales and market-share improvements in 21 different countries. Nearly all of these were positive, in some instances showing sales acceleration in the double digits, with Monster taking share from competitors like Red Bull GmbH in several countries. Consumer demand for Monster's lineup remains compelling.To return to Anders Bylund's paradox: Owners of Monster shares are investing on uncertain information in the near term, as the company builds out infrastructure with Coca-Cola partners in innumerable geographic regions. This type of growth is different from the linear expansion a young software company (for example) might exhibit. In the tech world, quarterly metrics like increases in total subscribers to a cloud service, or average volume per user, don't admit quite as much ambiguity.Last week's results pressured Monster stock. But if recent patterns hold, profit-taking will be followed by a stable or rising stock price, as investors return to their broader investment thesis on Monster Beverage. In the absence of smooth results, retail and institutional investors have focused, quite Foolishly, on Monster's long-term potential.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Assuming the transaction receives the approval of XL Group shareholders and passes regulatory muster, the combined companies will stand tall as the world's largest commercial property and casualty lines insurer based on gross written premiums.\"We are excited at the opportunity to build the scale, geographical footprint, product portfolio, and the unmatched commitment to innovation that relevance in the global insurance industry requires,\" added XL Group CEO Mike McGavick. \"In AXA we have found like-minded partners committed to the absolute necessity to innovate and move this industry forward.\"Monster Beverage stock jumped 2.9% after Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers upgraded the energy-drink leader from hold to buy. Powers also reiterated his per-share price target of $63, reflecting a premium of more than 16% from Friday's close.Monster Beverage stock is still reeling after the company posted  last week, with top- and bottom-line growth pressured by inventory reductions at certain international distributors. But Powers believes Monster's more-than-14% decline last Thursday was an \"overly negative reaction\" that creates a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Noting Monster shares still aren't cheap, trading at nearly 30 times this year's expected earnings, Powers also called it a \"premium-priced asset\" with a \"compelling growth story,\" particularly in a sector where peers are struggling to increase sales.More specifically -- and echoing comments from Monster Beverage  -- Powers believes that growth will be driven by a combination of Monster's entry into new international regions and its introduction of new coffee and athletic drink varieties in the U.S.Finally, thanks to recent tax reform initiatives in the U.S. that have freed up international cash hoards, he highlighted the increased potential for  to either boost its 18.1% stake in the company, or to acquire a majority or controlling stake.In any case, with Monster Beverage still trading near a six-month low, it's hardly surprising to see investors bidding shares up again given this encouraging vote of confidence from Wall Street.

Given the sharp gap-down price action, two potential trades now set up for active investors and traders. Source: When Monster stock missed analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line in its latest quarterly report, traders didn't take long to react negatively. The stock quickly dropped in after-hours trading and then fell more than 15% on March 1. Last week's sharp selling pressure likely cleared many weak hands out of the stock, yet many Wall Street analysts kept their price targets in the high $60s to low $70s.Click to EnlargeOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that MNST stock had a clear and impressive breakout move in August 2017, slicing above horizontal resistance (black horizontal) around the $54-$55 area. This led to a powerful push higher right into the January 2018 broader stock market highs, where the stock overshot its 11-month up-trend.In January, the stock became very stretched not only above its intermediate-term but also longer-term simple moving averages, which we can see with the MACD momentum oscillator at the bottom of the chart having reached \"overbought\" readings last seen in 2015.As a result of last week's roughly 18% drop, MNST stock has now once again reached the aforementioned breakout point for a revisit. While revisiting previous resistance often times is a healthy thing for stocks, when the drop back to support comes with strong downside momentum, it can lead to choppiness for a while.From where I sit, I envision MNST stock ultimately being able to hold support somewhere in the high $40s to low $50s, but in order to get back into longer-term hold positions, I must first see a proven bottom-building process on the weekly chart. This has yet to take place.Click to EnlargeOn the daily chart, last week's post-earnings selloff now has MNST stock significantly oversold.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Monster Beverage Corp (Symbol: MNST) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 27.9, after changing hands as low as $55.01 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 48.8. A bullish investor could look at MNST's 27.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

Revenue climbed 7.5% year over year to $810.4 million, which translated to a 17.5% increase in net income per share to $0.35. But analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $0.37 per share on significantly higher revenue of $843 million.To explain its relative shortfall, Monster pointed to the negative effect of inventory reductions by certain international distributors.Nonetheless, Monster CEO Rodney Sacks focused on the positive, noting the company launched its flagship Monster Energy brand drinks in multiple smaller countries during the quarter through its strategic alignment with  system bottlers. Monster Energy will also capitalize on incremental growth opportunities with additional launches in 2018, including in Argentina, Armenia, Belarus, and Tanzania in the first quarter. And the company looks forward to introducing new brands such as Caffe Monster, an energy coffee drink, and Muscle Monster, an energy shake targeted toward athletes.Even so, it's hard to blame the market for bidding down Monster Beverage stock after this underwhelming report. Until Monster can show signs that its future launches can reaccelerate its long-term growth, I suspect its shares will remain under pressure.Shares of Hostess Brands soared 15.4% today after the baked goods leader delivered  .

Both figures arrived comfortably ahead of consensus expectations, which called for earnings of $0.14 per share on revenue of $194 million.In particular, Hostess credited the recent introduction of its new Bakery Petites premium snack line, which single-handedly contributed around 3.1% of its net revenue gains. The remainder of its growth was driven by other new products including Chocolate Cake Twinkies, White Fudge Ding Dongs, and Golden CupCakes.\"We are pleased with our strong finish to the year,\" stated CEO Bill Toler. \"We were able to capitalize on the momentum provided by our robust product innovation and continued distribution gains to increase our market share.\"What's more, Hostess looks forward to new growth opportunities in the breakfast market, driven by its recent acquisition of the Big Texas and Cloverhill brands.As such, for the full year of 2018, Hostess anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.70. By comparison, Wall Street was expecting 2018 earnings near the low end of that range.Between Hostess' better-than-expected end to 2017, its optimistic view for the year ahead, and with shares down more than 20% over the past year, it's no surprise to see the stock rebounding in response today.

The company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.33%.Let's discuss the factors that are likely to drive Monster Beverage's fourth-quarter 2017 results.Product innovation plays a major role in driving revenues. The company's net sales grew 11.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2017. The upside can be attributed to a wide portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in domestic and international markets. The trend is expected to continue in the upcoming quarter.Sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment improved 11.6% in the first nine months of 2017. The segment accounts for 90% of total sales. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are particularly cautious about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content products. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks will drive the company's top line.Notably, the company's strategic deal with notable brands bolstered its portfolio and strengthened presence in the international energy drinks market. The Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company  , improved more than 10% in the first nine months 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage's sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected net sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment by approximately $13.4 million in the first nine months of 2017.Distributor termination expenses are likely to dampen the company's profits to some extent. It has been transitioning from third-party distributors to Coca-Cola's distribution network following a strategic deal.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $841.5 million, reflecting an increase of 11.6% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for earnings is 37 cents, implying 5.7% year-over-year growth.Monster Beverage has the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - which increases the odds of an earnings beat.

The quarter was impacted by hurricanes, which resulted in negative product sourcing impacts and a noticeable shift in product mix during September to lower margin case pack water. Despite these challenges, the company continued to grow with total sales increasing almost 37%, comparable net sales up 1.4% and comparable equivalent unit case volume growth of 1.0%.In the first nine months of 2017, Coca-Cola Bottling reported net sales growth of 38.1% year over year primarily on acquisitions and a 2% hike in comparable net sales on a 1.6% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Monster Beverage is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat.

Starting from humble beginnings with its former name of Hansen's Natural, Monster initially specialized in natural sodas that offered higher-quality ingredients than higher-profile competition. Yet the advent of energy drinks transformed Monster's business. Now, as consumer preferences continue to shift,  to keep up with changing times.Coming into Wednesday's fourth-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors wanted to see solid gains in sales and earnings. Monster's results were mixed, but a substantial deceleration in sales growth came as somewhat of a shock to shareholders hoping for a better finish to 2017. Let's take a closer look at Monster Beverage and what its most recent numbers say about what's coming down the road.Image source: Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage's fourth-quarter results didn't sustain  . Net sales were up just 7.5% to $810.4 million, falling well short of the consensus forecast among those following the stock for $843 million on the top line. Net income rose 16% to $201.3 million, but earnings of $0.35 per share fell short of the $0.37 per share that most investors were looking to see.Tax reform didn't have a huge impact on Monster's numbers. The company posted a $39.8 million charge due to revaluation of deferred tax assets, and mandatory repatriation of overseas earnings cost the company a minimal $2.1 million.Growth was relatively uniform across Monster's business. The Monster Energy drinks segment had a 7.6% growth rate, while the energy drink brands that Monster acquired from  (NYSE: KO) as part of their exchange of energy and non-energy products saw sales rise 7.8%. Only the American Fruits & Flavors business struggled, and even it managed to keep revenue flat year over year. Domestic business weighed on Monster's overall results, but growth internationally was stronger. The drink company reported a nearly 9% rise in sales to customers outside the U.S. market. Overall, Monster sold more than 86.5 million cases, up 11%, but per-case sales figures fell $0.30 to $9.31 per case.What saved Monster's bottom line was strong cost discipline. Operating expenses were down 4%, largely because the company didn't have recurring charges related to terminating distribution agreements. After adjusting for those items, overhead expenses were slightly higher as a percentage of sales from the previous year, but favorable tax treatment helped boost Monster's earnings.CEO Rodney Sacks once again focused on operations. \"Our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola system bottlers continues to progress,\" Sacks said, and the CEO pointed to new releases of Monster products in several countries that haven't seen them before.Further product launches are already taking place. In 2018, Sacks expects to make Monster Energy available in areas like Argentina and Belarus, while relaunching the brand in India. Meanwhile, the U.S. market should see an energy coffee product as well as a protein-infused beverage labeled Muscle Monster.Yet the big question is whether Monster can produce more growth from its new product launches. Greater penetration into overseas markets is fine, and trying to capture new niches domestically is also a smart strategic move. But in the end, investors seem to be coming to terms with the fact that Monster can't grow at a lightning-fast rate indefinitely.Monster Beverage shareholders seemed to focus on the short-term missed expectations in its fourth-quarter results, and the stock sank 6% in after-hours trading following the announcement. To get back its momentum, Monster will need to accelerate its growth, drawing success from strategic initiatives and new product launches to get back the energy it had throughout the 2000s.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Organically, revenues rose 2% in the period while volumes remained unchanged during the same. Price/mix increased on the company's disciplined approach to occasion, brand, price and package strategy as well as positive business and category mix.Notably, sparkling beverage volumes have shown no growth during the quarter that includes mid-single digit growth in Sprite, offset by a mid-single digit decline in Diet Coke. The company registered low single-digit rise in tea and coffee, offset by a low single-digit fall in water, enhanced water and sports drinks.Precisely, the company's sparkling beverage unit case volume was flat in the third and second quarters with a 1% decline witnessed in the first quarter of 2017. Notably, the sparkling beverage accounted for 72% of the company's 2016 worldwide unit case volume. Hence, such vast exposure puts Coca-Cola in a weak spot.Coca-Cola's North American sparkling beverage business has been delivering sluggish results due to carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category headwinds. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting demand for CSDs. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The challenges in the CSD category have been affecting all major soft drink makers namely Coca-Cola, PepsiCo  , Monster Beverage  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group  , leading to lower volumes and soft sales.Though Coca-Cola has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts are yet to show meaningful results with the trend unlikely to change in the fourth quarter as well.Overall, Coca-Cola's North American segmental revenues are expected to witness a 1.7% decline year over year and an 11.6%, sequentially, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Apart from the North American segment, Coca-Cola's Latin America revenues are likely to witness 9.9% growth. While the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment's revenues of $1.7 billion indicates an increase from $1.6 billion a year ago. Bottling Investments revenues are anticipated to decrease to $1.3 billion from $4.1 billion a year ago. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 3.2% on a year-over-year basis.Overall, the beverage behemoth's fourth-quarter revenues are likely to decline on structural changes. However, the company had earlier stated that its fourth quarter might benefit from an extra day compared with the prior-year period, which equates with roughly one additional point of top-line growth for the soon-to-be-quarter.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola expects the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 27-point headwind on net revenues and an 11-12 point headwind on profit before tax in the fourth quarter.The company had earlier stated that the hurricane strikes in North America during the third quarter caused disruption to its supply chain, registering an estimated $50 million rise in costs, majority of which is forecast to affect the fourth quarter.Nonetheless, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to some extent. You can see  .The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for fourth-quarter earnings reflects 2.7% growth from the prior-year period's profit of 37 cents per share.

For that, Coca-Cola's strategy to refranchise its bottling operations facilitated improved margins by reducing its exposure to the capital-intensive bottling business. The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Coca-Cola's adjusted EPS increased 2% from the year-ago level (after falling for nine consecutive quarters) in the prior quarter despite weak revenues. The company's earnings have topped the consensus mark in 12 of the past 13 quarters.The improvement was attributable to its ongoing productivity initiatives. Its adjusted gross margin expanded 170 basis points or bps in Q3. Comparable operating margin also grew 404 bps. The company's plan to refranchise its low-margin bottling operations and transform into a capital-light business are helping to improve its margins.

These include restructuring of its global supply chain, zero-based budgeting and streamlining its operating model.North America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to see tepid growth in the fourth quarter.

Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 3.2% on a year-over-year basis.Overall, the beverage behemoth's fourth-quarter revenues are likely to decline owing to structural changes and currency headwind.

These items are used by the company as intermediate inputs in some of its offerings. Any sudden supply-demand imbalance or fluctuations in price of these materials might significantly raise the company's operational expenses, in turn, weighing on the company's bottom line in the quarters ahead.The company also offers services in a highly competitive industry. Intense competition might lower aggregate market share and hence weigh over the company's revenues and profitability going forward.Also, sudden outbreak of a livestock disease or unfavorable government trading policies might hurt results going forward.Moreover, the United States Department of Agriculture's forecast regarding rise in global corn stocks indicates a probable decline in Pilgrim's Pride's aggregate corn exports in fourth-quarter 2017.Our proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

Among CSDs, the cola segment has been particularly facing challenges, as consumers are opting for alternatives. The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers - Coca-Cola  , PepsiCo, Monster Beverage Corporation  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  - leading to lower volumes and weak sales.PepsiCo's carbonated beverage drink volumes declined 4% in the first nine months of 2017 in North America.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Monster Beverage Corp , but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $50.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $78.00. The standard deviation is $8.271.But the whole reason to look at the  MNST price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MNST crossing above that average target price of $64.67/share, investors in MNST have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $64.67 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

However, Coca-Cola's 9% gain over the past year underperformed both its rival  (NYSE: PEP) and the S&P 500, which respectively rose 11% and 18%. Let's take a look back at what went wrong at Coca-Cola this year.Coca-Cola's sales growth is only positive on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange rates, acquisitions, divestments, refranchising efforts, and other charges. But on a reported basis, Coca-Cola's revenue has fallen annually for ten straight quarters.Image source: Coca-Cola.For example, Coca-Cola's organic revenues rose 4% annually last quarter as higher prices and a better product mix offset its flat growth in unit case volumes. However, its net revenues fell 15%, due to an 18% headwind from the ongoing refranchising of its bottling territories.As a result, analysts expect Coca-Cola's revenue to fall 16% this year and 12% next year. By comparison, PepsiCo's revenue could rise 1% this year and another 4% next year.Coca-Cola props up its earnings with aggressive buybacks. The company spent $2.8 billion, or 46% of its free cash flow, on buybacks over the past 12 months. PepsiCo spent just 36% of its FCF on buybacks during the same period.But even after those buybacks, Coca-Cola's earnings are expected to remain flat this year and rise just 4% next year. Analysts expect PepsiCo's earnings to grow 8% this year and 7% next year.Those dramatic differences can be attributed to the fact that PepsiCo's more diverse portfolio of carbonated drinks, non-carbonated drinks, and packaged foods (Frito Lays and Quaker) is better insulated from slumping soda sales than Coca-Cola's portfolio of beverages.PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi aggressively pivoted the company's portfolio toward healthier drinks and snacks, but former Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent and his successor, James Quincey, pursued different strategies -- like adding more non-carbonated beverages (via its acquisitions of Fuze, Vitamin Water, Honest Tea, and  ) and reduced-sugar versions of its flagship sodas.Soda consumption in the US dropped to a  last year according to Beverage-Digest. Demand is also slumping in other countries as consumers buy healthier drinks. However, the growing niche market of energy drinks is bucking that trend.That's why Coca-Cola took a 16.7% stake in energy drink maker  (NASDAQ: MNST) in 2014. At the time, it seemed like Coca-Cola would eventually buy the entire company, which is expected to post double-digit revenue and earnings growth this year.However, Coca-Cola hasn't expressed any interest in buying the company -- which likely dampened investor enthusiasm for its stock. Monster isn't cheap, with an enterprise value of $34 billion, but it could give Coca-Cola some much-needed growth.Coca-Cola's stock isn't cheap at 44 times earnings and 23 times next year's earnings. By comparison, PepsiCo has a trailing P/E of 24 and a forward P/E of 21.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which respectively pay forward yields of 3.2% and 2.7%, were both considered safe dividend plays in a low interest rate environment. But with interest rates gradually rising, bonds will become more attractive than blue chip  -- which could cause a sell-off of higher P/E dividend plays like Coca-Cola.If Coca-Cola's stock was poised to run higher, we'd likely see a lot of insider buying. Yet the company's insiders sold over 2.2 million shares over the past 12 months and only bought about 844,000 shares.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Monster Beverage Corp , but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $50.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $72.00. The standard deviation is $7.136.But the whole reason to look at the  MNST price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MNST crossing above that average target price of $62.40/share, investors in MNST have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $62.40 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Compared with its biggest rival,  , Coca-Cola's underperformance is more pronounced, as the former has provided investors a 90% return, double the return of Coca-Cola. data by In the third-quarter conference call, CEO James Quincey identified three broad tenets for growth. However, the last one received the bulk of the attention:Image source: Getty ImagesLater, and after considerable media interest, Quincey walked back his comments by saying although he'd \"never say never,\" he feels moving into alcohol doesn't make sense now. However, often the best solution is one already in front of you: Coca-Cola should lay off the booze and fully acquire  (NASDAQ: MNST) .While Pepsi's outperformance is recent, the roots of the company's strategy are more than 50 years old. In 1965, PepsiCo was formed through a merger of the Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay companies. Since then, the company has operated as a food and drink conglomerate, buying beverages such as Tropicana, SoBe Beverages, and IZZE Beverage Company for growth and diversification. Recently, while soft-drink sales have slumped because of health concerns, Pepsi's other brands have picked up the slack.Coca-Cola has continued to focus on beverages, only recently turning to acquisitions to grow its bottom line. In 2015,  and added a strategic partnership to expand Monster's global capabilities.Since Coca-Cola accounts for Monster under the equity-accounting method, it's easy to see just how profitable its stake in Monster has been. In the company's recent earnings report, Coke reported the fair value of its investment in Monster Beverage Corporation to be $5.6 billion. Meanwhile, the carrying value -- the price paid, plus earnings, minus dividends -- is $3.4 billion. In the event Coke sold Monster shares today, it would have a pre-tax gain of $2.3 billion, or 68%.While the alcohol comment received more attention from the press, more telling was Quincey's other two prescripts for growth. The first was to identify and incubate high-growth brands; the second was to nurture and expand small brands internationally, whether in-house or by partnerships. While Monster may not technically qualify as a small brand, given its $34 billion market cap, it's due to the company's tremendous growth.In the quarter ended Sept. 30,  , bolstered by a whopping 36% international growth. In the corresponding conference call, Monster CEO Rodney Sacks noted (emphasis mine):Coca-Cola already has a way to increase growth through an acquisition, and it doesn't require buying new, unknown companies or entering into new markets potentially outside its circle of competence. To consolidate Monster onto its financial statements requires a \"control stake,\" often considered 50% or greater.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan (JPM), Deere (DE) and VMware (VMW). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry over the past six months (up +26.5% vs. +18.1%). This price performance is backed by impressive earnings surprise history, with the company having surpassed expectations in all the trailing four quarters.The Zacks analyst likes the bank's efforts to control expenses. Combined with the improved rate scenario and rising loan demand, these initiatives should continue to benefit JPMorgan's financials. Given its solid liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, the company faces persistent fee income growth challenges, mainly due to slowdown in trading activities and dismal capital markets performance. Also, legal expenses are expected to continue lingering in the near-term.(You can  ).Shares of Strong Buy-rated  shares have surged +47.7% over the last one year, outperforming the Zacks Farm Equipment industry, which has gained +42.7% over the same period.

The Zacks analyst likes Deere's disciplined cost management and continued investment in innovative technology and solutions.Higher housing starts in the United States and an improving oil and gas sector bode well for the company. Recovery in the dairy and livestock sectors will drive growth in the EU28 region. Further, Deere's acquisition of Blue River Technology and the pending Wirtgen acquisition remain tailwinds.(You can  ). 's shares have gained +52.6% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Software industry which is up +36.1% over the same period. VMware's strong third-quarter fiscal 2018 results can be attributed to robust performance of its product offerings like NSX, vSphere and vSAN.The Zacks analyst thinks expanding product portfolio, partnerships with the likes of Intel, IBM, Amazon, Samsung, Fujitsu, Pivotal, Alphabet, and Microsoft along with continuing enterprise deal wins will drive results in the rest of fiscal 2018. Moreover, aggressive share repurchase will support bottom-line. However, several of the growth engines that the company is relying on could take longer to yield results.Heavy spending on R&D may weigh on its margins in the near future. Moreover, intensifying competition from Microsoft and Citrix Systems remains a major headwind in the near term.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Monster Beverage (MNST), Principal Financial (PFG) and Fortive (FTV).Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

However, higher costs pertaining to product innovation are hurting margins.Recently, this marketer and distributor of energy drinks and alternative beverages announced  results.The company reported adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net sales of $909.5 million beat the consensus mark of $901.1 million by 0.9%.Meanwhile, shares of Monster Beverage have gained 42.9% year to date, outpacing the  's gain of 14.8%. Estimates for the current quarter and year have also inched up 2.8% and 0.7%, respectively, over the past two months, reflecting analysts' optimism over the stock's prospects.Monster Beverage has a wide range of brands such as Monster Energy, Java Monster, X- Presso Monster, Worx Energy and Vidration. Further, the addition of Coca-Cola's energy drink brands has strengthened Monster Beverage's position.The Coca-Cola deal, also denoted as TCCC deal, provides Monster Beverage full access to Coca-Cola's world-class global distribution network. Under the agreement, Coca-Cola and its bottling partners act as Monster Beverage's preferred distribution partner globally, thereby ensuring greater exposure for the company's products. TCCC subsidiaries accounted for approximately 21% of the company's net sales in the first nine months of 2017. Notably, Monster Beverage's cash position received a major boost from the deal, which has encouraged it to consider a return of capital to its shareholders through share repurchases. Moreover, the brands acquired from TCCC, which produce concentrates or beverage bases, are high-margin products that make significant contribution to sales and gross margins.In addition to the deal, product innovation acts as a major growth driver. The company regularly introduces new flavors to existing products.Moreover, due to growing health awareness, consumers are now particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content and are moving toward alternatives such as energy drinks. This has been denting sales for most beverage companies like PepsiCo, Inc.  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  . Monster Beverage in addition to carbonated soft drinks has a portfolio based on energy drinks, which should drive the company's top line in the near term. In fact, net sales at the segment, comprising Monster Energy drinks as well as Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 11.4% in the first nine months of 2017.Despite the company introducing the new Mutant along with increased distribution, total Mutant sales have not been promising so far. Again, delays in Hydro, production capacity shortages related to Java Monster and Muscle Monster raise concerns. Moreover, although the company is trying to recover from operational limitations, Java Monster production issues have negatively impacted sales so far in 2017.Meanwhile, Monster Beverage's increased marketing spend to boost top-line growth and attract customers is likely to build pressure on margins. Operating expenses increased 15.1% year over year in the first nine months of 2017. Monster Beverage's operating margin fell 10 basis points (bps) in the same time frame owing to higher general and administrative as well as marketing expenses on international expansion.Nevertheless, various innovative sales-boosting efforts are expected to drive the top line for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Yet as any experienced investor knows, strong past performance is no guarantee that a company will continue to produce amazing returns, and often,  even after they've already enjoyed dramatic success.Coming into Wednesday's third-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors were looking for double-digit percentage gains in sales and earnings. Monster delivered on both fronts, but some of those following the stock were nevertheless disappointed with what the company said. Let's look more closely at Monster Beverage and what its latest report says about its prospects.Image source: Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage's third-quarter results were encouraging in some ways  . Net sales growth accelerated to more than 15%, with $909.5 million in revenue beating the consensus forecast among those following the stock by about $6 million. Net income climbed 14% to $218.7 million, and that produced earnings of $0.38 per share. That fell short of the $0.40 per share that investors were expecting to see, but Monster pointed to distributor termination expenses that would have closed that $0.02 per share gap.Monster's segments behaved the way that most investors would generally expect. The key Monster Energy drinks segment had the best growth, with sales climbing 17% from year-ago levels. The sales of energy drink brands acquired from  (NYSE: KO) saw more sluggish sales growth of 6%, and still represents less than 10% of the company's overall revenue. Products from the acquired American Fruits & Flavors business saw revenue declines during the quarter, and their influence on Monster's overall performance is insignificant, making up less than 1% of total sales.Monster's international popularity continued to grow. Net sales outside the U.S. jumped 36% from year-ago levels, and the proportion of international revenue is approaching 30%. On the expense side of the equation, distributor termination expenses played the biggest role in weighing down operating income, although a rise in selling expenses also held back profit growth.Case volumes were extremely strong. Monster sold 96.2 million cases during the quarter, up by more than 13 million cases from the year-ago quarter. Average sale price of $9.40 per case was down $0.05 from the third quarter of 2016 but still supported substantial overall revenue growth.CEO Rodney Sacks was happy with the way that Monster Beverage has made progress. \"During the third quarter, we successfully transitioned Nicaragua and Vietnam to Coca-Cola bottlers and commenced distribution of Monster Energy in Georgia, Kuwait, and Taiwan,\" Sacks said. The CEO noted that the overall strategic alignment of distribution to take advantage of the Coca-Cola partnership has been going well.Monster is more optimistic about its future prospects. In October, the company launched Monster Energy products in several smaller countries, and it expects a relaunch in India in the near future. With the release of Espresso Monster and NOS Nitro Mango in the U.S., Monster is paying attention to all of its markets, and Sachs sees further product launches coming in 2018.Yet investors in Monster Beverage weren't impressed by the rebound in top-line growth rates, and the stock sank almost 5% in after-hours trading following the announcement. At this point, valuations on the stock are high enough that even solid performance likely won't be enough to satisfy many shareholders. Until the company demonstrates further progress in using the Coca-Cola relationship to maximum effect, Monster Beverage could fall short of its full potential to grow.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Monster Beverage wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nalyst ratings can sometimes be complicated, and we here at  have noticed a bit of a paradox with Monster Beverage Corp (Symbol: MNST). The average 12-month price target for MNST - averaging the work of 10 analysts - reveals an average price target of $60.90/share. That's a whopping -1.77%  where MNST has been trading recently at $62.00/share. With this kind of downside potential (should MNST fall to that price target), one might expect to see a high concentration of \"hold\" or even \"sell\" ratings on the stock. Yet, take a look at the bullishness:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the table above is from 1 to 5, where 1 would be a consensus Strong Buy and 5 would be a consensus Strong Sell. In the middle, 3 would be a Hold. So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment. The average rating of 1.45 for MNST leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the MNST price target paints a different picture. Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at Monster Beverage Corp . Of course, the average price target is just that - a mathematical average, and is only one metric. There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $67.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $50.00. The standard deviation is $6.261.But the whole reason to look at the  in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes - much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the  guess tends to be very close. And so with MNST trading so far above that average target price of $60.90/share, the -1.77% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good \"signal\" to investors in MNST to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Monster Beverage Corp .

The company's initiatives have been bearing fruit of late, with net sales increasing 2.2% year over year in the first half. The company experienced sales growth for the fifth straight quarter after a few quarters of no growth. However, the company had earlier stated that owing to the timing of some second-quarter shipments, Hershey's second half net sales are likely to be same as the year ago.To add to the woes, Hershey has been delivering weak performance in international markets since 2015, primarily due to soft results in China. Lower net price realization in international markets and challenges in China are expected to remain a drag on the soon-to-be reported quarter.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company's  (U.S. and Canada) segment revenues, comprising 89% of the total revenues, of $1.76 billion are likely to remain unchanged in the third quarter from the year-ago quarter.  segment is likely to witness a decline of 0.01%.Meanwhile, Hershey's adjusted gross margin and operating margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) and 270 bps, respectively, in the second quarter driven by favorable trade, supply chain productivity and costs-saving initiatives and lower input costs. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. However, softness in sales and unfavorable mix are expected to hurt Hershey's margins. Again, higher advertising as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are expected to restrict the margins.Overall, Hershey's bottom line is likely to benefit depending on its ability to increase prices, along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives to offset lower volumes, flat sales, unfavorable mix and more advertising expenses and SG&A costs.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.28, reflecting a decrease of 0.9% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $2 billion, implying 0.02% year-over-year growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.Hershey has the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .

The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last nine quarters, primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category, and structural changes.Coca-Cola's second-quarter revenues declined 16% year over year due to currency headwinds and negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 17% impact on revenues, while currency headwinds hurt sales by 2%. The company's soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 19-20% in net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items. The company also expects currency headwinds to hurt quarterly net revenues by 1-2%. North America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to see tepid growth in third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $2.6 billion reflect growth of 1% from the year-ago quarter.Latin America revenues are likely to witness 4.8% growth. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment revenues of $1.9 billion indicates a decrease of 7.1% from the prior quarter and Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease 54% year over year. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to decrease 0.4% on a year-over-year basis.Coming to the company's bottom line, i.e. EPS, the cola giant has surpassed analysts' expectations for earnings in 12 of the past 13 quarters. However, the company's adjusted EPS, excluding one-time items, have fallen for the past nine consecutive quarters.As mentioned earlier, Coca-Cola expects net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items to have a headwind of 9-10% on profits before taxes in the to-be-reported quarter. Currency fluctuations are anticipated to have an adverse impact of 2-3% on quarterly profits before taxes.That said, Coca-Cola is taking aggressive cost-cutting and strategic measures to mitigate the impact of lower sales and weak volumes. Adjusted consolidated gross margins expanded 210 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.6% in the second quarter of 2017, as currency headwinds were offset by positive pricing and productivity gains. We expect to witness similar trends in the to-be reported quarter as well.Overall, the beverage behemoth's third-quarter revenues/profits are likely to decline owing to structural changes and currency headwind. We feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent. The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital in the long run by reducing exposure to the low-margin bottling operations.For the third quarter, Coca-Cola's Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 49 cents, reflecting a 0.7% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $8.84 billion, implying 16.9% decline.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Coca-Cola has the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .

However, the company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 1.42%.The chart below depicts the surprise history. | Monster Beverage has been doing well on the back of product innovation that plays a major role in the company's success. The company's net sales grew 9.4% year over year in the first half of 2017, banking on wide-ranging portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in both the domestic and international markets.The company's sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment, accounting for almost 90% of total net sales, increased 8.7%. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are now particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and obesity-related concerns. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks should drive the company's top line in the near term.Again, the Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company  , grew more than 13% in the period. The company's strategic deal expanded its portfolio with notable brands, with increased presence in the international energy drinks market. This addition has been boosting the company's sales and the trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company is experiencing solid growth in margins. The company's first as well as second quarters' gross margin benefitted from the raw material cost savings related to the American Fruits & Flavors acquisition. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage's sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Although the U.S. dollar has softened against other currencies, the impact is still significant.Distributor termination expenses too might affect the company's bottom line. The company has been transitioning from third-party distributors to Coca-Cola's distribution network following the strategic deal with Coca-Cola.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 40 cents a share, reflecting an increase of 20.8% year over year.

This consumer goods company has exceeded analysts' expectations for nine consecutive quarters despite lower sales.The company has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years. Weak volumes and slowing market growth along with foreign exchange headwind have been hurting its sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, also adds to the worries.The trend is unlikely to change for the to-be-reported quarter. Softness in the United States, United Kingdom and volatility in developing markets is likely to adversely impact Procter & Gamble's results. In fact, categories in the company's largest and most profitable market, the United States (accounting for 42% of total net sales in fiscal 2017), grew barely above flat in fiscal fourth-quarter 2017. The U.S. market growth slowed to just above 1% in fiscal 2017 from over 2% in fiscal 2016. Overall, the company expects fiscal 2018 organic sales growth of 2-3%.Importantly, Procter & Gamble expects first quarter to witness the lowest organic sales and core earnings per share (EPS) growth of the year, as the period compares against the highest organic growth base period. Top-line headwinds from portfolio choices and the recent Gillette price reduction in the United States will primarily impact the first half of fiscal-2018 results. Fabric & Home Care, comprising about 32% of the total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fabric & Home Care revenues of $5.4 billion reflect growth of 3.5% sequentially and 1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for Baby, Feminine & Family Care revenues of $4.6 billion indicates an increase of 0.5% from the prior-year quarter.Again, revenues from Beauty segment are expected to increase 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. Health Care revenues will most likely witness 0.9% growth. However, Grooming revenues is likely to register 2.1% year-over-year revenue decline.Here are the other factors that might influence Procter & Gamble's Q1 results:To counter the tepid sales growth, Procter & Gamble has been benefiting from its ongoing restructuring program aimed at reducing costs and driving efficiency. The company has been taking various restructuring initiatives aimed at generating higher profit and lowering costs. These initiatives have helped the company to accelerate margins growth amid the slowdown in sales.The company's focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs and lowering its marketing and advertising spending could boost its operating margins in the coming quarters.However, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category, higher commodity costs, a tough retail environment, an unfavorable mix, and year-over-year comparables are anticipated to continue being a drag in its bottom-line growth rate.For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.07, reflecting an increase of 4.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.6 billion, implying a 0.8% growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Procter & Gamble has the right combination of two main ingredients - a positive  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Monster Beverage Corp , but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $50.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $65.00. The standard deviation is $5.775.But the whole reason to look at the  MNST price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

We know that because several of  's (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) holdings pay handsome dividends and offer outstanding value, including  (NYSE: IBM) , recently added real estate investment trust (REIT)  (NYSE: STOR) , and beverage giant  (NYSE: KO) .Our Foolish investors take a closer look at these three stocks, to see what made them attractive to the Oracle of Omaha.Image source: The Motley Fool. Despite Berkshire's sell-off of a large chunk of its stake earlier this year, IBM remains one of Buffett's largest holdings, and with its outstanding 4.2% dividend yield, it's one of his highest-yielding stocks.As investors saw again last quarter, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty's transformation of her company to a cloud-first provider by way of its  initiative is still a work in progress. The result of IBM's ongoing transition was another drop in total sales last quarter to $19.3 billion, a 5% year-over-year decline.That may explain why Buffett sold off some of his stake. But why does he still hold billions of dollars of IBM stock? Aside from the dividend, IBM is a leader in the fast-growing cloud market. In fact, at an annual run rate of $15.1 billion, IBM is one of the largest cloud providers on the planet. Last quarter's $3.9 billion in cloud sales was an impressive 15% year-over-year jump, and its trailing-12-month total of $8.8 billion in cloud-as-a-service revenue was a 30% improvement.Another of IBM's objectives is to become a more efficiently run organization, and IBM took another step in the right direction toward that end last quarter. The company shaved $300 million off its total costs in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period, contributing to an 11% drop in total expenses during the first half of this year to $12.7 billion.Yes, IBM has fallen out of favor, but in addition to its industry-leading dividend yield, it's also one of the best values around. Priced at a meager 10 times future earnings, IBM is hard to beat for investors in search of high yields. Store Capital, a new addition to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, looks like a compelling buy today for two reasons: a sustainable business model and a dividend yield of 4.5%.First, a bit about what Store Capital does. It's a net-lease  that acquires and manages single-tenant properties. Store is a young company, founded in 2011, but its portfolio has already expanded to 1,770 properties across retail, manufacturing, and service sectors in the United States. You may have already guessed why Store's dividend is appealing: As a REIT, the company must pay out 90% or more of its taxable income in dividends.What's more, Store pretty much makes for a dividend growth stock, given how its profits and dividends are rising. Consider that the company grew its funds from operations and dividends at annual average rates of 10.1% and 8.6%, respectively, between 2013 and 2016. Much of this growth can be credited to Store's business model, or, specifically, the rent escalator clause in its lease agreements -- thanks to which the rent at which the company leases properties keeps rising at regular intervals. This benefit, of course, flows down to the company's bottom line.Store's diversified portfolio, the long-term lease agreements, and the rent escalation clause should protect its profits and dividend payouts. Meanwhile, the company's expansion plans should drive its growth, reaping richer dividends for investors along the way. Coca-Cola may not be the original Warren Buffett investment, but it's identified with Buffett as few other stocks are. Maybe it deserves a place in your portfolio, too.The beverage giant today is much more than the soda king it was when Buffett first started acquiring shares in it. It has divested itself of almost all its bottling operations, and it's moving its beverage lineup away from the sugary drinks upon which it made its mark and toward those in line with consumer tastes today, such as energy drinks, tea juices, and flavored waters. It already has  in  (NASDAQ: MNST) and is speculated to be considering buying out the rest.And when it comes to dividends, few companies can compare with Coca-Cola, which has raised its payout to investors for 55 consecutive years. The dividend currently yields 3.2%. While there are a few companies in Buffett's portfolio that have higher yields than that, Coca-Cola surpasses the vast majority of them and has the added benefit of being a supremely stable and consistent stock.It's a unique performance among companies that qualify as Dividend Aristocrats. With a commitment to continue growing its payout to investors, Coca-Cola brings with it safety, security, performance, and income. There's a good reason the drink giant is in Buffett's portfolio.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.15, reflecting a decline of 1.8% year over year.Apart from the default, the hurricanes in the United States and the earthquake in Mexico impacted Dr Pepper's operations. However, the company did not specify the extent to which such calamities have affected its operating results. Also, it expects about a $5-million increase in health, welfare and risk insurance in the third quarter.Apart from these headwinds, let us analyze a few other factors that might affect Q3 results: Sluggish carbonated beverages (comprise around 82% of its business) volume trends are hurting carbonated beverages (CSD) category growth for quite some time now. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are impeding CSD category growth. The diet drinks are also under pressure due to increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSD volume growth is projected at a meager 0.02% for the third quarter, less than 3% growth reported last quarter and 2% in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, bottler case sales (BCS) volume is expected to grow 0.02% in the third quarter, lower than 3% growth reported last quarter and 2% in the prior-year quarter. Non-carbonated beverages (NCBs) volumes are expected to grow 0.04%, less than 5% growth seen in the last quarter and flat volume in the prior-year quarter.Overall, sales volume is expected to increase only 0.02% as per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, compared with 4% growth reported last quarter and 1% in the year-ago quarter. : Dr Pepper will be making heavy marketing investments for Bai brands in the third quarter. The company has already spent $20 million for promoting the brand in the second quarter of 2017.Bai Brands is one of the fastest growing beverage brands that offer a family of premium better-for-you beverages. Now, with the shift of consumer preference toward healthier drinks, Dr Pepper's inclusion of Bai Brands will boost its profit margin amid declining soda sales. : We are encouraged by the company's Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) program through which it has been able to reduce inventory and storage costs and improve cash flows, which can be returned to shareholders via dividends and re-invested in the business to boost the top line.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.77 billion, reflecting an increase of 5.1% year over year.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Dr Pepper does not have the right combination of two main ingredients - a positive  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. : The Earnings ESP for Dr Pepper is -0.10%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : Dr Pepper carries a Zacks Rank #4. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. | Here are some companies in the Consumer Staples sector that you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:B&G Foods, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.17% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Coca-Cola European Partners PLC  has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and a Zacks Rank #3.Monster Beverage Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +0.36% and a Zacks Rank #3.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

You spend hours or even days researching a company, and then, if you decide to buy in, you may end up holding for years without any profit (this applies in particular to deep value investing). For many equity owners, this lack of action is boring and unpalatable. It takes a lot of restraint to sit back and watch a position do nothing for years. Many investors want quick profits and minimal losses, but this is not what investing is about.Investing is long term because business is long term. Companies do not become successes overnight. Take  (  ) for example. If you'd invested $10,000 in Amazon stock when it went public in 1997, you would have more than $5 million by now, according to the Wall Street Journal. But how likely is it you would have held on to the stock through all the ups and downs without getting bored or taking profits?To benefit from Amazon's success over the years, you would have had to stomach some fierce drawdowns. Amazon has seen a 10%-plus peak-to-trough decline in every calendar year since it floated; between December 1999 and October 2001, the shares dropped 95%!The profits speak for themselves: To profit from Amazon you needed to have been bored.Today markets are boring. Realized volatility has been falling for years and is currently near all-time lows (what this means for the outlook of markets is a topic for another day) and the current Standard & Poor's 500 rally has gone 10 months without a 3% selloff, making it the third longest since World War II. Historically, 3% to 5% selloffs in the S&P 500 have occurred on average every two to three months.Boredom can be a dangerous disease for investors. In a recent note to investors, Logo's Capital highlighted a principle eloquently presented by Christoper Mayer: \"Boredom can explain a lot. It can explain all kinds of financial behavior. And there is definitely a 'boredom arbitrage' to take advantage of in the markets.\"This concept of \"boredom arbitrage\" is an interesting one as it links with the \"time arbitrage concept\" touted by other value investors.Today investors are looking for action. The market is slow, and this slowness inspires boredom trading. It's all too easy for the thought that \"this stock is going nowhere so I'm going to buy Amazon\" to creep into your mind when the market is going nowhere. Alternatively, if a company comes out with a bad set of figures, a dull market environment makes it easy to justify jumping out and into the next hot investment.The financial markets are still primarily composed of the results of people's decision making and thus are influenced by boredom. People get bored and just want to make something happen. Thus, companies and industries fall out of favor. Often what is out of favor is priced as such and thus offers the best prospects for outsized returns over the long term, ergo \"boredom arbitrage\" or \"time arbitrage\" depending on how you look at the opportunity or how it presents itself.Logo's uses  (  ) as a classic example of the \"boredom arbitrage\" trade:Just like Amazon, with Monster the long-term holder, would have won big, but are there any investors out there who were able to sit tight and embrace boredom through all the peaks and troughs?The most comprehensive data on \"boredom arbitrage\" comes from DALBAR's annual Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior report .According to this market research firm, \"in 2015, the 20-year annualized S&P return was 8.19% while the 20-year annualized return for the average equity mutual fund investor was only 4.67%, a gap of 3.52%.\"Why did average investors underperform by such a wide margin during this period?\"Analysis of the underperformance shows that investor behavior is the No. 1 cause,\" or to put it another way, investor boredom has pushed them to trade in and out of mutual funds as they try to beat the market.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Monster Beverage Corp , but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $50.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $65.00. The standard deviation is $5.775.But the whole reason to look at the  MNST price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MNST crossing above that average target price of $56.25/share, investors in MNST have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $56.25 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Nonetheless, this is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise.PepsiCo's third-quarter core earnings per share (EPS) of $1.48 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 by 4.2%. Core earnings grew 6% year over year, mainly on better operating efficiency. In constant currency terms, adjusted earnings grew 7%.Core earnings exclude restructuring and impairment charges and commodity mark-to-market net impact. Reported earnings came in at $1.49 per share, reflecting an increase of 9% year over year. Foreign exchange translation had an adverse impact of 1% on reported EPS. | Total sales improved 1.3% year over year to $16.24 billion. Although foreign exchange (Fx) hurt revenue growth by 1%, pricing had a positive impact of 3%. Reported revenues came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.42 billion by 1.1%.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 1.7% on an organic basis, primarily driven by higher demand for beverages/food/snacks in the Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA) and Latin America segments. Notably, organic sales growth was softer than the 3.1% rise recorded in the previous quarter.Total volumes declined 1% during the quarter against flat growth in the previous quarter. While organic snacks/food increased 1% (softer than 2% growth witnessed in the second quarter), beverage volumes dropped 1% (versus down 2%).Revenues grew 3% at the Frito-Lay segment, 1% at Quaker Foods (QFNA), 6% at Latin America and 8% at ESSA. However, revenues declined 3% in North America Beverages (NAB) and 4% in AMENA segments.Notably, the company's NAB segment was negatively impacted by operating cost inflation that substantially offset productivity gains. While volume sales were down 6%, net pricing was up 1% in the segment.Operating profits (on a reported basis) increased 5% in the Frito-Lay segment, 2% in QFNA, 14% in Latin America, 12% in ESSA, and 1% in AMENA. However, operating profits plunged 10% in the NAB segment.Core gross margins contracted 15 basis points (bps). However, core operating margin expanded 30 bps.Cash and cash equivalents were $10.24 billion as of Sep 9, 2017, up from $9.2 billion as of Dec 26, 2016. Long-term debt was $31.5 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $30.1 billion as of Dec 26, 2016.Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.8 billion in the third quarter. It was $6.1 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared with $6.8 billion in the year-ago period.PepsiCo now expects full-year organic revenue growth (excluding headwinds from currency and structural changes) to approximate its year-to-date growth rate, i.e. 2.3% (against its earlier projection of at least 3%). Currency is projected to hurt revenues by 1% versus 2% expected earlier, while the 53rd week in 2016 is expected to restrict sales by 1%.PepsiCo lifted its core EPS forecast to $5.23 from $5.13 expected earlier. The company expects core EPS growth of 9% (previously 8%) offset by 1% negative impact (previously expected to be 2%) from the Fx translation. The company now anticipates foreign exchange to have less negative impact on core earnings than previously expected.Also, management plans to return $6.5 billion to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Meanwhile, Monster Beverage's shares scaled a new 52-week high of $56.44 on Aug 31, finally ending the day's trading a tad lower at $55.82.Coca-Cola had already acquired a 16.7% stake in Monster Beverage on Jun 12, 2015. Hence, according to Cramer, Monster Beverage is a possible buyout choice for Coca-Cola as the company has also been focusing on portfolio expansion in order to gain a competitive edge in the U.S. beverage space.Furthermore, Coca-Cola's new CEO, James Quincey is known for his motivation in expanding the company's brand through acquisitions.In the U.S. beverage space, Coca-Cola along with other major soft drink makers like Pepsico, Inc.  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  have been facing carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category headwinds for some time now.Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness have resulted in a drastic shift in consumer demand toward healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters. Consumer's watchfulness over the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content has dented sales for companies belonging to the beverage  .In fact, Coca-Cola's second-quarter 2017 revenues declined 16% year over year to $9.7 billion, marking the ninth consecutive quarterly decline in revenues.Year to date, shares of Coca-Cola have underperformed the industry. The company's shares have rallied 9.8% as compared with the industry's 14.1% gain. Notably, new taxes levied on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressure are affecting CSD sales for Coca-Cola. In order to navigate such challenges, it is necessary for the company to diversify its portfolio by tacking on other healthier energy drink makers like Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage drinks are healthier options and keeps up with changing consumer preferences. New innovative mutant soft drink, known as \"super soda,\" has considerably drove revenues and profits in the last quarter from the year-ago quarter for Monster Beverage.However, Coca-Cola's strategic efforts in enhancing its portfolio as a total beverage company are encouraging. Takeover of Monster Beverage can therefore prove beneficial in terms of revenue growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

Growth  also have to remain strong, and energy-drink giant  (NASDAQ: MNST) has had to deal with the  on its ability to sustain lightning-fast sales gains.Coming into Tuesday's second-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors wanted to see double-digit gains for revenue and profit. The company instead fell just short on the sales front, and bottom-line performance didn't live up to hopes, either. Let's take a closer look at Monster Beverage to see whether its results can shed some light on the energy-drink specialist's future.Image source: Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage's second-quarter results  . Net sales were up 9.6%, to $907.1 million, falling short of the 10% growth that those following the stock had wanted to see. Net income gained at a more impressive 21% clip, to $222.6 million, but even though earnings rose to $0.39 per share, they fell just short of the $0.40 per-share consensus forecast among investors.Taking a closer look at Monster's report, the beverage-company's results were more balanced than we've seen previously. The Monster Energy drinks unit, which includes the key franchises for the company, posted growth of 9.7% in its top line. The strategic-brands segment, which includes certain acquired energy-drink brands, saw slightly faster growth of 10.6% compared to the year-earlier period. Only the products from American Fruits & Flavors, which make up what Monster calls its \"other\" segment, suffered outright declines, falling about 6% from the second quarter of 2016.Once again, Monster managed to produce extremely attractive results from its international outreach. Net sales to non-U.S. customers jumped by nearly a quarter, making up about 27% of Monster's overall top line. That left U.S. sales growing at less than a 5% pace during the period.Monster benefited from better results on the cost front. A big decline in overhead expenses helped to limit operating-expense increases to less than 2%, and that helped boost net margin by more than 2 percentage points, to 24.5%.From a fundamental perspective, Monster Beverage kept its loyal customer base. Case volume jumped 11%, to 97.2 million cases, and even a slight $0.10 drop in average case prices, to $9.27, wasn't enough to keep the top line moving higher.Monster Beverage CEO Rodney Sacks celebrated the fact that gross sales topped $1 billion for the first time ever. \"We continued with the strategic alignment of our distribution system with  (NYSE: KO) system bottlers,\" Sacks said, noting that transitions in Macau and Hong Kong to Coca-Cola bottlers went well during the quarter and will be followed by other transitions worldwide. New-product launches also helped to bolster growth for the company and should continue to add to performance looking ahead.Monster still hasn't found solutions to all of the problems it faces. Currency impacts are having a negative influence on results, in part because of the greater success of Monster's international business. In addition, production shortages of Java Monster and Muscle Monster products have persisted, and it's troubling to see that, even though the company has been aware of that problem for months now, it hasn't been able to solve it entirely.Investors in Monster Beverage disliked the shortfalls in the beverage-giant's quarterly results, and the stock responded by falling nearly 6% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Monster has done a good job of turning things around for its business so far, but it can't afford to let up in its efforts if it wants to return to the full glory that made it such a  throughout the decade of the 2000s.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Source: For those who want international exposure but via companies listed on U.S. exchanges, you need not look far. While they do not abound given overall market gains, attractively priced, high quality multinational businesses do exist.With that in mind, here are three U.S. stocks across food and beverage, digital payments and travel with international growth opportunities.Corona, California-based  (NASDAQ:  ) has definitively left its quaint roots in the Hansens juice business and grown to become, well, a monster.It dominates the energy drink market, which is its most important segment from a revenue generation standpoint, representing 89.4% of sales as of last quarter.One prong of Monster Beverage's growth strategy is innovation, which means product line extensions. Consistently coming up with new flavors and twists under their brands to attract new customers and boost volumes is crucial and MNST has been executing on this front.In April and May alone, six new energy drink products came to market with names that emphasize the company's focus on differentiation (Mutant\u00ae Super Soda, White Lightning, Monster Hydro Mean Green, Manic Melon and Tropical Thunder). And indeed, differentiation has been a key to their success in a world where the beverage aisles are already overloaded with hundreds of products. Monster has seen immense success with their bold graphics and a distinctive look to maximize their visibility and identification.The other prong of MNST's growth strategy, as is the case for many F&B companies, involves expanding internationally. Net sales abroad currently stand at about a quarter of total sales, and with such strong brands in place, Monster is looking to increase that brand. They've been seeing increased volume due to higher international consumer demand and intend to stoke further sales growth. So far, MNST has been succeeding on this front: 2014 to 2015, gross sales to customers ex-U.S. were up 8.4%, from 2015 to 2016, they were up a very promising 24.6%.Upon signing a distribution agreement with  (NYSE:  ), Coke owned a  in MNST. The partnership has been crucial to MNST's international expansion plan and Coke's further dominance in a growing, niche market. Given the synergies between the two companies, and MNST's attractive growth profile, I think an acquisition remains a distinct possibility and not a far-fetched one. (NYSE:  ) is perhaps the epitome of an extremely profitable cross-borders payments businesses.With the demands for global digital payments increasing exponentially, Visa is top dog in terms of market cap, sales and arguably brand strength. There are over 3 billion Visa cards in circulation accepted at 44 million locations and the network continues to grow.The great news for Visa and its shareholders is that as the payments industry makes the inevitable shift from cash and check to digital/card, V makes more money. That is, the economics are even more lucrative for every dollar spent on digital; a swipe on a physical credit card processing machine,  .On the international front, V has been uniquely establishing direct relationships with governments. China has proved tricky with specific timing and ultimate costs still uncertain, but strides are being made elsewhere.In Egypt, Visa signed an MOU with for a G2C program. For Visa, there is potential for 60 million new accounts and additional $100B+ in annual processing volume. And other partnerships are being built as we speak. This $235 billion market-cap company is just getting started.As the holding company for leading OTAS (booking.com, agoda.com and priceline.com), meta-search service (KAYAK), rental reservation service (Rentalcars.com) and restaurant reservation service (opentable),  (NASDAQ:  ) is a powerhouse in the online travel market.Incidentally, the size of the travel market outside of the U.S. is significantly greater than the domestic market. As such, recent international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the domestic growth rates. So, it's very much a big fish in a big pond.For the last fiscal year, the international business (majority of sales attributed to booking.com) were 88% of PCLN's gross profit. Booking.com is PCLN's most important brand that has benefited from the increasing availability of accommodations on the site.

Core earnings grew 10% year over year. In constant currency terms, adjusted earnings grew 13%. The upside was primarily driven by higher pricing, partly offsetting the weak demand.Core earnings exclude restructuring and impairment charges and commodity mark-to-market net impact. Reported earnings came in at $1.46 per share, reflecting an increase of 6% year over year. Foreign exchange translation had an adverse impact of 2% on reported EPS.Total sales improved 2% year over year to $15.71 billion. Although foreign exchange (Fx) hurt revenue growth by 1.5%, pricing had a positive impact of 3% on revenues. Reported revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.64 billion by 0.4%.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 3.1% on an organic basis, primarily driven by higher demand for beverages/food/snacks in Latin America and Europe Sub-Saharan Africa. Notably, organic sales growth was higher than the 2.1% rise recorded in the previous quarter.Total volumes remained flat during the quarter, same as witnessed in the previous quarter. While organic snacks/food increased 2% (higher than 1% growth witnessed in the first quarter), beverage volumes dropped 2%.Revenues grew 3% at the  segment, 2% at  , and 6% at both the  as well as the  segments.

The company now anticipates foreign exchange to have less negative impact on core earnings than previously expected.Excluding headwinds from currency and structural changes, organic revenues are expected to rise 3%. Currency is projected to hurt revenues by 2%, while the 53rd week in 2016 is expected to hurt sales by 1%.Also, management plans to return $6.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Last quarter, the cola giant delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.27%.However, Coca-Cola surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 1.51%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Coca-Cola's first-quarter revenues declined 11% year over year due to currency headwinds and negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 10% impact on revenues, while currency headwinds hurt sales by 1%. The company's soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 17-18% in net revenue from acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items. The company also expects currency headwinds to hurt the quarterly net revenues by 1-2%.The company's revenues declined for the last eight consecutive quarters primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category. Coca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets and shift in consumer preference.That said, Coca-Cola is taking aggressive cost-cutting and strategic measures to mitigate the impact of lower sales and weak volumes. Adjusted consolidated gross margins expanded 120 basis points (bps) year over year to 61.3% in the first quarter of 2017, as currency headwinds were offset by positive pricing and productivity gains. We expect to witness similar trends in the to-be reported quarter as well.Coming to the company's bottom line, i.e. EPS, Coca-Cola's earnings decreased 4.4% in the first quarter 2017. The downside was primarily due to higher interest expenses, resulting from additional long-term debt issued in the quarter as well as in the second and third quarters of 2016. Coca-Cola's first quarter of 2017 interest expenses were also higher due to interest rate swaps on the company's fixed-rate debt.As revealed earlier, Coca-Cola expects net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items to have a headwind of 3-4% on profits before taxes in the to-be-reported quarter. Currency fluctuations are anticipated to have an adverse impact of 3% on quarterly profits before taxes. However, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 58 cents, reflecting a 4.1% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the projected sales growth for the current year is pegged at $9.75 billion, implying a 15.5% decrease.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Coca-Cola is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .That is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 57 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 58 cents. Coca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see  . | PepsiCo, Inc.  reported  in second-quarter 2017 (ending Jun 17), with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

It's not always easy to separate the long-term winners from the flash-in-a-pan gadflies -- and making the wrong bets can get expensive in a heartbeat.To help you get moving in the right direction, we asked three of The Motley Fool's top contributors for their best ideas in high-growth investing right now.

One of the best business models a company can have is to act as an intermediary, taking a small piece of every transaction that comes in its doors.  , offering millions of people and businesses across the globe the ability to move money effortlessly through its electronic payment systems.As the global economy has grown, Visa has grown with it, and the rise of electronic payments in countries that are underserved by banks and other traditional financial institutions has only accelerated that process. Despite being the industry's giant, Visa has done a good job of keeping up its pace of innovation rather than letting rivals catch up.The best thing about Visa is that even though it's best-known for its credit cards, the payment processor bears no credit risk in its business. Instead, it allows banks to issue its cards, letting them take on responsibility for ensuring payment and leaving Visa to focus on making its technology as powerful and efficient as possible. That has led to long-term average annual growth rates in the high teens on a percentage basis, and most investors expect that trend to continue.For those seeking high growth, Visa will keep finding ways to participate in the global economic boom for the benefit of its shareholders.Image source: Author. Once upon a time, not too long ago, Monster Beverage was the raunchiest growth story on the market -- bar none. From 1997 to 2006, the company then known as Hansen Natural  -- about triple the gains of the  most profitable stock during this period.That decade-long surge started from a tiny market cap of just $10 million, of course. Repeating that performance today would create an impossibly huge titan with a $770 billion market cap. No amount of energy drink sales would ever deliver that kind of supercharged growth from a $29 billion starting point.That doesn't mean Monster Beverage is out of rocket fuel -- not by a long shot. In fact, sales have improved by an annual average of 12.4% over the last five years. Earnings grew at a compound clip of 18.4% over the same period -- and analysts expect that rate to  to roughly 20% in each of the next five years.These numbers stand tall next to just about any other growth stock, particularly ones with market caps closing in on $30 billion.  , albeit from a very different angle. The company has matured a lot, struck a mutually beneficial partnership with industry giant  , and positioned itself for a new chapter of international growth.Image source: Getty Images. The decking industry is dominated by -- no surprise here -- real wood, which makes up some 90% of lineal feet of decking sold every year in North America. Trex is trying to change that.Already the No. 1 seller of wood-alternative decking with more than 40% of annual sales, Trex makes up around 6% of lineal feet of total decking when factoring in wood and wood alternatives. But management is taking steps to  of growing faster than both its alt-wood peers and total decking sales.For a number of years, the company's marketing efforts have been focused on building brand recognition and defining Trex as the superior product versus competitors. The company has used both traditional media and social media to great effect, with the company saying it commands more audience share and engagement on  than all of its competitors combined. This has helped drive big increases in traffic to its website, and established it as the most-named brand in alt-wood decking. That has the company incredibly well-positioned to continue its strong record of growth for years to come.The best part for investors? Trex has proven it can generate significant operating leverage, creating a lot more profits from its incremental sales growth. Since 2014, earnings have more than doubled on a 44% increase in revenue.At 28 times earnings, Trex may not be cheap -- but it's worth paying a premium for small growth company that's set to disrupt a much bigger industry.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, the company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 0.82%.The chart below depicts the surprise history. | Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.A look at estimate revisions gives us an idea of analyst expectations right before a company's earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share remained stable over the past 30 days at 40 cents. This reflects a year-over-year increase of 20.2%.This double-digit expected earnings growth is likely to be driven by higher sales banking on innovations, solid demand for the company's energy drink brands and expansion into new markets.Product innovation plays a major role in the company's success. The company regularly introduces new flavors of existing products, while removing non-performing products. Again, the company's strategic deal with The Coca-Cola Company  expanded its portfolio with notable brands with increased presence in the international energy drinks market. This addition has been boosting the company's sales and such a trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.However, Monster Beverage's sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Although the U.S. dollar has recently softened against other currencies, the impact is still significant. Expenses associated with expansion, such as higher payroll expenses, are also likely to impact the company's profitability.Distributor termination expenses too might affect the company's bottom line. The company has been transitioning from third-party distributors to Coca-Cola's distribution network following the strategic deal with Coca-Cola.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $906.6 million for the said quarter, reflecting an increase of 9.6% from the year-ago quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Monster Beverage is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.

The only question is whether Monster would  Dr. Pepper Snapple, whose margins are considerably lower.A deal would also put an end to all the rumors that  (NYSE:  ) - Coke owns  of Monster and is the company's preferred global distribution partner - was eventually going to buy it.Of course, Coke paid $2.2 billion to Monster in 2015 as part of its strategic partnership which included Coke transferring its energy drink assets to Monster while Monster moved its non-energy-drink assets to Coke.I'm sure the two companies could figure out how to keep their partnership going despite Monster acquiring Dr. Pepper Snapple.

It has become a player in the food business.In April, Snyder's-Lance  Brian Driscoll interim CEO of the company after its chief executive officer of 12 years, Carl Lee Jr., retired.

However, both stocks have had bouts of good performance over the years due to a stable of strong brands.VF's CEO says his company wants to make a big acquisition, but the valuations are simply too high.\"We've looked at a lot of brands on a monthly basis in the last 2-3 years,\"  Steve Rendle in April in a  Q&A.

Coca-Cola, however, has not gotten every deal right. In fact, its 2014 decision to buy a stake in Keurig, the company famous for its single-serve coffee pods, backfired.It's not so much that Coca-Cola lost its $2 billion investment because it got much of that back when Keurig was  . Instead, the failure of the deal was the opportunity the company lost when Keurig botched their joint venture, the single-serve cold beverage brewing system Keurig Kold.Coca-Cola lost its opportunity to create a market for cold single-serve beverages. Image Source: Coca-Cola.Coca-Cola should have seen some red flags when it looked at Keurig's record beyond its K-cup machines. That platform was wildly successful, but efforts to create a machine for espresso-based beverages, and one that made full carafes, failed miserably. That didn't stop the company from charging into the unproven single-serve cold beverage market, and at first, Coke was very excited.Deryck van Rensburg, the Coke executive overseeing the Keurig partnership, said in a  :That all sounded nice, but Keurig made a major mistake that Coca-Cola should have seen coming: It charged $369.99 for the Kold. That's around twice what the initial K-cup brewers cost, which doomed the machine to failure.The Kold was Coca-Cola's first foray into allowing its products to be made at home. That could have become a viable niche for the company, serving apartment dwellers and others who would prefer to not lug cans and bottles of soda around.In theory, had the company not worked with Keurig, it could have created a Coke-branded cold beverage platform. That might not have been a runaway hit, but it could have succeeded like the  Verismo coffee brewer. That machine has not replaced K-cup brewers or even dented that audience, but it does serve a market seeking a higher-end experience.It's logical to think that with $2 billion and over a year, Coca-Cola could have launched a machine more consumer-friendly than the Kold. That's not an opportunity lost forever, but the Keurig failure makes it unlikely the company will try again soon.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Oil prices are also applying pressure this Monday morning, slipping to $46.21 per barrel at last check.On the options front, volume remained fairly average on Friday, with about 15.3 million calls and 12.6 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose slightly to 0.54, though the recent attention to calls dropped the 10-day moving average to 0.64 from Thursday's two-month high of 0.66. Against this backdrop, futures on the  are down 0.11%, while  futures are off 0.07% and  futures have shed 0.08%.On the options front, Friday's volume arrived well ahead of average as traders prepared for gyrations in the wake of French elections.

Meanwhile, Hyatt and Westin hotel operator  (NYSE:  ) attracted a flood of put volume after the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings results. Finally,  (NYSE:  ) was hit with heavy put volume after Warren Buffett admitted he was wrong on the company.Apple has quite the hoard of cash right now, and every analyst on Wall Street is speculating on what the iPhone maker will buy - especially since Apple only hiked its dividend by a disappointing 10.5%.With the company recently receiving approval to test self-driving cars in California,  that Tesla could be on Apple's shopping list.

While total volume rose to a respectable 712,000 contracts on the day, calls only captured 46% of the day's take. As  of last week, puts have gained considerable attention on Tesla stock recently.What's more, as a result of Friday's influx of put activity, the May put/call open interest ratio ballooned from Thursday's perch at 1.15 to its current reading at 1.20. Currently, the May $300 put is the most popular, with more than 3,800 contracts in residence, as traders either speculate on support in the region via put sells, or snap up long puts betting on a decline.ILG made a rare appearance on the top 10 most active options listing on Friday after the operator of the Hyatt, Westin and Sheraton hotel brands posted  results.Revenue for the quarter surged 58% to $452 million, while earnings arrived at 35 cents per share, up from 33 cents in the year-ago period.Interestingly, puts were the options of choice following this earnings beat.

Yet with a past full of strong growth comes responsibilities to continue to grow, and Monster has more recently started to run into the traditional problems of how to find new avenues for expansion.Coming into Thursday's first-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors expected the company to see its past growth rates slow somewhat, and seasonal factors also came into play. Yet the energy-drink specialist is also working hard to find ways to expand internationally, and combined with new products, that might help Monster succeed in making more progress toward its long-term goals. Let's look more closely at Monster Beverage and what its results say about its future.Image source: Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage's first-quarter results returned to a slower pace of growth for the company. Net sales climbed 9% to $742.1 million, which was almost exactly what most investors had expected to see. Net income also rose at a 9% clip, finishing at $178 million and working out to $0.31 per share. That figure was $0.01 per share less than the consensus forecast among those following the stock.Looking more closely at the numbers, Monster saw a reversal of fortune among its primary segments compared to previous quarters. This time around, the Monster Energy drinks segment, which contains the company's legacy brands, posted reasonable 7.5% gains in sales. Yet the strategic brands division, which includes the energy drink brands Monster acquired from  (NYSE: KO) as part of a broader partnership and collaboration deal, saw much stronger growth on its top line of 16%. Sales of American Fruits & Flavors products added another $5.5 million in revenue, or less than a percentage point of growth.Monster's efforts to appeal to a more global audience have definitely been paying off. Growth in sales to customers outside of the U.S. once again outpaced Monster's overall growth rate by a substantial margin, posting 28% gains compared to the year-ago quarter. From a geographical perspective, Monster continued to move forward with its efforts to gain more international acceptance. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. jumped by a third to $193.5 million, making up more than a quarter of Monster's overall revenue.Once again, Monster suffered from relatively large gains in expenses that weighed on its bottom line. Gross margin actually improved, but rising overhead expenses and selling costs outpaced Monster's sales gains. Moreover, some one-time distributor termination charges hit Monster's operating income as well.Yet fundamentally, demand for Monster products remains strong. Case volumes grew 10% to nearly 80 million cases, and that increase more than made up for the less than 2% price decline to $9.21 per case.Monster Beverage CEO Rodney Sacks continued to see the company's evolution in terms of the way it responds to aligning its distribution system with that of Coca-Cola. Within the U.S., the upper Midwest region made the transition to Coca-Cola bottlers during the quarter, and new launches in various areas in China continued. Monster believes that both China and India should be successful venues for product launches going forward, and that could spur greater growth later in the year.Yet there are some execution issues Monster will have to resolve in order to make the most of its growth opportunities. In particular, Sacks said that production shortages of the Java Monster and Muscle Monster products weighed on first-quarter results. That suggests demand could be getting ahead of the company's ability to maintain consistent supplies, and Monster will have to move aggressively to expand production capacity as necessary in order to avoid having frustrated customers give up and flee to competing products.Investors in Monster Beverage weren't entirely happy with the report, and the stock fell about 2% in after-hours trading following the announcement. In order to satisfy shareholders, the energy drink giant is likely to have to pump up its growth to a greater extent and find ways to broaden its product appeal. If it can succeed in doing so, then the Monster brand has plenty of room to grow going forward.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Hydro is  of a replenishing drink, designed with electrolytes and other ingredients that are supposed to make you feel refreshed after a workout or a strenuous activity, while also adding a kick of energy on top of that.Monster was expected to launch the drink soon, but the coming two months or so will be rough on the company as its release will be delayed. In fact, Hydro may not arrive for another 90 days at the most.The move is especially concerning because we are in the thick of spring, and quickly approaching the summer. It would be a hard pill to swallow for Monster if the company was not in the mix of the beverage giants selling mass amounts of energy drinks to its consumers.Additionally, analysts are concerned about the growth (or lack thereof) of soft beverages as this appears to be a trend on the decline. Many are turning to healthier alternatives with less sugar, carbonation and artificial ingredients.This is the healthiest that the company has been - or strived to be - in a while, and this trend is also seen in the rise of high-quality items at fast food chains as well.MNST shares fell 2.1% during regular trading hours Thursday.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n this segment from  , host Chris Hill enlists the help of Motley Fool analysts Aaron Bush and David Kretzmann to pore over the most recent results from  (NASDAQ: MNST) .Thanks in part to rising market demand, and in part to a critical deal with  (NYSE: KO) , the energy drink leader is getting its products into the hands of more and more consumers. Where will the company turn next to extend its incredible track record?A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Monster Beverage wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! Shares of Monster Beverage up 14% this morning after strong sales in the fourth quarter. David, a lot of that is going to the bottom line, too. Just in terms of this latest quarter, their profits look good. Energy drinks are hot sellers, and I think Monster still holds the honor of being the top performing stock over the past 20 years. I looked it up, any guess over the last 20 years how much that stock is up? Wait a minute, I'm sorry, it's the number one stock for 20 years?! I know this was true last year, and based on the numbers I pulled up, I don't think there's any other stock that's overtaken that mark. I can't even begin to guess. 26,000%. 238,850% over the past 20 years. What?! How? That's ridiculous! Right now, Monster is trading at about $48 a share. 20 years ago, it was trading at the equivalent of $0.02 per share, so just a couple of pennies could have but you a share. There have been numerous splits and stuff, but it's pretty incredible performance. Energy drinks have done wonders for the company and for investors who managed to hang on through that. That's ridiculous. I don't follow this as close as David does, but I have to say, every time that I think that a company is decelerating for good, or that things are going to slow down, as soon as I think that, the next quarter they just reaccelerate all over again, and raise guidance. Coca-Cola. Yeah, that really is the story with Monster. A couple years ago Coca-Cola took a stake in Monster. Coca-Cola basically said, \"We're done competing in the energy drink space. We're going to give Monster the few energy drink brands we have.\" And now, Coca-Cola owns about 17% of Monster. Over the past couple years, each quarter, Monster will transition over to Coca-Cola's bottlers and distributors. This quarter, they transitioned to Coke's distributors in Brazil, Costa Rica, Panama, so, increasing that Latin American presence. They launched in China, in a couple areas like Shanghai, Shenzhen, a few others. They're expecting to continue that expansion into China and India in 2017. So this is really a story of Monster getting their product in front of more people. Once they do that, whether is in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, or even in the U.S., they manage to sell more. It's just a very attractive business model. Right now, they have $600 million in cash, no debt. They're producing well over $100 million in free cash flow each quarter. So it's just a very solid, high margin business. It's been incredibly well run by Rodney Sacks, who's been CEO since 1990. He's been a big piece for that incredible performance of the stock and the company. They also are trying to get into this super soda category. I hadn't realized that Mountain Dew commands a lot of presence and a lot of market share in that category. What constitutes super soda? Highly caffeinated? It's highly caffeinated soda. It's not strictly an energy drink, it's not strictly a soft drink. It's somewhere in between there. It's just a little bit more radioactive, I guess. But Monster, late last year, they launched Monster Mutant, which really does look radioactive, it's this really food color-y green and red color. But apparently it's selling pretty well initially. Then, you also have lines like Java Monster, which is the coffee drink that competes more with the  prepared beverages. For those of us who don't get enough caffeine in our coffee, we can just grab a Monster. And that's the thing. You would think that with health concerns and the headwinds against soda, you wouldn't expect energy drinks to be doing pretty well. But between 2011 and 2015, the energy drink category in the U.S. almost doubled. This is actually a category that continues to grow. You have those tailwinds behind Monster, they're trying to get more market share from Red Bull and become the dominant energy drink brand in the U.S. and the world. And now with that they have Coca-Cola's distribution model, that whole system, that should continue to play to their advantage. I think there are still a lot of reasons to like this company going forward. And that's the thing. You think about Coca-Cola, which is, in some ways, the quintessential American brand. And yet, from a business standpoint, the overwhelming majority of sales of Coca-Cola products takes place outside of the United States. And when I look at Monster Beverage, and in this latest quarter, international sales make up just a little bit north of 25% of revenue. Even taking into account the gob-smacking stock performance over the last 20 years, I just look at that and go, \"Wait a minute, is it unreasonable to think that they can double international sales?\" No, I don't think it is. Yeah, at least. Looking over the next 10 years, I think you see those tailwinds behind Monster's back. Having Coca-Cola's whole distribution system, that should help accelerate that transition and that growth internationally for the company. And then, there's still room to gain market share domestically against Red Bull and some of the other brands that might be nipping at Monster's heels. So, yeah, I think there are still a lot of reasons to like where Monster can go over the next decade. And one thing that stands out to me is, five years ago, their gross margin was in the low 50%. Now, it's in the mid 60s. I think a big part of that came when the Coca-Cola deal emerged, and all that distribution, leveraging all those costs, has really pushed up the gross margin. But because they're still in growth mode, not all of that yet has come through and shown in operating margins and free cash flow margins. Even if revenue growth tapers down, there is still going to be plenty of room for the earnings growth to pick back up and keep the stock moving forward, which is just fascinating to me. Have you had it? I've never had one of their drinks, have you? I have, yeah. And? It's a lot of caffeine. [laughs] I don't drink the actual Monster drinks anymore, they're just a little too sweet and I'm like, this just can't be good for my body. But the Java Monsters aren't bad if you like iced coffee, it's pretty similar to a Starbucks frappuccino or something. So, I'll go with a Java Monster, maybe a couple a year, if that. We have to try the super sodas, see if we change colors or something. [laughs] See if we survive, yeah. You could probably run 10 miles after that. One of the things I love about companies like this who are performing like this is, it just makes me smile for all the times that I hear analysts talk about the growth in organics. \"Look at the health trends, we're all getting healthier!\" It's like, not all of us are getting healthier. Monster is there to fill that gap, yeah, and they've done a good job at it.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["oca-Cola Bottling Co.

Sure, the price is lower than it's been over the past year, but there's often a good reason for the decline.In some cases the market goes too far, beating down a stock beyond what can be justified by the fundamentals.  (NYSE: ZOES) ,  (NASDAQ: MNST) ,  (NASDAQ: BBBY) , and  (NYSE: OXY) are four good examples of stocks that could be in for major recoveries. Investors in the Mediterranean-inspired fast-food chain Zoe's Kitchen have had a rough couple of months. Same-store sales growth has decelerated and management was forced to cut its full-year 2016 guidance. Add in  that are weighing on profits, and it's understandable that growth investors have been dumping their shares. The pummeling has gotten so bad that the company now trades at the lowest point since its 2014 IPO. data by  .While it is true that the same-store sales declines are worrisome, I can't help but feel that the selling is overdone. After all, this company is still reporting  comp growth, which is something that few other restaurants can claim. In addition, Zoe's top line continues to grow at a healthy pace, rising more than 17% last quarter. While the growth is primarily being driven by new store openings, it's a solid figure nonetheless.Looking ahead, I think that Zoe's management team has an interesting plan to reignite comp growth. The company is investing in its website and mobile app in an effort to drive an improved experience and prompt more visits. The company is also adding new features that should make it easier for customers to order catering or delivery. Finally, Zoe's is planning on tweaking its menu to bring in new dishes.While it is still unknown if these strategies will work, I think the company deserves the benefit of the doubt. In addition, the company believes that the U.S. can ultimately support 1,600 locations. That leaves plenty of room left for growth from today's store base of only 150 locations.All in all, Zoe's Kitchen continues to look poised for double-digit revenue growth from here. If you agree, then picking up shares while they are on sale could prove to be a profit-friendly move. Monster Beverage is one of the best-performing stocks of the 21st century, so it's surprising to some to see the energy-drink giant trading near 52-week lows. However, Monster has had to deal with slowing growth in past quarters, and the strength of the U.S. dollar put some currency-related pressure on its financial numbers as well. What had once been an extremely high-growth company looked like it might be maturing, and that was bad news for a stock that had seen the very expensive valuations that investors tend to put on energetic performers like Monster.Image source: Monster Beverage.However, in its most recent quarterly results, Monster has gotten some of its energy back. The company reported a 17% rise in revenue, taking net income up by roughly a quarter as it rides its core selection of energy beverages higher. Also, Monster has increasingly taken advantage of its strategic partnership with  by using the cola giant's distribution network both domestically and internationally. That offers the prospect of more efficient operations, and that in turn could not only boost profits but also open up new markets in areas of the world that have a lot of promise for energy-drink sales.Admittedly, even near 52-week lows, Monster appears richly valued, trading at about 30 times forward earnings estimates. However, with good prospects to get its growth mojo back, Monster Beverage is definitely worth a closer look for investors willing to take some risk. Retail has always been a tough business, but a combination of excessive retail square footage and the continued growth of e-commerce will put even more pressure on weaker retailers in the coming years. Pessimism has driven down the price of retailers' stocks across the board, creating some bargains among the stronger players. Bed Bath & Beyond is one example.Investing in Bed Bath & Beyond certainly comes with some risk. The company has a long track record of producing solid margins, but we're in uncharted territory. E-commerce is accounting for an increasing portion of retail sales each year, forcing brick-and-mortar retailers to get more aggressive on price in order to drive store traffic. Bed Bath & Beyond is not immune from these trends.Still, with the stock trading for about 8.5 times trailing-12-month earnings and the company producing operating margins around 10%, shares of Bed Bath & Beyond could surge if the company manages to navigate the next few years without as much trouble as the market is expecting. Margins have been in decline over the past five years, with share buybacks helping to prop up per-share earnings, so the company will need to find a way to reverse that trend. If Bed Bath & Beyond can stabilize the bottom line, buying near the 52-week low will turn out to have been a great idea. Oil giant Occidental Petroleum isn't the company it once was. That's because it shed several assets over the past few years to improve its returns and focus on its best growth prospects. As a result, production has declined from a peak of 763,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013 down to 630,000 barrels per day last year. That declining production, as well as a recent sell-off in  , has the stock currently sitting at a 52-week low.That sell-off, however, looks like a buying opportunity for long-term investors. That's because Occidental Petroleum has gotten its costs down to the point where it can start growing again at current oil prices, which should eventually get production back up to its former peak even if oil doesn't recover any further. Fueling that outlook is the fact that Occidental currently controls the largest acreage position in the low-cost Permian Basin. Overall, the company has 11,650 drilling locations remaining, 2,500 of which have break-even points below $50 per barrel. That sub-$50 drilling inventory alone is enough to last Occidental 14 years at a 10-rig drilling pace, which is above the company's current six-to-nine-rig pace. Furthermore, that current drilling pace supports 20% compound annual production growth through 2019 out of the company's Permian resources, which would fuel 5% to 8% annual growth in companywide production.What makes Occidental a great oil stock to consider buying right now is the fact that it can deliver highly profitable growth at lower oil prices thanks to its prime position in the Permian. That growth alone should eventually lift the stock from its current low. Meanwhile, if oil prices do improve, the stock could rebound sharply because Occidental has the resource base and the financial strength to quickly ramp up its Permian production to capture those higher prices.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! What a day -- Snap has gone public. If you're an investor, this is like Christmas and your birthday and the 4th of July all wrapped into one. This is it. Let the mania begin. We're going to talk about that in a second. We're also going to talk about the latest earnings from Shake Shack and Monster Beverage. Let's start with Snap. Snap goes public at $17 per share. It opens for trading to regular investors like you and me at about $24.50. If you're scoring at home, that's a 46% increase right off the bat before regular investors can get in. At that point, Snap's market cap is $33 billion, which puts it in the top third of companies in the  . I don't know where to begin, David. This is, partly, madness. It's certainly exuberance, this is what exuberance looks like. This is also what it looks like when you haven't had a tech IPO in a couple of years. Yeah, I think people are excited. This is one of the bigger IPOs, certainly, in tech, that we've seen in a couple years. So Wall Street is clearly excited today. All rationality is going out the window for a day or two, most likely. It's interesting to take a look at how Snap today compares to  before the IPO. Obviously, Snap is a younger company going public today than Facebook was at the time it went public in 2012, but there are some similarities here, where you can see the opportunity or potential for Snap. It's still more of a stretch, I think, for Snap to succeed from here and really reward investors. But just looking at something like average revenue per user. At the time Facebook went public, its average revenue per user was $1.21. For Snap, it's $1.05. So, pretty close there. The main difference for Snap, and the reason the company is losing a ton of money right now and its losses are increasing, its cost per user is above $2, while Facebook's cost per user was more like $1.25. So, Snap now has even higher expectations. Whether or not the company can become profitable is something that they themselves question in the S-1. They say, \"We might not ever be able to reach profitability.\" So, there are certainly a lot of question marks with Snap. It's a riskier company, very high expectations, and still a very limited operating track record that investors can work with. I suppose you have to give them bonus points, Aaron, for just coming out and saying, \"You know what? We might never be profitable.\" At least they're admitting it. I do think that cost per user number is something that's going to prove to be one of the most important metrics that investors need to be looking at. When I read through the S-1 prospectus, I was starting to piece together that what management thinks is their competitive advantage isn't really the network that they have built, it's not necessarily the uniqueness that Snapchat has created, but rather it's their ability to innovate rapidly and always be one step ahead of the competition. And that's a very different kind of story than you hear from other social media companies.  is \"we are live\". Facebook wants to connect the world and that kind of thing. On one hand, this is good, because it's going to keep Snapchat out of the trap that Twitter fell into where product innovation stalled. If anything, with Snapchat, we've seen an acceleration in the number of new features and stuff that they have thrown out. So that will help them, definitely, stay relevant and improve engagement, and that engagement should lead to higher revenue per user and that kind of thing. But that does come at a cost. And that's just yet another hurdle to overcome. And when Snap says that they're a camera company ... Ugh. I cringe. That's their leading statement for everything, \"Snap is a camera company.\" It's like, what?! It's like, why are you saying that out loud? Wasn't  a camera company? How did that turn out?! So, I think that's an important thing to be thinking about, what exactly that means. I think for Snap, that means that the evolution of the camera is real, and Snap is driving that. It means that software is playing a bigger and bigger role in what camera technology is doing in connecting people, and having people engage with each other on a mobile basis, augmented reality filters, all that kind of stuff. But it also means that they're probably going to be stepping more into the hardware game. They've already done that with Spectacles. I still don't really know what I think about that. The Spectacles are literally just glasses. Glasses you wear, they take the 10-second videos that automatically upload to your Snap account. They cost $130. So, it might draw some comparisons to Google Glass. But obviously much more affordable, has a much more direct use case. So far, I think you have seen broader adoption, even at this early stage, compared to Google Glass. Yeah, and I think Evan Spiegel in general has constantly been an underrated CEO. He probably is a really brilliant product guy. So, for Spectacles, that obviously is a better thing than Google Glass was, and I think we will probably see the hardware portfolio expand, as well. I don't really know what that's going to look like. But I get the sense that things are going to be moving more in that direction as well. Yeah, design and innovation, that's the name of the game for Snapchat. And like Aaron mentioned, I think a lot of that starts with Evan Spiegel, who does have a very solid reputation of being a designer and an innovator, a product guy, in Silicon Valley. But I take a step back and I think, there was a reason that Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg were very interested. At first, they tried to compete with Snap. Zuckerberg actually flew down to Los Angeles in 2011 and met with Evan Spiegel, and he said, \"Here's what I would do if I were Snap, and by the way, Facebook is going to try to do this.\" And then, a year or so later, Facebook offered $3 billion to acquire Snap. And Spiegel and Snap turned it down without thinking about it, and they got a good amount of heat from investors and the press for that. And here they are worth 10 times what Facebook offered for them a few years ago. So, there is something there, especially with Spiegel.I think that leadership factor is a huge piece of the valuation today, and those high expectations for Snap. And Chris, you and I were just at the member event that we had an Arizona, and you talked to Brad Stone, whose new book  looks at the early days of Airbnb and Uber. And there was a quote that I thought was very relevant to how to think about Snap. This was a quotes from Fred Wilson, who was an early Twitter backer who passed on Airbnb, and he said that his mistake -- this is his direct quote: \"We made the classic mistake that all investors make -- we focused too much on what they were doing at the time, and not enough on what they could do, would do, and did do.\" I think with Snap, you really have to look at the bigger picture. This is expected to be the first year where digital advertising spend exceeds TV marketing. That's a pretty big milestone, if that does happen this year. And Snap is really trying to capture those dollars that are shifting from TV advertising to digital advertising, trying to reach that audience of 18 to 35 years old, which is really Snap's bread and butter. So I can see where the company is in a really interesting position. They have some tailwinds, potentially, behind their back. They have a very innovative CEO. But yeah, the costs are very high, they're expected to keep going higher. So the company probably won't make money for a long time. Yeah, and to give some final perspectives, on a numbers basis, when Facebook IPO'd, it came out with pricing about 28 times sales. Twitter was priced at 56 times sales. Snap, right now, at $33 billion, is about 80 times sales. [laughs] That's a high number. I would also keep in mind that today, Twitter, just to keep the comparison going, has $2.5 billion in sales, which is about eight times what it had when it IPO'd. And the stock, today, is trading for significantly less than it was when it IPO'd. Where it is right now, about $11 billion, is one third where Snap is right now. So, Twitter made all that progress, but here Snap is in the same boat. Would you rather have all of Twitter or one third of Snap? I'd actually probably go with one third of Snap right now. I would take that gamble on Spiegel. I just like the leadership and the vision of Snap a lot more than Twitter right now. It's obviously a riskier bet, but I think Snap, right now, with the leadership, is a bigger idea than Twitter. Aaron? I'd take Twitter, but getting creative, I think if I can take 100% of Twitter, you can have some more control, and then I could make a deal to figure out how to work things out with Snap. Aaron Bush, new CEO of Twitter. There are worse ideas. Let me go back to Spiegel for a second, just because here at The Motley Fool, one of the things we focus on is leadership. There are a lot of people going into this IPO -- speaking of Facebook and Twitter -- using those two companies as comparison points. Like, this could be the next Facebook. It could also be the next Twitter. People are saying that not as a compliment, in terms of the IPO. As you said, Aaron, Twitter's value today is about one third less than it was on the day that it went public. But, if you think back to when Facebook went public, there were questions about Mark Zuckerberg. Completely fair questions about both his age and his experience. That's where I think the comparison to Spiegel is apt. As I said, these were fair questions. Here's this young person. What kind of public company CEO is he going to be? I think that's the thing we will only find out with time. With the case of Facebook and Zuckerberg, you could point to people like Sheryl Sandberg, or other people in the management team, also a bigger and more mature company at the time. But you could see other people and say, \"OK, whatever kind of public company CEO Zuckerberg turns out to be, he has some other steady hands on board there.\" I don't know who else is on Evan Spiegel's management team. We will only find out in time what kind of public CEO he's going to be. But I think it's perfectly legitimate to say -- and I agree with you, Aaron, he's underrated. To this point, I think Evan Spiegel is not getting quite the credit he probably deserves. But now, it's a brand new ballgame because they're a public company, and they're going to get a report card in three month, and we'll see how they do. Really, the main thing that Snap has going for it right now certainly is not its financials. It's leadership and vision. I think the company didn't even start making any revenue until 2015, so just a couple years. That's a very limited operating history. And they have been scaling that revenue pretty quickly. But that's not a whole lot to go off of. I think it really does come down to the design, the innovation of Spiegel and that vision. And obviously, Wall Street bought into it on the roadshow. But that, right now, is really the main thing investors have to go off of. So that's one of the reasons it's a riskier bet today. All right, let's move on to Shake Shack. Fourth quarter revenue grew more than 40%, and that's great, until you realize that a lot of that, Aaron, is from new locations opening up. Their same-store sales, just 1.5%. That's not going to get it done. Yeah, that's pretty normal, it seems, these days. But when you realize that last year, it was 11%, that's a pretty substantial deceleration. I think, for the most part, this quarter it was pretty good. The top line was moving in the right direction. That is probably the number one thing investors would want to see. It's still profitable. They just launched a mobile ordering app, which is, I think, David and I were talking about, we wish some other companies would do that. So, they might be a little bit ahead of the game here, which is a good thing. My issue with the Shake Shack is how much optimism is based into the price. There's a little less optimism today. Yeah, a little less optimism. But still, even compared to a few months ago, it's still not that different. It's 70 times earnings, still. Yeah. So, when I see same-store sales dramatically decelerate, labor costs go up and squeeze operating margins, franchising isn't moving the needle, and that's a big part of their strategy now internationally. Competition in the burger space is about as rough as it gets. And I think that as they expand, they'll have more issues standing out. But I think, perhaps, most importantly, there's a pretty wide discrepancy between what's priced into the stock and the economic reality. Just a few numbers, each store, on average, delivers $5 million in revenue. But the market is pricing each store at about $20 million. So, take that for what it's worth. That doesn't entirely include all of the licensing stores, but it's hard to do apples to apples on that. So, that's very aggressive. If you look at the entire system, management has guided investors to expect $1.12 in earnings per share by 2020, which is kind of specific. But right now, Shake Shack is trading at 32 times that, and that is expected to come in two or three years. That's aggressive, and it makes me a little hesitant. They did raise their sales guidance for this year by 0.03%, though. Let's not overlook that. Wow. Give them some credit. I'm going to give them just a tiny bit of credit for that, because when you look at restaurants in general, I'm going to grade them on the curve in that regard. At least they're guiding higher. Yes, ever so slightly higher, but higher nonetheless. The opportunity here with the Shake Shack, right now, they just have 114 locations. Seems like a concept that could be quite a bit bigger than that. So I think that is part of the reason investors are comfortable paying a higher valuation. Some other things I really like with Shake Shack that a lot of other restaurants are in this position, especially smaller concepts like this, they're already free cash flow positive, they have almost $75 million in cash, and no debt. So, they're able to open these new stores through their own cash. They don't have to go into debt, they don't have to issue stock. That's an attractive position, that's a similar position to what  and  were in 10 years ago or so. But, certainly, the premium that Shake Shack is commanding today ... you need to see some stronger performance within those locations. But you do have to give the company somewhat of a break, because restaurants have had a very difficult past couple years. But still, 1.5% comps isn't going to get the job done. We were talking about  the other day, and the numbers that they've been putting up. I threw out the question, restaurants are struggling, is part of the reason that restaurants are struggling because companies like Domino's Pizza are making it really easy for people not to leave their homes? Everyone who's going to Domino's, yeah. Right, that's the thing, they're getting Domino's to come to them. Yeah, because Domino's same-store sales in a quarter that has been brutal for most restaurants, even pretty solid concepts, Domino's same-store sales -- Over 12%. Yeah, incredible numbers. And that's an acceleration from the past couple years. So, restaurants need to take more notes from Domino's, because the streak that they're on is unbelievable. That's domestic? That's domestic. Oh, wow. From food to beverage, shares of Monster Beverage up 14% this morning after strong sales in the fourth quarter. David, a lot of that is going to the bottom line, too. Just in terms of this latest quarter, their profits look good. Energy drinks are hot sellers, and I think Monster still holds the honor of being the top performing stock over the past 20 years. I looked it up, any guess over the last 20 years how much that stock is up? Wait a minute, I'm sorry, it's the number one stock for 20 years?! I know this was true last year, and based on the numbers I pulled up, I don't think there's any other stock that's overtaken that mark. I can't even begin to guess. 26,000%. 238,850% over the past 20 years. What?! How? That's ridiculous! Right now, Monster is trading at about $48 a share. 20 years ago, it was trading at the equivalent of $0.02 per share, so just a couple of pennies could have but you a share. There have been numerous splits and stuff, but it's pretty incredible performance. Energy drinks have done wonders for the company and for investors who managed to hang on through that. That's ridiculous. I don't follow this as close as David does, but I have to say, every time that I think that a company is decelerating for good, or that things are going to slow down, as soon as I think that, the next quarter they just reaccelerate all over again, and raise guidance.  (NYSE: KO) . Yeah, that really is the story with Monster. A couple years ago Coca-Cola took a stake in Monster. Coca-Cola basically said, \"We're done competing in the energy drink space. We're going to give Monster the few energy drink brands we have.\" And now, Coca-Cola owns about 17% of Monster. Over the past couple years, each quarter, Monster will transition over to Coca-Cola's bottlers and distributors. This quarter, they transitioned to Coke's distributors in Brazil, Costa Rica, Panama, so, increasing that Latin American presence. They launched in China, in a couple areas like Shanghai, Shenzhen, a few others. They're expecting to continue that expansion into China and India in 2017. So this is really a story of Monster getting their product in front of more people. Once they do that, whether is in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, or even in the U.S., they manage to sell more. It's just a very attractive business model. Right now, they have $600 million in cash, no debt. They're producing well over $100 million in free cash flow each quarter. So it's just a very solid, high margin business. It's been incredibly well run by Rodney Sacks, who's been CEO since 1990. He's been a big piece for that incredible performance of the stock and the company. They also are trying to get into this super soda category. I hadn't realized that Mountain Dew commands a lot of presence and a lot of market share in that category. What constitutes super soda? Highly caffeinated? It's highly caffeinated soda. It's not strictly an energy drink, it's not strictly a soft drink. It's somewhere in between there. It's just a little bit more radioactive, I guess. But Monster, late last year, they launched Monster Mutant, which really does look radioactive, it's this really food color-y green and red color. But apparently it's selling pretty well initially. Then, you also have lines like Java Monster, which is the coffee drink that competes more with the  prepared beverages. For those of us who don't get enough caffeine in our coffee, we can just grab a Monster. And that's the thing. You would think that with health concerns and the headwinds against soda, you wouldn't expect energy drinks to be doing pretty well. But between 2011 and 2015, the energy drink category in the U.S. almost doubled. This is actually a category that continues to grow. You have those tailwinds behind Monster, they're trying to get more market share from Red Bull and become the dominant energy drink brand in the U.S. and the world. And now with that they have Coca-Cola's distribution model, that whole system, that should continue to play to their advantage. I think there are still a lot of reasons to like this company going forward. And that's the thing. You think about Coca-Cola, which is, in some ways, the quintessential American brand. And yet, from a business standpoint, the overwhelming majority of sales of Coca-Cola products takes place outside of the United States. And when I look at Monster Beverage, and in this latest quarter, international sales make up just a little bit north of 25% of revenue. Even taking into account the gob-smacking stock performance over the last 20 years, I just look at that and go, \"Wait a minute, is it unreasonable to think that they can double international sales?\" No, I don't think it is. Yeah, at least. Looking over the next 10 years, I think you see those tailwinds behind Monster's back. Having Coca-Cola's whole distribution system, that should help accelerate that transition and that growth internationally for the company. And then, there's still room to gain market share domestically against Red Bull and some of the other brands that might be nipping at Monster's heels. So, yeah, I think there are still a lot of reasons to like where Monster can go over the next decade. And one thing that stands out to me is, five years ago, their gross margin was in the low 50%. Now, it's in the mid 60s. I think a big part of that came when the Coca-Cola deal emerged, and all that distribution, leveraging all those costs, has really pushed up the gross margin. But because they're still in growth mode, not all of that yet has come through and shown in operating margins and free cash flow margins. Even if revenue growth tapers down, there is still going to be plenty of room for the earnings growth to pick back up and keep the stock moving forward, which is just fascinating to me. Have you had it? I've never had one of their drinks, have you? I have, yeah. And? It's a lot of caffeine. [laughs] I don't drink the actual Monster drinks anymore, they're just a little too sweet and I'm like, this just can't be good for my body. But the Java Monsters aren't bad if you like iced coffee, it's pretty similar to a Starbucks frappuccino or something. So, I'll go with a Java Monster, maybe a couple a year, if that. We have to try the super sodas, see if we change colors or something. [laughs] See if we survive, yeah. You could probably run 10 miles after that. One of the things I love about companies like this who are performing like this is, it just makes me smile for all the times that I hear analysts talk about the growth in organics. \"Look at the health trends, we're all getting healthier!\" It's like, not all of us are getting healthier. Monster is there to fill that gap, yeah, and they've done a good job at it. All right. Aaron Bush, David Kretzmann, thanks for being here! Thanks, Chris! Thank you!

Net sales for the smaller strategic brands business, which includes various energy drink brands acquired through a strategic partnership with  in 2015, grew 6.9% to $64.9 million. Other segment net sales, including certain American Fruits & Flavors products sold to independent third parties, were $4.7 million.On the bottom line, that translated to 24.7% growth in reported net income, to $172.9 million, and a 32.6% increase in net income per share, to $0.30. However, earnings were also reduced by $46.3 million, or $0.05 per share, due to distributor termination expenses incurred during the quarter, bringing adjusted net income to $0.35 per share. On average, analysts were looking for lower adjusted net income of $0.30 per share on revenue of just $723.9 million.Image source: Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage CEO Rodney Sacks elaborated: \"We are pleased to report continued progress on the strategic alignment of our distribution system with Coca-Cola bottlers, both domestically and internationally. In the United States, we continue to see improvements in the quality of our distribution, particularly in the food service channel, and we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drinks to the Coca-Cola bottlers in Wisconsin early in January 2017.\"Sacks further noted the company has already transitioned distribution of its namesake drinks to Coke bottlers in Brazil, Costa Rica, and Panama, and continued to implement launches across China during the fourth quarter.

Also, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 6.76%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Monster Beverage benefits from strong sales of new products in the U.S. The company's deal with Coca-Cola Company is expected to expand its presence in the international energy drinks market. The trend is expected to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Also, the acquisition of American Fruits and Flavors (\"AFF\") proved accretive to earnings. As a result of the AFF transaction, the company achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the third quarter. Monster Beverage is likely to benefit further from the AFF transaction in the fourth quarter as well.However, Monster Beverage's sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Though the U.S. dollar has recently softened against other currencies, the impact is still significant.Also, high professional service costs related to regulatory and litigation issues and transition costs connected to the Coca-Cola deal are denting Monster Beverage's profits.Notably, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 35 cents, reflecting a 35.6% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, our estimate for revenues is pegged at $723.90 million, implying a 12.2% increase.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Monster is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Yet in recent quarters, the company has seen things slow down a bit, and coming into Wednesday's fourth-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors were fairly conservative in their expectations for sales and earnings growth. Monster did a good job of knocking those expectations out of the park with its report, and the positive momentum it generated bodes well for 2017.Let's take a closer look at Monster Beverage to see how it did and what's ahead for the energy-drink specialist going forward.Image source: Monster Energy.Monster Beverage's fourth-quarter results were a much-needed respite from more sluggish performance in past quarters. Net sales for the quarter jumped 17% to $753.8 million, which was far faster than the 12% growth rate that most investors were expecting to see. Net income climbed by an even more impressive 25% to $172.9 million, and that produced earnings of $0.30 per share, which was roughly in line with the consensus forecast among investors despite the fact that it includes distributor termination expenses of about $0.05 per share.Taking a closer look at the report, one piece of good news was that currency impacts have nearly disappeared from Monster's results. The company said that adverse currency exchange rates caused only a $3.3 million reduction in net sales during the fourth quarter, amounting to less than 1%.Monster also saw better results from its home-grown energy drink brands than it did from the portfolio of energy drinks it bought from  (NYSE: KO) as part of the two beverage companies' partnership. Sales of the Monster Energy segment gained 17%, while net sales for the strategic brands division were up just 7%. Still, the old Coca-Cola brands make up less than 10% of Monster's overall net sales.From a geographical perspective, Monster continued to move forward with its efforts to gain more international acceptance. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. jumped by a third to $193.5 million, making up more than a quarter of Monster's overall revenue.Turning to key operating metrics, gross margin climbed more than three and a half percentage points to 66.1%, but operating income growth was sluggish as substantially higher overhead expenses ate into bottom-line profit. Case volumes climbed more than 15% to 78 million cases, and average net sales per case held its own, rising by $0.05 to $9.61 per case.Monster Beverage CEO Rodney Sacks again gave details on how the transition with its distribution and bottling operations is going. \"We transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drinks to the Coca-Cola bottlers in Wisconsin early in January 2017,\" Sacks said, and the CEO also pointed to similar moves in Brazil, Costa Rica, and Panama during the fourth quarter.Moreover, Monster is optimistic about emerging markets. The company continued launches in key Chinese markets like Shanghai and Shenzhen during the quarter, and it anticipates further launches throughout the country this year. In addition, Sacks identified Nigeria and India as areas of particular promise for Monster in 2017.Monster also announced another step forward in its stock buyback program. The company authorized another $500 million in share repurchases on Feb. 28, after having used up its previous allowance. Monster has aggressively bought back its stock recently as part of a broader program to return capital to shareholders. The fact that the company's shares have become so cheap make the moves seem smart in comparison to other companies that tend to make mistakes with their capital allocation.Investors in Monster Beverage were pleased with the results, and the stock quickly climbed 7% in after-hours trading following the announcement. The energy drink giant has a lot further to go to recover all the losses it has suffered, but Monster got a nice vote of confidence by managing to put together a solid quarter to finish 2016.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, investors shouldn't simply settle with the single-digit growth of stalwarts like  (NYSE: KO) or  .I recently screened for consumer goods stocks with double-digit sales  earnings growth for this year  next year, and three surprising stocks rose to the top of that list --  (NASDAQ: MNST) ,  (NASDAQ: BUFF) , and  (NYSE: BGS) .Image source: Pixabay.Monster Beverage is an energy drink maker which sells its beverages under the Monster, NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother, BU, Gladiator, Samurai, Nalu, PBM, Power Play, and Relentless brands. Several of those brands were previously owned by Coca-Cola, which swapped its energy drinks for Monster's juices, teas, and other non-energy drinks in 2015. Coca-Cola also acquired a 16.7% stake in Monster as part of that deal.Soda sales in the U.S. have fallen for three consecutive decades, but the niche market for energy drinks has withstood that decline. Grand View Research estimates that the energy drink market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10% between 2016 and 2024, driven by demand from busy urban consumers and supported by big marketing campaigns at sporting events.That's why Monster's revenue is expected to rise 12% this year and another 11% in fiscal 2017. Its earnings are expected to grow 24% this year and another 19% next year. Those growth figures compare very favorably to Coca-Cola's single-digit growth, but Monster stock isn't cheap at 39 times earnings -- which is much higher than the industry average of 24 for soft drink makers.The pet food industry is remarkably resistant to economic downturns since consumers certainly won't let their pets starve. One such high-growth player in that market is Blue Buffalo, which produces natural pet food products for specific diets -- including high-protein, grain-free, and food sensitivity requirements.Blue Buffalo went public in 2015, and has posted double-digit annual sales growth every quarter. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 12% this year and 10% next year. The company believes that it can maintain a top line growth rate of 10% over the next few years. Its earnings are expected to rise 27% this year and 14% next year.Image source: Pixabay.Blue Buffalo still has a lot of room to grow, since it only controls about 6% of the U.S. pet food market. That market is dominated by legacy brands like  ' Petcare and  's Purina, but Blue Buffalo's growth indicates that there's still room for smaller premium players for pet owners who are concerned about the health of their pets. However, investors should note that Blue Buffalo trades at 47 times earnings -- which is higher than its earnings growth rate and the industry average P/E of 41.B&G Foods sells a wide variety of packaged food brands, many of which it acquired from big acquisitions. It acquired Green Giant from General Mills in 2015, and bought up Victoria Fine Foods (which makes specialty sauces, condiments, and gourmet spreads) and  ' spice business last year.But to fund that inorganic growth strategy and repay its debt, B&G announced two secondary share offerings last year, which put 8.35 million more shares on the market. That boosted its total outstanding shares by 14% over the past 12 months.Analysts expect B&G's top line to grow 45% this year, due to its newly acquired brands, and rise another 17% next year. Additional acquisitions this year could cause those estimates to be readjusted upwards. Its earnings are expected to jump 42% this year and 12% next year.Unlike Monster and Blue Buffalo, B&G Foods also pays a forward dividend yield of nearly 4%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 94%. B&G Foods' P/E ratio of 27 is also lower than its industry average of 33, and looks reasonable relative to its earnings growth rate. The only thing B&G Foods investors should be mindful of is \"diworsification\" -- which could happen if the company acquires too many weak brands that offset the growth of its stronger ones.Monster Beverage, Blue Buffalo, and B&G all defy slow growth perceptions about the consumer goods sector. However, investors should be cautious with Monster and Blue Buffalo, since their valuations indicate that their upside potential could be limited. B&G offers a good balance of growth, stability, and income, but investors should also be wary of its elevated debt levels and the risks of diworsification.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Helping this momentum was the company's better-than-expected Q4 results, with the company beating on all fronts.

Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline given quite a few regulatory and data updates scheduled for the coming quarters.

Also, P&G shares have outperformed the S&P 500 index in the year-to-date period (up +8.3% vs +4.9%). P&G's quarterly results exceeded expectations. On the flip side, the Zacks analyst points to mature end markets and the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar as some of the headwinds for the stock.

General Mills'  adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4% and 2.4%, respectively. Procter & Gamble's  earnings and revenues exceeded expectations by a respective 1.9% and 0.3%.Coming to the Beverage-soft drinks industry within the consumer staples sector, the industry has been adversely affected by changing consumer preferences. Consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concerns. Also, possible new taxes levied on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting Carbonated Soft Drink (CSD) sales. The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers, leading to lower volumes and weak sales.Given this backdrop, let's try to determine how these players - Monster Beverage Corporation  and Cott Corporation  - are placed ahead of their earnings releases on Feb 23. , manufacturer of energy drinks, natural soft drinks and fruit drinks, is expected to report fourth-quarter 2016 results.In the last reported quarter, the company had posted a negative 10.81% earnings surprise.

This  has paid uninterrupted dividends on its common stock since 1893 and increased payments to common shareholders every for 55 years in a row. Warren Buffett's  's (  ,  ) is  of the world's largest beverage company.The company's last dividend increase was in February 2017 when the Board of Directors approved an 5.70% increase to 37 cents per share. Coca-Cola's largest competitors include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Over the past decade this  has delivered an annualized total return of 8.90% to its shareholders.The company has managed to deliver a 3.30% annual increase in EPS since 2006. Analysts expect Coca-Cola to earn $1.92 per share in 2017 and $2.10 per share in 2018. In comparison Coca-Cola earned $1.49 per share in 2016. The figures for 2016 are depressed by one-time charges. I believe that the forward figures for 2017 are a better estimate for the true earnings power of the company to use in my analysis.The company has managed to reduce the number of outstanding shares from $4.700 billion in 2006 to $4.345 billion in 2016.Overall, I am not satisfied with the lack of earnings growth over the past four years. As a result, dividends have increased mostly through the expansion of the dividend payout ratio. This is not sustainable. Without further growth in earnings per share, I would be impossible to maintain the streak of annual dividend increases. The high valuation, and the lack of growth in earnings per share over the past four - five years do not bode well for an investment in Coca-Cola today.The company's return on equity has been on the decline over the past decade, falling from a high of 30.90 % in 2007 to a low of 27.60% in 2016. Rather than focus on absolute values for this indicator, I generally want to see at least a stable return on equity over time.The annual  payment has increased by 8.50% per year over the past decade, which is higher than to the growth in EPS.An 8.50% growth in distributions translates into the  every eight and a half years. If we look at historical data, going as far back as 1966 we see that Coca-Cola has managed to double its dividend almost every seven years on average.The dividend payout ratio has increased gradually over the past decade. Using the earnings estimates for 2017, the forward payout ratio is a more reasonable but still high 77%. A lower payout is always a plus, since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short-term fluctuations in earnings.Currently Coca-Cola  at 21.10 forward 2016 earnings, yields 3.60% with a high payout ratio.In comparison, PepsiCo is trading at a P/E of 22.10 and yields 2.80%. Given the lack of earnings growth over the past four years, and the high valuation, I am not interested in adding to the stock.In the meantime, I am going to patiently hold on to my existing holdings, but  .If Coca-Cola cuts dividends, I will be out of the stock one second after the announcement.More From InvestorPlaceThe post ) Dividend Star is Waning appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he dream of every investor is to purchase the next  or  as a small-cap stock and watch it bloom into one of the leading companies within its industry. But companies that have the ability and opportunity to grow their valuations from the millions into megacap territory are quite rare.Furthermore, even when investors find one of these profit powerhouses, they often have a hard time sitting still for the long period of time required to let their investment thesis fully pan out. Information is now constantly at our fingertips, and with the rise of the internet and trading algorithms, holding time frames have seemingly been on the decline for years.Image source: Getty Images.However, there are a select few companies that have turned modest nest eggs into veritable treasure chests over the past 30 years or so. Had you invested $10,000 in any of the following three companies in May 1986, you'd have at least $3.68 million today. Best of all, one of them is a company I can almost guarantee you've never heard of before.If I asked for a show of hands to see how many investors had heard of  (NASDAQ: BCPC) before, chances are, not too many hands would be raised. Balchem, which is still just a midcap company today even after its 36,784% romp higher, provides animal nutrition products, food flavorings, and specialty ingredients to the industrial and pharmaceutical industry.What has allowed Balchem to thrive isn't so much its business diversity as its innovation (and a little bit of luck). As the story was  last year, Balchem was nearing a point of reckoning in the mid-to-late 1990s, when it was losing money hand-over-fist on a new nutrient coating. Thankfully, management and Balchem workers were able to double production without raising costs, and found ancillary revenue channels for existing products.Image source: Balchem.An example the article gave was choline salts, which are traditionally developed for food supplement purposes. A staff engineer at Balchem realized that choline salts could also stabilize clay deposits. That eventually opened a new revenue channel for the company, as fracking for oil and gas requires the stabilization of clay deposits. Interestingly, though, fracking didn't become a major technology in the energy sector until years after the engineer's discovery. These innovative pursuits have expanded Balchem's product portfolio organically, allowing it to wildly outpace the  .Today, Balchem looks to be fairly valued, if not a bit pricey; but I guess that's to be expected after a nearly 37,000% run! Valued at 31 times next year's estimated profit per share, Balchem would have to produce a major surge in animal and human nutrition and health sales to reasonably support a higher valuation.Innovation was also the driving force for  (NASDAQ: MNST) , which has delivered nearly 51,000% gains since May 1986. Monster's claim to fame are its energy drinks, which have only grown in popularity over the years with young adults.Over the past 12 months, Monster has generated nearly $3 billion in revenue, practically all of which was tied to its namesake brand of energy drinks. By comparison, in 2006, it generated only $606 million in full-year sales. This isn't to say the company hasn't had its hiccups. In 2012, Monster was the subject of a Food and Drug Administration investigation into the deaths of five people who'd consumed its energy drinks, which quelled sales for a short period. However, as you can clearly see based on its latest sales numbers, those health safety issues have been put in the rear view mirror.Image source: Monster Energy.In recent years, Monster's biggest catalyst has been a partnership with  (NYSE: KO) . Under the agreement, Coca-Cola agreed to contribute its energy drink portfolio to Monster, and Monster in turn sent its non-energy product portfolio to Coca-Cola. The deal also allowed Coca-Cola to take a 16.7% equity investment in Monster Beverage, giving it access to the fast-growing energy drink market. Finally, distribution agreements between the two companies were amended, and since 2014 Monster's gross margin has leaped from 54.4% to 62.8% on a trailing 12-month basis. The result was a better-than-doubling of its net income over the past three years for Monster.Monster Beverage isn't cheap after its run higher -- its shares now sell for 30 times forward earnings -- but unlike Balchem, it has the potential for double-digit percentage sales and profit growth for years to come. Though I'd expect the gains to be substantially more modest, Monster remains an intriguing investment opportunity.Last, but not least, we have the operating system kingpin,  (NASDAQ: MSFT) , which has generated a better than 64,600% return over the past 30 years and change.It's certainly not hard to understand why Microsoft has been so dominant. Despite numerous efforts during the emergence of desktop and laptop computers to unseat it as the dominant operating system provider, Microsoft dug in and ceded very little, if any, market share. Today, Microsoft's Windows OS is so dominant in the PC market, it's almost frightening.Image source: Microsoft.According to NetMarketShare.com, as of January 2017, Windows 7 and Windows 10 combined accounted for 72.5% of all desktop operating systems. Group the less-popular XP, 8.1, 8, Vista, and NT together, and they kick in nearly another 19%. That gives Microsoft a desktop OS market share of about 91.5%, and as you might have surmised -- correctly -- a lot of pricing power comes with a veritable monopoly on desktop operating systems.But Microsoft hasn't been without its faults. Its Achilles' heel, perhaps, has been its acquisitions; its big purchases have included some notable duds throughout the years. For example, Microsoft's acquisition of  's handset business and aQuantive were both disasters. Its $8.5 billion acquisition of Skype has netted the network a lot of customer usage, but very little in the way of financial benefits.Nonetheless, Microsoft remains a dominant force in PC operating systems, is regularly generating $23 billion to $26 billion in annual free cash flow thanks to its substantial operating margin, and recently acquired LinkedIn, which will hopefully open new channels of revenue for the company. With annual EPS growth throughout the remainder of the decade forecast to be roughly 10%, Microsoft may still offer modest upside to patient investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them!

PepsiCo's CSD volumes declined 3% in the first nine months of 2016. To counter the fall in soda beverage volumes, the company is focusing more on healthier beverage options.

The company has posted two positive and two negative surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 0.50%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | Kimberly-Clark has been disappointing investors of late, which is hurting its share price.The company reported lower-than-expected results in the preceding quarter, wherein both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also lowered its 2016 guidance for earnings and organic sales growth.Kimberly-Clark has been witnessing sluggish organic sales growth, especially in developing and emerging markets, over the past few quarters. In the third quarter, organic sales declined in all the other regions, except in developing and emerging markets, where the figure was up 3%. However, growth decelerated from 5% increase witnessed in the first and second quarters, as performance improved in China but softened in Latin America. Brazil and Argentina were affected in particular due to lower volumes, and highly competitive promotional activity and an even more difficult economic environment.Though the company has strong long-term growth prospects in developing and emerging markets, the current promotional environment is weakening the market dynamics. Further, it is difficult to predict when growth will pick up significant pace again. Hence, we expect the trend to remain the same in the fourth quarter as well.In fact, Kimberly-Clark's shares have been underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry since the past one year. The stock has declined by 5.9% in comparison with the industry's growth of 6.0%. Notably, the industry is part of the bottom 9% of the Zacks Classified industries (240 out of the 265). The broader Consumer Staples sector is placed at the bottom most of the Zacks Classified sectors (16 out of 16).Though the company is relying on cost saving measures and restructuring programs to drive earnings, it is also striving to reduce expenses and buying back shares. These moves are aimed at boosting the comapany's profits. However, Kimberly-Clark anticipates currency volatility, increased competition and higher marketing expenses to hurt profits in the near term.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Additionally, PepsiCo will present Pepsi Zero, a zero-calorie soda.The Super Bowl, which is scheduled to be played on Feb 5, has long been the battlefield for cola companies. This time, PepsiCo has left no stone unturned in its promotions for LIFEWTR.PepsiCo's chief competitor, Coco-Cola Co.  , is yet to announce any plans to advertise during the Super Bowl. As per the  report, Coke has no plans to feature either of its Smart Water or Dasani bottled water brands during the Super Bowl.Hence, LIFEWTR will compete directly with Coke's Smart Water as PepsiCo's war against Coca-Cola intensifies amid declining consumption of sugary sodas in the beverage industry.Though Pepsi has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost the carbonated beverage business, no meaningful improvement has been observed yet. Pepsi's CSD volumes declined 2% each in 2014 and 2015 and 3% in the first nine months of 2016.Apart from this, product innovation also plays a huge role in the company's success. The company regularly creates new flavors of existing products alongside maintaining a robust pipeline of new products. Innovation has accounted for approximately 9% of the company's revenues in the third quarter of 2016. Most of the company's latest line-up of products offer health benefits like reduced calorie beverages, non-carbonated beverages and healthier snacks.PepsiCo is working hard to broaden its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages in order to decrease the dependence on colas. However, it is to be seen whether this new premium bottled water brand will be able to counter the slowing carbonated soft drinks (\"CSD\") trends.The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers - PepsiCo, Coke, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  and Monster Beverage Corporation  - leading to lower volumes and weaker sales.In addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades\u2026 from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

These acquisitions have boosted McCormick's business and strengthened its portfolio. In fact, the company has an optimistic view of the fourth quarter, owing to recent acquisitions.Further, McCormick has been regularly launching products in order to remain competitive. Its increasing focus on cost savings as well as enhancing productivity through the ongoing initiative - the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement ('CCI') program - is encouraging and boosting earnings.However, the company's industrial segment has been reporting sluggish sales over the past few quarters, which is a serious concern. The company is facing sluggish sales, particularly in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, due to weak demand from quick service restaurants. The company also remains exposed to unfavorable foreign currency translations, particularly for its joint venture in Mexico. Higher material costs also remain a major headwind.If we look into past six months performance, McCormick's shares have underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry. The stock declined by 10.4% in comparison to the above mentioned industry's decline of 6.5%. Notably, the industry is part of the bottom 40% of the Zacks Classified industries (159 out of the 265). The broader Consumer Staples sector is placed at the bottom most of the Zacks Classified sectors (16 out of 16).Our proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

The company continued its trend of seeing declines in carbonated beverages, but increases across the company's non-carbonated beverage portfolio. Leadership changes coming to Coca-Cola could now put an even bigger emphasis on diversifying the company and continuing a pattern of acquisitions both internationally and in the non-carbonated beverage sector. Source: Late in 2016,  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) both made acquisitions to strengthen their lineups. Pepsi paid $200 million to acquire probiotic beverage maker  . Dr. Pepper Snapple Group bought  for $1.7 billion in an ambitious push into antioxidant beverages.Coca-Cola has been relatively quiet on the acquisition front of late, with a couple international deals done, but no major U.S. beverage deals. On May 1, 2017, the company will turn a new leaf and  its new CEO James Quincey. After 10 years of serving various roles with Coca-Cola, including his current Chief Operating Officer role, Quincey will take over the top role from Muhtar Kent, who is stepping down.Many investors believe new leadership could lead to an acquisition push by KO stock, and I have to agree with that. Quincey was instrumental in major international acquisitions like  and  . I believe Quincey's position at Coca-Cola will lead to at least one major deal from the beverage giant in 2017.In September, Coca-Cola  bolt-on acquisitions as one of several items that would bring growth for KO shareholders. The other major pieces were scaling globally and growing the non-carbonated soft drink categories.Back in 2000, carbonated soft drinks accounted for 84% of Coca-Cola's unit case volume. In 2015, that figure had dropped to 64% as the company has done a good job of diversifying away from the declining category.Of course, Coca-Cola may continue its route of acquiring successful international brands or private companies in a push to scale the small companies on its own. Keep in mind that rumors continue to make Coca-Cola an acquisition target of its own by the largest beer maker in the world,  (NYSE:  ), a company that has grown through a series of massive acquisitions and usually gets what it wants when it comes to deals.Here's a look at three publicly traded companies that might make good acquisitions for Coca-Cola in 2017. The obvious acquisition for Coca-Cola would be  (NASDAQ:  ). Coca-Cola  a 16.7% stake in the energy drink maker in 2015 in an asset swap. Coca-Cola sold Monster its NOS and Full Throttle energy drink brands in return for non-energy drink brands like Hansen Juice, Hansen sodas, and Peace Tea. Coca-Cola also paid $2.15 billion for the stake in MNST.In the recent  , MNST reported net sales up 4.1% to $788 million. International sales saw an increase of 11.8% in the quarter to $190.9 million.The quarter continued the progress of Coca-Cola distributing the company's products in several regions. Monster Energy was launched in China and Turkey during the quarter. More international launches are planned for 2017. The new product launch of Mutant, a possible rival to Mountain Dew, also happened in the quarter.For years, KO  the top two carbonated soft drinks brands with its namesake Coca-Cola and number two with Diet Coke. Pepsi Cola finally passed Diet Coke to slip into the number two spot.While Coke's top two brands have dominated their peers, Pepsi's Mountain Dew brand has been the number four most sold carbonated soft drink and fended off numerous attempts from Coca-Cola to have a competing brand. Monster is the latest company to take on Mountain Dew and with Coca-Cola's full weight, could perhaps dent into the strong market share Mountain Dew has.Mutant was launched by Monster Energy in the third quarter, with a rollout to select convenience store chains beginning in September. The company is  convenience stores first by going after customers who typically buy 20oz Mountain Dew bottles.Monster Energy said it saw \"encouraging early results.\" Monster Energy will also release Monster Hydro, a bottled water energy drink soon. You can bet that Coca-Cola will closely be watching the success or failure of Mutant, as it has needed a strong rival to Mountain Dew for years. Another name that often gets tossed around as a beverage acquisition target is  (NASDAQ:  ). The owner of popular brands like La Croix, Shasta, Clear Fruit, Crystal Bay and Faygo is turning into an impressive stock for its shareholders. FIZZ shares are up about 120% over the last two years. With a market capitalization of $2.3 billion, the deal wouldn't be tiny for Coca-Cola, but easily doable with current cash.In November, FIZZ  its best ever six month period with a strong second quarter. Six month revenue of $420 million was up 15% from the prior year. Net income surged 65% to $54 million, representing earnings per share of $1.15.One of the biggest positives in the quarter came with continued gains in operating margins. The trailing twelve months saw a rate of 16.4%, up from 13.2% for fiscal 2016 and 11.5% for fiscal 2015.National Beverage becomes a big acquisition target as it is diversifying itself and has some strong non-carbonated brands. The company also makes private-label brands for some stores, serving as a cheaper alternative to Coca-Cola products. This would give KO stock an increasing share in many stores and the ability to offset any weakness over pricing or economic worries.In 2016, FIZZ launched La Croix TangerEEN, a soft drink alternative with no calories, no sodium and no sweetener. This clean-label beverage represented the first in the industry to have the clean label and 100% all natural ingredients. National Beverage seems to have a good grasp on growing sales aside from carbonated beverages and Coca-Cola could greatly benefit from a deal here. An outside candidate as a 2017 acquisition by Coca-Cola is  (NASDAQ:  ). With a market capitalization of $314 million, Coca-Cola would easily be able to complete this deal and would get a strengthened position in bottled water.Primo Water made an acquisition recently that will transform the company. Primo paid $273 million to acquire  . The deal will more than double net sales, operating income and customer locations for Primo Water with minimal overlap.Primo Water reported a record quarter for revenue and profitability, which should get the attention of investors and other beverage companies. Third-quarter revenue increased 5% to $35.5 million. The sell thru of dispenser units increased 13% in the quarter.Primo Water is North America's largest single source provider of multi-gallon purified bottle water and self-service refill water. Thanks to the strong quarter, PRMW raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $133.2 to $134.4 million.This marked the 18th consecutive quarter of 8.5% or higher same store unit growth for the company. The chain added 300 net retail customers, including many  (NYSE:  ). The buyout of Glacier will take Primo Water to more than 46,000 customers. An annual target is to add 1,500 to 2,000 customers a year, taking Primo to what they believe is their long term goal of 50,000 to 60,000 locations.Primo Water makes money selling large amounts of water to customers. The company has some of its own water brands and major deals with businesses and retail companies. A buyout by Coca-Cola could help KO expand some other brands into offices and businesses. Imagine offices being able to buy large water cooler refills and also some bottled drinks for employees.The post ) Should Buy in 2017 appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported better-than-expected results in fourth-quarter 2016 (ending Dec 31), with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same.Moreover, this Purchase, NY-based food/beverage giant provided its full-year 2017 earnings guidance.PepsiCo's fourth-quarter core earnings per share (EPS) of $1.20 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 by 3.4%.Earnings rose 13.2% year over year despite the adverse impact of currency headwinds on sales.

The company posted in-line results in the last quarter.In the trailing four quarters, the company reported an average positive earnings surprise of 6.44%. | Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.SUPERVALU has been in troubled waters for the past one year due to tough competitive pressure, deflationary environment in the food industry and soft sales in the retail segment. The company's shares have declined 21.2% in the past one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry that witnessed an increase of 10% in the same time frame. Further, it posted weaker-than-expected sales in the Retail and Save-A-Lot segments in second-quarter fiscal 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be reported quarter as well.Furthermore, the Save-A-Lot segment is affected negatively by deflationary environment as well as unfavorable comparisons with the previous year. Moreover, SUPERVALU is experiencing lower revenues due to declining fees from its Transition Services Agreements (TSAs) with Albertson's LLC and New Albertson's, Inc. which may result in lower profits.However, SUPERVALU has undertaken several sales and margin boosting initiatives, which may help counter persistent weakness and deliver higher top line. Amid the competitive environment, the company has taken initiatives to expand its existing customer base by inking several supply and distribution agreements with retailers such as Fresh Market Inc., American Foods Basket and Marsh Supermarkets, in a bid to retain its market share.

Further, management's lapses in adapting to changing market preferences dealt a blow to the stock, which underperformed the broader sector while DOW rose over 13% in 2016.With 500 brands, including four of the top five sparkling drink franchises worldwide, namely, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite, the company holds a unique market position.However, the rate of growth is slowing down. The company's recent dividend hike was just 6%, compared to 8% in 2015 and 9% in 2014.The company's share price lost 2.3% in 2016, underperforming 3.4% growth of the broader consumer staples sector. The beverage giant also faces weak volume growth as consumers are increasingly shifting to healthier products, rejecting many of the core ingredients that include sugar, which dominates most of the company's product ingredients.Also, severe macroeconomic challenges in certain international markets and the stronger U.S. dollar have impacted quarterly results for the cola giant, which generates about half of its sales abroad.Nevertheless, the company has responded to the changing needs by coming up with products like Zero Sugar Coca-Cola.As we enter 2017, it is to be borne in mind that Coca-Cola is a legendary dividend growth stock. The company has raised its dividend for 54 consecutive years, consistently boosting returns for investors. Coca-Cola is making investments in newer platforms to boost sales and profits over the long haul. The company acquired a stake and signed a deal with Monster Beverage Corporation  in Jun 2015 to expand distribution of the latter's products. This will allow Coca-Cola to compete more effectively in the global energy category.Coca-Cola has also signed a distribution agreement with Suja, a high growth organic cold-pressed juice company, to gain traction in this new market. In China, the company has invested in the plant-based protein drinks platform through the acquisition of the beverage business of China Green Culiangwang Beverages Holdings.In early 2016, Coca-Cola acquired 40% stake in Chi Limited, Nigeria's leading value-added dairy and juice company. These strategic investments will help the company expand in the non-alcoholic beverage industry.Coca-Cola's purchase of Unilever's  soy-based beverage business, known as AdeS, with the help of its largest Latin American bottler Coca-Cola Femsa SAB  , is one major portfolio diversification step that most shareholders should appreciate. Coca-Cola is presently undergoing a number of transformations. Its drive to refranchise nearly all of its North American bottling operations by the end of 2017 is also on track. This will make Coca-Cola as an asset-light business focused on concentrates and the marketing of its 500-plus global brands. The company aims to get rid of the capital-intensive distribution business by refranchising its bottling territories around the world. The company focused on incremental media investments in 2014 and 2015 to fund brands globally. Also, Coca-Cola adopted aggressive marketing campaigns like Share a Coke to accelerate the top line.

Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.10%.In fact, despite sales remaining subdued, the consumer goods company posted positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, with the average being 6.04%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Though the company refrained from providing guidance for the second quarter, we expect modest sequential sales improvement through fiscal 2017. Negative Fx impact, moderate anticipated input cost inflation and continued geopolitical uncertainty may limit upside.The company expects organic sales growth of around 2% compared with fiscal 2016 and a 1% impact due to currency movements leaving overall almost flat sales guidance of around +1%.Procter & Gamble has been struggling to boost sales over the past few quarters. Significant negative Fx impact, weak volumes, divestures and slowing market growth have been impacting sales.Fx has always been a deterrent for Procter & Gamble with around 60% of the company's business being outside North America. Fx impacted the company's revenue growth by 6% in both fiscal 2015 and 2016. While the company expects Fx to be a nominal headwind for fiscal 2017, it is likely to impact results in the second quarter as well.Overall, pricing gains, productivity savings and lower overhead costs should provide bottom-line support despite top-line pressure as witnessed in the past few quarters.It is evident from the company's last reported quarter that currency headwinds, unfavorable mix, innovation and capacity investments, and higher commodity costs were offset by productivity cost savings and higher volume benefits. Core gross margin expanded 50 basis points (bps) to 51.6% in the quarter.Again, core operating margin expanded 20 bps to 23.4% on productivity cost savings. Procter & Gamble has undertaken an aggressive cost-cutting plan to reduce spending across all areas like supply chain, research & development, marketing and overheads.It is to be noted that Procter & Gamble is considered a darling by dividend investors having an uninterrupted 59-year-long streak of dividend growth. The stock currently boasts a dividend yield of 3.2% and so far does not reflect any currency headwind.For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.07, reflecting an increase of 2.7% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.84 billion, implying a 0.4% decline.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Procter & Gamble is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat expectations. But that is not the case here as you will see below.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. | Some stocks in the consumer staples sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Coty Inc.  , expected to report quarterly results on Feb 2, has an earnings ESP of +8.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Image: Bai Brands, LLC. 's(NYSE: DPS) announcement this week of its pending acquisition of antioxidant-infused beverage maker Bai Brands, LLC for $1.7 billion in cash certainly represents the direction in which the carbonated soft drink industry is headed. But it also marks a particular achievement for Dr Pepper Snapple, which has often felt the sting of opportunity cost in its relationship with independent beverage companies for which it provides services.The beverage giant obtains about 5% of its annual volume from bottling and/or distributing brands it doesn't own. Dr Pepper Snapple refers to these labels as \"allied brands,\" and they encompass both well-known and more obscure names such as Bai, Fiji Water, SunnyD, and BodyArmor.In the past, it's been debatable if running several non-proprietary brands through the company's system for just a few percentage points of volume is even worth the effort. Particularly open to questioning is the fact that, as allied brands grow with the help of Dr Pepper Snapple, they often leave for other distributors or get acquired by \"DPS\" competitors.During the company's most recent  in October, an analyst asked about protective contractual provisions Dr Pepper Snapple has in place when an allied brand decides to seek bottling and distribution elsewhere. This led to some musing on the part of CEO Larry Young about the brand relationships and the sudden loss of volume from a departing label:The names mentioned above, once distributed by Dr Pepper Snapple, are some of the most vibrant and respected young beverage companies around today. Rockstar is now distributed by  (NYSE: PEP) . But perhaps more painfully,  (NYSE: KO) not only distributes Monster energy drinks, but boasts an equity stake in  (NASDAQ: MNST) , and owns the vitaminwater and FUZE brands outright.To put it another way: More than losing revenue and gross profit, there's a potentially significant opportunity cost in assisting small brands and then watching them flourish after your competitors snap them up.Coca-Cola has its own venture capital arm,  , or VEB, which takes minority stakes in fledgling beverage companies, then ratchets up investment once they're proven to be scalable across the Coca-Cola system. With the acquisition of its allied customer Bai Brands, Dr Pepper Snapple has for the first time put meaningful dollars behind a company it similarly helped nurture.The low-calorie, low-sugar, antioxidant-rich beverage profile that Bai's water drinks offer will certainly help the organization diversify outside of its carbonated soft drink revenue streams. But more importantly, the transaction proves the point of having an allied brands business in the first place. Just last quarter, the company cited both Bai and the popular Fiji Water as the main drivers of 16% year-over-year growth in its non-carbonated beverages water category.Management has promised that the $1.7 billion cash consideration for Bai will be funded through unsecured notes and commercial paper, thereby avoiding long-term debt which might weigh on the company's investment grade credit rating. And Dr Pepper Snapple expects the purchase to be accretive to earnings by 2018.But beyond the financial impact, this transaction is vital as it introduces a process the company should try to repeat many times. Help an allied brand hit critical mass, then purchase it to increase long-term value for shareholders, rather than watch that value get transferred to a competitor. For this reason alone, the Bai deal is, for both mangement and investors, a no-regrets acquisition.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares of Coca-Cola closed the trading session on Jan 4 at $41.65, down 0.4% from the previous day.Coca-Cola has been accused of understating the ill-effects associated with sugary drinks in its advertisements. Praxis also accused both the defendants for deceiving the public into believing that lack of exercise is the only cause for obesity.However, Coca-Cola deems the lawsuit as \"legally and factually meritless\" and claims to have taken the health of their consumers very seriously. American Beverage Association found the accusation \"unfounded.\"Notably, the company's North American sparkling beverage business has been posting weak results due to Carbonated Soft Drink (CSD) category headwinds. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness - consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concern - are hurting demand for CSDs.Among CSDs, the cola segment has been particularly affected as consumers are opting for alternative beverage offerings. The diet drinks are also under pressure due to increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Also, possible new taxes levied on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressure are denting CSD sales. The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers - Pepsico, Inc.  , Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  and Monster Beverage Corporation  - leading to lower volumes and weak sales.The Zacks categorized  industry has underperformed the broader market in last six months as you can see below:Though Coca-Cola has ramped up its marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts have not as yet resulted in any meaningful improvement.Notably, Coca-Cola's top-line underperformance has been quite noticeable in the first nine months of 2016. The company's shares have also seen quite a struggle in the last six months, with the stock losing 8% compared to the Beverages - Soft Drinks industry's decline of 6.5%.Earnings growth for the current quarter and year is expected to decline 3.8% and 4.6%, respectively, for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.You can see In addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades\u2026 from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

Total consumption has declined every year since 2004 in the U.S., and per-capita consumption is now at a 30-year low. Diet sodas have also fallen out of favor as health-conscious consumers have become wary of artificial ingredients like sweeteners.Image source: The Motley Fool.Not surprisingly, the soda giants' performance was middling in 2016.\n  \nSource: Yahoo! FinanceAs you can see from the chart above, SodaStream was the winner in the group as the company benefited from a pivot to a sparkling water brand as well as the opening of a new factory, moves that helped profits grow sharply during the year. National Beverage, which owns the La Croix sparkling water brand, may also have benefited from a similar trend as consumers moved away from sodas and towards alternate beverages like sparkling water.However, the three traditional industry giants PepsiCo, Dr Pepper Snapple, and Coca-Cola fared worse as all underperformed the broad market and both Dr Pepper Snapple and Coke lost a few points over the year. Notably, those stocks, especially Coke and Pepsi, have missed out on the post-election rally, which has favored macroeconomically sensitive sectors like financials and industrials. As Coke and Pepsi are defensive, dividend-paying stocks, investors tend to look to them to safeguard assets in a down market.All three companies have taken steps away from sugary beverages in recent years, investing in newer, healthier drinks, and in Pepsi's case, growing its food divisions, Frito-Lay and Quaker.However, those moves have had mixed results in offsetting the headwinds from soda consumption. Let's take a closer at look at Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper Snapple's struggles this year.Coca-Cola continued to gain market share from its rivals during 2016, but that was not enough to overcome challenges from structural changes, a stronger dollar, and slowing growth in worldwide soda consumption. Thus far this year, overall revenue has fallen 5% due to currency fluctuations and its decision to refranchise its North American bottlers, however, organic revenue has grown by a respectable 4%. In addition to diversifying into still-beverage brands like Fuze tea, Gold Peak tea, Zico coconut water, and taking a stake in energy-drink maker  (NASDAQ: MNST) , the company has also been able to squeeze out profit growth by selling Coke in smaller bottles, borrowing a page from tobacco companies that have been able to boost profits despite falling consumption by raising prices.Coke also announced that COO James Quincey would take over for Muhtar Kent as CEO next year as Quincey has prepared for the job by running operations in Europe and Mexico. Considering the industrywide challenges, Coca-Cola's performance in 2016 was decent as the organic, adjusted revenue and profits continued to grow, but the trend in the market favoring cyclical stocks could make 2017 another tough year for Coke stock.Dr Pepper Snapple made its boldest move in years just last month when it snatched up Bai Brands for $1.7 billion. Bai sells naturally flavored low-calorie water drinks, making a big push with the \"none of this makes sense\" ad campaign this year. Prior to purchasing Bai, Dr Pepper Snapple had already been its distributor in the Northeast, where most of its sales come from. The company hopes to expand distribution as part of the usual acquisition playbook for such deals.Outside of the Bai deal, Dr Pepper Snapple has put up modest growth this year with an increase in core EPS of 11%, a 1% increase in sales volume, and a 4% increase in revenue. The difference speaks to Dr Pepper Snapple's ability to drive profit growth from small increases in volume sales, by raising prices and controlling costs.Management also raised its full-year EPS guidance in the most recent report to $4.32-$4.40, a sign that performance is topping expectations. With that guidance, the company is set to increase per-share profits 10% from last year, solid growth considering the industry challenges. Over a longer time frame, Dr Pepper Snapple has significantly outperformed Coke and Pepsi as its shares have more than doubled over the last five years.Looking ahead to 2017, the company expects $425 million in incremental sales from Bai but a dilutive effect of $0.03 on EPS due to expanded marketing costs. Otherwise, the company should continue to grow at a similar pace, which could boost the stock as its P/E has now fallen under 20.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  )Here is a synopsis of all the four stocks: (NASDAQ:  ) is a comprehensive provider of a broad range of social and medical services in the home. The company's services include personal care and assistance with activities of daily living, skilled nursing and rehabilitative therapies, and adult day care.Its consumers are individuals with special needs who are at risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill and disabled. Its payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, the Veterans Health Administration, commercial insurers and private individuals.On November 7 the company delivered a big Q3 earnings beat and reported net service revenues that grew 22.7% to $103.5 million for the quarter from $84.3 million in Q3 of 2015. Shares popped over 30% last week and analysts were eager to raise estimates.While the earnings beat was only 10-cents, the consensus estimate for the full-year 2016 rose 22-cents from $1.05 to $1.27. And 2017 estimates rose 20% from $1.15 to $1.38.What's encouraging about this growth picture is how quickly the company is emerging from a restructuring process where they took a $0.23 charge. Addus reported Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.39. The adjusted results excluded the $0.23 of restructuring charges, $0.02 of severance, $0.03 of stock-based compensation and a $0.04 credit for normalization of effective tax rate.According to the company press release, \"While the majority of the growth in billable hours per day was attributable to the first-quarter acquisition of South Shore, same store revenues contributed meaningfully to revenue growth for the quarter.\"Dirk Allison, President and Chief Executive Officer of Addus, remarked, \"We are pleased to report an outstanding third quarter for Addus. We achieved substantial growth in revenues - including same store growth of 4.1% - and in adjusted EPS. We produced strong cash flow from operations and significantly strengthened our balance sheet, due both to our increased adjusted earnings and to the pay down of the past-due Illinois non-Medicaid accounts receivable.\"Analysts see cost-cutting and restructuring moves as improving the company's short-term liquidity to pursue further accretive M&A opportunities. Addus operates its business through two divisions, Home & Community services and Home Health services.The Home & Community services are social, or non-medical, in nature and include assistance with bathing, grooming, dressing, personal hygiene and medication reminders, and other activities of daily living. The Home Health services are medical in nature and include physical, occupational and speech therapy, as well as skilled nursing.Addus currently holds approximately 300 home care contracts throughout the country. The company provides health care services to over 30,000 consumers weekly from over 120 offices located in 21 states. (NASDAQ:  ) reported Q3 earnings on November 3 and missed the top and bottom-line consensus estimates. Shares are off over 12% since then, with over 18 million changing hands on November 4 as some institutions decided it was clearly time to exit the stock.And now, many other investors are wondering if this is a buying opportunity just another 10% from 52-week lows, or if there is something more to be concerned about.Earnings and revenues did improve 4.1% and 17.9% year over year, respectively, driven largely by impressive gross margins - courtesy of cost of goods savings, the AFF transaction and product mix.But the results failed to impress in every other aspect. Operating expenses rose over 22%, leading to roughly flat operating income growth. The U.S. market was softer than international figures with only 1.9% net sales growth.And results were also hurt by weaker foreign currencies and purchases by retailers ahead of a price hike. However, although net sales growth of 4.1% was weaker than 14% recorded in the first half of the year, Monster Beverage's sales bounced back in October, rising 12%, including 10% growth in the key U.S. market.Given this mixed picture, analysts leaned on the side of bringing estimates down, and that's what brought the stock down to a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell).Full-year 2016 EPS estimates were taken down from $1.30 to $1.24 while 2017 profit projections were clipped from $1.60 to $1.53.Monster Beverage's third-quarter diluted earnings of 33 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.37 by 10.8%. Meanwhile, earnings increased 17.9% year over year on lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016.Net sales of $787.95 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $817.20 million by 3.6%. However, the figure improved 4.1% year over year.Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of $2.6 million on net sales. Net sales outside the U.S. rose 11.8% to $190.8 million on a year-over-year basis.On Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)  that it has discovered the biggest deposit of untapped oil in the United States, located in the Wolfcamp shale formation in the Midland Basin portion of Texas' Permian Basin.Wolfcamp has an estimated average of 20 billion barrels of oil, 16 trillion cubic feet of associated natural gas, and 1.6 billion barrels of natural gas liquids there for the taking. To put this into perspective, according to USGS, the Prudhoe Bay formation on the North Slope of Alaska-the largest producing oil field in North America to date-has only produced roughly 12 billion barrels of oil in the past 43 years. And the East Texas Field, which is the biggest producing oil field in the lower 48 states, has produced just over 7 billion barrels of oil since the 1930s.In other words, the magnitude of this oil discovery is incredible. And based on current  , the newly found untapped oil is worth almost $900 billion.\"The fact that this is the largest assessment of continuous oil we have ever done just goes to show that, even in areas that have produced billions of barrels of oil, there is still the potential to find billions more,\" said Walter Guidroz, program coordinator for the USGS Energy Resources Program.\"Changes in technology and industry practices can have significant effects on what resources are technically recoverable, and that's why we continue to perform resource assessments throughout the United States and the world,\" Guidroz continues.USGS notes that over 3,000 horizontal oil wells have already been drilled and finished in the Wolfcamp section of the Midland Basin. According to  , Wolfcamp has been one of the primary targets for shale drillers like ConocoPhillips (NYSE:  ) and Diamondback Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:  ) in recent years, as intensive drilling and fracturing techniques, or fracking, became more commonly used.You are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 \"Strong Buys\" free of charge.

Shares are off over 12% since then, with over 18 million changing hands on November 4 as some institutions decided it was clearly time to exit the stock.And now, many other investors are wondering if this is a buying opportunity just another 10% from 52-week lows, or if there is something more to be concerned about.Earnings and revenues did improve 4.1% and 17.9% year over year, respectively, driven largely by impressive gross margins - courtesy of cost of goods savings, the AFF transaction and product mix.But the results failed to impress in every other aspect. Operating expenses rose over 22%, leading to roughly flat operating income growth. The U.S. market was softer than international figures with only 1.9% net sales growth.And results were also hurt by weaker foreign currencies and purchases by retailers ahead of a price hike. However, although net sales growth of 4.1% was weaker than 14% recorded in the first half of the year, Monster Beverage's sales bounced back in October, rising 12%, including 10% growth in the key U.S. market.Given this mixed picture, analysts leaned on the side of bringing estimates down, and that's what brought the stock down to a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell).Full-year 2016 EPS estimates were taken down from $1.30 to $1.24 while 2017 profit projections were clipped from $1.60 to $1.53.Monster Beverage's third-quarter diluted earnings of 33 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.37 by 10.8%. Meanwhile, earnings increased 17.9% year over year on lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016.Net sales of $787.95 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $817.20 million by 3.6%. However, the figure improved 4.1% year over year.Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of $2.6 million on net sales. Net sales outside the U.S. rose 11.8% to $190.8 million on a year-over-year basis.The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.8 %, compared with 39.4% a year ago. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to a one-time tax benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction.As a result of the AFF transaction, the company achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the third quarter.Monster Energy Drinks Segment: The segment reported net sales of $710.1 million, up 3.4% year over year.Strategic Brands segment: This segment includes brands acquired from Coca-Cola. Net sales at the segment increased 3.2% to $72.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with $69.9 million in the comparable quarter of 2015.Other: Net sales for the company's Other segment, which includes certain products of American Fruits & Flavors sold to independent third parties, were $5.7 million in the quarter under review.

The company has created an energy-drink empire from scratch, attracting the attention of major beverage giants. Yet lately, the company has seen things slow down, and coming into Thursday's third-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors wanted the beverage maker to prove that it could still grow its bottom line at an impressive rate.Monster's results were far from bad, but they nevertheless didn't live up to the growth expectations that investors had for it. Let's take a closer look at how Monster Beverage did and whether better times could be ahead.Promotional activity is a key part of Monster's brand-building. Image source: Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage's third-quarter results didn't have the energy that investors have come to expect from the company. Revenue was up just 4%, to $788 million, which was well short of the consensus forecast among those following the stock, for roughly $820 million. Net income rose a more respectable 10%, to $191.6 million, and that produced earnings of $0.99 per share. However, that number didn't compare favorably with investor expectations of $1.12 per share.Taking a closer look at Monster's numbers, Monster didn't hesitate to point out that last year's third-quarter results were juiced higher by an anticipated price increase on certain energy-drink products. That pulled some revenue into last year's third quarter, and Monster estimated the amount at $11 million of net sales, or roughly 1.4 percentage points.Meanwhile, the impact of currency pressure on its overall sales has almost disappeared. The company said that unfavorable currency exchange rates only cost it about $2.6 million in net sales, down from more than $12 million in the second quarter of 2016.Once again, Monster's international performance outpaced its domestic results. Monster said that sales outside the U.S. made up $190.8 million in revenue, up by almost an eighth compared to year-ago figures.From a segment-by-segment perspective, Monster saw modest strength across the board. The Monster Energy drinks segment, which also includes the Mutant Super Soda product, saw revenue climb to 3.4%. Meanwhile, the strategic brands segment, which includes former  (NYSE: KO) energy-drink brands, posted sales gains of 3.2%. Moreover, the new segment for other revenue posted sales of $5.7 million, representing sales of products of American Fruits & Flavors that are sold to independent third parties.Operationally, Monster fared reasonably well. Gross profit margin climbed strongly, but a rise in general and administrative expenses hurt the company's operating income. The company's tax rate fell sharply during the period, reflecting a one-time tax benefit. Case volumes climbed slightly, to 82.8 million cases, and average net sales per case climbed to $9.45.Monster Beverage CEO Rodney Sacks once again made most of his comments about internal operations, especially its strategic alignment with various Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. \"We commenced the launch of Monster Energy drinks in China,\" Sacks said, \"beginning with Beijing in September and Shanghai and Hunan Province in October.\" The CEO believes that Monster will keep making moves for the rest of the year and throughout 2017 to boost its presence in China. In addition, distribution in the U.S. market has seen improved quality, and the Mutant Super Soda is doing well early on in its product cycle.One thing that investors will want to watch closely is a pick-up in costs related to regulatory matters and litigation. For now, the $4.9 million that Monster spent in the third quarter isn't worthy of too much concern, but it did rise by nearly half from year-ago levels. With the beverage industry broadly seeing more attention from regulators and consumer advocates, Monster will have to work hard to control risk.Investors in Monster Beverage weren't pleased with the slowdown in the company's growth rate, sending the stock down about 5.5% in after-hours trading following the announcement. In order to make long-term investors more comfortable with the stock, Monster will have to find ways to stoke its growth and get things moving more aggressively in the right direction.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The highlight was evidence of wage inflation, with hourly earnings up 2.8% from last year for the best jump since June 2009, bolstering the Federal Reserve's justification to raise interest rates before the end of the year. Indeed, Atlanta Fed president Lockhart said the report was \"solid.\"Back to politics. Which is all anyone seems to care about these days.Fresh polls show Trump taking the  , which could be enough to push him to victory given polling in other battleground states (assuming he gets Nevada, Florida, and Maine's Second Congressional District).Overall, the RealClearPolitics average has Clinton with a 1.7-point lead over Trump. That's down from a 4.6-point advantage last Friday before the FBI announcement that new emails related to Hillary's private server had been discovered on the laptop of Anthony Wiener, the estranged husband of close aide Huma Abedin.The IBD/TIPP poll has Clinton up 1 point, while the LA Times/USC poll has Trump up 4 points. The RCP average for battleground states has Clinton up 1.2 points in Florida, 2.6 points in Colorado and 3 points in Pennsylvania. Trump is ahead by 0.8 points in North Carolina, 1.5 points in New Hampshire and 2 points in Nevada.It's coming right down to the wire.Given Trump's aggressive nationalism and his stated opposition to things like open immigration, \"unfair\" trade and the Federal Reserve's cheap money stimulus - all of which have bolstered corporate profits and thus stocks in this bull market - the apprehension on Wall Street is understandable.But for his supporters on Main Street, this is exactly what's needed to bolster the middle class.The selling pressure that's resulted from Trump's rise has taken out significant technical support levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is falling away from the 18,000 level - first reached in 2014 - that had sustained a tightening trading range Since September. The Russell 2000 small cap index has returned to April-July levels.Seemingly unstoppable rallies in big-tech glamor stocks like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) - which pushed the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 to a new high on Oct. 25 - have given way to the selling pressure as well. AAPL is down nearly 8% over the past two weeks. AMZN is down nearly 11% from its early October high.Whether this is merely another buying opportunity on the path to ever higher prices or the start of a correction or something worse depends on who the American voters pick to lead the country on Tuesday.But even a relief rally on a Clinton win could be short lived. The Federal Reserve is preparing to raise interest rates in December, corporate earnings growth is moribund and the economy is limping just above stall speed.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including ExxonMobil (NYSE:  -  ), Gilead (NASDAQ:  -  ) and Duke Energy (NYSE:  -  ). shares have lagged the broader energy space this year (the stock is up 7.2% year to date vs. 12% gain for the sector as a whole), reflecting the stock's defensive attributes and relatively less 'oiliness' relative to peers like Chevron (CVX). The stock is nevertheless ahead of the market this year and provides a lower risk way to play the energy space with its integrated model, above peer group average financial returns, a fortress balance sheet and a very safe and attractive dividend currently 3.6%. Exxon's Q3 results were significantly below the year-earlier level, but they were nevertheless better than expected. Comparisons are expected to improve from Q4 onwards. (You can  ) shares have been laggards this year, losing nearly 28% year-to-date, as the HCV franchise continues to witness slowdown in the U.S. and Europe due to lower sales of Harvoni. The mixed Q3 results and questions about product pipeline didn't help matters either. On top of this are macro headwinds facing all drug makers related to pricing and other regulatory changes that many suspect are steadily shifting in an unfavorable direction. These are no doubt big challenges, but the analyst also points towards the company's robust late-stage pipeline. (You can  ) shares have outperformed the broader market as well as the peer utilities space in the year-to-date period (it is up more than 8%), with the company's better than expected Q3 results adding to the favorable momentum. The analyst likes the company's strong cash position, as is evident from the solid improvement in its cash equivalents figure. Further, the company's updated guidance buoys optimism. Being a premier utility service provider, Duke Energy continues to invest in infrastructure and expansion projects.

The Energy Drinks segment reported net sales of $743.5 million in the second quarter, up 14.2% year over year, owing to higher price and increased volume. The volume growth was driven by domestic and international customer demand. The trend is expected to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The acquisition of AFF represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for its principal products. The company believes that it will be able to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating costs commencing with the third quarter.However, high professional services costs related to regulatory and litigation issues, unfavorable currency translations and transition costs related to the Coca-Cola deal are hurting Monster Beverage's profits.Notably, for the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.12, reflecting a 32.99% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, our estimate for revenues is pegged at $823.4 million, implying an 8.83% increase.Here are some other companies in the consumer staples sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Avon Products Inc.  , slated to report third-quarter 2016 results on Nov 3, has an earnings ESP of +33.33% and a Zacks Rank #1.

That kind of brand recognition does not come easily or cheaply. It's 124 years old this year. That means KO stock has been through tougher times than we're going through right now and prevailed. Source: And it's a dividend aristocrat, meaning it has grown its dividend every quarter for more than 25%. That kind of rock-solid dividend growth and impressive yield (it's almost double the average  yield of 1.7%; KO is now yielding over 3.3%) is certainly comforting in today's turbulent market.But with all this going for it, KO stock is simply treading water. It's actually slightly in the red, year-to-date.The main problem that has everyone concerned is the fact that consumers are looking for healthier alternatives to the soft drinks that have been such a major revenue stream.Coca-Cola has adapted to that and continues to make efforts to find new growth markets in energy drinks, teas and juices. The problem is, it takes a while to turn a $180 billion ship that has production and distribution facilities around the world.Also challenging KO stock has been the slow growth in major overseas markets like China, Brazil and Argentina.But this isn't just a problem for Coca-Cola, but also its competitors  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ). All are having to retool in their businesses in the U.S. and abroad to keep growth alive.The advantage KO has is that it has already been moving in that direction for a few years now.Its water lines - Dasani, glaceau smartwater and vitaminwater - are a strong addition. And its Fuze tea and Honset Tea brands are also making progress. Its long-time juice brands Minute Maid and Simply Orange have been bolstered by Odwalla.But the most compelling addition has been the distribution agreement with  (NASDAQ:  ). Basically Coca-Cola gave MNST its energy drink business in exchange for a distribution deal and revenue share on its products.Through Q2, Monster was blowing away analysts' expectations. Growth has really taken hold now that MNST is attached to KO's powerful global production and distribution facilities.But this transition from its core soft drink brands to newer channels of revenue will take some time. And analysts are not patient people. However, their impatience is our advantage. While they discount KO stock into the end of 2016 - Coca-Cola has already guided lower for the year - that is only a short-term situation.Long-term, KO offers great growth potential with its second century of operations and its dividend will remain an aristocrat for decades to come.

Adjusted operating margin was 23.4%, down 30 bps year over year.Reported Profit-before-tax (PBT) declined 17%. Currency translations hurt PBT by 3%. Structural changes had a negative impact of 2% on PBT. Excluding currency headwinds and structural changes, PBT rose 2% on the back of positive impact of its productivity initiatives and an increase in equity income, partially offset by net interest expense.The structural changes mainly include the impact of bottler re-franchising efforts and the brand transfer agreement with Monster which closed in 2015.Coca-Cola witnessed 1% volume growth in the third quarter, compared with flat growth in the previous quarter. Sparkling beverage unit case volume was even as growth in three of the four geographic operating segments was offset by a 2% decline in Latin America. Moreover, still beverages volumes grew 3% in the quarter.In North America, volumes grew 1%, same as the previous quarter, reflecting ongoing pricing initiatives in the company's sparkling business as well as continued growth in stills portfolio.Sparkling beverage volume growth was slightly positive, rounding to even. Coca-Cola's North America still beverage volumes rose 2%, down from 3% in the previous quarter.Western Europe and Middle East & North Africa business units remained strong, partly offset by the weakness in Central & Eastern Europe business units.

Structural changes are expected to have a 4% negative impact on PBT, primarily due to accelerated re-franchising.In 2016, the company expects adjusted EPS to be down 4% to 7% versus prior year's comparable EPS of $2.00.The company expects to buy back shares worth $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion in 2016.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $110 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.00. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.6% return against the $110 commitment, or a 2.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MNST's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $110 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Monster Beverage Corp sees its shares fall 25% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $106.00 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.00 from $110), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.9% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , and highlighting in green where the $110 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $110 strike for the 2.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Monster Beverage Corp (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $146.58) to be 29%.

This morning, analysts at Credit Suisse surveyed a few of their favorites, and announced they're initiating coverage of  (NYSE: PEP) at outperform (i.e., buy), and  (NASDAQ: MNST) likewise, but giving  (NYSE: KO) no more than a neutral rating.Would you like to know why? Then you've come to the right place. Here are three things you need to know about Credit Suisse's new recommendations.Credit Suisse serves up a series of new soda pop ratings. Drink up! Image source: Getty Images.Our survey begins with PepsiCo, the soda giant known not just for its pop, but for its Frito-Lay line of salty snacks as well. Credit Suisse rates PepsiCo an outperform, and has assigned the stock a $121 price target. With PepsiCo stock currently trading for $105 and change, that promises as much as a 15% profit for new buyers -- plus a 2.9% dividend yield.What gets Credit Suisse so excited about Pepsi stock? It's not the valuation. At 30 times earnings, Pepsi stock is hardly cheap. Moreover, Credit Suisse admits that its own \"sales and EPS estimates are generally in-line with the consensus\" -- so Pepsi's P/E isn't really any cheaper than it looks.It's not the growth rate, either. Most analysts doubt Pepsi can grow much faster than 7% long-term, and while Credit Suisse says Pepsi is growing its \"noncarbonated beverages\" business (i.e., water) well, it's probably not well  to bump the growth rate well into the double digits. Rather, Credit Suisse simply likes Pepsi's staying power as a franchise, arguing that \"we think the market is not giving the company due credit for the marketing and financial strength of the Frito-Lay franchise\" and Pepsi's ability to keep earning steadily for years to come.Moving on to archrival Coca-Cola, Credit Suisse isn't nearly as enthralled with this one. Quoted on  this morning, the analyst calls Coke \"one of the top three most valuable brands in the world and one of the best operators out there.\" However, Credit Suisse worries that earnings over the next couple years \"will be bumpy\" and predicts \"the shares will remain range-bound over the coming 12 months as the company implements the organizational and operational changes it is currently undertaking.\"Coke stock sells for $42 today, and Credit Suisse doesn't see it growing much past $44 over the coming year. Accordingly, Coke gets a neutral rating.Curiously, though, Coke  key to Credit Suisse's recommendation of a completely different stock: Monster Beverage. By piggybacking on \"the Coke distribution system,\" Credit Suisse predicts that Monster will \"broaden its range and expand geographically.\" Credit Suisse thinks Monster's \"strong growth [will] persist and even accelerate ... in the coming years\" as the company capitalizes on its products' popularity with \"Millennial consumers.\"How good could things get for Monster stock? Most analysts who follow Monster see the company growing earnings at 21% annually over the next five years, but Credit Suisse says it adds 2% more worth of annual growth rate from 2018 on out based on \"aggressive assumptions around innovation launches and increased distribution in international markets.\"Of course, even a 23% growth rate may be too little to justify Monster's monstrous valuation of 46 times earnings. More worrisome still, Monster Beverage suffered a big drop in free cash flow last year (generating just $0.31 in real cash profits per $1 in reported income), and its free cash flow has actually turned negative over the past 12 months. Those numbers might be enough to give any investor pause, even if the stock's P/E ratio didn't show it to be significantly overvalued already.Then again, with PepsiCo stock valued at 30 times earnings, and Coca-Cola stock at 24 times earnings -- both on prospects for no more than single-digit growth over the next five years -- maybe Credit Suisse thinks it's worthwhile paying up for greater growth at Monster.My only advice: Paying up is fine. But try not to  pay.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Monster Beverage is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MNST in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.13 per share for MNST, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MNST, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 0.89% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that MNST has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Monster Beverage, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Beyond this Tale of the Tape, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

From its namesake cola drink to its wide line of juices, waters, soft drinks, and sports drinks, Coca-Cola has a long lineup of products, and its brand is known around the world. Along the way, Coca-Cola has built itself into an empire, and longtime investors have earned impressive returns by owning Coca-Cola stock and holding it for the long term. Yet there are many ways to value a company, and many investors wonder if the stock price truly reflects how much Coca-Cola's corporate operations are really worth. Below, we'll take a closer look at the net worth of Coca-Cola by several different measures to see whether the current share price is consistent with the beverage giant's true value.Image source: Coca-Cola.In the end, a company is worth only as much as investors are willing to pay for it. Coca-Cola currently has about 4.32 billion shares outstanding. With a share price of around $43.50 per share, that puts Coca-Cola's market capitalization at roughly $188 billion.However, market capitalization takes into account the relative amounts of cash and debt that a company has. Some people prefer to look at enterprise value, which ignores the capital structure that a company has chosen and instead focuses on the value of the business that the company generates. When you net out cash and debt, Coca-Cola has an enterprise value of almost $213 billion.Often, market participants see value in places where accountants won't necessarily look. When you look at Coca-Cola's balance sheet, you get a much different picture of the value of Coca-Cola.Coca-Cola's most recent financial statements put a value of $94 billion on its assets. That includes $24 billion in cash and short-term investments, about $5 billion in accounts receivable, and $7 billion in inventory, prepaid expenses, and other current assets. In addition, Coca-Cola's plants, property, and equipment make up almost $13 billion after taking accumulated depreciation into account. Long-term investments account for another $19 billion, including Coca-Cola's stake in  (NASDAQ: MNST) and various bottling operations around the world. When you add in another $26 billion in goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-term assets, you have all of Coca-Cola's balance sheet assets.Against those assets, Coca-Cola has substantial liabilities. Debt amounts to $48 billion, including $14 billion in short-term borrowings and more than $34 billion in long-term debt. Accounts payable add nearly $10 billion more to Coca-Cola's liabilities, and deferred tax liability and other liabilities bring the total to $67 billion. That gives Coca-Cola total shareholder equity worth $26.8 billion, or roughly $6.17 per share.Given that the stock trades for roughly seven times its book value, Coca-Cola's true value clearly isn't reflected in its accounting statements. Part of the reason is that it's hard to put an accurate value on the intangible brand that Coca-Cola has created. Late last year, Interbrand did its annual survey of major global brands, and Coca-Cola finished in the No. 3 spot. The rankings put a value of $78.4 billion on Coca-Cola's brand identity, and even though that was down 4% from year-earlier levels, it still recognizes the effort to which the beverage giant has gone in order to sustain its marketing advantage over its beverage rivals.Finally, you can learn a lot about a company by comparing it to its peers. In some cases, a superior company deserves a premium valuation when you put it side by side with fellow industry rivals. In others, a disparity can reflect short-term factors that can reverse quickly and pull share prices down in the future.For Coca-Cola, the stock's current valuation puts it in the middle of the pack in terms of trailing price-to-earnings ratios, as you can see below:\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance.However, a couple of things stand out. First, most investors don't see Coca-Cola producing very much growth in the near future, even in comparison to its closest direct peers. Much of the trouble here stems from Coca-Cola's reliance on sugary soft drinks, which have come under fire lately due to concerns about their long-term health impacts. PepsiCo has a more diversified business that includes snack items, and that gives it slightly less risk than Coca-Cola with respect to that particular issue.Even with tepid growth expectations, Coca-Cola still fetches a substantial earnings multiple in the mid-20s. That likely reflects the high demand for dividend-paying stocks. Coca-Cola has a long history of paying dividends to shareholders, including more than a half-century of annual increases to its dividend. The 3.2% dividend yield isn't that far above PepsiCo's, but Coca-Cola's track record is even longer than what PepsiCo has put together. That could change if low interest rates start to rise, but for now, investors are happy to pay up for Coke shares.Coca-Cola's net worth puts it among the most valuable stocks in the market. Given its global franchise, well-recognized brand, and ability to face up to challenges in its core industry, Coca-Cola has the ability to keep performing well and justifying its worth to shareholders for years to come.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

While adjusted earnings of 99 cents per share fell short of the Zacks consensus estimate, they were up 25% from a year ago. Revenue of $827.5 million was up 19% year over year and beat estimates.Following the earnings announcement, S&P Capital IQ Equity Research reiterated its \"Buy\" rating on MNST stock and raised its price target by $28 to $191. Its analysts note that while the strategic partnership between Monster Beverage and  (NYSE:  ) is causing near-term disruptions, they are cheered by early signs of sales outperformance.In June 2015, KO took a 16.7% stake in Monster for its non-energy drink business (natural sodas, juices, smoothies, teas, lemonades and enhanced waters) and transferred its energy drink business to Monster. In addition, the deal made Coca-Cola Monster's preferred distribution partner.Capital IQ expects Monster to post 13% sales growth this year, driven by new product launches, price increases and international expansion. Operating EPS is estimated to increase 31% in 2016 to $3.93 and another 21% in 2017 to $4.75.Turning to the chart, we see that following a decline from about $160 in December, MNST stock formed a \"W\" bottom from February to late April.

The gap pushed shares through the 200-day moving average and into a bull channel that was confirmed by consistent higher highs and higher lows within a range of about 10 points.Following a new high on Friday, MNST stock predictably fell to its bull channel support line at about $158.Traders should look to buy shares under $160 for a trade to $200 for a potential return of at least 25%. Long-term investors may also want to buy MNST stock for an even greater percentage return since point-and-figure analysis renders a target of $232, almost 45% above the current price.Click to EnlargeThe post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself.

However, the energy drink producer has delivered negative earnings surprises in two of the last four quarters and has an average negative surprise of 5.04%. | Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcementMonster Beverage's revenues in the second quarter of 2016 are expected to gain traction from new products launched in the U.S in the past few quarters, solid international sales and growing momentum of the energy drink category.The company reported strong gross margin expansion through 2015 and first quarter 2016 on the back of price increase, strong sales of new products and a favorable segment mix trend. The brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company  , which are produced as concentrates or beverage bases, are high-margin products that make significant positive contribution to sales and gross margins. This gross margin trend is likely to continue in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage generates more than 20% of its consolidated gross sales outside the U.S. Because of its growing international presence, its sales and profits are being hurt due to negative currency translations. Though the U.S dollar is getting weaker, the negative impact of currency translation is still significant.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Monster Beverage is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. : Monster Beverage' Earnings ESP is -1.92% as the Most Accurate Estimate stands at $1.02 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.04. Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though the company's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies in the broader food sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Dean Foods Company  has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #2Post Holdings, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +14.89% and a Zacks Rank #2The Procter & Gamble Company  has an Earnings ESP of +2.7% and a Zacks Rank #3Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

's  (NYSE: KO) second-quarter 2016 earnings, released on Wednesday, continued the first quarter's theme of declining revenue resulting from carbonated-beverage weakness. Earnings fared better as the multinational refreshment purveyor increased earnings per share by 11% in the quarter. Nonetheless, ongoing volume softness in key international markets caused Coca-Cola to revise its outlook for the rest of the year.Let's walk through the key numbers from Wednesday's report, discuss earnings highlights, and review the specifics on the company's forward guidance.Data source: Coca-Cola Company 8-K filing, July 27, 2016.In Coca-Cola's earnings release, CEO Muhtar Kent addressed the company's current ground game within turbulent emerging markets:\"In these international operations where external headwinds have proven to be more severe than originally forecast, we are taking action by reassessing local market initiatives where needed and continuing our efforts in driving productivity.\"During the organization's  with analysts on Wednesday, Kent explained that \"reassessing local market initiatives\" means tactically easing up on resources in underperforming markets, while shifting resources to those which are building momentum.This fits a recent pattern in which Coke executives seem to be implementing revenue management strategies in local markets much more rapidly than in years past. And actually, they have little choice: Hyperinflation in Latin America, coupled with more tentative consumers in Europe, China, and even parts of Africa, forces Coke to be more pragmatic with its advertising and distribution, and to favor areas that respond quickly to investment.Coca-Cola stock ended Wednesday's trading session down more than 3%. The company's second-quarter results really weren't much worse than the first quarter; however, management lowered its outlook for organic revenue growth in 2016, from a previous range of between 4% and 5%, to the slower and more specific growth rate of 3%.This pushed the estimated range of full-year comparable EPS down roughly two percentage points, to a projected decrease of 4% to 7% from last year's comparable EPS of $2.00.At midyear, it certainly seems that Coca-Cola is working hard to preserve even a small bit of organic revenue expansion. Looking ahead to Q3, the company might find a revenue catalyst in the form of further favorable pricing in mature markets. Spurring growth in developing countries while holding emerging markets steady is essentially the opposite of the company's long-term strategy, but if Coke can reaccelerate in the back half of the year, it won't be too particular about flipping the script for the time being.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

Though the cola giant beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, it missed the same for sales due to severe macroeconomic challenges in many international markets. Importantly, soda volumes declined in the all important North America segment.Atlanta beverage giant lowered its previously issued sales guidance for 2016 and guided for an adjusted earnings decline in the year. This hurt investor sentiment propelling a more than 2% share price decline in  .Second-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of the company were 60 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents by 3.4%.Earnings declined 5% year over year due to currency headwinds. Excluding the 11% negative Fx impact, earnings rose 6% on the back of improved organic growth and higher operating margins.Earnings have been adjusted mainly to incorporate charges related to the North American/international re-franchising initiative and costs associated with the productivity program. Including these, reported earnings were 79 cents per share, up 12% year over year.Net revenue declined 5% year over year to $11.54 billion due to currency headwinds and the negative impact of acquisitions/divestitures and structural items.Currency headwinds hurt sales by 3%, in line with management's expectations of 2-3%. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items hurt revenues by 5%, more than the predicted 2-3%.After adjusting for the negative Fx impact and acquisitions/divestitures, organic revenues rose 3%, better than 2% in the previous quarter as pricing gains mitigated flat volumes in the quarter.Strong performance in developed markets like U.S., Mexico and Japan was offset by weakness in key emerging markets like China and Argentina due to worse-than-expected macroeconomic headwinds.Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.71 billion by 1.5%.Adjusted consolidated gross margins contracted 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 60.5% as positive pricing, productivity gains, and lower commodity costs were offset by currency headwinds, the effects of refranchising the North American bottlers and sale of the legacy higher margin energy brands to Monster in 2015. Gross margins rose 40 bps sequentially.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis to $3.92 billion.Adjusted operating income, on a constant currency basis, was $3.05 billion, up 3% year over year. Adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, up 50 bps year over year as lower gross margins were counteracted by strong cost management and productivity gains. Operating margins rose 280 bps sequentially.Profit-before-tax (PBT) declined 6% to $3.40 billion. Currency translations hurt PBT by 11%, in line with expectations. Structural changes had a negative impact of 4% on PBT, more than an impact of 3% as estimated. Excluding currency headwinds and structural changes, PBT rose 10% on the back of higher organic revenues and operating income along with increased equity income and favorable timing of expenses.The structural changes mainly include the impact of bottler re-franchising efforts and the brand transfer agreement with Monster which closed in 2015.Coca-Cola witnessed flat volumes in the second quarter, compared with 2% growth in the previous quarter, due to lower sparkling beverage volumes. Moreover, still beverages volumes slowed down in the quarter.Sparkling beverage volumes declined 1% compared with flat result in the previous quarter due to weakness in some emerging markets. Still beverages grew 2% in terms of volume, compared with less than 7% growth the previous quarter. Positive growth in all categories was partially offset by lower juice and juice drinks volumes due to industry weakness in China.In North America, volumes grew 1% versus less than 2% growth in the previous quarter as soda volumes fell. Sparkling soda volumes declined 1% in North America. Rival, PepsiCo, Inc.'s  carbonated soft drink volumes also declined 4% in the country in the second quarter, as announced earlier this month. Sales of sodas of these bigwigs are being hurt by lower demand due to increasing health consciousness among consumers. Coca-Cola's North America still beverage volumes rose 3%, also slowing down from 5% in the previous quarter.Among other developed nations, volumes remained stable in Japan while improving slightly in Europe. European volumes were flat, better than a decline of 1% in the previous quarter. Japan volumes rose 4%, same as in the previous quarter.Among the developing countries, 3% growth in India and a high single-digit growth in Mexico were offset by declines in Brazil, Russia and China.Price/mix increased 3% compared with a 1% rise in the previous quarter as pricing gains were partially offset by an unfavorable geographic mix.Though the company reaffirmed the previously issued 2016 profit outlook, it lowered its sales expectations.Organic revenues are expected to rise 3%, less than the previous range of 4-5% in 2016. The guidance now falls short of Coca-Cola's long-term target of a mid single-digit increase. Acquisitions/divestitures (mainly the bottler re-franchising efforts) are expected to hurt revenues by 6-7% (previously 4-5%), while Fx is expected to have a negative impact of 2-3% (maintained) on revenues.Excluding currency headwinds and structural changes, PBT is expected to increase 6-8%, in line with long-term estimates.Foreign exchange is expected to hurt PBT by 8-9%. Structural changes are expected to have a 4% (previously 3-4%) negative impact on PBT, primarily due to accelerated re-franchising.In 2016, the company expects adjusted EPS to be down 4% to 7% versus prior year's comparable EPS of $2.00.The company expects to buy back shares worth $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion in 2016. Adjusted effective tax rate is likely to be 22.5%.Concurrent with the earnings release, Coca-Cola said that two existing bottlers signed letters of intent to expand their territories. While Moses Lake territory has been granted to Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Yakima, Washington, Sanford territory has been added to Durham Coca-Cola Bottling Company of North Carolina.The company also said that the National Product Supply Group will add two new members.The company also said it has reached a definitive agreement with Viking Coca-Cola Bottling and Great Lakes Coca-Cola Distribution to add territories or acquire production facilities, as agreed upon, in the previously announced letters of intent.Coca-Cola is refranchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories to create a more efficient system. Over 65% of the U.S. territories have already been transferred or agreed to be refranchised so far.The company is also focused on refranchising in markets like Europe and Africa, which include the creation of Coca-Cola European Partners  through the merger of bottlers in Western Europe in May and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa through the merger of bottling operations in Southern and Eastern Africa in July. In China, it has agreed to refranchise its company-owned bottling operations to its existing partners, COFCO and Swire.In addition, Coca-Cola has made equity investments in smaller companies like Monster Beverage Corporation  to enhance growth in key categories.The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, are expected to result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Currently, Coca-Cola has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). | Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

That's what MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (  ) performs.The market has gone up and down like a kid on a trampoline for the past six months. Yet the $2.1 billion mutual fund's marching orders are to find companies that have the best opportunities for growth two to three years in the future and whose valuations underplay those growth prospects.So how does the mutual fund pursue those goals without getting crushed in the market's volatility in the meantime?\"The benefit of a longer-term time horizon is that you can look through the market's short-term noise,\" said co-manager Paul Gordon, who runs the fund with colleagues Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel. \"We also tend to look for companies that are heavily in control of their own fate, so events in the world shouldn't disproportionately impact them. They can grow through those issues.\"It's not that the fund is looking for stocks that play dead for two or three years, Gordon says. What the fund wants is stocks whose earnings keep on growing for at least two or three years more. \"We're willing to trade a stock with a high current rate of growth for one where we can be confident in the duration of its (slightly slower) growth,\" Gordon said.That approach has enabled the fund to keep its footing during the market's gyrations. Going into Friday, the fund was up 6.23% so far this year, topping 72% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 4.54%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was up 7.49%. Over the past three years, the fund's 11.43% average annual gain beat 92% of its direct rivals, which averaged a 7.74% gain, while the big-cap bogey advanced at a 10.98% yearly pace.Also, the fund's IBD 36-Month Performance Rating is A. That means the its performance is among the top 10% of all mutual funds in that time.Helping to drive that record? Nine of the fund's top-10 holdings as of June 30 had a strong IBD Composite Rating of 80 or better. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Composite Rating.The portfolio also includes  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

Gordon doubts that's the case. \"And it's more difficult to imagine that a  (  ),  (GM) or even  (BMWYY) can do what Mobileye can.\"Vulcan Materials, a building materials company, is up 26% so far this year. It pays a dividend yield of 0.6%, and it has a 97 Composite Rating from IBD, the second-highest possible.\"Aggregates are a good business,\" Gordon said. \"It is highly localized, and Vulcan has a significant market share in its regions. As such, it has positive pricing (power), including through the last downturn.\"With product volumes near all-time lows in a cyclical business, \"that tells us that Vulcan's risk-reward potential is skewed to the upside,\" Gordon said.The stock plunged 5% Monday to its 50-day moving average after Q2 revenue and earnings came in below analyst expectations.Monster Beverage is up 8% so far this year, having rallied from a steep decline in February.EPS growth rebounded 25% in the latest quarter, bouncing back from a 6% decline the prior quarter.\"Energy drink consumption continues to gain share of total beverage consumption,\" Gordon said. \"And their deal with (  (KO)) lets them significantly increase distribution internationally with little operational risk or costs to Monster.\"Teen-targeting discount chain  (FIVE) is up about 58% so far this year.

Meanwhile energy-drink volumes have risen dramatically, up 7.94% in 2015 and 7.34% in 2014, on top of double-digit increases in recent years.\"Energy drinks have had very strong growth for over a decade now and the primary reason for that is there is a huge demand for energy and the products are well-formulated to deliver on that,\" said Gary Hemphill, managing director of research at Beverage Marketing.Monster cans come in 16 fluid ounces and contain two servings. Each serving has 86 milligrams of caffeine vs. 95 milligrams found in a typical cup of coffee. The drinks often contain other stimulants like guarana, taurine and B vitamins.\"Consumers gravitate more toward things that are healthier for you, and consumers want variety and a change of pace,\" Hemphill said.Monster declined requests for an interview.But the company offers a variety of products including a low-carb version, Muscle Monster energy shakes and a football-themed version inspired by Rob Gronkowski, the energetic New England Patriots tight end who manages to simultaneously maintain a fun-loving lifestyle and still set National Football League records.Monster and Austria's Red Bull are the two global leaders in the energy drink market. Red Bull has more market share in Europe, as it tapped into the EU market before Monster did.But Monster leads in the U.S., the largest energy-drink market in the world with volumes at 629.3 million gallons last year, Beverage Marketing says. Monster is typically sold in the U.S. in a can twice the size as Red Bull, but at the same price.[ibdchart symbol=\"MNST\" type=\"daily\" size=\"threequarter\" position=\"leftchart\" ]Smaller players in the energy beverage spectrum include Rockstar, along with Rip It by  (  ) and 5 Hour Energy shots by capital management firm Innovations Ventures.Monster generally has been a highly rated stock, but Wells Fargo downgraded it to market perform from outperform this past Monday. That sent the stock tumbling as the analyst warned on lower-than-expected sales and no new products until the fourth quarter.But shares have gained back some ground since then, and remain in buy range. Shares ended trading up at the close Friday and were down fractionally at the close Monday to 160.07.Monster was founded under the name Hansen Natural in 1935 before switching its name to Monster Beverage in 2012 to emphasize its focus on energy drinks. During its first-quarter conference call in April, Monster said that according to Nielsen data, U.S. sales of its energy drinks grew 10.8% while sales of Red Bull increased 4.1% and sales  's (  ) Amp decreased 8.1%.Monster also is making headway overseas and saw market share gains during the first quarter in a slew of European nations. They include: Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden.Much of Monster's international growth has come from  's (  ) ownership stake in the company. Last year Monster completed a deal to move its bottle and distribution to Coke bottlers and sold its non-energy drink assets, including Hansen's soda, to Coke. Coke sold its energy products such as its Burn drink, to Monster.\"This opens up new channels, new areas to get product into more storefronts,\" said Adam Fleck, director of consumer equity research at Morningstar.\"There have been lawsuits and continuing regulator concerns around the product,\" Fleck said. \"A company the size of Coke has some concerns about going all in on energy drinks. Instead they have chosen to take a minority stake in Monster and get out of the business entirely.\"Fleck believes U.S. energy drink volumes will continue to grow in the high-single to low-double digits in the foreseeable future.Monster consumers tend to skew younger and male, Fleck said. Monster sponsors extreme sporting events and athletes in motocross, BMX, mountain biking, surfing and snowboarding. It also has an athlete development program for kids ages 13-21.But with the addition of a line of Java-themed products that include coffee, cream and a \"Monster energy blend\" the brand is looking to expand its reach past its key demographic.Monster is planning to launch its products in China later this year but warned during its first-quarter conference call that the launch could be delayed by regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements.Monster settled two wrongful-death lawsuits last year after teenagers died of cardiac problems after drinking the energy drinks.Studies have shown that increases in blood pressure after drinking energy drinks can make people more susceptible to cardiovascular problems, and the World Health Organization said high caffeine levels can cause heart palpitations, hypertension and heart attacks in extreme cases.Middlebury College in Vermont has banned the sales of energy drinks on campus as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say mixing energy drinks with alcohol makes people three times more likely to binge drink.Because Monster relies so heavily on one product Fleck said investors need to have \"a larger margin of safety\" than with a more diversified beverage company like Coke, which relies on its signature drink along with bottled water and juices.\"Health concerns are a real downside risk in the Monster story,\" he said. \"While the international growth rates remain pretty good, a U.S. slowdown will be a big risk.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors eyeing a purchase of Monster Beverage Corp (Symbol: MNST) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $159.90/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $115 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.80. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.2% return against the $115 commitment, or a 2.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MNST's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $115 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Monster Beverage Corp sees its shares decline 28% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $110.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.80 from $115), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.8% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , and highlighting in green where the $115 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $115 strike for the 2.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Monster Beverage Corp (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $159.90) to be 31%.

The company's partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) last year has helped to expand its reach in the U.S. and internationally.

Its year-to-date loss of about 8% going into Thursday lags the average 2.96% setback by its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500's 2.45% gain.But you're highly unlikely to hear sounds of panic from the fund's quarters. That's because this is not the first lobster bake for the Boston-based fund managers. They've encountered market volatility before. And they have a way of rebounding.Right now, the fund's IBD 36-Month Performance Rating through May is A+, the highest available. That means the fund's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Around the start of that period, the fund was also battling rough seas. In the second quarter of 2013, the fund lost ground while both its peer group and the broad market romped ahead.Usually, the fund makes the opposite happen. In the more than 53 quarters since the start of lead manager Thomas Galvin's tenure on Feb. 28, 2003 -- he's the longest tenured of three current managers -- the fund has outperformed both its direct rivals and the big-cap bogey 28 times. It has lagged both two quarters in a row only once.That helps explain why this fund is an  winner, shining in three categories: U.S. stock funds, growth funds and large-cap funds. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.So how has the fund positioned itself for the future?

But the highly caffeinated brand grew to dominate its finances to such an extent that the company renamed itself Monster Beverage in 2012. Today Monster is the best-positioned drink marketer in the most attractive segment of the industry. While carbonated soda sales have been shrinking for years, the \"alternative\" beverage niche is growing by double-digits and passed $40 billion in 2015.Monster's incredible stock price run can be attributed to an epic expansion of profits. Net income is up seven fold over the last decade, almost exactly mirroring the rally in shares. Recently, a lucrative partnership with  has helped  to the Monster brand.

Image source: Monster Beverage.Beverage giant  (NASDAQ: MNST) has pioneered the energy-drink industry, bringing innovation to a beverage market that has been showing signs of decline. Even as traditional carbonated products have struggled to find their footing amid greater calls for regulation and taxation, Monster Beverage has survived past controversies about the health impact of its products. As the company's second-quarter financial report approaches, Monster Beverage investors want to see the same kind of positives that helped send the stock higher after the company's previous earnings announcement.Let's take an early look at the latest from Monster Beverage with an eye toward gauging whether the company can keep up its momentum going forward.Data source: Yahoo! Finance.In recent months, investors have gotten more optimistic about Monster Beverage earnings, raising their full-year 2016 and 2017 projections by between 2% and 3%. The stock has also done extremely well, climbing more than 20% just since mid-April.Nearly all of the stock gains Monster Beverage has earned came in the aftermath of its first-quarter financial report. The pace of revenue growth for Monster doubled to almost 16%, and adjusted net income rose by nearly half from year-ago levels. Those figures even included a hit from currency impacts, and case volumes rose enough to offset a drop in the average price per case. CEO Rodney Sacks pointed to the company's integration of its purchase of American Fruits and Flavors as being successful thus far, and the announcement of a new stock buyback also helped send shares higher.Since then, Monster has quickly moved to implement some of what it talked about in its earnings report. The final results of Monster's tender offer to buy back $2 billion in shares were available in June, and the beverage company said it accepted about 12.8 million shares for buyback at $156 per share. The company accepted all but about 1.3% of shares tendered at or below that $156 price, and that included extensive holdings of roughly 1.83 million shares from the CEO and 1.05 million shares from board member Hilton Schlosberg. Some were concerned about the insider sales, but the two executives still hold more than 17.3 million in total after the tender offer.Monster has also kept up its pace of innovation by going after some of the most popular beverage franchises of its rivals. In June, Monster introduced two new products, and one drew particular notice from investors as a departure from its core area. The new Mutant product will be a \"super soda,\" and many believe the carbonated beverage is designed to target customers who currently drink Mountain Dew. Mutant will have even more caffeine per ounce than its rival, and Monster hopes the energy emphasis of the beverage will help it avoid the drop-off in demand that most traditional carbonated-beverage sellers have seen with regular colas and other sugary drinks. With Mountain Dew having done a lot of marketing in connection with extreme-sports events like the X-Games in an effort to go after younger customers, most industry analysts see Monster's move as a direct assault on Mountain Dew's leadership role in that segment of the market. In addition to Mutant, the new non-carbonated energy drink Hydro will also be available and adds to Monster's already impressive lineup of available beverages.In the Monster Beverage report, investors will want to look closely at whether its efforts to take advantage of competitors' weakness result in greater sales. With shareholders having weathered so many fears about whether the energy-drink industry will end up getting beaten down by regulatory or health concerns, Monster Beverage has a real opportunity if it can keep on growing with its existing products and also expand to cover larger pieces of the market worldwide.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Is there more consolidation ahead? Which mREITs might be drafting buyout proposals right now? And most importantly, what does it mean for investors, and how can we make the most of this merger mania?Here's CWMF on all that, and more: There are a number of high-profile mergers happening right now in the mREIT sector (you've got the Apollo (  ) (  ) mREITs consolidating, Annaly's (  ) merger with Hatteras (  ), and ZAIS' (  ) combo with privately held commercial mREIT Sutherland Asset Management). Would you say there's something of a \"merger mania\" happening in the mREIT sector right now, and why is the time ripe now for consolidation? Are we going to see more of these types of mergers going forward? There was a substantial increase in merger activity due to the extreme discounts to book value that were seen during the first part of the year. The enormous disconnection between book values and share prices created a major incentive for larger mREITs or those trading at stronger valuations to acquire smaller ones.I would expect more mergers to be announced, but there are far fewer compelling targets in the current scenario. To be a compelling target one of the mREITs needs to trade at a large discount to book value. However, it won't work for just any mREIT to be at a large discount. It needs to be an mREIT that does not have exceptionally strong controls in place to limit the rights of shareholders. What are the implications of all these mergers for mREIT investors? A merger between mortgage REITs can be fairly positive. The mREIT making the acquisition will almost always be getting a very attractive deal because they are usually acquiring securities that range from extremely liquid to moderately liquid and they are buying them at a discount to the fair value of the assets.The target of the acquisition usually sees a much larger price gain due to their discount to book value disappearing, but they also usually only get 80% to 90% of book value. I believe one of the largest reasons for discrepancy between the buyout price and the book value is because of the termination fees paid to external managers (or consulting contracts / termination bonuses to internal managers). A mortgage REIT couldn't very well announce that they were closing up shop, paying management 4% to 8% of book value, paying any other transaction costs, and then sending the rest of the cash to shareholders.I see buyouts where both mREITs have the same external manager as a positive strategy. In those cases the termination fees should regularly be waived and more of the wealth goes to the shareholders. You've written that it's a difficult economic environment for mREITs and that you're finding the sector overall expensive right now. So do you see any opportunities in mREITs in the coming months? Conversely, are there specific stocks you'd advise investors to steer clear of, in light of merger news, concerns or other macro issues (the Fed, jobs, world events, etc)? I would be wary of any mortgage REIT trading at a very small discount to book value. If the mortgage REIT also has a small market capitalization, it requires even further due diligence. There are two major signs that an mREIT's share price might collapse. Either the mREIT is going to have an earnings report where they will reveal terrible numbers on earnings and book value, or the mREIT has to cut their dividend. In both cases it helps if the mREIT is already trading at a higher price-to-book ratio than peers.New York Mortgage Trust (  ) was a perfect example prior to Q1 earnings. Their price to book ratio is back to being too high, but so far in the second quarter their position in very credit sensitive assets should be performing well. Strong performance on that segment reduces the risk of a hard fall. On the other hand, I don't believe that dividend is sustainable over the long term. Investors should be wary about the risk for a sudden fall on the date the company is scheduled to announce their dividend. If they cut the dividend, it could trigger a fall. If they sustain, it could create a little rally.I think Chimera Investment Corporation (  ) has the potential for a fierce correction, but it wouldn't be likely in the short term. Their credit assets are having a solid quarter and management already indicated that they expect to maintain the dividend throughout the year. Even though I think the mREIT is near the top end of their potential valuation, neither catalyst is available in the near future.I'm worried about Orchid Island Capital (  ) because of the risk of a wave of prepayments hitting the portfolio. That would have the potential to significantly weaken their asset yields. Their book value appears to be doing fairly well during the quarter (based my models) but the dividend could be in danger. If I were in their shoes, I wouldn't want to cut the dividend. If they can move above book value they could issue new shares, which would allow them to improve their economies of scale on some of their operating expenses.The interesting thing is that by my calculations, as of early June ORC has one of the best TERs (Total Economic Return). When assessing which mREITs were able to generate the best combination of dividends and change in book value, I see ORC's portfolio position as one of the most successful among mREITs that are primarily owning agency RMBS. By my estimates ORC's book value was higher as of 06/03/2016 than it was at the start of the quarter. That is pretty good given that they had already paid out $.28 in dividends. Despite those positive developments, I simply see prices being too high. You mentioned in your  dated Monday, June 6 \"Thoughts On A Handful Of mREITs And The State Of The Industry (Week 34)\" that the mREIT sector is flooded with new investors, and that their presence is \"driving up prices and leading to some new relative pricing failures.\" Can you elaborate on that, and is that a trend you expect to shake out at some point? Is there a specific set of catalysts that could potentially \"scare\" investors out of the sector? If so, what does that do to prices overall, and how can investors position themselves against any sort of volatility resulting from an exodus of frightened novice investors from mREITs, if that's even a concern? Relative pricing failures might shake out at some point, but if that ever happened entirely, it would make my job dramatically more difficult. I believe the market as a whole is getting fairly expensive and bond yields are getting pretty low. Investors are desperate for yield and a few positive comments about mREITs can be enough to sway some investors to join the sector. These new investors are less likely to understand how the mortgage REIT portfolio works and may be more likely to use factors like the dividend yield to make their decision. Who wants to buy 11% when they can get 18%? If these investors don't know the odds of the dividend being cut, or how much of the dividend is simply a return of capital (from an economic perspective, not a tax perspective), how can they determine that the 18% yield is better?An investor can get a 100% yield from their savings account for one year so long as they don't mind most of it being a return of capital. I try to constantly warn investors about the risk of viewing a return of capital as income, but only some of them are willing and able to process the implications.The big risks I see here as potentially setting off a panic would be dividend cuts or massive interest rate volatility. If the Federal Reserve were able to scare the markets into believing long-term rates needed to go materially higher (say 100 to 150 basis points), it would absolutely crush book value for any mREIT that was not heavily hedged against it.I would say that the potential exodus of frightened novice investors (excellent description) is a huge concern for any investor trying to buy shares in this environment. The fall in prices that could happen during an exodus could easily offset more than a year of dividend income.When looking for potential long plays in the sector, I would look at mortgage REITs that have reasonable levels of operating expenditures relative to equity, trade at larger than normal discounts to book value, and are unlikely to cut their dividends in the near future. There are only a few of those in the market right now. By virtue of trading at a much larger discount to book value, I believe these mortgage REITs will be ones that investors view unfavorably on an emotional basis.If investors want a quick way of asking which mREITs are going to be on my radar, they can start with asking themselves: Anything that has elicits an emotional response warrants further investigation. Nothing drives prices to absurd levels (high or low) quite the same way as emotion. Without highlighting individual names, I need to point out that there are a few large discounts in the industry that I believe absolutely deserve to be there. Assessing book value is a critical step in the analysis process, but investors need to know that there can be huge problems with an mREIT that won't show up on the balance sheet. Is there anything else you'd like to add here for readers that I didn't ask you about? I recently purchased common shares of ARMOUR Residential REIT (  ). I can still hardly believe it. I've been one of the biggest bears on ARR and have consistently analyzed them to find their weaknesses. Eventually ARR traded at a dramatically larger discount than peers and I saw a strong opportunity. The mREIT materially altered their portfolio after Q1 ended and their bet on the direction of interest rates was right. It wasn't that long ago that ARR traded at the same discount to book value as many peers, but since then shares dramatically underperformed even though the portfolio of assets was outperforming. This is not a long-term investment. This is simply an opportunity to capitalize on ARR's portfolio value being higher (by my estimates) than I think most investors or analysts would have guessed.ARR cut their dividend twice recently and the market has thoroughly punished them for it. Many investors may be scared that the dividend will be slashed again. I strongly doubt that will happen. My position in ARR could be taken as my way of betting that it won't happen.I made the trade on the same day that interest rates moved hard and I was able to get an approximation of book value for 5 mortgage REITs prepared the same day. That approximation, along with my decision to enter the market, was immediately sent to  .Lately I've been putting in long hours on preparing some subscription work and I put an emphasis on pair trades. The reason for emphasizing pair trades was to provide new subscribers with a quick way to capture a gain to cover the cost of the subscription. For subscribers that don't use pair trades, the analysis still provides a way to plan an exit from one security and an entry into the second security that has materially better prospects given the right price points. Those price points are also highlighted.Dividend sustainability is another area that I like to cover, and that I believe is often misunderstood. Many investors or analysts will look at the dividend, look at \"Core EPS\" and then simply measure which value is bigger. Such an analysis could be performed in a second grade classroom. This lack of effort should usually lead to a lack of results. There are a few ways to estimate dividend sustainability, but that isn't one. When a dividend is set up to be slashed but appears to be covered by Core EPS, it is a great indicator that there could be a huge correction coming. Are you psyched/intrigued by mREIT merger mania?

Source: \u00a9iStock.com/Mike_KievThat news flash probably doesn't come as a surprise to most investors. Heck, the average U.S. dividend yield is higher than a 20-year bond. Investors, crazy for yield, have nowhere else to turn.Historically, dividend yields offered a premium to bonds. Capital appreciation was an afterthought. Then, in the 1950s, capital appreciation replaced dividends as the bigger portion of a stock's total return. It has been that way ever since.However, evidence suggests we could be returning to those halcyon days when dividends ruled. The only problem? Capital appreciation is expected to go missing in action, causing pensioners a whole lot of grief.What to do? The easy answer is to buy dividend-paying stocks, avoiding any that don't.However, behavioral finance expert  suggests $1,000 received by selling shares for a capital gain are equal in terms of buying power to $1,000 in dividends; perhaps more so because in some situations the tax rate on capital gains is lower than dividends.Furthermore, Daniel Solin pointed out in a 2014  on the subject, that between 1991 and 2012, non-dividend-paying stocks had an average annual return of 11.1%, 200 basis points higher than dividend-paying stocks.In my opinion, there should always be a mixture of both in your portfolio. Here are three stocks to buy that don't need dividends to lift them. Who doesn't like  (  )?Zero debt, no quarterly dividends, Mark Zuckerberg, $20.6 billion in cash and marketable securities, $3 billion in first-quarter non-GAAP operating income; the list of positives is endless.But seriously, do you honestly think that the 2.2% dividend yield generated by the  is going to get you through retirement all by its lonesome?

Helping out is the completion of its acquisition of  , the people behind the energy drink's different flavors. With these guys in-house, expect new products and flavors to get to market faster.Here's the deal.Coke and Pepsi currently generate dividend yields of 3.1% and 3% respectively, with average annual returns over the past five years of around 8%-9%. You can buy their stocks or you can buy a MNST stock that pays no dividend but has achieved an annual return of 33.4% over the same period.

First quarter adjusted earnings of 80 cents per share increased 25% year over year owing to lower tax rate and strong revenues. Net sales of $680.2 million increased 8.5% year over year driven by higher international sales despite steep currency headwinds.Monster Beverage started 2016 on a positive note after delivering dismal results in 2015. The company reported strong gross margin expansion through 2015 and first quarter 2016 on the back of price increase, strong sales of new products and a favorable segment mix.Moreover, with the implementation of The Coca-Cola Company (  ) deal, Monster Beverage is aggressively expanding in the international market, supported by strong demand in the energy drink category. The company is in the process of launching Monster in China later this year in partnership with Coca-Cola System, which we believe is good strategic move and should drive sales and profits further. Also, the acquisition of American Fruits and Flavors on Apr 1, 2016, is encouraging as it stabilizes the flavor supply for the company.Going ahead, Monster Beverage has several new product launches lined up for 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, the company launched Gronk energy drink and Salted Caramel Java Monster. The company intends to launch a new Mutant, a refreshment energizer in the third quarter of 2016. The introduction of these new products will also benefit from the broader distribution network as a result of the Coca-Cola deal.However major headwinds including unfavorable currency translations and the transitional impact of the Coca-Cola deal continue to hurt profits.

Coca-Cola beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales in first-quarter 2016. Excluding Fx, earnings of 45 cents per share rose 8% on improved organic growth and higher operating margins. Organic revenues inched up 2%. However, soda volumes declined in the quarter due to challenges in many emerging markets.2015 was a \"transition year\" for Coca-Cola because of the changes implemented to create a new operating model. The company made tangible progress on this plan. The company implemented aggressive cost-cutting measures and several initiatives to drive growth during the year. The resultant savings are being deployed to fund marketing programs and in innovations to re-accelerate top-line growth, margin expansion and returns on capital. Other than aggressively cutting costs, the initiative included disciplined brand and growth investments as well as aligning incentive plans.Coca-Cola's productivity and strategic initiatives led to better-than-expected results in 2015 with the trend continuing in 2016. Its increased marketing investments have led to volume growth, especially in North America.The company is also focused on refranchising in markets like Europe and Africa, which includes the planned creation of Coca-Cola European Partners in Western Europe and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in Southern and Eastern Africa. Coca-Cola European Partners is a merger of three European bottlers including Coca Cola Enterprises, Inc.  . Coca-Cola will own an 18% stake in Coca-Cola European Partners and 11% in the new African bottler. In China, it has agreed to refranchise its company-owned bottling operations to its existing partners, COFCO and Swire.Coca-Cola's transformative global re-franchising initiatives would boost margins and returns as well as ensure solid growth, despite hurting sales/profits in the near term.Coca-Cola is also pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits. Coca-Cola acquired a stake and signed a deal with Monster Beverage Corporation  in Jun 2015 to distribute Monster products in additional territories.

These strategic investments will help the company to diversify beyond its calorie-loaded sparkling beverages and improve growth prospects.However, Coca-Cola's top line needs to show sustained acceleration. Though markets like North America, Japan and India are consistently strong, continued weakness in some emerging markets like China, Russia and Brazil is holding back significant sales acceleration.

The company is in the process of launching Monster in China later this year in partnership with Coca-Cola System, which we believe is good strategic move and should drive sales and profits further.

In the first quarter of 2016, the company launched Gronk energy drink and Salted Caramel Java Monster. The company intends to launch a new Mutant, a refreshment energizer in the third quarter of 2016. The introduction of these new products will also benefit from the broader distribution network as a result of the Coca-Cola deal.However major headwinds including unfavorable currency translations and the transitional impact of the Coca-Cola deal continue to hurt profits.

Source: For starters, there is the obvious double-digit decline suffered by AAPL stock after  . There's also the first-ever quarter-over-quarter revenue decline, the fact that Carl Icahn has announced he's selling the stock and other general headlines about Apple being past its prime.But rather than trot out another tired story about what is wrong with Apple, it's worth exploring what investors should do with their money if the tech giant is not a viable investment for the time being.After all, kicking AAPL when it's down doesn't get your portfolio anywhere. The real thing you should be doing is moving your money into better investments, with bright growth prospects and a chance of outperformance in 2016 and beyond.That's exactly what these five stocks offer. Unlike Apple, the fundamentals are looking good and investors can have confidence buying these picks now. If you keep waiting for  (NASDAQ:  ) to cool off before buying in, you're going to be waiting quite a long time. The most recent proof: Shares gapped up last week on an impressive earnings report, putting the social media giant at a 12.7% gain so far in 2016 vs. just 1% for the broader stock market.The reasons for the enthusiasm were warranted, but familiar. Facebook  its already mammoth user base grew 15% year-over-year to 1.65 billion monthly active users, and FB stock saw advertising revenue jump 57% and saw net income soar by 195%.The company continues to profit even as it moves steadily off desktops and onto smartphones, too, with mobile advertising revenue a whopping 82% of total sales, up from 73% last year. Not many companies have been able to fluidly make the move away from PCs into a mobile experience without sacrificing margins, but Facebook has made it look easy.The growth has been impressive thus far, and with big efforts cooking like continued content integration and even experimentation with virtual reality, investors can be sure that Facebook isn't peaking or losing steam in 2016.

Younger consumers still want their caffeine but aren't drinking coffee or traditional drinks as much, trading up for products like Monster.MNST continues to capitalize on a strong brand, with  posting 16% sales growth and a 50% jump in net income to top expectations. Shares surged by double-digits as a result.The fundamentals were strong, but what really had Monster investors excited was the company's plan to use its growing cash stockpile to repurchase $2 billion shares and help drive continued earnings expansion going forward.Monster stock has been troublesome for many investors, since the big gap higher after earnings really just brought the company back to where it started the year. However, a strong history of growth will continue to power this consumer name going forward and a robust repurchase plan is sure to sweeten the pot.Piper Jaffray in Brazil and Mexico, and most of those polled were not only aware of Netflix, but intended to subscribe.

But while shares are now off about 20% year-to-date in 2016, these kind of short-term pullbacks are not uncommon for NFLX as it has mounted a consistent multiyear uptrend that is among the most envied on Wall Street.Consider that even amid recent headwinds, NFLX stock is up 160% in the last five years vs. just 55% for the  . And since 2008, shares are up roughly 20-fold!That's because while the recent pace of growth isn't as grand as some had hoped, the long-term uptrend is simply amazing.

So even though the Netflix hype machine got a bit ahead of itself in recent months, investors should not doubt the long-term success of this growth stock. (NASDAQ:  ) is one of those stocks that, like Netflix, is no stranger to volatility even as it has put up impressive growth metrics over the last several years. But unlike NFLX, Amazon stock has clearly returned to favor with investors, rallying 10% on its latest That enthusiasm is quite warranted, given the fundamentals. With 28% revenue growth and a soundly profitable quarter thanks to the high-margin and high-growth cloud business of Amazon Web Services, there's a lot to like about AMZN even if the bears like to kick and scream about valuation.Here's the thing about Amazon: The growth is real, and the company is consistent with its long-term march towards dominance. And while it's tempting to make any manner of AMZN stock comparisons - with retailers like  (NYSE:  ), with cloud stocks like  (NYSE:  ), even with aforementioned streaming video giant Netflix - the reality is that there is no other company like Amazon.com on the planet.What you're betting on is, really, Jeff Bezos & Co. and this management team's ability to find new and innovative ways to grow and prosper.Investors should take that bet, based on five-year returns of almost 250% and 10-year returns of over 1,800%. While growth investors tend to fall in love with tech companies,  ,  (NASDAQ:  ) is a specialty retailer that is worth consideration. That's because the nation's largest beauty retailer is a true growth story when you look at the numbers, and will rival any Silicon Valley firm with its performance.Just ask Louis Navellier, editor of  , who has been recommending ULTA stock since early last year and  , too.Revenue has more than doubled from under $1.8 billion in in fiscal 2012 to almost $4 billion last year, and profits have surged at an even higher rate.

Yet even Monster has had to deal with periodic setbacks that created pauses in its growth trajectory. Coming into Friday's first-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors were anxious to avoid the disappointing results that the company produced last quarter. Monster's actual performance during the first quarter was stellar, and investors immediately responded positively to the good news. Let's look more closely at the latest from Monster Beverage and see whether it can continue to produce similar growth in the future. Monster Beverage's first-quarter results made last quarter's poor performance look like a one-time aberration. Adjusted net sales jumped almost 16% to $680.2 million, doubling the pace of last quarter's growth and easily topping the 12% growth rate that most investors were hoping to see. Adjusted net income performed even better, jumping by almost half to $166.1 million. That produced adjusted earnings of $0.80 per share, compared to the $0.74 per share consensus forecast among investors.Looking more closely at Monster's figures, some of the same trends we've seen in past quarters continued. Currency-related issues once again hit Monster's results, but to a lesser extent than we've seen in recent reports. The company said that net sales took a $12.3 million hit, or less than two percentage points, because of the strong dollar. Overall, net sales to customers outside the U.S. rose at a much faster pace than domestic sales, jumping 32% and making up more than a fifth of Monster's total revenue.Monster's finished product segment sales were up 4.8% from the year-ago quarter, making up more than 90% of the company's overall revenue. Yet concentrate sales continued to boost sales, adding $55.9 million. However, because of the sales of non-energy-drink brands that Monster sold to  as part of its larger partnership with the beverage giant, Monster lost $31.3 million in sales that it brought in last year from those products.Key operating metrics were mixed to positive. Margin expansion came largely at the gross profit level, with the cost of sales actually declining slightly despite the big jump in revenue. Case volumes soared by more than a quarter to 72.7 million cases, but the average net sales per case fell 8% to $9.36 per case. Monster Beverage CEO Rodney Sacks mostly focused on operational successes. \"The integration of [American Fruits and Flavors] is proceeding in line with expectations,\" Sacks said, and \"we are pleased to note continued progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers internationally.\" The CEO pointed to deals for distribution in Australia and New Zealand as well as other locations across the globe, and U.S. bottlers have expanded distribution of Monster products.Monster also implemented the first part of its broader strategy to return capital to shareholders. The company announced that it would hold a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in common stock. The tender offer will use what's called a Dutch Auction process, whereby Monster will set a price range for accepting bids, and investors will be able to state the price at which they would be willing to sell their shares back to the company. This differs from a traditional stock repurchase program, in which the company simply goes into the open market to purchase shares from whichever investors happen to be selling them at the time. The Dutch Auction has the benefit of allowing a large one-time transaction without unpredictable market movements, and it also raises the visibility of the buyback.Investors in Monster Beverage were happy with the results and tender offer, sending the stock soaring by 12% in early morning trading following the announcement. With its growth engines back and with benefits from its strategic partnerships starting to show themselves, investors are expecting to see more positive news from Monster in the future.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

If you can find a promising stock  its share price starts taking off, then you can capture most of its gains for yourself. That can produce wealth that will truly change your life.To find those stocks, you can't simply turn to the past to see which stocks have already produced those returns. After all, stocks can only climb so far, and companies that have already gone through massive growth spurts won't necessarily be able to keep up the pace and duplicate their past efforts. Nevertheless, by seeing which companies were most successful in past years, you can identify attributes that winning stocks share, and that can make it easier for you to find  winning stocks before the rest of the investing crowd discovers them. When you look at a list of some of the best-performing stocks of the past decade, you'll find some clues you can use in your search for new winners.Below, you'll find 10 stocks that have managed to produce returns of more than 500% since mid-2006. I selected this list from some of the best-performing picks of The Motley Fool's  and  newsletters, and although some of those picks were made within the past decade, all of them were still recommended stocks as of the writing of this article.\n  \nSource:  .*Tesla's return and market cap figures are measured using its closing price on first day following IPO in June 2010.When you look closely at this list, there are a couple of things that stand out. All of these stocks are now household names among investors, offering products and services that millions of people rely on in their everyday lives. The rise of the Internet has made Priceline, Baidu, Netflix, and Amazon go-to sources for information, entertainment, and retail goods across the globe. The mobile revolution has lifted Apple from the ashes to become the most valuable company on the planet. Trends toward healthier living have shifted demand toward the athletic apparel that Nike and Under Armour offer, and changes in eating habits have pushed customers toward the socially conscious Chipotle while transforming the beverage industry away from carbonated soft drinks toward the energy drinks that Monster Beverage makes.But back in 2006, the story was a lot different. Apple, Amazon, and Nike were all well-established companies a decade ago, and they already had captured a core audience that they used as a foundation to build further growth. You'll now find all three stocks among the most valuable in the stock market, and their brand names have played a vital role in fostering their growth.Apart from those three companies, the other entries on this list were all solidly in what we would call the mid-cap stock category, with market capitalizations between roughly $1 billion and $3 billion. Focusing on mid-caps can serve as a useful filter, because in many ways, mid-cap stocks offer the best of both worlds. On one hand, mid-cap stocks have already established themselves as players in their respective industries, rising from the ranks of smaller companies to stand apart and demonstrate their competitive advantages over their peers. Yet on the other hand, mid-cap stocks haven't yet achieved the size of large-cap stocks, and they therefore have plenty of potential growth left in them for new investors to reap. Moreover, they tend to get less attention from Wall Street analysts, making it more likely that you can make discoveries that others won't notice until the companies have achieved much greater success.The other thing that most of these stocks have in common is that they've suffered major declines at various points, only to rise stronger than ever. Netflix and Priceline both came back from the brink of extinction on occasion, and even Apple seemed to become irrelevant in the early 2000s before the launch of the iPod. Chipotle is going through a tough period right now, dealing with the aftermath of foodborne illness in some of its restaurants, but the strongest companies find ways to bounce back from adversity. Therefore, once you find a winning stock, it's important to hang onto it. You might make a quick profit by selling early, but you risk missing out on the huge gains that can truly make a difference in your wealth.To win at investing, find great stocks and stick with them for the long run. By looking at undiscovered companies in promising new areas, you'll give yourself the best chance to buy stocks that will appear on this list a decade from now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This sector, which has its lifeblood vested in consumer behavior, seems to be gaining from the increase in gross domestic product (up 1.4%), a favorable job scenario, heightened consumer confidence and constant housing market recovery.Per the latest  (as of Apr 27, 2016), nearly 40.6% of the consumer staples companies have already reported their first-quarter results, out of which 84.6% beat earnings and 61.5% surpassed revenue estimates. However, total earnings for these companies slipped 0.7%, with revenues sliding 7.3% year over year.Among these companies, we saw leading names like PepsiCo Inc.  and The Coca-Cola Company  deliver solid Q1 results recently. Despite soft demand for their sugary sodas, currency headwinds and sluggishness in the core emerging markets, these soft drink behemoths' bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, thereby bringing the sector into the limelight.Overall, the sector is currently expected to see a 0.5% drop in earnings and a 4% fall in sales in first-quarter 2016, comparing favorably with respective declines of 6.3% and 7.9% witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2015.Let's see what these consumer staples stocks, slated to release Q1 earnings on Apr 29, have in store.Marketer and distributor of energy drinks and alternative beverages -  is set to report first-quarter 2016 results.

Further, the company's gross margins have been benefiting from strong product sales and favorable segment mix. Moreover, the price increases and lower raw materials costs have been boosting the gross margin for a while now, and we expect the trend to continue.Despite these positives, Monster Beverage's growing international presence remains a concern as it exposes the company to currency exchange risks, which may weigh on its sales and profits.

Further, Newell's practice of strengthening its portfolio through strategic acquisitions and reducing activities with marginal profitability bodes well.

Let's take a look at MNST's recent quarterly announcements, Monster's price chart and what, if anything, the options market is estimating in front of the earnings report.In front of Friday's Q1 earnings release,  , an increase of over 20% from a year ago.Range views are 67 cents to 83 cents and current estimates compare to last quarter's profit miss of 68 cents, which fell short of Street views by 16.8%.Street estimates for MNST's full-year 2016 earnings are pegged at $3.85 and would represent an increase of nearly 29% if achieved.Monster Beverage's sales are expected to climb by 12% from the year-ago period's $587 million to $659 million and rise by 2% from last quarter's revenue miss of $645 million.Looking further out, analysts expect full-year sales of $3 billion for MNST stock, an increase of 11% over 2015's $2.7 billion.Over the past couple years  regarding earnings versus Street views. Monster's profits have beat forecasts on five occasions, or 42% of the time, while coming up short 58% of the time, or on seven reports.On the other hand, investor reaction in MNST stock has proven generally more supportive of bullish positioning.Shares of Monster have produced one-day reactions of -1.74%, 13.61%, 2.97%, -10.47%, 13.13% and 7.87% over the past several quarters, favoring bulls.Actual price movement in MNST stock has produced an average increase of 2.35%, but sporting a fairly significant one standard deviation of 9.05%.Notably, the seven-period stock performance calculation in MNST has been more bullish for investors. Over the last several quarters shares have moved higher by 4% with a tighter one standard deviation of 8.25%.Technically, MNST stock appears to favor bears. Our eye on lower prices in shares of Monster Beverage is based on confirmed pattern resistance and its downward and recently crossed RSI indicator.Looking at the weekly price chart, Monster Beverage has carved out a lower high, stymied by resistance from the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, MNST's 200-day simple moving average and a smoothed, upward-sloping channel line, which makes an allowance for the August flash crash.As with any price chart, there's always the other side to consider and shares of Monster are no different.Currently, MNST bulls may find support from an existing double bottom. The formation developed off the August flash crash low, 38% retracement level and the more recent February low forged during the market correction.Monster Beverage ended Wednesday trading off by about 0.28% at $123.43. In front of Friday's report, options traders are pricing in a 68% chance MNST will remain within a range of $102 to $133 through expiration in two days.The math behind the MNST stock range calculation is based on the weeklys at-the-money April 29 $123 straddle market and implieds of 118%.The pricing of the Monster straddle is the purest play on the earnings event and tells us what traders collectively expect from MNST shares in the immediate aftermath of its quarterly announcement.The expected dollar move up or down works out to 8.7% by Friday's close. Based on recent price reactions, a move of this magnitude would be volatile, but statistically within the normal range of expected outcomes. .The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is set to report first-quarter and fiscal 2016 resultson Apr29, before market opens. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 18.29%.The company's earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 8.91%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Monster Beverage's revenues in the first quarter of 2016 are expected to gain from the new products launched in the U.S. over the past few quarters, solid international sales and growing momentum of the energy drink category.Gross margins are benefiting from strong product sales and a favorable segment mix. The brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company  , which are produced as concentrates or beverage bases are high-margin products that make significant positive contribution to sales and gross margins.Moreover, the price increases and lower cost of certain raw materials also drove gross margins in the past quarters. We expect the trend to continueHowever, Monster Beverage generates more than 20% of its consolidated gross sales outside the U.S. The growing international presence is exposing the company to currency exchange risks, which in turn is hurting its sales and profits.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Monster Beverage is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Monster Beverage' Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus estimate stand at 75 cents. Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP, however, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Here are some companies in the broader food sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:The Hershey Company  has an Earnings ESP of +2.86% and a Zacks Rank #3.Pinnacle Foods Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +5.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Having started from modest beginnings as the maker of Hansen Natural soda products, Monster has become one of the leading energy-drink makers in the world, attracting the interest of soft-drink giant  as a partner. Yet coming into its first-quarter financial report on Friday, Monster Beverage investors are nervous that disappointing results from the fourth quarter of 2015 might persist into 2016, and the stock has been under pressure all year. Let's take an early look at what's been going on with Monster Beverage and whether investors will be happy with what it says in its report.\n  \nSource: Yahoo! Finance. In recent months, investors have cut their views on Monster Beverage earnings, reducing their first-quarter projections by a nickel per share and their full-year 2016 estimates by almost double that amount. The stock has done poorly, falling 12% since late January.Monster's fourth-quarter results played a role in holding the stock back during the quarter. Revenue growth was extremely slow, coming in at less than 7% despite a long history of double-digit growth. Net income rose 11%, but an increase in shares outstanding made earnings per share actually decline from 2014's fourth quarter. Foreign-currency weakness and the one-time impact of a pricing increase were partially responsible for the poor financial performance, and Monster also said that integrating its partnership with Coca-Cola created some disruptions as well. Yet drops in average sales price offset gains in volume, and Monster investors seemed uncertain whether the future would bring a bounce or further deterioration in the company's fundamentals.But another aspect of Monster's performance has come from mixed reviews from those following the stock. During the quarter, analysts at Merrill Lynch started covering the energy-drink giant, setting a price target that implied further share-price appreciation but rating the company neutral because of its fairly rich earnings multiple. Still, peers at  put Monster Beverage on its conviction buy list, citing potential growth in the U.S. and international markets as well as potential upcoming products in the energy-water and sports-drink space.An essential component of ensuring Monster's future success will be locking in strong relationships with bottling companies, and Monster is optimistic about how that process has been going. In last quarter's conference call, CEO Rodney Sacks reported good progress toward implementing agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide, pointing specifically to Russia, Turkey, Australia, and several countries in Europe and Southeast Asia as having already been completed. Further progress on key relationships in South America, Africa, and China was also good news, and although it may take longer than many had thought, investors should look for further news on the bottling front to see where Monster stands currently.In the Monster Beverage report, investors should look at the beverage company's overall numbers, but also take a look for early signs of success from Monster's recent acquisition of American Fruits & Flavors. Monster is counting on the buyout to produce some additional earnings in 2016, and the clarification of the long relationship between the two companies could create some new opportunities that would be exciting for investors. If Monster demonstrates a newfound spirit of innovation and purpose, then its shares could easily earn back the ground they've lost and start marching higher again.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

However, soda volumes declined in the quarter.Moreover, despite the strong first-quarter results, Coca-Cola maintained its previously issued guidance for 2016 amid a volatile macro outlook. Notably, PepsiCo, Inc.  , which reported earlier this week, also reiterated its full-year outlook despite recording better-than-expected first-quarter results.This probably hurt investor sentiment leading to a more than 1% share price decline in  .First-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of the company were 45 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents by 2.3%.Earnings declined 4% year over year as a strong dollar eroded the value of Coca-Cola's overseas sales. Excluding the 12% negative Fx impact, earnings rose 8% on the back of improved organic growth and higher operating margins.Earnings have been adjusted mainly to incorporate charges related to the North American re-franchising initiative and costs associated with productivity program. Including these, reported earnings were 34 cents per share, down 4% year over year.Net revenue declined 4% year over year to $10.28 billion due to currency headwinds and one less selling day in the quarter.Currency headwinds hurt sales by 5%, in line with management's expectations. With more than half of its revenues coming from outside the U.S., Coca-Cola's sales/profits were affected by the strengthening U.S. dollar.After adjusting for the impact of currency and slightly negative impact of acquisitions/divestitures, organic revenues rose 2%, better than a decline of 2% in the previous quarter. Organic revenues improved across almost all segments. Revenues also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.26 billion by 0.2%.Adjusted consolidated gross margins contracted 150 basis points (bps) year over year to 60.1% as positive pricing and productivity gains were offset by currency headwinds. Gross margins rose 60 bps sequentially.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses declined 4% on a currency-neutral basis to $3.77 billion.Adjusted operating income, on a constant currency basis, was $2.45 billion, up 7% year over year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, up 30 bps year over year as lower gross margins were offset by strong cost management and productivity gains. Operating margins rose 370 bps sequentially.Profit-before-tax (PBT) declined 5% to $2.58 billion. Currency translations hurt PBT by 12% as expected. Structural changes had a negative impact of 1% on PBT, less than an impact of 2% as estimated. Excluding currency headwinds and structural changes, PBT rose 9% due to higher organic revenues and operating income, increased equity income and favorable timing of expenses.Coca-Cola witnessed 2% volume growth in the first quarter, less than 3% in the previous quarter due to slower sparkling beverage volumes. However, still beverages volumes rose amid growing demand for ''healthier'' drinks.Sparkling beverage volumes remained flat compared with 3% growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. Still beverages grew 7% in terms of volume, higher than 6% growth the previous quarter. Positive growth in all categories, except juice and juice drinks which declined marginally in the quarter, drove the upside.In North America, volumes grew 2%, less than 3% growth in the previous quarter, due to softer volumes of sparkling sodas. Sparkling soda volumes were flat in the quarter as against a 2% increase in the previous quarter. Pepsi's carbonated soft drink volumes also declined 2% in the first quarter. Sales of sodas of these bigwigs are being hurt by lower demand due to increasing health consciousness among consumers.Among other developed nations, volumes improved in Japan but deteriorated in Europe. European volumes declined 1% as against 3% growth in the previous quarter. Japan volumes rose 4% better than 3% decline in the third quarter.Among the developing countries, double-digit growth in India and 5% growth in Mexico was offset by declines in Brazil, Russia and China. The company saw 2% decline in volumes in China as against a 1% increase in the last quarter.Price/mix increased 1% compared with a 2% rise in the previous quarter as pricing gains were partially offset by unfavorable segment mix.The company re-affirmed the previously issued 2016 outlook.Organic revenues are expected to be up 4-5% in 2016, in line with the company's long-term target of a mid single-digit increase. Acquisitions/divestitures (mainly the bottler re-franchising efforts) are expected to hurt revenues by 4-5%, while Fx is expected to have a negative impact of 2-3% (previously 4%) on revenues.Excluding currency headwinds and structural changes, PBT is expected to increase 6-8%, in line with long-term estimations.Foreign exchange is expected to hurt both PBT and EPS by 8-9% (previously 9%). Structural changes are expected to have a 3-4% negative impact on both PBT and EPS, primarily due to accelerated re-franchising.In 2016, the adjusted constant currency earnings per share are expected to increase 4-6%. However, the guidance includes 3-4% negative impact from structural changes.The company expects to buy back shares worth $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion in 2016. Adjusted effective tax rate is likely to be 22.5%.2015 was a \"transition year\" for Coca-Cola because of the changes implemented to create a new operating model. The company implemented aggressive cost-cutting measures and several initiatives to drive growth during the year. The resultant savings are being deployed to fund marketing programs and in innovations to re-accelerate top-line growth, margin expansion and returns on capital. Other than aggressively cutting costs, the initiative includes disciplined brand and growth investments as well as aligning incentive plans.Coca-Cola is also refranchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories to create a more efficient system. Over 50% of the U.S. territories have already been or agreed to be refranchised so far. It plans to refranchise all its company-owned North American bottling territories by the end of 2017.Concurrent with the earnings release, Coca-Cola announced that a new bottler owned by former NBA player \"Junior\" Bridgemam\" will join the U.S. Coca-Cola system by acquiring territories in the Midwest. In addition, Coca-Cola said that three existing bottlers signed letters of intent to expand their territories.The company is also focused on refranchising in markets like Europe and Africa which include the planned creation of Coca-Cola European Partners in Western Europe - merger of three European bottlers including Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.  and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in Southern and Eastern Africa. In China, it has agreed to refranchise its company-owned bottling operations to its existing partners, COFCO and Swire.Coca-Cola's transformative global re-franchising initiatives should boost margins and returns as well as ensure solid growth, despite hurting sales/profits in the near term.Coca-Cola's productivity and strategic initiatives led to better-than-expected results in 2015 - the transition year - positioning it well for 2016. Its stepped-up marketing investments and supported improved volume growth in 2015, especially in North America.In addition, Coca-Cola has made equity investments in smaller companies like Monster Beverage Corporation  , to enhance growth in key categories.Currently, Coca-Cola has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Source: Long gone are the days when beverage-makers could inject their cans and bottles full of sugar. Americans today are more health-conscious, focusing their fire on companies like  (  ) that have been blamed for contributing to rising rates of obesity.Since 1998, soda and orange juice sales  25% and 45%, respectively.In many cases, the beverage-makers are being forced to adapt to the new reality they face. With investors demanding growth, companies like  (  ) are looking into the creation of new brands and product positioning in hopes of scoring big in an already saturated market.That said, consumers are becoming interested in non-GMO products such as a line of  juices and organic  that are likely to be debuted sometime this year.To reduce calorie consumption without losing sales, beverage companies like Pepsi and Coke are also offering smaller containers.In keeping with the American Beverage Association's goal to cut calories 20% by 2025, serving smaller cans and bottles achieves the objective without having to rework the recipe using less sugar.With these challenges and more, let's use  to see where some of the major players have been and where their stock prices are likely to go over the next few months or so.Coca-Cola has held firm over the past year, slowly gaining momentum off of its mid-September 2015 price lows and again with a break above its 50-day moving average in early February this year.Utilizing  Technical Event Lookup feature, three bullish technical events appear (MACD, Double Moving Average Crossover (21-week above 50-week) and an intermediate-term KST).The first of these events triggered back on Oct. 2 last year when KO was trading for $40.39 per share. At the current price of $46.51, investors would have pocketed a 15.15% return, plus the 2.88% dividend payout rate just for holding onto the stock.PepsiCo still appears range-bound, but the situation could change based on the higher highs we're seeing in KO.The good news is that the  signaled two bullish events to start the year where the stock crossed above the 50-week moving average on Jan. 29 and then crossed above the all-important 200-day moving average on Feb. 12. tells us that we should keep an eye on intermediate-term support at $100 below and also resistance found at $103.20. Should PEP's price break above key resistance on better-than-average volume, we would consider it a significant breakout move.On the other hand,  (  ) is in the later stages of its major bull run (if it hasn't ended already), which began in late 2008 back when the stock was trading for a paltry sum of about $10 per share.This makes sense given that the energy drink is a relative newcomer to the stage and experiencing growth that far outpaces the more established brands of Pepsi and Coca-Cola.But having climbed so far and so fast, the bulls are showing signs of fatigue. Although shares have recently found a way to get back above the 50-day moving average, MNST still trades below its longer-term 50-week and 200-day moving averages.But back on Nov. 30 last year, investors who had signed up to receive  event alerts were given a major bearish signal when the KST oscillator broke down. With shares trading at the event price of $154.61 closer to the peak, those who took profits or shorted the stock are more than pleased.On the latter point, anyone betting that the stock would fall saw shares hit a February low of $113.08 for gains up to 26.86% inside of three months.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Corporate debt - it's totally out of control, and like with regular Americans when it comes to personal debt, U.S. companies will have difficulties digging out from under this record level of maturing debt. Source: Standard & Poor's Ratings Direct recently studied this and found that $4.1 trillion in U.S. corporate debt is due to mature by 2020. Further, American companies account for 43% of the maturing global debt.Is it manageable? The experts say yes but there are risks.\"A range of macroeconomic factors will make it more difficult for lower-rated companies to tap the debt capital markets in order to refinance their debt obligations,\" Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst Tiina Siilaberg said recently.The maturing debt problem suggests it's time for American corporations to slim down and get their debt under control.

About $700 million of that is for its purchase of  , its formerly external flavor supplier, which secures the intellectual property for its energy drinks and, more importantly, increases its attractiveness to its bigger competitors.After securing its future for $700 million, it still has $2.2 billion either sitting in the bank or earning a small amount of interest. To put this cash to better use, in February it announced a new $1.75 billion share repurchase program in addition to the $250 million remaining on its previous $500 million program.Normally I'm not a big fan of share repurchases because companies generally do a terrible job buying back their own stock. But given its strength as an independent energy drink maker -  (  ) does own 17% - it's hard to imagine it making a big acquisition of another beverage company.AFF was an exception to the rule.With M&A effectively out of the picture and no debt to pay down, its only other option aside from buybacks is to start paying a dividend. With operating income generally growing by 15% to 20% annually, its days as a growth company haven't come to an end just yet.Coke is the obvious business to acquire MNST at some point in the future, so it's unlikely that a bidding war would emerge for the company although you never know until you try.Until management does look for a buyer, a dividend would be a nice gesture. On the other hand, knowing it's going to be taken out at some point, the tax-free nature of share repurchases makes an awful lot of sense in this example.No debt. No worries. (  ) is a company I've admired for some time. But it wasn't always this way.Back in 2011, I recommended to investors that they go with  (  ) over ULTA because SBH had a more sustainable business model. Two years later I completely changed my tune.What happened to switch my view? Nothing really.The big problem, I thought to myself in 2013, was that ULTA stock was all over the place. One minute it was up and the next minute it was down. Over a two-year period, I counted no less than eight declines of 10% or more. Volatility like that will break even the most seasoned of investors.But for those who could look beyond its volatility and work with and not against those 10% declines, the future would be bright indeed. Since June 20, 2013, when I made my positive recommendation on ULTA stock, it's up more than 100%, compared to 8.6% for SBH and 26.7% for the  (  ).And why not? It has got a flawless balance sheet with year-over-year comps that are growing by double digits. Its Q3 report saw e-commerce sales grow by 56.3% to $46.2 million, adding 190 basis points to the company's comparable sales increase of 12.8% in the quarter.In 2013,  contributor Herb Greenberg had a problem with e-commerce because of the razor-thin margins.  \"To keep profits moving in the right direction, it has to have an e-commerce platform,\" I said at the time. \"No ifs, and's, or buts.\"E-commerce revenues broached $200 million in fiscal 2015.What's not to like? While I'm tempted to go with  (  ) because it has got a great product that's changed how surgery is performed, I couldn't very well leave  (  ) off the list given I've written not  , but  positive stories about FB stock in the last month.I can remember a good friend asking me prior to the Facebook IPO in 2012 if he should buy its stock once it started trading; he asked me the same thing about  (  ,  ). When Google went public I simply shrugged my shoulders and said, \"I don't know anything about online advertising or SEO but they do make money.\" Not exactly a strong endorsement. Needless to say, he didn't buy.So, when he asked me about Facebook I was hell bent on being more emphatic in my answer. I told him that IPOs often trade below their issue price within 12-24 months of going public. For a second time, my opinion included the caveat that it made good money. Again, my friend didn't buy, but at least this time, it did what I said it could do and dropped below $38.Today, he's not likely to ask me if he should buy either stock, and I'm left touting the earnings quality of Facebook.

The company implemented aggressive cost-cutting measures and several initiatives to drive growth during the year. Coca-Cola aims to achieve total annualized productivity of approximately $3.6 billion by 2019 backed by the initiatives implemented under its re-structuring program since it began in 2012.Coca-Cola's re-structuring program focuses on initiatives like restructuring the global supply chain including optimization of the manufacturing footprint in North America, investing in technology to streamline operations, implementing a zero-based budgeting program, headcount reductions and driving increased efficiency in direct marketing investments. The resultant savings are being used to fund marketing programs and innovation to re-accelerate top-line growth, margin expansion and returns on capital.Other than aggressively cutting costs, the initiative includes disciplined brand and growth investments as well as aligning incentive plans.Coca-Cola is also refranchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories to create a more efficient system. Over 45% of the U.S. territories have already been refranchised. It plans to refranchise all its company-owned North American bottling territories by the end of 2017.In many international markets, Coca-Cola has been divesting and merging many bottling operations since 2014 to revamp the bottling system and thereby improve margins and drive growth. Three of its European bottlers - Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.  Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetr\u00e4nke AG (German bottler) - will merge to form a new Western European bottler named Coca-Cola European Partners.Also, the company has entered into an agreement with beer and beverage company, SABMiller, and partner Gutsche Family Investments, to merge their bottling operations in Southern and East Africa and form the largest Coca-Cola bottling entity in Africa. While Coca-Cola will own 18% in Coca-Cola European Partners, it will have 11% stake in the new African bottler. In China, it has agreed to refranchise its company-owned bottling operations to its existing partners, COFCO and Swire.The company has also created the National Product Supply System (NPSS) to strengthen and streamline the U.S. production volume that will lower costs, enhance investments and facilitate innovation.The refranchising efforts will lead to higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital over the long term, though at the cost of near-term sales/profits.Coca-Cola is also pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits. Coca-Cola acquired a stake and signed a deal with Monster Beverage Corporation  in Jun 2015 to distribute Monster products into additional territories. This will allow Coca-Cola to compete more effectively in the global energy category.Coca-Cola has also signed a distribution agreement with Suja, a high growth organic cold-pressed juice company to gain a foothold in this new growing market. In China, the company has invested in the plant-based protein drinks platform through the acquisition of the beverage business of China Green Culiangwang Beverages Holdings.In early 2016, Coca-Cola acquired 40% stake in Chi Limited, Nigeria's leading value-added dairy and juice company, to penetrate further into the energy juice and value-added dairy categories. These strategic investments will help the company to diversify beyond its calorie-loaded CSDs and improve growth prospects.Coca-Cola's productivity and strategic initiatives led to better-than-expected results in 2015 - the transition year - positioning it well for 2016. Its stepped-up marketing investments supported improved volume growth in 2015, especially in North America.Despite all the efforts, Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) as the improvement seen in 2015 has to be maintained. The global macroeconomic environment is likely to remain volatile in 2016, thereby making sales growth difficult. While the macro environment is improving in the U.S., management expects persistent challenges in many key emerging/developing markets like Brazil, Russia and China. Moreover, weak CSD volumes and currency headwinds remain challenges.A beverage stock worth considering is Cott Corporation  with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This segment includes brands acquired from Coca-Cola. Net sales of the segment were $60.4 million in the fourth quarter of 20Array5. This was the second time that the concentrate segment has reported full-quarter results, which is why there is no comparable figure from the preceding quarters. During fourth quarter 20Array5, there were no sales from the segment compared to net sales of $30.8 million in the prior-year quarter. This was because of the closure of the Coca-Cola transaction in June.Fourth quarter 20Array5 gross margin rose 770 basis points (bps) to 62.5%.

Yet even with its key partnership with beverage giant  , Monster still has to produce the growth that investors are looking for. Coming into Thursday's fourth-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors wanted to see continued strong increases in revenue and profits, but what Monster provided fell well short of their expectations. Let's take a closer look at what Monster Beverage did to close 2015 and whether it can get back its lost momentum in 2016. Monster Beverage's fourth-quarter results stood in stark contrast to the healthy performance that the energy-drink specialist gave investors last quarter. Net sales grew less than 7% to $645.4 million, which was less than half the ambitious 15% growth rate that investors had wanted to see. The news on the bottom line was even more concerning. Net income picked up 11% to $140.9 million, but a big increase in outstanding share counts pushed earnings per share  from year-ago levels to $0.68. That missed the consensus forecast by $0.14 per share.Taking a closer look at Monster's figures, a couple of factors directly affected results. First, the strong dollar hit net sales, although the impact was just $19.7 million, or about 3 percentage points. Second, just as Monster got a boost in the third quarter from customers who chose to stock up prior to an anticipated April 31 price increase on energy drinks, the company felt the negative payback this quarter, and it said that the move probably cost it $11 million, or just under 2 percentage points, in net sales.Looking at its segments, finished product sales climbed 1.8%, while concentrate sales added another $60 million to total revenue. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were up almost 9% to $145.3 million, pointing to the popularity of energy drinks internationally. Gross margins climbed almost eight percentage points to 62.5%, and a nearly full-percentage-point drop in distribution costs likely stemmed from the Coca-Cola partnership. Yet big increases in overhead and marketing expenses ate into profits.Monster Beverage saw mixed performance in its key business metrics were once again mixed. Case sales jumped 15% to 67.5 million. But average sales price fell 7.5% to $9.56 per case, offsetting much of the volume gains. Monster Beverage CEO Rodney Sacks blamed some of the ongoing issues in its work with Coca-Cola and non-Coca-Cola distribution methods for parts of the shortfall. \"Distributor transitions and uncertainties in portions of our international non-Coca-Cola distribution network limited further revenue growth during the quarter,\" Sacks said. Yet the CEO did say that Monster Beverage has been able to reach agreement with many Coca-Cola bottlers for distribution.More interesting than the quarterly earnings results was Monster Beverage's announcement earlier in the week that it had acquired American Fruits & Flavors for $690 million. The deal brings the primary supplier of flavoring under Monster's corporate umbrella, and that will allow greater certainty about the future of Monster's intellectual property and ability to keep manufacturing its products without any possibility of a breakup. It also gives Monster Beverage the capacity to try out new flavors in the future, something that could prove increasingly necessary as it fights against Red Bull and other energy-drink competitors.Investors in Monster Beverage didn't like its short-term results, sending the stock down 7% in the first 30 minutes of after-hours trading following the announcement. Monster still is well positioned to benefit from further growth in energy drinks, but its latest results point to possible limits to the growth in that market that could put a ceiling on future share-price gains in the immediate future.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The deal includes territories in Washington (including the cities of Seattle and Spokane), Idaho and Oregon (including the city of Portland). In addition, Swire will acquire cold-fill production facilities in these areas. Last year, Swire had agreed to take over territories in Arizona and Colorado.Swire Coca-Cola, USA is a subsidiary within Swire Pacific's Beverages Division. The latter manufactures, markets and distributes Coca-Cola products in Hong Kong, Taiwan, certain provinces of Mainland China and an extensive area of the Western U.S.Also, Coca-Cola reached definitive agreements with Great Lakes Coca-Cola Distribution LLC, a Rosemont, IL-based Reyes Holdings company, to take over facilities in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan and Iowa as per letters of intent signed last year.Coca-Cola is refranchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories to create a more efficient system. Earlier this month, the company declared that it will complete the remaining re-franchising of North American bottling operations by the end of 20Array7, much before 2020 as previously expected. The latest plans include the sale of the remaining 39 North American cold-fill production facilities which produce both still and sparkling beverages. Coca-Cola will retain ownership of the hot-fill facilities, which will supply the entire North America Coca-Cola system.The first letters of intent were announced in 20Array3 and over 45% of the U.S. territories have already been refranchised.In many international markets, Coca-Cola has been divesting and merging many bottling operations since 20Array4 to revamp the bottling system and thereby improving margins and driving growth. Three of its European bottlers - Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.  , Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetr\u00e4nke AG - will merge to form a new Western European bottler named Coca-Cola European Partners.Also, the company has entered an agreement with beer and beverage company, SABMiller, and partner Gutsche Family Investments, to merge their bottling operations in Southern and East Africa and form the largest Coca-Cola bottling entity in Africa. While Coca-Cola will own Array8% in Coca-Cola European Partners, it will have an ArrayArray% stake in the new African bottler. In China, it has agreed to refranchise its company-owned bottling operations to its existing partners, COFCO and Swire.The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital over the long term.In addition to the accelerated re-franchising efforts both in the U.S. and international markets, Coca-Cola has made equity investments in smaller companies, like Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.  and Monster Beverage Corporation  to enhance growth in key categories.Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The stock is up 17% year to date, and in the past year COT has posted a 33% return, plus it throws off a respectable 1.9% dividend.The most interesting aspect of this well-mannered grower is, its growth is overlooked by many market analysts because it's not a  (  ) story of massive growth or an institutional story like  (  ) or  (  ).For example, did you know that COT can be found in 90% of the U.S. office coffee and water markets and is a leader in the sector in both Canada and the U.S.?Or that it's the first company to make a diet soft drink?Nowadays it's most famous because it's one of the top private-label makers of carbonated and noncarbonated soft drinks and juices - even energy drinks.It's everywhere, but you would never notice. And for COT stock that's just fine, because it means its business is doing well.The company started in the early 1950s in Quebec, but had some roots in the Northeast U.S. and Canada. But it was in the 2000s when COT decided to go big. It began acquiring smaller labels and building a base of operations across Canada, the U.S., the U.K. and Mexico.In early January this year, it bought AquaTerra, Canada's oldest and largest home and office water delivery business, for $62 million. It's a big deal for a $1.4 billion company like COT. But it isn't going to make many waves in the financial press since KO and PEP are more than 100x bigger than COT. Even MNST is 20x bigger.Again, it's keeping quiet and doing the work that needs to be done well, with no flash, no drama.But in a turbulent market like the one we're in now, COT is the kind of stock you want as ballast for your portfolio.Another plus is COT stock offers a dividend reinvestment plan (), so you can simply opt to have your dividends reinvested (instead disbursed) to buy more shares of COT stock.

Investors of all stripes are now clamoring to rebalance their portfolios. Everyone in the money management game is now facing up to the stark reality that has been altogether forgotten over the last seven years of \"straight-up\" euphoria:Yes, men with ponytails and screaming bald men on soapboxes have for years browbeat retail investors to buy stocks based on the principle that \"they are high, so they have to be going higher,\" ignoring underlying valuations. When that party ends, it ends fast, and as you've noticed, they don't ring a bell.Mr. Market has done a fine job in rebalancing a lot of the froth in the market. But we have identified one stock whose valuation - yes, valuation - is completely removed from reality considering the business risks and limited growth opportunities.We reintroduce the investing world to an old name that is worth a second look - Monster Beverage (  ).Shorts are sometimes right and sometimes wrong, but they are always early. The bear case thesis on Monster has been around for years. It used to focus on the headwinds of the energy drink business and the health risks of the product. All the while the price of MNST has continued to defy gravity - as if the stock drank four cans of its own product.We believe now is the time for both long and shorts to consider the real facts surrounding the business and consider the price of the stock within the perspective of current market conditions.Amped-up valuation: Over the past five years MNST's market valuation is up 500% while its revenues are up 90%.Let us start with the facts.Monster Beverage is not a technology company, nor is it scalable, and by no means can you ever call it disruptive (to your health maybe). Monster is not even the No. 1 player in the energy drink market. The Monster product is not even discernible to its customers as it is more about the marketing than the product... yet Wall Street has ignored reality.Look at the basic comparisons below. Wall Street is valuing Monster like a tech company, when in reality, it is a single product company selling sugar and caffeine water among many competitors whose business is only as strong as its marketing muscle.To illustrate how utterly ridiculous this is vs. other beverage companies, consider these comps.Dr. Pepper Snapple Group's valuation (  ) is 30% smaller than Monster's, despite boasting 100% more revenues and roughly 60% greater EBITDA than Monster.Valuing Monster comparable to DPS's multiple would result in 48% downside to Monster owners.We explain Monster's valuation disconnect with reality, demonstrating why Monster will trade down to $80.Coca Cola's buy-in may have temporarily validated Monster, but at a second look it's not as sweet as investors had imagined. After years of controversy, Coca Cola provided some much needed short-term validation in 2014 with its investment in MNST and as usual Wall Street overreacted.Since the transaction MNST stock price is up almost 100% while revenues are up only 10% (even less if you remove the Coca Cola energy drink brand revenues transferred to Monster).Now let's get back to reality.Coca Cola's investment is NOT the first step toward an eventual purchase. On the contrary, it's the opinion of Citron that this transaction eliminated the possibility of a future takeout and the premium that had always glimmered in the company's future. Coke used this transaction to quietly exit the energy drink business, distancing itself from the reputational risks of energy drinks to their own portfolio.(One hypothesis is that Coke's portfolio of energy drinks was never successful because its marketing is limited by its engagement in \"ethical\" advertising).This is how the transaction was structured. Coca Cola now has the benefits of participating in the energy drink business without the risk... something even Buffett and Ackman can agree on is a good thing. (  )In fact, if you take out the Coke products, Monster's minimal organic growth is not supportive of a company with this multiple.Here's the analysis in a single chart:The single graph that should give every MNST shareholder nightmares: Deriving Monster's organic growth from Coke's disclosures.Why an $80 Short - Target?In trying to find an honest comparable for Monster, Citron thinks Keurig Green Mountain Coffee (  ) is the ideal candidate. Both companies are high growth beverage companies who attracted sizable investments from Coca Cola.We would argue that GMCR is the higher quality business because it is the dominant leader in its category and its product produces recurring revenue through the sale of K-Cups. Given that powerful advantage to GMCR, below we present the comparison of MNST and GMCR on a pre- and post-takeout basis.If we chose to value MNST vs. Dr. Pepper Snapple, a more direct competitor, it would result in a 48% downside to Monster owners. For the sake of the benefit of the doubt we used the post GMCR takeout value as a benchmark to get to $80 a share for Monster.Monster has justified its double-digit growth story by teasing its next phase: China. Investor Meeting (Jan. 12, 2016):\"Reverting to probably what is our largest individual country opportunity is obviously the Chinese market.\"Wow! It's 2016 and Monster in finally entering China. Note: Monster Energy is not Facebook! For Monster, entering China commits them to an expensive brand-building exercise from the ground up, while selling their product at a price with significantly lower margins than afforded in the US. And their primary obstacle is established branded competitor Red Bull, which has been in China  . Not to mention we are skeptical about how popular the  will be with the Chinese Government. (Had to throw in the Monster Girls somewhere.)In Monster's own words (Investor Meeting - Jan. 12, 2016):\"They (Red Bull) have very, very much the lion's share of the market... But their pricing is at basically about $1 a can.\" : The days of justifying a stupid stock price based on \"entering\" China is soooooo 2009. Just look to the past to tell the future. Coca-Cola provides a meaningful example here.Coke bought Glaceau/Vitamin Water in 2008 as a U.S-only business. The rationale was their ability to leverage the asset with massive overseas market penetration, riding Coke's powerful distribution assets. Not to mention Glaceau had a wide array of energy drinks. But, despite Coke's distribution power, it has failed to grow its international market share for Vitamin Water meaningfully. International sales comprise only 12% of sales... after six years.So how can Monster's road in China be anything other than: high brand-building expense, low margins, and slow growth? Where is the Great Leap Forward in this plan?If there is one counter-argument to this whole piece that the bulls will counter with, it is the increased margin Monster's turned in last quarter.However, margins would not look so hot without Coca Cola's concentrate business: Here is a quick analysis for you bulls who will hold on to any outlandish justification for this crazy valuation.Note: the above margins are not adjusted for lower margin Monster non-energy drink assets, which were divested to Coke and are no longer a part of Monster's business (they are not disclosed). Refer to the important graph on 2015 Sales Growth to quantify the effect of the brand exchange with Coke, as derived from Coke's disclosures.Based off of these assets transfers, plus a price increase on Monster Energy drinks in the U.S., Monster hit high EBIT margins of 38% in Q3 2015 for the first time, despite hovering around 29%-31% for the last few years. The only way for analysts to justify their stock target is to have this company expanding margins while going into China - not happening.As we see the truth from Coca Cola.\"Gross profit will be negatively impacted, despite the structural benefit at net revenue, primarily due to the loss of concentrate profit on KO's legacy energy brand.\"This statement from Coca Cola makes clear that it offloaded its more profitable energy drink assets for non-energy drink assets, and that Monster will receive a one-time benefit from Coca Cola's energy drink assets, which are wasting assets.Analysts want investors to get excited about new products being launched by Monster. But let's be honest here. Rob Gronkowski is a great football player, but an energy drink call \"Gronk\" isn't exactly going to move the needle for a $30 billion company, and probably won't sell well to Giants or Jets fans. All new products introduced by Monster simply cannibalize the existing product line - this is not exactly Mondelez (  ).At the end of the day, Monster is not a product company with a broad suite of unique products. It is a marketing company that is trying to differentiate its brand from other similar products. As admitted by Goldman Sachs in a conference.Coke says: \"On the Monster program, we're extremely excited about that. I think Monster is a premier marketer.\" - Goldman Sachs Global Staples Summit May 5, 2015So a solid marketing company is worth a valuation that \"monsters\"its competitors? NO!Fund manager John Davies wrote an insightful article on Seeking Alpha that describes the declining growth of Monster Beverage, drawing scary comparisons to the wine cooler craze of the 1980s. This is required reading for investors. In the article Davies notes:(  )For the past seven years, Wall Street research analysts have practiced the dark art of justifying a sky-high stock price by back-filling their model to try and support a current nosebleed price level. The beverage analysts are no different.Not to pick on Goldman Sachs, but when you are the biggest, it is only inevitable. Last year Green Mountain Coffee hit the same exact stock price that MNST is currently trading (around $140). Goldman came out and stamped a $185 target on GMCR. Over the next nine months the stock plunged to $40 a share - 79% below Goldman's target, before a bail out by JAB at $90 (still over 50% below Goldman's peak target). Oh, by the way, the GMCR Goldman analyst is the same one covering MNST! The analysts could not have been more wrong. But we know ... this time it will be different. (  )The stock price of Monster Beverage has climbed as if its business has rid itself of all of the risks in that have shadowed the energy drink market for years - but in reality it has only gotten worse. Citron is not going to dedicate too much time going over the danger of energy drinks - the risk is self-evident and something that the bulls and bears can probably agree on.The risks are particularly high with respect to consumption by adolescents and young adults.And just to prove that we are not just relying on cheap sensationalistic news blips, we defer to a brand new study - just two-months-old - from the Mayo Clinic, published in the JAMA, that shows the dangers of drinking even one energy drink.(  )To read the findings of the investigations, see the appendix at the end of this story.Meanwhile, despite the health risks and governmental focus, Monster has continued to market its products aggressively to teens because it knows they are the lifeblood of its business. This is a CURRENT marketing campaign from Monster's own website... who do you think this targets?(  )For years, critics have thrown the concern about government regulation at Monster Beverage, and the company has obviously ignored the warnings. The fact that Monster continues this type of youth-oriented marketing only emphasizes how critically important the teen market is to their business model.Citron has seen this story before: government action is slow, but when they come down, it is for real. Look at the impacts on former Citron subjects Apollo Group (  ), Valeant (VRX) and World Acceptance (WRLD).Government regulation could take the form of one or more of these many actions, and they will impact Monster's bottom line:While it does not appear any of these risks will hit by tomorrow, it is naive for any investor to discount these risks to zero, blindly trusting multi-year CAGR and gross margin projections extended mindlessly into the future.Health concerns have slowed Monster sales before:\"The softness in the energy drink market that I alluded to in my previous conference call on February 27, 2013, continued through the first quarter of 2013, we believe, partially due to the ongoing negative publicity that continues to appear in the media, questioning the safety of energy drinks and suggesting limitations on their ingredients, including caffeine and/or the levels thereof and/or minimum age restrictions for consumers. In some of our international markets, the energy drink category also appears to have slowed in the quarter. - Rodney C Sacks, Chairman and CEO, Monster Beverage Corp - Q1 2013 Conference Call May 8, 2013 (  )Citron is not saying that Monster misses its next quarter, necessarily. We're not even stating that the company's business isn't successful or valuable. We are just saying that it will never grow into its valuation.That said, if anyone ever wanted exposure to Monster Beverages, why not just follow the biggest beverage company in the world? Buy Coca Cola; you get superior diversification, as well as a 17% position in Monster... without the reputational risk.Cautious investing to all.Appendix:(  ) : Short MNST.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. However, both the metrics declined year over year due to fewer selling days in the quarter and weak margins.Concurrent with the fourth-quarter earnings release, the beverage giant announced that it will accelerate its North-American bottler refranchising efforts and agreed to refranchise its company-owned bottling operations in China to its existing partners.Fourth-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings of the maker of Coke and Fanta were 38 cents per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents by 2.7%.Earnings declined 12% year over year as a strong dollar eroded the value of Coca-Cola's overseas sales. Excluding the 10% negative Fx impact, earnings declined 2% due to six fewer selling days in the quarter and relatively weaker margins.Nonetheless, the earnings decline was less than management's expectations of a mid-to-high single-digit range.Earnings have been adjusted mainly to incorporate charges related to the North American re-franchising initiative, asset impairment costs and costs associated with productivity program. Including these, reported earnings were 28 cents per share, a 62% year-over-year surge. Net revenue declined 8% year over year to $10 billion due to currency headwinds.Currency headwinds hurt sales by 7%. With more than half of its revenues coming from outside the U.S., Coca-Cola's sales/profits were affected by the weakening of many emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar.Adjusting for the impact of currency, organic revenues declined 1% mainly due to six fewer selling days in the quarter. A strong performance in North America was offset by some softness in the international markets. Revenues, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.86 billion by 1.4%.Adjusted consolidated gross margins contracted 120 basis points (bps) year over year to 60.7% as positive pricing and productivity gains were offset by currency headwinds. Gross margins were flat sequentially.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses declined 3% on a currency-neutral basis to $3.95 billion.Adjusted operating income, on a constant currency basis, was $2.0 billion, flat year over year. Adjusted operating margin was 20%, down 140 bps year over year as lower gross margins offset strong cost management and productivity gains. Operating margins declined 370 bps sequentially.Profit-before-tax (PBT) declined 13% to $2.16 billion. Currency hurt PBT by 10%. Structural changes had a negative impact of 1% on PBT, less than 2% as expected. Excluding currency headwinds and structural changes, PBT decreased 2% due to lower organic revenues, lower equity income and interest income.Coca-Cola witnessed 3% volume growth in the fourth quarter, same as the previous quarter, as both still and sparkling beverages volumes remained steady.Sparkling beverage volumes grew 2%, same as the third quarter. The Coca-Cola brand grew 1%, same as the prior quarter. Coke Zero climbed 7%, while Sprite grew 3%. Diet Coke, however, declined 5% as the diet drinks are bearing the brunt of increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Still beverages grew 6% in terms of volume, same as the previous quarter, supported by positive growth in teas, packaged water, juice and juice drinks and sports drinks.In North America, volumes grew 3%, higher than 1% in the earlier quarter, driven by improved volumes of the sparkling sodas. In fact, according to management, the North America region delivered its strongest annual performance in three years.Among other developed nations, volumes improved in Japan, while it softened slightly in Europe. European volumes rose 3%, less than 4% growth in the previous quarter. Japan volumes rose 3%, much better than 2% decline in the third quarter.Among the developing countries, double-digit growth in India was offset by declines in Brazil and softened volumes in China. Volumes grew 1% in China, less than 5% last quarter.Price/mix increased 2%, less than 3% in the previous quarter due to softer growth in North America and Latin America.Latin America and North America continued to show growth, though the increase was lower than the third quarter. Price/mix declined in Asia Pacific but improved in Eurasia and Africa and Europe.In 2015, Coca-Cola witnessed 4% decline in revenues to $44.29 billion. However, revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusting for the impact of currency and structural changes, constant currency revenues increased 3%.Adjusted earnings were $2.00 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99 by a penny. Earnings declined 2% from the prior-year figure. Excluding the impact of currency, earnings increased 6%, higher than the company's expectation of 5%.Organic revenues are expected to be up 4% to 5% in 2016, in line with the long-term target of a mid single-digit increase. Acquisitions and divestitures are expected to hurt revenues by 4-5%.Excluding currency headwinds and structural changes, PBT is expected to increase in a 6-8% range, also in line with the long-term range.In 2016, the adjusted constant currency earnings per share are expected to increase 4-6%, less than the long-term target of a high single-digit increase.Foreign exchange is expected to hurt 2016 revenues by 4% and both PBT and EPS by 9%.Structural changes are expected to have a 3-4% negative impact on both PBT and EPS, primarily due to accelerated re-franchising.The company expects to buy back shares worth $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion in 2016. Adjusted effective tax rate is likely to be 22.5%.Coca-Cola declared that it will complete the remaining re-franchising of North American bottling operations by the end of 2017, much before 2020 as previously expected. The company also said it has signed non-binding letters of intent to refranchise company-owned bottling operations in China to its existing partners, namely China Foods Limited, part of COFCO Limited, and Swire Beverage Holdings Limited.Coca-Cola is re-franchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories to create a more efficient system. Over 40% of the U.S. territories have already been refranchised.It has been divesting and merging many bottling operations since 2014 to revamp its bottling system and thereby improve margins and drive growth. Three of its European bottlers - Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.  , Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetr\u00e4nke AG (German operations of Coca-Cola) - will merge to form a new Western European bottler named Coca-Cola European Partners.Also, Coca-Cola has entered into an agreement with beer and beverage company, SABMiller and partner Gutsche Family Investments, to merge their bottling operations in Southern and East Africa and form the largest Coca-Cola bottling entity in Africa. SABMiller, headquartered in London, is Coca-Cola's largest bottler in South Africa. On the other hand, Gutsche Family Investments has a majority stake in Coca-Cola Sabco, another South African bottling company of Coca-Cola. While Coca-Cola will own 18% in Coca-Cola European Partners, it will have 11% stake in the new African bottler.The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and improved return on invested capital over the long term.2015 has been a \"transition year\" for Coca-Cola because of the changes implemented to create a new operating model. The company implemented aggressive cost-cutting measures and several initiatives to drive faster growth during the year. Other than aggressively cutting costs, the plan includes making disciplined brand and growth investments as well as aligning incentive plans. The resultant savings are being used to fund marketing programs and innovation to re-accelerate top-line growth, margin expansion and returns on capital.In addition, Coca-Cola has made equity investments in smaller companies, like Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.  and Monster Beverage Corporation  , to enhance growth in key categories.Currently, Coca-Cola has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Monster's stock has been one of the top performers of the past decade, but to begin 2016, Coca-Cola has outperformed its younger peer by a substantial margin. Coming into its fourth-quarter financial report on Thursday, Monster Beverage investors hope that the company will reestablish its growth trajectory and get its share price moving in the right direction again. Let's take an early look at what Monster Beverage is likely to say in its report and what the future holds for the energy-drink king.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance. In recent months, investors haven't made big moves in their expectations for Monster Beverage earnings, holding their fourth-quarter estimates unchanged and cutting just a single penny from their full-year 2016 projections. The stock hasn't fared nearly as well, though, falling 13% since mid-November.Monster's third-quarter results provided a much-needed boost to the company after it had seen substantial weakness earlier in 2015. Revenue growth came in at 19%, and net income jumped 44%, both of which were better than investors had expected. Some of the positive results likely came from retailers stocking up on inventory before an August price increase took effect, but a huge gain of 8 percentage points in gross margins was instrumental in Monster's growth. Substantial repurchase activity also helped send shares higher, and Monster said it planned to continue to buy back stock by tapping into its new $500 million repurchase program.However, in late January, Monster became the latest target of analysts at Citron Research, who panned the stock with some arguments with which longtime shareholders will be familiar. Citron pointed to the fact that Monster shares have soared much more than its sales, noting that Coca-Cola trades at half the valuation based on enterprise value to sales, and other industry peers fetch less than a third of Monster's multiple. It also believes that energy-drink growth will slow globally to single-digit percentage rates, putting further pressure on Monster stock. The share price didn't respond to the Citron report immediately, but within a week, the stock had fallen 15%.Yet CEO Rodney Sacks still has plenty of optimism about Monster's prospects going forward. At an investor presentation in January, Sacks singled out China as \"our largest individual country opportunity in the future.\" The CEO said that it has already obtained provisional approvals in Shanghai and Beijing for specially formulated products for the Chinese market, and it is working with all three of the Coca-Cola bottling companies currently in China to figure out a strategy for national distribution.At the same time, Monster has also continued to work at amping up its marketing campaign for maximum exposure. A huge social media presence includes 24 million fans on Facebook and 3 million each on Twitter and Instagram. At the same time, sponsorship deals in sports like NASCAR, Formula One, and MotoGP have shown the value of using an endorsement model.In the Monster Beverage report, watch for explicit rebuttals from the company to Citron's assertions in its January report. As Citron admitted, the bear case for Monster is one that investors have made for years, and anyone betting against the company has lost substantial amounts of money. That in itself doesn't prove Citron wrong, but if Monster can reassure investors that its growth engines are still running strong, then the stock could bounce from its recent pullback.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Source: .Coke had its ups and downs over the past 12 months. Source:  . Coca-Cola saw a 4% decline in revenue in  showing that even though it's in no way just a soda company -- Coke's many brands include Powerade, Dasani, Odwalla, Fuze, and Minute Maid -- it's still vulnerable to changing consumer tastes and the weakness in its core soda products. But, while the revenue drop was not happy news for investors, global volume was up 2% for the year.A classic Coke vending machine Image source: Coca-Cola.Coke is a huge company which sells pretty much everything you can think of in the  . That makes the beverage maker, which is in the process of purchasing many of its bottlers to better control manufacturing, packaging, and shipping of its products, fairly resistant to changing tastes.That said, the company operates in a next-big-thing industry where little companies can explode quickly. Coke has often had to buy its way into emerging beverage categories either by launching its own brands or buying successful new players.For example, the company had to create Powerade to compete with Gatorade (which Pepsi now owns). It also had to buy stakes in  to get into the single-serve coffee market and  to make up for its weakness in energy drinks. In addition, the company has created lines like Dasani water, various energy drink brands, and has bought its way into the iced tea market.Coca-Cola also runs a risk of bad publicity regarding packaged drinks in general. That could be more negative publicity for sugar or even a renewed push toward making your own beverages. While new categories, changing tastes, and bad PR can hurt Coke in the short run, the reality is that the company has the money and distribution network to weather any storm. If drinking bubble tea becomes all the rage and Coke lacks a bubble tea brand, it can simply buy one and push it through its well-established sales channels.Because the beverage game is largely about shelf space and distribution, it's hard to see any competitor or change in consumer desires derailing Coke for long. Yes, having to buy said imaginary bubble tea brand or create its own costs money, but Coke can afford to roll with those kinds of punches.If a new trend emerges, Coca-Cola can buy in or force its way in. That means that while market conditions and fickle consumers may cause bad quarters, or maybe even bad years, in the long run, the company is well set up to recover from almost any setback.It's hard to see Coke stock as risky as a long-term hold because the company controls store shelves, restaurants, and a large part of how beverages get into people's hands. As needs change, that means the company really just has to shift its product mix, and any risks are relatively short in duration.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

It increased 105,000%, turning $10,000 into more than $10 million.But this isn't a retrospective about how you should wish you owned Monster stock. It's almost the opposite.The truth is that Monster has been a gut-wrenching nightmare to own over the last 20 years. It traded below its previous all-time high on 96% of days during that period. On average, its stock was 26% below its high of the previous two years. It suffered four separate drops of 50% or more. It lost more than two-thirds of its value twice, and more than three-quarters once.That's how the stock market works.This chart shows when, and by how much, Monster stock was below its high of the previous two years. (Periods at 0% show when shares hit a new two-year high). Again, It's hard to grasp how the best-performing stock of the last 20 years could spend the majority of that time with returns that would make you want to vomit. It's easy to think that the single-best investment to own is one that would make us smile every morning we woke up owning it.But it wasn't. It never is. And it never will be. That's the nature of the stock market. On the way to making serious money, you spend a lot of time losing serious money. It's a reality anyone investing in stocks, no matter what you own, has to face.I looked at the 10 best stocks to own over the past 20 years. These are all cherry-picked for their stellar returns, and the stocks you would probably choose to own if you had a time machine. On average they increased more than 28,000%.But they all spent a majority of the time well below their previous high mark. They all had multiple declines of 50% or more. A few had multiple 70% drops.Take  (NASDAQ: BIIB). It was the second-best stock to own over the past 20 years, increasing 60,210%. But most of the time, shares have been in some stage of pure agony:Or consider  (NASDAQ: GILD). It increased 21,000% over the last 20 years. But shares spent more of that period down 30% or more than they did anywhere near a new high:Here's how it stacks up for the 10 best stocks to own over the last 20 years. Basically, it's a disaster:There are a few takeaways here. It's easy to think of Starbucks over the last 20 years as a story of uninterrupted success. We know where it began and where it is today, so that story makes sense. But so much happened in between. Growth slowed, plunged, and spiked again. It fired a CEO. Smart people wrote it off with analysis that made sense. It had to reinvent its growth plans, struggled with the introduction of food, and had trouble expanding overseas. What now looks like a slam-dunk story was, at any given time in the last 20 years, an easy story to criticize. That's why shares were so volatile. If stocks with the cherry-picked best returns spend a third of their time down at least 30%, you can imagine what the long-term losers look like. It's a horror show.There are two ways to deal with that: Accept severe volatility as normal, or blunt it with mass diversification. If you're OK with it, you can't remind yourself enough that huge volatility does not preclude high returns over time. It is a normal, inevitable part of the process. Capitalism is fierce about denying you something for nothing, and higher returns tend to demand the mental agony of higher volatility.

Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.70%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcementMonster Beverage's revenues in the fourth quarter of 20Array5 are expected to gain traction from new products launched in the U.S in the past few quarters, solid international sales and growing momentum of the energy drink category.Gross margins are being by strong product sales and a favorable segment mix. The brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, which are produced as concentrates or beverage bases, are high-margin products that make significant positive contribution to sales and gross margins.Moreover, the price increases and lower cost of certain raw materials also drove gross margins in the past quarters and should drive gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage generates more than 20% of its consolidated gross sales outside the U.S. Because of its growing international presence, its sales and profits are being hurt due to negative currency translations.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Monster Beverage is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #Array (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Monster Beverage' Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus estimate stand at 82 cents. Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Because of currency translation pressures, analysts are actually expecting Coca-Cola earnings per share to decline from $2.04 to $1.99.Looking ahead to 2016, investors can expect Coke to continue to diversify from its traditional carbonated soft drinks into alternative beverages. In recent years, the company has made major investments in  and  .Up to this point, the Keurig deal seems to have largely been a bust, with sales of the Keurig Kold underwhelming, and a private equity buyout of the company saving Coke from its paper losses on Keurig's stock. The arrangement with Monster has been more successful, with the stock gaining more than 50% since the tie-up was announced in 2014. In October of last year, the company was also considering taking a stake in Greek yogurt maker Chobani, which would have been its first step outside beverages, but it dropped that bid.Coke's results in 2016 should be similar to last year, which is what investors such as Warren Buffett like about the stock. It's a huge brand with an economic moat, as well as strong profit margins that allow healthy dividend payouts and share buybacks, but it also has slow growth.Coca-Cola continues to grow on a currency-neutral level. In its most recent quarter, revenues and volume improved 3%, and the company is eyeing currency-neutral EPS growth of 5% for 2015.This won't be the company's best year ever, but it won't be its worst, either. Investors should expect similar growth, with revenue improving in the low- to mid-single-digit range, and earnings per share in the mid-single-digit range as share buybacks help inflate the value of bottom-line profits.With downward pressure on the market recently, Coca-Cola stock could outperform, as the company is a classic defensive stock. It pays a dividend yield over 3%, and its sales are not generally affected by weakness in the economy as people need to drink beverages regardless of the economic situation. If 2016 turns out to be a down year for the market, expect Coca-Cola stock to outperform, as investors may turn to it as a safe haven.Long-term investors should also be considering Coca-Cola's prospects beyond 2016. The key question facing the company is this: Can it diversify away from sugary, sparkling beverages fast enough to keep up its modest growth? Through the first three quarters of 2015, sparkling-beverage volume was up just 1%, and health concerns could drive it to zero or into negative territory. The company's steps to invest in the growth of other beverage makers such as Monster  and Keurig  is evidence of a larger strategy, as it needs to put new beverages into its portfolio to maintain its growth rate.Another option is a new drink, a healthier drink such as Coca-Cola Life, the stevia-sweetened beverage that Coke hopes will catch on. The most likely outcome is that Coke's profit margins will persist, but the company's growth will come under more pressure as health concerns chip away at its brand advantages.Currency translation issues should ebb in 2016, but analysts only expect revenue growth of 0.6% and 3.5% in EPS. Barring an unseen shift in its business, those patterns should persist.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

No matter what people call them, soft drinks have steadily been seeping out of the American diet for the past decade or so, as superfoods and salads replace hamburgers and fries. Carbonated soft drinks -- referred to as CSDs in the industry -- have fallen in overall volume by 16.7% between 2003 and 2014, according to Wells Fargo, as consumers guzzle bottled water and energy drinks in their stead.Larger portions of thirsty and free-spending younger consumers have gravitated to energy drinks -- soda-like, stronger-than-coffee energy-boosting concoctions. They have been a hot ticket forMonster Beverage (  ). Since acquiringCoca-Cola 's (  ) energy brands -- including Full Throttle, NOS and others -- Monster has become the U.S. energy drink market leader with 42% dollar share, Cowen & Co. analyst Vivien Azer told IBD.In June, the two companies closed a deal in which Monster scooped up Coca-Cola's energy drink portfolio and Coca-Cola acquired Monster's non-energy brands plus a 16.7% stake in Monster.\"Monster has done a great job of building (its energy drink) business,\" said Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog, adding that there is \"huge upside\" for the company, though much of it is already priced into the stock.Shares of Monster have climbed 37% since the start of the year, and the company has logged earnings growth in nine out of the last 10 reported quarters, most recently topping Q3 estimates. This growth helped it earn an IBD Composite Rating of 97, which means that it has outperformed 97% of publicly traded companies based on a combination of technical and fundamental factors.Analysts say that the company's growth potential lies abroad in its battle to catch up with global leader Red Bull. Monster received a big leg up in that fight through its distribution deal with Coca-Cola, which made it a preferred global distribution partner in 28 countries. Monster said in November that it plans to enter the China market in the first half of next year.There's a \"good energy (drink) market\" in China, said Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck. \"Given Monster's branding, (it'll) probably help to create pretty sizable growth for them going forward.\" China's energy-drink market is growing at a high-teens rate, according to Stifel estimates, vs. the U.S.' high-single-digit rate.Domestically, energy drinks have logged a 23.2% compound annual growth rate (  ) in 2003-2014 and still have plenty of room for growth, say analysts. By contrast, soft drinks have a negative 1.6% CAGR over the last decade or so, according to Wells Fargo, drawing upon data from Beverage Digest.\"Although the addressable energy drink market is probably smaller than that of broader sodas, we believe the category's growth can continue to outpace traditional carbonated soft drinks,\" wrote Morningstar's Fleck in a Nov. 6 note. He pointed to low U.S. per capita consumption of energy drinks compared with other types of beverages. He projects that Monster will grow internationally at a clip of more than 20%, while domestic sales growth sticks to the low double digits.Even diet sodas have lost popularity, largely due to concerns over artificial sweeteners. Soft drink volumes are declining faster than the overall carbonated soft drink category, said Herzog.So why aren't energy drinks -- which are packed with just as much sugar as cola -- subject to the same health-conscious scrutiny that have weighed negatively on soft drinks?Energy drinks are extremely popular among young adults, particularly males, who are \"probably less impacted by calorie and sugar concerns\" than other consumers, said Fleck via email.\"Moreover, the consumption rates of energy drinks are still quite low compared to mainstream CSDs on a per-capita consumption rate, leaving room for people to enter the category,\" he wrote.For sports drinks, Fleck says that having the calories is actually important and that the calories in a drink like Gatorade, for instance, are roughly half that of traditional CSDs.But Fleck does note \"some movement\" into diet energy and sports drinks, highlightingPepsiCo 's (  ) diet Gatorade product, G2, and Monster's Ultra Zero, which is the company's second-bestselling product behind its original energy drink.Consumption of bottled water has also benefited immensely from shifting consumer tastes. Even plain old tap water has grabbed market share at the expense of soft drinks, said Fleck.In 2014, bottled water led gains in the nonalcoholic drink market. Of the major brands tracked by Beverage Digest, Nestle Pure Life volume grew 8.9%, Coca-Cola's Dasani rose 8.2%, Nestle's Poland Spring climbed 7.9%, and PepsiCo's Aquafina rose 7%. By comparison, Coke and Pepsi volumes fell 2.4% and 2.9%, respectively.In its most recently reported quarter, Coca-Cola said that its \"still\" or non-carbonated beverage portfolio -- which includes water, juice and tea -- grew 6% globally by case volume, led by 11% growth in packaged water. Sparkling beverages rose only 2%, with an 8% Diet Coke decline weighing on results.\"Everything outside of soda is doing better for them, and that's been true for a while now,\" said Cowen's Azer of the company.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo together have only about 13% U.S. volume share of the bottled water space, according to Wells Fargo, while Switzerland-basedNestle (  ) dominates with almost half of the market. But don't expect the soda heavyweights to try to vie for Nestle's No. 1 position.\"Bottled water has driven the majority of incremental growth in beverage volumes, but the category has the lowest average price per case with low margins too, making the category relatively unattractive to manufacturers,\" wrote Herzog in a November note on the beverage and tobacco sectors.Instead, Coke and Pepsi are working on making gains in the \"value-add\" water category, said Fleck, which includes products like flavored sparkling water and vitamin-enhanced H2O.\"(Coke and Pepsi will) probably grow more slowly in the category but won't be giving up as much margin,\" he said.Soft drinks make up about three-quarters of Coca-Cola's U.S. business, which means that the company is more exposed to CSD trends than, say, PepsiCo. Fleck says that Pepsi gets two-thirds of its profits from its snack business. Soda makes up 80% ofDr Pepper Snapple Group 's (DPS) business, though it occupies a slightly different space from Coke and Pepsi. It has no exposure to colas, but a strong presence in niche-flavored soft drinks such as Canada Dry and 7UP.Coca-Cola, Monster and Dr Pepper are members of IBD's Beverages-Nonalcoholic industry group, which ranks fourth out of IBD's 197 ranked groups. Smaller memberNational Beverage (FIZZ), which makes LaCroix sparkling water and Faygo, among other products, has a 98 Composite Rating, on par with Monster.As consumers lean toward beverages with healthier images, where does that leave traditional soft drinks? Are carbonated sodas on the brink of fizzling out?Not quite, say experts. Soft drinks still made up well over half of all retail beverage sales last year.At the same time, the experts don't expect the current downward trajectory of CSDs to stop anytime soon.Coca-Cola has transitioned its strategy in recent years and is in the midst of refranchising its bottling operations, though it retains minority stakes in many of its bottlers. The move is seen boosting profitability.In August, Western Europe'sCoca-Cola Enterprises (CCE), Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetr\u00e4nke AG of Germany announced a three-way merger, becoming the largest independent Coca-Cola bottler. Under the agreement, Coca-Cola will own 18% of the newly combined company, which will be called Coca-Cola European Partners.And Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and other soda makers plan to recapture the beverage market with the same old product, albeit in slightly different packaging -- think smaller cans that appeal to health-conscious individuals who still crave an occasional fizzy drink.In turn, consumers wind up paying more per ounce, which analysts call out as a positive.\"(There's a) long runway ahead for smaller package sizes,\" said Fleck.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["egendary investor Warren Buffett is famous for his uber long-term approach to investing, and his status as the second wealthiest American suggests investors might want to follow in his footsteps. Especially when it comes to dividend paying stocks that have been shown to outperform their non-dividend paying peers.With that in mind, we asked some of our top Motley Fool contributors to scour Buffett's portfolio in search of dividend paying stocks that may make sense to own in 2016. Read on to learn which companies they picked and why.: One Warren Buffett dividend stock that could be in for a particularly good 2016 after finishing 2015 flat is auto giant  , of which Buffett's company,  , currently owns 50 million shares.The entire auto industry is trading at an exceptionally low valuation, and General Motors is different. GM's forward P/E is a mere six, and its PEG ratio is below 0.4. To quote the late, great, Rodney Dangerfield, it's \"getting no respect.\" However, 2016 could be a banner year for GM and auto sales as a whole.To start, General Motors is benefiting from a precipitous drop in prices at the pump. Lower  mean lower fuel costs, and it makes trucks and SUV's, which typically sport lower fuel efficiency than sedans and smaller vehicles, look a lot more attractive. This is important for General Motors because SUV's and trucks typically carry higher margins than entry-level compacts and sedans. With an oil equilibrium yet to be reached, oil prices are expected to remain volatile, but depressed, for some time to come.IHS Automotive also happens to be forecasting a peak of 18.2 million auto sales in the U.S. by 2017, which would blow the old record of 17.35 million units from 2000 out of the water. A bullish forecast should benefit much of the industry, including GM.Another key point is that General Motors also recently redesigned a number of vehicles at just the right time (i.e., when fuel prices began to drop). The makeovers for the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pushed the Silverado near the 600,000 unit mark for 2015, its best performance since 2007, while the Sierra may wind up topping 220,000 units sold, which would be its best year since 2005. Even GM's aesthetic improvements, such as with the Chevy Equinox SUV, are going a long way. Sales of the Equinox may near 280,000 units in 2015 and mark its seventh straight year of increasing sales.The real allure for GM, though, is its $1.44 annual dividend, which works out to an  -doubling 4.2% yield. Considering that GM's payout ratio is below 50%, and it's generated between $1.1 billion and $5.1 billion in free cash flow in each of the past five years, I'd call this one of Buffett's most exciting  for 2016.: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 35% of its money invested in financials, and one of his biggest stakes is  -- the national banker that pays a dividend yield of 2.76%.Historically, a period of economic expansion that leads to interest rate increases boosts bank profits as assets reprice more quickly than liabilities. Since the Fed bumped up rates by 25 basis points in December and is guiding for rates to grow to 1.3% in 2016 and 2.4% in 2017, it would seem that owning a bank or two in portfolios could make sense.In Wells Fargo's most recent quarterly filing, the company indicated that it's estimating a Fed Funds rate of 1.86% over the next two years. If the rate is higher than that, then the company could see a 0% to 5% tailwind to its earnings. Currently, industry watchers think Wells Fargo's EPS will reach $4.42 in 2016, up from $4.15 this year.Because Wells Fargo's price to book value remains well below pre-recession highs, an argument can be made that the bank isn't overly pricey and if that's true, collecting a better than market dividend yield at a time when earnings could climb would appear to be a savvy move. data by : One of Warren Buffett's longest-held holdings is  , and the soft-drink giant has been under siege lately because of concerns about the health impact of its sugary and diet carbonated beverages. Trends in the industry have moved away from Coca-Cola's namesake drinks toward alternatives like bottled water, juices, and energy drinks, and some fear that the company has fallen behind the curve.However, Coca-Cola has made some smart investments lately, most recently involving a partnership with  in which the two companies swapped beverage lines in order to concentrate on their respective strengths. With its having retained a sizable stake in Monster Beverage as part of the partnership, Coca-Cola is poised to benefit from further growth in the energy-drink industry, and Monster will have access to Coca-Cola's impressive distribution network to help improve its internal efficiency and sales reach.With a yield of more than 3% and a track record of more than half a century of annual dividend increases that has given it admission onto the elite list of Dividend Aristocrats, Coca-Cola has been a steady long-term holding for Buffett. Despite its challenges, Coca-Cola has gotten through tough times before and has a world-renowned brand to help support its future strategic moves. At the recent Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Warren Buffett admitted this emerging technology is threatening his biggest cash-cow. Buffett's fear can be your gain.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $105 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $7.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 7% return against the $105 commitment, or a 3.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MNST's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $105 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Monster Beverage Corp sees its shares decline 27.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $97.60 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $7.40 from $105), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , and highlighting in green where the $105 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $105 strike for the 3.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Monster Beverage Corp (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $145.29) to be 33%.

This is the second time in less than six months that the company has lowered the sales guidance. Previously, during the third-quarter conference call, the sales growth expectation was lowered from slightly positive.The company is geographically focused on Western Europe and thus exposed to the economic uncertainties of this region and the challenging consumer spending environment which continues to affect the broad consumer goods sector.Ongoing economic softness and operating challenges in Europe, evolving consumer landscape and an increasingly competitive environment hurt Coca-Cola Enterprises' top line in 2014 as well as in 2015. These challenges are expected to persist through 2016, which, coupled with the increasingly strong currency headwinds, will limit revenue growth. With the euro deteriorating against the dollar, currency had a significant negative impact on 2015 sales and earnings.Operating income growth is still expected to be slightly positive both on a comparable as well as currency-neutral basis.2015 adjusted earnings growth is still expected to meet the upper end of the guidance range of 6% to 8%, on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Currency translation is expected to hurt earnings by 18%.Coca-Cola Enterprises expects free cash flow within $600 million to $650 million for 2015. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $325 million. The company expects the weighted average cost of debt to be around 3%. Effective tax rate is anticipated to be roughly 27%.On a comparable and currency-neutral basis, sales growth in 2016 is expected to be slightly positive.In the first quarter, comparable and currency-neutral operating income and diluted earnings per share growth are expected to be down slightly due to unfavorable timing of expenses and one less selling day. Currency translation is expected to hurt earnings by 5%.Coca-Cola Enterprises expects free cash flow in the range of $500 million to $550 million for 2015. Capital expenditures are projected to be about $325 million. The company expects the weighted average cost of debt to be around 3%. Effective tax rate is anticipated to be within 26% to 28%.Separately, the company announced that the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus related to its proposed merger with two other European bottlers to form Western European bottler - Coca-Cola European Partners (\"CCEP\") - has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing was done by CCEP.On Aug 6, Coca-Cola Enterprises announced the merger agreement with two Coca-Cola European bottlers - Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetr\u00e4nke AG - to form CCEP. Coca-Cola Enterprises will hold 48% stake in CCEP which will be the largest independent Coca-Cola bottler in terms of revenues. The transaction is expected to close by the end of second-quarter 2016.Both Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Enterprises carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Coca-Cola has been divesting and merging many bottling operations since 2014 to revamp its bottling system and thereby improve margins and drive growth. Other than the European bottler merger, Coca-Cola has entered into an agreement with beer and beverage company, SABMiller, and partner Gutsche Family Investments, to merge their bottling operations in Southern and East Africa and form the largest Coca-Cola bottling entity in Africa.Moreover, Coca-Cola has made equity investments in smaller companies, like Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.  and Monster Beverage Corporation  , to enhance growth in key categories.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The 45-year-old lead manager of $3.5 billion Morgan Stanley Growth is following in the footsteps of his father, who was a money manager and co-founder of Lynch & Mayer, starting in the 1970s.The elder Lynch (also named Dennis) can be proud. Morgan Stanley Growth was the 25th-best-performing U.S. diversified stock fund in 2015. It outperformed 95% of its peer  tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past five years.And with a 9.4% gain in the fourth quarter that topped 97% of his direct rivals, Lynch was again among the  .With Lynch at the helm since mid-2004, the fund has focused on its managers' best ideas rather than on overdiversifying. It has aimed for securities in the  that benefit from competitive advantages such as a network effect among site visitors and from a steady flow of subscription-based revenues.And in an industry that employs battalions of analysts who are experts at diving into the details of earnings reports, a key member of Lynch's team is a futurist whose job is to spot emerging investment trends years before they generate revenues and profits.Lynch talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Manhattan. Dennis, your fund has outperformed in 2015 and long-term. But in 2012 and 2014 it was middle of the pack. What went against the fund's approach in those years? We try to add value through stock picking and identifying what we think are mispriced or undervalued companies, companies that are undervalued because  don't understand the quality of their business or how they can grow over time.Along the way, there can be periods when specific ideas are not working or the market is not in agreement with our ideas. We had a challenging period in 2012. In the back part of the year we did poorly, given a large allocation toFacebook (  ). It came public with a lot of public enthusiasm, then went through a vicious and challenging period when the stock price more than halved.We actually added to our position during that challenging period, then later on we benefited as the stock price rebounded.Generally, when we have ups and downs relative to the market or peer groups, sometimes it's because we're going through a period when the market thinks we're wrong. And we also make mistakes from time to time. Your concentrated portfolio is the flip side of your long-term approach, right? Yes. Why we do well in any given year reflects decisions made in previous years rather than anything we do in the current year.Amazon.com (  ) is a company we've owned continuously for roughly 13 years. The reasons we got involved were a combination of the online advantages that made them tough to beat. They offer inventory that they don't necessarily possess themselves, but which they have access to.At the same time, they've slowly built a very large logistical infrastructure in the physical world.And they target increasingly technology through their Amazon Web Services. Is there anything that could disrupt a juggernaut like Facebook? You don't have to worry that another social network will get bigger. That's highly unlikely.But is there something out there that can take people's attention away, like virtual reality or some other technology that still in its early stages now?In the absence of something like that, it's unlikely that Facebook's network effect will be challenged anytime soon. LinkedIn's (  ) third-quarter profit jumped 50%, a nice rebound from Q2. This is another network-effect play, isn't it? Both holdings have strong network effects of users connected to each other.Both have users who cross-connect. It's hard to displace them. Even though both have that at their core, they make money in different ways. So we're not exposed to the same end markets or even the same spending patterns.Earlier in the year, LinkedIn made changes to its workforce that surprised people. But each quarter, results have seen the fruits of LinkedIn's longer-term thinking. The key toMonster Beverage (  ) is how their deal withCoke (  ) gives them a shot at foreign expansion, right? With Coca Cola becoming a substantial owner, it opens opportunities for distribution to become more efficient in the U.S. and increases chances of capturing more global share. They've had less success outside the U.S. IsSalesforce.com (CRM) one of those subscription-revenue companies you like?It gives customers the ability to benefit from upgrades to the whole system rather than having to buy a new version of the software for each upgrade cycle.As a result, they built a high recurring-revenue business. On an annual basis, revenue renewal is over 90%. So that gives their revenue a lot of visibility.They are figuring out how to meet other important needs for large organizations. They're expanding into marketing. IBD: Why hasAthenahealth 's (ATHN) share price been choppy recently? Athenahealth is the dominant provider for doctors to get reimbursed by insurers.And the way their system works, every doctor can learn (about methods for improving insurance reimbursements) from the experience of other doctors on the platform.Once Athena figures out how to apply new rules for one doctor, all doctors benefit.So it's hard for a doctor not to join the network. This is an inherent network effect. But their penetration is still less than 10% of the overall doctor market, so they've got a lot of room for growth.And they've diversified into electronic health records. Once you get a lot of doctors to join, you can provide other services, which draws in more doctors. After a rough patch,Intuitive Surgical 's (ISRG) earnings-per-share growth is accelerating again. Is this improvement for real? That rough period was when they were transitioning from a first-generation platform to the next generation.And it's a razor-and-razor-blades model. There are a lot of consumables that need to be reordered each time.So it's a high recurring revenue model. It continues to take share.When a company has an upgrade cycle, customers wonder if they should order the old system or the new one. Sales can slow. It happened a couple of years ago. Now things are heading back in the right direction. Dennis, how does your team differ from its rivals? One thing I try to emphasize when I talk with people who are thinking about whether to put money in the fund is what skin in the game do people running a product have?Here, we're not going to do well every quarter or every 12 months. There can be periods when things go badly, but through Morgan Stanley's deferred compensation program, the vast majority of team pay is deferred, and most goes into our products.We have significant personal exposure through co-ownership with our clients in the products we make for them. Tell me about the person on your team whose job is to scout ahead for emerging trends or disruptive new technologies. Yes, in addition to our expert work, meetings with companies, looking at financial statements -- those conventional activities -- we've dedicated one person to research topics that have the potential to be disruptive in industries or sectors. What is your change researcher looking at these days? More recently, he's been focused on Bitcoin and virtual reality. These are potentially powerful emerging themes and disruptive trends. Who is your disruptor expert? Stan Delaney. How do you and the five other managers on this fund -- David Cohen, Sam Chainani, Alexander Norton, Jason Yeung and Armistead Nash -- divide your workload? Is each manager responsible for different industrial sectors, for example? I act as a generalist. Outside of me, everyone has a sector and industry expertise. Sam follows the Internet and financials. David follows consumer, which sounds like one industry but is really multidimensional. Jason follow health care and some consumer staples. Armistead follows business services and software. Alex does technology -- we think of technology differently than the Internet. Companies use the Internet to create. They are not selling semiconductors or software. Alex focuses on those kinds of business models and things like industrials.My dad managed large- and midcap growth stocks, starting in the 1970s in a time when managers tended to be generalists. Today people tend to be experts in a category but lacking the perspective of knowing multiple categories and being able to compare. We believe we benefit from taking the generalist approach, and we can leverage the experts.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" data by  Shares of  gained 13.4% in November, according to data from  . It has been a bumpy year, but the energy drink veteran's shares have soared more than 40% year-to-date. The big driver of Monster's November rally was a  posted in the first week.Sales rose 19% year-over-year to $757 million, earnings soared 44% higher to land at $0.84 per share, and both figures stomped Wall Street expectations. The next day, Monster shares jumped more than 14% higher, essentially accounting for the entire month's strength in one fell swoop. For example, 9% of its third quarter sales came from the new concentrate business. That may look small, but the exceptional profit margins in this hyper-efficient business model lifted gross margins from 53.8% to 61.5%.And it's pretty obvious where many of these new ideas started. Thanks to a deep partnership with soft drink titan  , Monster now has access to a worldwide, world-class distribution network and some of the best production facilities on the planet.\"We are pleased to report good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers,\" said Monster CEO Rodney Sacks in November. That's a solid candidate for the coveted \"understatement of the season\" awards. The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Plus, Corona, Calif.-based Monster has signed deals withCoca-Cola (  ) andMcDonald's (  ) to broaden its distribution network and customer reach -- and to try to get a leg up.But hey, Monster has yet to launch distribution services to the moon. And at least there's no sign it has come up with a way to sell its products telepathically.Seriously, that's about all Monster hasn't tried in what's turning out to be titanic battle for market supremacy against Red Bull, the Austrian company that currently ranks No. 1. Calling it a tight race could be an understatement.Euromonitor International estimates that Red Bull had a 43% share of the global energy drink market as of 2014, the most recent year annual data are available. Monster, which gets most of its sales from the U.S., was second with 39%. Privately held Rockstar, based in Las Vegas, ranked a distant third with 10% of the market.While Red Bull has a slight leg up now, its battle with Monster continues to teeter back and forth, with one player gaining ground in certain areas and the other moving ahead elsewhere.\"If you look at the U.S. only, Monster has lost some share to Red Bull this year on a revenue basis,\" Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck told IBD. \"Part of that is that Red Bull put in price increases earlier.\"Monster CEO Rodney Sacks echoed that point on a third-quarter conference call with analysts, saying Red Bull's sales have been \"a percent or two\" above Monster's.\"(Red Bull) took a price increase in January at a slightly higher level, which seems to have stuck,\" Sacks said. \"We are really just starting to try to get our price level solidified.\"But, he added, in cases and units sold during the third quarter, Monster's market share \"in fact increased and is ahead of Red Bull's.\"Monster doesn't shy away from its desire to take over leadership of the global energy drink market. To do that, it will need to grow its business overseas, where Red Bull holds a commanding lead.\"Overall we expect the international markets to outpace the growth we see in the U.S. for Monster,\" Fleck said. \"This move into new countries will likely continue, and we would expect them to enjoy good growth from a small base. Internationally, Red Bull does dominate, so it will be interesting to watch any competitive moves from them as Monster enters new markets.\"Monster's international strategy got a lift in June, when it finalized a strategic partnership with Coca-Cola. Under terms of the deal, the soft drink giant increased its stake in Monster to about 17% and transferred ownership of its global energy drink business to Monster. Brands in that business include NOS and Full Throttle.Meanwhile, Monster transferred most of its U.S. distribution of Monster Energy products to the Coca Cola distribution network. Monster also transferred non-energy products, such as Hansen's natural sodas and juices to Coca-Cola.Since then, Monster has made several moves to expand its reach. A launch in Russia is expected by the end of this month. In November, Monster said it plans to move into China during the first half of 2016. It also plans to enter other regions, such as Nigeria.The move into China has grabbed most of the headlines, for obvious reasons: About 1.4 billion people live there. JPMorgan analyst John Faucher noted that Monster has filed applications for product approval in China and begun negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers for production/distribution.The approval process \"may take longer\" in China than in other countries, Faucher said, though Monster still plans to launch there by the middle of next year.Making an impact in China won't be quick or easy, watchers say.\"They will face competitive issues with Red Bull in China, and China also has a low per-capita consumption of carbonated beverages to begin with,\" Fleck said.On the Q3 conference call, CEO Sacks said it's unlikely Monster will have a big national launch in China with TV ads. The company is more likely to introduce its products province by province.\"It may mean that it takes some time,\" Sacks said. \"It may not go through all of the provinces. China is very, very big.\"International expansion isn't the only growth avenue for Monster. The company recently began selling Monster energy drinks in about 20 of McDonald's U.S. restaurants, opening a new market beyond traditional distribution channels such as convenience stores.Evercore ISI estimates that Monster could see as much as $1.5 billion in additional U.S. revenue with the new quick-serve restaurant distribution channel.\"They're moving into more restaurant chains and beverage coolers and machines as part of their distribution agreement with Coke,\" Fleck said. \"The majority of sales will probably be at gas/convenience store channels, but the other channels should help drive growth in margins.\"Financially, Monster bounced back during the third quarter after a disappointing second quarter. Third-quarter adjusted earnings rose 20% from the prior year to 84 cents a share, topping consensus estimates by 3 cents. Gross margin widened to 61.5% from 53.8%. Revenue gained 19% to $756.6 million, also above views.Those numbers compare to a 4% EPS decline and 1% revenue gain during the second quarter.Monster shares touched a new high of 158.35 on Nov. 30 and are up more than 40% since the beginning of the year.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (Symbol: QUAL) where we have detected an approximate $82.7 million dollar inflow -- that's a 5.3% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 23,750,000 to 25,000,000).

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares surge nearly 14% on the day.

Year to date, the energy drink company has yielded a solid return of 44.7%.Shares have soared 18.4% since the company posted solid third-quarter 2015 results on Nov 5. There are, however, several other factors that make Monster Beverage appealing to investors.Monster Beverage's third-quarter 2015 results were impressive with both earnings and revenues growing year over year. Moreover, the company provided an encouraging outlook for fourth-quarter 2015 and 2016.Earnings surged 20.2% on the back of a 19% increase in net sales and robust margins. The increase in net sales was driven by advance purchase by consumers in anticipation of a rise in prices of some Monster Energy drinks effective from August 31, 2015. The company also reported strong sales in markets outside the U.S, particularly in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.The top line was also driven by strong sales of new products. In order to maintain this growth momentum, the company plans to launch new products in early 2016. Moreover, the brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company  , which are produced as concentrates or beverage bases, are high-margin products that make significant positive contribution to sales and gross margins.Gross margins continued to be driven by strong product sales and a favorable segment mix. Sales of non-energy brands, the price increase in August and lower cost of certain raw materials also drove gross margins.Monster Beverage is currently working on its strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers across the globe. Monster Beverage has already completed its transition with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Germany in July.The company has reached an agreement with Coca-Cola Hellenic Group, through which Coca-Cola Hellenic will distribute Monster products across 28 countries. Monster Beverage will launch Monster drinks in Russia by 2015 end.Monster also entered into an agreement with Household & Health Care Limited in Korea to distribute Monster brands in South Korea. Meanwhile, it is negotiating with bottlers in South and Central America and Australia.

It does so with a long-short strategy that calls for concentrated bets on individual stocks alongside put options against broad market indexes. To win, Caxton has to nail its stock picking, something it has done since its founding in 1983.Recently revealed 13F filings show what the hedge fund manager was buying and selling last quarter, giving investors some new stocks to keep on their watch lists. Caxton is looking for a monster --  , that is. The hedge fund company disclosed that the energy drink maker quickly became its biggest individual stock position, acquiring nearly 1.15 million shares. That makes it equal to nearly a tenth of the entire publicly disclosed portfolio.The company's core products, energy drinks, are some of the few remaining growth products in carbonated drinks. The company now lays claim to a majority of the market, overtaking Red Bull as the dominant energy drink company. Impressively, sales continue to grow at a breakneck pace. The company reported sales of 81 million cases last quarter, a 31% improvement over the 62 million cases sold in the same period of 2014. Caxton's investment in  grew a little bigger this quarter, with the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank growing to roughly 7% of the portfolio from under 6% last quarter. The asset-sensitive bank has been a favorite of top stock pickers for some time, as Charlie Munger's  has nearly 30% of its portfolio invested in the company.Bank of America isn't just a play on interest rates, however. The company's cost-cutting has produced a more efficient bank that takes more of its revenue to the bottom line. Recently, its efficiency ratio in its consumer banking unit dipped below the 60% level often described as being a  for a \"good\" bank. And it isn't taking its foot off the gas pedal: at a recent conference, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan suggested that for every dollar it is investing in technology today, it expects to see a dollar of cost savings in perpetuity.Having shed their bad loans during the financial crisis and upped their capital levels, many believe the bank industry may offer some of the best stock market values. Cleansed loan books, cost cutting, and rate hikes should give banks plenty of room to grow earnings over the long haul. A heightened pace of new home sales should be a boon to one of Caxton's investments: homebuilder  , which is seeing increased demand for new builds. Though new home sales recently came in at an annual pace of 495,000 units, well below the peak of nearly 1.4 million in 2005, there is reason to believe that the uptick in construction may have legs for years as millennials pay down student debt and move out of mom and dad's house.Lennar is perhaps more dependent on a recovery in homebuilding than its peers, having deployed billions of dollars to acquire land for development. The company's balance sheet reflects nearly $4.9 billion of its $14.2 billion in total assets is invested in land and land under development.To put its land ownership in perspective, the company's recent quarterly filing shows that its homebuilding unit generated $2.2 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, of which only $23 million (or about 1% of the unit's revenue) came from land sales. On a recent conference call, Lennar CEO Stuart Miller noted that his firm has seen \"probably a 14% kind of inflation factor for land on an annual basis right now,\" suggesting that a tightening market is making its land holdings a little more valuable each and every day.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

He also led Coca-Cola's German business from 2010 to 2014. Steckhan will report to North American chief, Sandy Douglas.Additionally, Stuart Kronauge and Ivan Pollard were named as co-heads of U.S. marketing. They will be taking over from former North American marketing chief, Wendy Clark, who resigned last month.Coca-Cola's North America business has seen improved sales performance in 2015 supported by higher prices and better volumes largely on the back of its disciplined quality advertising investments.The North America segment recorded revenue growth of 1% year over year in third-quarter 2015, reported in October, despite currency headwinds and negative impact of structural changes. Volumes grew 1% as improvement in still beverages was offset by decline in sparkling sodas.To boost long-term sales and profits in the North American segment, Coca-Cola is pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms. In June, the cola giant acquired a stake in and signed a deal with Monster Beverage Corporation  to expand distribution of Monster products into additional territories. This will allow Coca-Cola to compete more effectively in the global energy category.Similar to the Monster deal, Coca-Cola acquired a 17% stake in Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.  in 2014/2015. Also, the company signed an innovative partnership with Keurig Green Mountain under which the latter will make and sell Coca-Cola branded single-serve pods for use on its Keurig Kold at-home beverage system. The deal opens up an exciting new packaging format for Coca-Cola's brands.It also signed a distribution agreement with Suja, a high growth organic cold-pressed juice company, to gain a foothold in this growing market. In China, the company has invested in the plant-based protein drinks platform through the acquisition of the beverage business of China Green Culiangwang Beverages Holdings.Moreover, Coca-Cola is refranchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories to create a more efficient system.It has been divesting and merging many bottling operations since 2014 to revamp its bottling system and thereby improve margins and drive growth. Three of its European bottlers - Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.  , Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetr\u00e4nke AG - will merge to form a new Western European bottler named Coca-Cola European Partners. Also, the company has entered into an agreement with beer and beverage company, SABMiller, and partner Gutsche Family Investments, to combine their bottling operations in Southern and East Africa and form the largest Coca-Cola bottling entity in Africa.The company has also created the National Product Supply System (NPSS) to strengthen and streamline the U.S. production volume that will lower costs, enhance investments and improve innovation.The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The Coca-Cola Company and its partners will act as Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, thus giving greater exposure to Monsters' products.Monster Beverage's adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents by 3.7%. Earnings also increased 20.2% year over year on the back of strong revenues and margin.Monster Beverage's net sales of $756.6 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $740 million by 2.2%. Net sales increased 19% year over year.Net sales growth was partly driven by advance purchase by consumers in anticipation of a rise in prices of some Monster Energy drinks in August. Advance purchase drove net sales by $11.0 million during the quarter.However, foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of $28.6 million on net sales. Net sales outside the U.S. increased 25.2% year over year to $170.6 million, particularly in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. However, sales in Spain and Italy were impacted by the transition process of the deal closure.From second-quarter 2015 onward, Monster Beverage has been reporting its results under three operating and reportable segments - Finished Products, Concentrate and Other. The segment reported net sales of $686.7 million, up 15.5% year over year. Despite the year-over-year increase, net sales were hurt by unfavorable foreign currency. This segment includes brands acquired from Coca-Cola. Net sales of the segment were $69.9 million in the third quarter of 2015. This was the first time that the concentrate segment has reported full-quarter results, which is why there is no comparable figure from the preceding quarters. During third-quarter 2015, there were no sales from the segment compared to net sales of $41.6 million in the prior-year quarter. This was because of the closure of the Coca-Cola transaction in June.Third-quarter 2015 gross margin rose 770 basis points (bps) to 61.5%. Gross margin gained from favorable product sales and segment mix as the higher margin Concentrate segment is generating higher sales. Moreover, sales of the non-energy brands, the August price increases and lower cost of certain raw materials also pulled up gross margins.Excluding deferred revenues and distributed termination expenses, adjusted operating income increased 53.5% to $291.4 million. Operating margin was 23.0%, down 90 bps year over year.Monster Beverage is currently working on its strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers across the globe. Monster Beverage also plans to launch Monster in Nigeria in 2016.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Monster Beverage is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MNST in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 82 cents per share for MNST, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MNST, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.24% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that MNST has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Monster Beverage, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Initially going up against giants like  , Monster not only survived and competed effectively against much bigger rivals but also ended up collaborating with Coca-Cola on key initiatives. Coming into its third-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors were a little uncertain about whether the company would be able to restart its growth engines, but Monster's results quelled concerns that arose in last quarter's slightly downbeat results. Let's look more closely at Monster Beverage's latest quarter to discover how the company managed to bounce back. Monster Beverage's third-quarter results brought growth back to the beverage giant. Net sales climbed 19% to $756.6 million, easily topping the 16% growth rate that most investors were expecting to see from Monster. On the bottom line, Monster posted even more impressive results, with a 44% jump in net income to $174.6 million. That equated to earnings of $0.84 per share, beating the consensus forecast by $0.03 per share.Looking more closely at Monster's numbers, the report is easier to decipher now that the company's operations have become simpler. The strong dollar hurt Monster's results, costing the company roughly four percentage points of net revenue growth due to poor foreign currency performance. On the other hand, Monster got a boost from customers making the smart move to stock up on its products before a scheduled price increase became effective at the end of August. The company believes that those decisions added roughly 1.5 percentage points to its sales figures for the quarter. Monsters gross margins rose nearly eight full percentage points, and operating-expense increases were held in check, helping to drive earnings higher.Monster Beverage's business metrics were once again mixed. Case sales soared more than 30%, but average net sales plunged by almost a full dollar to $9.31 per case. Monster also introduced a new concentrate segment, which accounted for about $70 million in sales for the company. Sales to international sources jumped 25% to $170.6 million during the quarter.Monster Beverage CEO Rodney Sacks kept praising the company's progress with its strategic moves. \"We are pleased to report good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers,\" Sacks said. \"In the United States, we are seeing continued improvement in distribution.\" As predicted, Monster Beverage also moved forward with its plans to undertake some major repurchases of its stock. The company said it repurchased 2.9 million shares at an average price of just under $134.50 per share, adding up to a total of roughly $390 million. The company said it has started to tap its new $500 million repurchase program, having exhausted its 2013 authorization during the quarter.Yet the more important aspects of Monster's strategy involve international distribution, which the Coca-Cola partnership has made possible. The company expects to entire the Russian market by the end of this year, and it is still working out its strategy for the key Chinese market. With so much untapped potential in international markets, using the distribution agreement to boost its overseas presence could be a huge driver for future growth for Monster.Investors in Monster Beverage were quite happy with the results, as the stock soared more than 8% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Monster has great potential to produce even better growth in the future, and with Coca-Cola's big stake in the beverage company giving it continuing incentive to render assistance, Monster appears to be on track to refocus its efforts on building up even more positive momentum for the rest of 2015 and beyond.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Distribution expenses plummeted by 22% as a percentage of sales, which helped power Monster's surging profit gains. \"We have entered into a number of distribution agreements for various international markets served by the Coca-Cola bottler system, which will be implemented over the following months. In the United States, we are seeing continued improvement in distribution,\" CEO Rodney Sacks said in a press release.Management suggested that, as good as things were this quarter, growth could have been even more robust. Sacks said that \"uncertainties in portions of our international non-Coca-Cola distribution network limited further revenue growth during the quarter.\" That statement suggests the next few quarters could bring an acceleration of the positive trends that investors saw recently, assuming management can remove those roadblocks. It turns out that people really liked the idea of purchasing four suits at the same time.

Management last quarter  as it transitioned away from that promotion-based business model, but the results were dramatically worse than they had expected. \"While we expected top line volatility, we did not anticipate that the impact from the traffic decline would occur to this degree,\" CEO Doug Ewert said in a press release.The new traffic trends point to an even more brutal fourth quarter ahead. The company forecast a comparable-store sales drop of as much as 25% at Jos. A. Bank over the holidays. And full-year earnings are now seen coming in at $1.90 per share, compared to the $2.80 per share executives had targeted previously.It's little consolation that the company will be making more money on each suit sale: Gross margin for the brand will rise by five percentage points, management said. Yet the sharply lower sales number means that total profits will be \"well below last year's fourth quarter given the anticipated traffic declines\".

Yet over the past 10 years or so, there's been a sea change in the industry, and  's energy drinks have come into the spotlight as a preferred choice for many consumers. Yet coming into its third-quarter financial report on Thursday, Monster Beverage is in the rare position of having to rebound from a poor showing in its previous quarterly results, and the pressure is on for the company to return to its more typical growth trajectory. Let's take an early look at what investors should expect from Monster Beverage and whether the stock can return toward its all-time highs from earlier this year.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Investors have had a tough time reconciling the impact of Monster Beverage's second-quarter slowdown on its earnings, having reduced their third-quarter projections by $0.07 per share and cutting full-year forecasts by $0.25 per share. The stock has fallen from its past record highs, down 10% since late July.Monster's second-quarter results crushed the confidence that many investors had had in the energy-drink company. Growth came to a near standstill, with both revenue and net income rising by about 1%. For a company that has routinely posted double-digit percentage increases, that departure from the norm was shocking, and although the company's deal with Coca-Cola to trade energy and nonenergy drink brands between them had an impact on Monster's financials, some of the fundamentals of the energy-drink business itself were mixed. For instance, even though sales volumes rose, average prices fell, weighing on Monster's ability to increase overall revenue.Perhaps in response to its share-price declines, Monster chose to approve a new stock repurchase program. In September, Monster's board authorized up to $500 million in share buybacks under the new program, having completed its previous $200 million authorization. The impact will likely be minimal, given that $500 million is just over 2% of Monster's market capitalization, but it does demonstrate the company's confidence in its stock at current levels.From a fundamental standpoint, Monster got some positive news after the end of the third quarter. In late October, fast-food giant  is testing sales of Monster beverages in about 20 of its stores. The test could lead to a closer relationship between the two companies in the future, and having exposure at the chain's restaurants would not only directly improve Monster's results but also increase brand awareness more generally and increase sales from existing distribution channels as well.Yet the bigger question Monster faces is whether competitors will eventually take away some of Monster's business. The company has effectively neutralized Coca-Cola with its partnership with the beverage giant, but Coca-Cola's major rival in the soft-drink industry as well as key players in the coffee business are taking their own stabs at producing energy drinks of their own. Monster has an edge in having been a first-mover, and its brand-name recognition is synonymous with its namesake products. How durable those competitive advantages will be, though, remains to be seen.In the Monster Beverage report, investors will need to focus closely on how well the brand-swap with Coca-Cola has gone. With new brands among its assets and with some old longtime holdings now moved to Coca-Cola, Monster's report will look different than it has in the past. If trends in the beverage industry continue, then Monster Beverage will be well-positioned to profit from rising demand for the types of drinks it is famous for making.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Last quarter, the Israel-based manufacturer of household soda makers delivered a negative earnings surprise of 54.05%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.SodaStream has been recording soft sales in the U.S. over the past few quarters due to lower demand for its products - soda/sparkling water machines and flavored syrups.The U.S. carbonated soft drink (CSD) market is facing troubles as consumers are shifting away from traditional soda toward more natural, water-based beverages containing fewer calories.SodaStream is thus pursuing a global restructuring and growth plan. The company is repositioning itself as a water brand under its health and wellness strategy and making significant changes in its growth initiatives to turn around the business.As part of the plan, the company has begun to roll out a range of natural water-enhanced flavors at its retailers. The company is also testing a marketing campaign, \"Sparkling Waters - Made by You\".SodaStream is also working to transform its manufacturing base and operating structure - including consolidation/closure of production facilities - to create a more efficient organization.At the second-quarter conference call, management stated that it was expecting sales decline rates to moderate in the second half from the first, especially in the fourth quarter. Sales growth is likely to turn positive in the fourth quarter. We can safely assume that though the third-quarter sales growth might not be positive, it should still be better than the declines witnessed in the first half gaining from the product launches and increased marketing support.However, gross margins are expected to be down slightly in the third quarter than the comparable year-ago period due to unfavorable product mix (higher concentration of sparkling water makers and flavors). Advertising costs are expected increase to support product launches which might put third-quarter profits under pressure.Our proven model does not conclusively show that SodaStream is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 21 cents. SodaStream'sZacks Rank #3 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Some stocks in the broader consumer staples sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Dean Foods Company  , with an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Campbell Soup Company  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #3.Monster Beverage Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.24% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Shares declined around 1.5% in  .Third-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings of the maker of Coke and Fanta were 51 cents per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents by 2%.Earnings declined 4% year over year due to a strong dollar eroding the value of its overseas sales. Excluding the 12% negative Fx impact, earnings increased 8% as improved organic revenues made up for the relatively weaker margins.Earnings have been adjusted mainly to incorporate charges related to the North American re-franchising initiative and costs associated with productivity program. Including these, reported earnings were 33 cents per share, down 31% year over year.Net revenue declined 5% year over year to $11.43 billion due to currency headwinds.Currency headwinds hurt sales by 8%, higher than management's expectations of 7%. With more than half of its revenues coming from outside the U.S., Coca-Cola's sales/profits were affected by the weakening of many emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar.Adjusting for the impact of currency, organic revenues went up 3% driven by improved volume and pricing. Revenues, however, marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.61 billion.Adjusted consolidated gross margins declined 50 basis points (bps) year over year and 80 bps sequentially to 60.7% as positive pricing and productivity gains were offset by currency headwinds.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis to $4.21 billion due to higher marketing expenditure.Adjusted operating income, on a constant currency basis, increased 8% to $2.71 billion. Adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, flat year over year as lower gross margins and higher marketing investments offset strong cost management and productivity gains. Operating margins declined 230 bps sequentially.Profit-before-tax (PBT) declined 5% to $2.89 billion. Currency hurt PBT by 12%, worse than the expectation of 10%. Structural changes had a negative impact of 1% on PBT. Excluding currency headwinds and structural changes, PBT improved 8% as strong profits in North America made up for the declines in Asia-Pacific and Europe.Coca-Cola witnessed 3% volume growth in the third quarter, better than 2% in the previous quarter as both still and sparkling beverages volumes improved.Sparkling beverage volumes grew 2%, higher than 1% in the second quarter. The Coca-Cola brand grew 1%, same as the previous quarter. Coke Zero climbed 8%, while Fanta and Sprite grew in a low single-digit range. Diet Coke, however, declined 8% as the diet drinks are coming under pressure due to increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Still beverages grew 6% in terms of volume, better than 5% in the last quarter supported by growth in teas, packaged water and sports drinks.In North America, volumes grew 1%, lower than 2% in the earlier quarter, as improved volumes of still beverages were offset by decline in sparkling sodas. On the contrary, peer, PepsiCo, Inc.  witnessed improved volumes in its North Americas Beverage segment in the third quarter, per results announced earlier this month.Among other developed nations, volumes improved in Europe, while it declined in Japan. European volumes rose 4%, better than 1% in the previous quarter. Japan volumes declined 2%, worse than 1% growth in the second quarter.Among the developing countries, 5% volume growth in China and 4% in India were offset by declines in Russia and Brazil.Price/mix increased 3%, better than 1% in the previous quarter driven by the company's new pricing and packaging initiatives in key markets like North America and a favorable geographic mix.While Latin America and North America continued to show growth due to the company's new pricing strategies, price/mix improved in Asia Pacific. However, price/mix declined in Eurasia and Africa but remained flat in Europe.In 2015, the adjusted constant currency earnings per share are expected to increase 5%. Previously, management expected the number to go up in a mid single-digit range.Foreign exchange is expected to hurt 2015 revenues by 7% (previously 6%), operating income by 11% (maintained), and PBT by 8% (earlier 7-8%).Structural changes are expected have a 1% negative impact on revenues and PBT.The company still expects to buy back shares worth $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion in 2015. Productivity savings are expected to be $500 million in 2015. Adjusted effective tax rate is likely to be 22.5%.2015 has been a \"transition year\" for Coca-Cola because of the changes implemented to create a new operating model. The company has undertaken aggressive cost-cutting and several initiatives to drive faster growth this year. The resultant savings are being used to fund marketing programs and innovation to re-accelerate top-line growth, margin expansion and returns on capital.The company is also re-franchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories to create a more efficient system. It has been divesting and merging many bottling operations since 2014 to revamp its bottling system and thereby improve margins and drive growth. Three of its European bottlers - Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.  , Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetr\u00e4nke AG - will merge to form a new Western European bottler named Coca-Cola European Partners.Moreover, Coca-Cola has made equity investments in smaller companies, like Keurig Green Mountain and Monster Beverage Corporation  , to enhance growth in key categories.Currently, Coca-Cola has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.67%.Kraft Heinz was formed out of the merger of packaged food company, Kraft Foods, and ketchup maker, H.J. Heinz Company.Previously known as H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation, the company changed its name to Kraft Heinz post the merger on Jul 2. The deal was backed by Brazilian private equity firm, 3G Capital, and billionaire investor, Warren Buffet.Kraft Heinz started trading on Jul 6, which was after the end of the second quarter, and therefore reported separate results for Kraft and Heinz. The third quarter should, therefore, be the first time that the company reports a combined result.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Kraft Heinz is likely to beat earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +5.17%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. Kraft Heinz carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Kraft Heinz's Zacks Rank #3 and +5.17% ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Kraft has reported weak sales for the past few quarters due to volume losses associated with price increases and softness in certain categories resulting from the lack of innovation/brand building activities. Sales at both Kraft and Heinz have been suffering as a result of declining consumer demand for packaged food products.However, profits were decent in the last quarter supported by lower commodity costs, mainly dairy and meat, lesser SG&A expenses due to advertising efficiency, and reduced manufacturing costs driven by improved productivity. We expect the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.As regards Heinz, while currency headwinds will hurt sales, pricing gains and improved performance in North America should boost results. Also, Heinz's cost management efforts should support profit growth in the third quarter.Some stocks in the broader consumer staples sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Dean Foods Company  , with an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Campbell Soup Company  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #3.Monster Beverage Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.23% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In its fiscal third-quarter 2015 earnings reported Wednesday, Coke posted revenue of $11.4 billion, a 5% decrease from the comparable prior-year quarter. Net income declined to $1.5 billion from $2.1 billion in the previous year, which equated to $0.33 per diluted share, versus $0.48 in Q3 2014.Coke ascribed its performance lag to a currency headwind of 8% against revenue, as the dollar trumped local currencies in the numerous countries where Coke does business. The company reported that organic revenue actually grew 3% during the quarter. In addition, currency effects created a drag of 12% on both operating income and earnings per share.Earnings were also affected by charges the company took in its effort to refranchise its North American bottling operations, and additional charges within its ongoing productivity program. These charges, in total, trimmed the bottom line by $871 million, or $0.18 per share. Below, we review five additional highlights from Wednesday's earnings filing. Coke managed global unit-case volume growth in sparkling beverages of 2% during the quarter. Global \"trademark Coca-Cola\" soda volume increased 1%, which, along with gains in Coke Zero of 8%, as well as single-digit contributions from Sprite and Fanta, offset an 8% decline in Coca-Cola's second-best-selling beverage, Diet Coke. Diet Coke still appears to be suffering from consumer concerns regarding the potentially harmful health effects of its ingredients.\"Still,\" or non-sparkling, beverages continue to gain share at a much faster rate than their carbonated counterparts. During the three months ended October 2, 2015, Coke's bottled water, teas, juices, energy drinks, and other still offerings saw volume expansion of 6%. Year to date, still beverages have grown by 4%, versus 1% for sparkling beverages.Coca-Cola is beginning to realize some payback from its recent distribution deal with Monster Beverage Corporation . The expanded distribution of Monster beverages contributed one percentage point to total North American unit-case volume, both during the quarter and year to date.This 1% is perhaps more important than it looks. Without it, North American unit-case volume would have been flat. Shareholders will want to pay attention to the Monster contribution next quarter to see if the energy drink manufacturer's brands further assist Coca-Cola's total volume. This quarter, Coca-Cola's gross profit of $6.8 billion marked a decline of about 7% from last year's $7.3 billion benchmark. However, on a currency-neutral basis, the company's gross profit actually rose 2%, indicating that gross profit margin is rising in real terms, if ever so slightly.The gross margin improvement on a currency-neutral basis can be traced back to the company's productivity plan, which aims for $3 billion in annual cost savings by 2019. The anticipated savings won't have a dollar-for-dollar impact on net income, as some gains will be reinvested in marketing, and other aspects of Coke's business. Yet the initial effects on margin bode well for a future in which foreign currencies will inevitably regain some ground against the U.S. dollar, thus making cost improvements more visible. Alongside earnings on Wednesday, Coca-Cola announced that it has entered into agreements with three U.S. bottlers as part of its goal to refranchise (sell back to other companies) one-half of its U.S. company-owned bottler volume by 2017.Formalizing the transaction, Coca-Cola issued letters of intent to bottlers in Chicago, Tampa, and Atlantic, Iowa, granting them exclusive rights to sell and distribute bottle-delivered Coca-Cola beverages within their geographic territories. In addition, Coca-Cola's U.S. bottling arm, Coca-Cola Refreshments, will sell off its local bottling assets to each partner.This deal is part of a larger effort to transform Coke into a company that's focused on brands as much as it is distribution. Coke still retains interests in bottling partners around the world in the form of equity investments and joint ventures, but owning less infrastructure should facilitate the beverage giant's quest to modernize its drink portfolio. Despite losing on currency differentials around the globe in 2015, Coca-Cola has continued to deliver the ample cash flow that its shareholders dearly prize. Cash from operations through the first three months of this year totaled nearly $8.4 billion.The company has already paid out $4.3 billion in dividends, and repurchased nearly $2.0 billion of its own shares so far this year. This was achieved through the use of the company's free cash flow, along with some proceeds of $4.1 billion in net debt issuance completed year to date. Coca-Cola updated full-year guidance Wednesday, and as expected, indicated no immediate relief from dollar strength. For the fourth quarter, management anticipates a currency headwind of six percentage points against net revenue, and 12 percentage points against operating income. For the total year, currency will drag on net revenue by seven points, and operating income by eleven points.While virtually all of 2015 has been clouded by the firm greenback, on the bright side, Coke is setting up easier comparisons for next year. In addition, the pay-off from its investments in smaller brands such as Monster, coupled with productivity discipline and aggressive brand marketing, should begin to manifest soon. At this point, however, we're likely looking at 2016 for such a boost.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Where organic revenues grew by 3% as it raised prices and sold a greater number of smaller packages, currency-adjusted sales resulted in a reported near-5% decline.The currency effect also had an impact on earnings. The beverage company generated per-share profits of $0.33, though after adjusting for one-time items like restructuring costs, they were $0.51 per share, a penny better than what Wall Street was expecting. Still, foreign exchange differences were a 12-percentage point hurdle it couldn't get over.Here are the highlights of Coke's most recent quarterly report:The dramatic difference in net income was the result of the various one-off transactions that occurred as adjusted earnings were down just 5% year over year.Currency fluctuations, however, will continue to have an impact on Coke going forward. Where it previously estimated it would represent a 6-point headwind on revenues and a 10-point one on operating income, that's now been revised upwards to 7 points and 11 points, respectively.This quarter, foreign exchange effects turned a 3% increase in sales in Asia-Pacific into an 11% decline. Organic revenues in Latin America went from jumping 14% to tumbling by a like amount, while Europe's sales were up 3% organically but down 7% after adjustments. The three markets account for a third of Coca-Cola's total revenue.Yet Coke still believes it is on course to return to its previous growth trajectory, with chairman and CEO Muhtar Kent saying in a statement: \"Our third-quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflect the continued execution of our strategic initiatives to restore momentum, which are beginning to take hold across our global business.\"But the return to normalcy isn't being driven by Coke's mainstay soda -- instead, still beverages like water, teas, and juices are leading the way.The strength of still beverages like Coca-Cola's Dasani brand helped lift global case volumes in the third quarter.Global unit case volumes rose 3% in the quarter, driven by a 6% rise in still beverage volumes and a 2% increase in sparkling beverages, but in North America, it was much the same as it's been for far too long: Soda sales continue to fall as sparkling beverages suffered a 1% decline in case volumes, this even though there were more selling days this quarter than last year.Although it enjoyed a 1% increase in Coca-Cola brand soda sales and a remarkable 8% increase in Coke Zero, that was offset by a similar percentage point decline in Diet Coke sales, which remain in a decade-long slump. Still, its new and expanded distribution partnership with  helped contribute to the gains as well.Coke also continues to streamline its business. As part of its plan to refranchise half of its volume delivered in the U.S. by bottlers it owns by the end of 2017, it separately announced it had reached agreement with three of them to expand their distribution territories in seven states.Coca-Cola's stock is largely unchanged in midday trading, undoubtedly reflecting the view that there's still a lot of work to be done, but it's going to be a long slog as the U.S. dollar stays strong, even if things do seem to mostly be moving in the right direction.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Last quarter, the company had delivered a negative earnings surprise of 12.22%. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters.Monster Beverage witnessed a period of major transition in the first half of 2015 as the company closed its deal with The Coca-Cola Company  in June and restructured its operating segments thereafter.The transition included the formation of a new segment called The Concentrate segment, which includes all the brands acquired from Coca-Cola. Under this segment, Monster manufactures and supplies concentrates or beverage base to bottling partners that produce and bottle the finished product. The addition of this high-margin concentrate segment drove gross margins in the second quarter of 2015, a trend which is likely to have continued in the third quarter of 2015 as well.Gross margins in the second quarter were driven by favorable changes in the product sales mix, higher production efficiencies and lower cost of some raw materials, particularly certain sweeteners. These tailwinds should boost results in the third quarter as well.Monster's revenues in the third quarter of 2015 are expected to gain traction from new products launched in the U.S in the past few quarters, solid international sales and growing momentum at the energy drink category.However, because of its growing international presence, its sales and profits are being hurt due to negative currency translations.Our proven model shows that Monster Beverage is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +1.24%, as the Most Accurate Estimate of 82 cents is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents.

Nine manufacturing facilities will be transferred to bottlers between 2016 and 2018.Coca-Cola continues to see a decline in soda sales in North America as consumers shift away from sugary drinks, but its global still (noncarbonated) beverage business is doing well.

Under the pact, Coke transferred ownership of its energy-drink business to Monster. In return, Monster transferred its non-energy-drink business to Coke.Earlier this month, a report on August beverage sales by Wells Fargo showed that Monster's dollar sales rose a solid 11.2% from a year earlier during the four-week period ending Sept. 5.

In some cases, companies engaged in mergers and acquisitions simply to enter fast-growing segments of the food and beverage sector, i.e. General Mills ()  and Campbells Soup () bought salsa and .Other deals, such as the merger between Kraft and Heinz (), were made to take advantage of synergies between companies and to increase their geographic and/or product diversity.The consolidation trend looks to be continuing, as shown by Anheuser-Busch\u2019s () rumored bid for SAB Miller (), as well as by a report that nut distributor Diamond Foods () has been in talks about selling itself to a So which food stocks should investors buy in an effort to take advantage of this trend?Within the sector, WhiteWave Foods, (WWAV), Hain Celestial (HAIN), Hormel Foods (HRL) and John B. Sanfilippo & Son (JBSS) all have characteristics that could make them attractive takeover targets in the near to medium-term.In addition to their status as potential M&A targets, all four food stocks have other positive attributes: WWAV and HAIN have strong growth prospects; HRL should benefit from  the world; and Nut distributor John B. Sanfilippo & Son is benefiting from the inclusion of nuts in a number of popular diets.Investors should buy all four of these food stocks.Widely seen as healthier than cow\u2019s milk, WhiteWave\u2019s  are category leaders. The increasing consumption of these products has enabled the company to grow rapidly; and in the second quarter, the company\u2019s net sales , while its per share earnings, excluding the impact of an acquisition in China and currency fluctuations, surged 16% year-over-year.WhiteWave\u2019s strong growth could appeal to food companies with large amounts of cash and product portfolios that are not appealing to younger generations. Companies in this category include Kellogg (), Campbell\u2019s, General Mills, ConAgra (), Coca-Cola () and Pepsi ().WhiteWave would be a particularly intriguing M&A target for Kellogg and Coca Cola, as well as French yogurt giant Danone ().Like , Kellogg\u2019s ; but unlike General Mills, it hasn\u2019t made any major acquisitions to rejuvenate its  yet. And Coca-Cola has shown in recent years that it is looking to aggressively expand its portfolio and add more popular products, having bought large stakes in Monster Beverage () and Keurig Green Mountain ().Danone  and buying WhiteWave would obviously make the French company a much bigger player here.Moreover, WhiteWave\u2019s subsidiary in China can grow, and it can expand into new markets in Asia, where soy milk consumption has . (The company has a subsidiary in Hong Kong and it has a 49% stake in a joint venture in China, but it does not appear to have entered other Asian countries.) A huge corporation that already has distribution capabilities in Asia would facilitate WhiteWave\u2019s entrance into new Asian markets.And as William Blar analyst Jon Andersen pointed out on Sept. 4, WhiteWave\u2019s results should become even more attractive \u201c.\u201dEven if WhiteWave is not acquired, strong growth and tremendous potential make WWAV one of the most attractive food stocks in the market.Andersen also expects Hain Celestial, another organic food maker, to benefit from accelerated household formation by the millenials.Like WhiteWave, Hain Celestial has one of the highest growth rates in the food sector.

It predicted that its net sales would increase 10% to 15%, while its EPS is expected to rise 12% to 20%.HAIN stock has not been one of the better food stocks this year, as the shares have given back about 8% in 2015. Investors are probably worried about the weak performance of the company\u2019s sizable U.K. operations and its lack of organic (no pun intended) growth.However, the food maker\u2019s guidance indicates that it is well positioned for strong growth going forward, and, as Andersen points out, HAIN stock should benefit from the growth in popularity of organic food.Another attractive food stock for both retail investors and conglomerates looking for growth opportunities is Hormel.Trading at a market cap of around $17 billion after its stock doubled since the beginning of 2013, Hormel would be an expensive M&A target. But some buyers, including Berkshire Hathaway (, ), private equity firms and Chinese conglomerates that could obtain massive loans from Chinese banks, could possibly afford to pay $21 billion or a bit more to buy Hormel. is expected to rise strongly over the long-term, making protein producers an attractive investment. (That trend was the motivating factor behind the takeover of pork producer Smithfield Foods by a Chinese company in 2013 and Tyson Foods\u2019 () $7.7 billion acquisition of Hillishire Brands last year. )Meanwhile, a number of acquisitions by Hormel in recent years have enabled it to move , such as spam and pepperoni, and into more healthy, exotic and snack-oriented areas. The consumption of natural/organic, snacking, and more exotic foods have all become .Hormel acquired guacamole maker Wholly Guacamole in 2011, bought Skippy peanut butter in 2013 and acquired Muscle Milk-maker CytoSport in 2014. The latter company \u201caddresses nutritional opportunities,\u201d i.e. protein enhancement, Food Business News quoted Hormel CEO Jeffrey Ettinger as saying recently. Of course,  for millennials and many others in the U.S. And this year, Hormel looked to capitalize on the natural/organic trend by buying Applegate Farms, which develops natural and organic processed meats and poultry products.So any company that buys Hormel could benefit from increased consumption of protein around the world, while obtaining several units whose products are exactly in-line with major trends.Nuts are a component of  America\u2019s eight most popular diets: The Mediterranean Diet, the Raw Food diet, The Zone Diet, the Vegan Diet and the Vegetarian Diet..So it\u2019s not surprising that nut distributor John B. Sanfilippo & Son has been doing well. The company\u2019s  in its fourth quarter ended in June vs. the same period a year earlier, while sales rose 9% year-over-year. In all of fiscal 2015, its net sales surged 14%.JBSS stock jumped 67% over the last year, but its market cap is only $600 million, making it an easy food stock to digest for companies in the sector that are saddled with unpopular products.And even if it\u2019s not acquired, the company offers investors strong growth and one of the most attractive performances of any food stock in the market.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["everage giants,  and  , are reportedly fighting to buy a stake in the Greek yogurt maker, Chobani.Chobani was founded by its current CEO, Hamdi Ulukaya, in 2005. The company uses only natural ingredients to make Greek yogurts. The company's first Greek yogurt cup was launched in 2007.The investment could value Chobani at as much as $3 billion, according to Reuters which was the first to report the news. Reportedly, Chobani is looking to sell a minority stake to expand its supply chain and geographical reach of its new products. Other companies apart from Pepsi and Coca-Cola are also reportedly in talks with Chobani regarding an investment.Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi have been investing in emerging consumer categories to diversify their product portfolios beyond sodas that are witnessing declining sales of late.In 2015, Coca-Cola increased its stake in specialty coffee retailer Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.  to 16% and bought 16.7% stake in energy drink maker, Monster Beverage Corporation  .With Keurig Green Mountain, Coca-Cola has an innovative partnership under which the former will exclusively make and sell Coca-Cola branded single-serve pods for use on its Keurig Cold at-home beverage system. The deal opens up an exciting new packaging format for Coca-Cola's brands. Under the deal with Monster, Coca-Cola swapped its global energy drink business with the former's non-energy drink business. These strategic investments will help Coca-Cola adapt to changing consumer trends while accelerating innovation.In addition, Coca-Cola has a 50% equity interest in Aujan Industries Company, one of the largest independent beverage companies in the Middle East.Pepsi is also exploring newer categories like dairy with the Wimm-Bill-Dann acquisition in Russia, a joint venture (JV) with Almarai in the Middle East and the Muller Quaker Dairy JV in the U.S.Growing health and wellness consciousness - consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concern - is hurting the sales of carbonated beverages of Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. Among carbonated soft drinks, the cola segment, in particular, has come under fire as consumers are opting for alternative beverage offerings. The diet colas are also under pressure due to increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Acquiring a stake in Chobani should help the beverage giants to gain from the growing demand for yogurts as Americans become increasingly health conscious. However, we believe the investment would prove more beneficial for Coca-Cola as it is solely focused on beverages. On the other hand, rival Pepsi's massive snacks business - accounting for just over half of the sales - gives it the much needed diversification.Both Pepsi and Coca-Cola have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Mexico passed the tax in 2013, which adds a 1-peso charge, or about $0.06 to bottlers for every liter of sugar-sweetened soft drinks distributed, adding about 10% to the price.According to researchers from the University of North Carolina, soda sales in Mexico fell 6% last year, and the decline accelerated over the course of the year, reaching 12% in December. The study also noted that the drop-off was most pronounced among low-income Mexicans, falling by as much as 17% and suggesting that the tax itself was the cause for declining sales and not publicity or changing attitudes.Mexican Coke isn't flying off the shelves as fast as it used to.Though the effects of a small tax south of the border may be dismissed by some industry advocates, Mexico is no ordinary country when it comes to the soda wars. Our neighbors to the south have embraced American eating habits more than any other nation. In 2013, it became the most obese country in the world, passing the United States, and also led the world in soda consumption as of 2011. At that time, its per-capita consumption was 163 liters a year, or 40% greater than the U.S. With a population of 122 million, Mexico is also one of the highest global consumers of the fizzy stuff. That high consumption rate and the obesity and health epidemics like diabetes and heart disease that sprang from it are exactly what prompted the soda tax in the first place. Now, health advocates in the U.S. see a strong argument for imposing such a tax stateside.It's become trite by now to draw analogies between soda and cigarettes, but the latest evidence from Mexico ties the two even more closely together. Cigarette taxes went through similar political battles as tobacco companies fought fiercely against them, but the evidence is clear. Cigarette taxes, which range as high as $4.35 a pack in New York at the state level and $6.16 in Chicago at the local level, have had a pronounced effect on sales. A 10% increase in cigarette prices on average leads to a consumption decline of 3-5% and has the added bonus of deterring kids from ever trying smoking in the first place.Currently, the only soda tax in effect in the U.S. is in Berkeley, Calif. The penny-an-ounce tax was passed overwhelmingly last year, and brought in a $116,000 in revenue for the small city in its first month in March. However, a recent study by Cornell and the University of Iowa found the tax was often ignored, and in many cases less than half of the cost was being passed on to consumers. The researchers found that in the case of Coke and Pepsi, only 22% of the tax was being passed on. One problem could be concerns about cross-border competition as vendors may be worried that their customers can simply visit one of Berkeley's neighbors to avoid the tax. Overall, however, researchers say Mexico's tax offers a much more conclusive result than Berkeley's.With other municipalities threatening to follow in Berkeley's footsteps, soda consumption is only likely to continue declining as health concerns mount.In the face of falling favor for their trademark product, Coke and Pepsi have done the logical thing and diversified away from soda. Coke has taken steps to branch out including making investments in  and  while Pepsi counts major food brands such as Tropicana, Frito-Lay, and Quaker under its corporate umbrella. Just this week, both Pepsi and Coke were said to be battling to take stakes in greek yogurt-maker Chobani, though Coke has since backed out, saying it prefers to stay within beverages.Both soda giants have seen the light. Though carbonated drinks will continue to generate gobs of cash flow for each of these corporate titans, future growth will have to come from outside of soda.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

However, with the right perspective, managing your money becomes a lot simpler.Here are six points that will change how you think about money. The S&P 500 -- an index that has been tracking the performance of 500 large American companies for more than a century -- gained an average of 10.77% each year between 1871 and 2014. An investment of $1 in the S&P 500 in 1871 would have been worth $2.25 million at the end of 2014.Taking a more realistic look at the past 40 years, the annualized return of the S&P 500 between 1974 and 2014 was 11.08% -- right in line with the historical average. It's a similar story between 1934 and 1974, when the index turned in annualized returns of 9.49%. Even between 1894 and 1934 -- a period that ended in the middle of the Great Depression -- its annualized returns were 7.32%.The message is clear: For people with an investing horizon of decades -- which applies to you whether you're fresh out of college or settling into your career in your mid-30's -- you'll be hard-pressed to find an investment vehicle more likely to deliver solid long-term returns than the stock market. Oftentimes some of the best future investments are right in front of us in our daily lives. Among the top 15 best-performing stocks of the past decade are  (up 1,306%), energy drink juggernaut  (up 2,194%), specialty coffeemaker  (up 2,038%),  (up 2,749%), and online travel deals pioneer  (up 6,190%). There's a good chance you regularly see (or use) the products and services of these businesses, which have delivered astounding gains for patient investors who bought and held shares for 10 years. It will likely be a similar story for the best-performing stocks over the next decade.The lesson here is that investing doesn't have to be complicated. Stick with investing in an index fund (such as one that tracks the S&P 500) or investing in companies that you know, love, and understand. Thanks to resources like the Internet, consumers are arguably more empowered and informed than ever before.Your knowledge as a consumer can help you as an investor, too. If you pay attention to products, services, and trends around you, there's a good chance you can make use of your observations and experiences when you're considering whether or not to invest in a company. (Legendary investor Peter Lynch would get investment ideas when he took his family to the mall and saw which stores and products caught their eye.)If you think buying stocks is difficult, think again. Opening a  (and funding that account) doesn't take long at all -- and we're here to help. Let's say you start investing with a lump sum of $1,000 and then routinely invest another $500 each year for the next 30 years. This means that after 30 years, you would have invested a total of $16,000. If you're investing in a low-cost stock market index fund, history shows that over several decades, you can expect to earn an average return of 8% per year or more. Given an average 8% annual return, your $16,000 investment would be worth $71,235.59 after 30 years.To gain wealth, the single most important thing you can do is invest your money over a period of many years in order to maximize the effect of compound interest. Motley Fool columnist Morgan Housel  this with the story of Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world: Thankfully, young people are beginning to think more proactively about college expenses. According to the College Savings Foundation, 51% of high school students are already saving for a college education, and 83% of those savers have already set aside $1,000 or more in 2015.Although fewer students are planning to borrow to pay for college this year compared to 2014, the College Savings Foundation says 65% of those borrowers need to borrow more than a quarter of their total higher education cost. More than half of these prospective student borrowers are expecting it to take at least six to 10 years to pay off the loans.And the overall student loan picture isn't getting much prettier. The average class of 2015 graduate with debt has more than $35,000 in student loan debt to pay back, which is a record amount of indebtedness. And 71% of those receiving a bachelor's degree have a student loan upon graduating, a number that has been steadily rising each year and is now at an all-time high.According to NerdWallet, of the U.S. households that have debt, the average household credit debt is $15,863. Credit card fees cost the U.S. $90.3 billion in 2014, up from $43 billion in 2004.Dealing with debt? Take a look at our  to getting out of debt. Thanks to the power of compound interest, it doesn't take a lot of money to start investing and grow your wealth until you're ready to retire in comfort. Investing $100 every month for 30 years and earning an average annual return of 7% (below the historical average return of the stock market) will leave you with more than $122,700 after 30 years. To boost that number, you can always save and invest more and/or lengthen your time horizon. Investing $100 a month for another 10 years (so 40 years in total) and earning that same 7% return would  to $264,012. As you can see, an extra few years of investing can make a difference of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Time is your greatest advantage when it comes to investing and ensuring financial freedom over the course of your life. The earlier you start saving and investing and let compound interest take full effect over years and decades, the better off you will be when you hit retirement or need those funds.  Whether you start with $50, $500, or $10,000, it really doesn't matter. The key is to  .

The acquisition of Seattle, WA-based Sahale Snacks, Inc. in Sep 2014 is also expected to contribute to fiscal first quarter 2016 sales.However, lower coffee volumes owing to higher  and weakness in K-cup sales remain concerns for Smucker. Though Smucker announced a cut in coffee prices in July, which will ultimately ease volume declines, the company expects the impact of reduced coffee costs to be evident from the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

Quincey will be responsible for the company's entire operating units across the globe and report to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Muhtar Kent.Quincey played a vital role in the proposed merger of three of Coca-Cola's European bottlers - Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.  , Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetranke AG - to form the world's largest independent Coca-Cola bottler, Coca-Cola European Partners Plc.Quincey has worked with Coca-Cola for as long as 19 years and even held the position of the president in the company's Europe Group. His responsibility had then included its business across 38 European countries. Despite macroeconomic headwinds in the region, Coca-Cola's European business had consistently reported strong revenue growth during his tenure.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company also announced that Ahmet Bozer, Executive Vice President and President of Coca-Cola International, will retire in Mar 2016.Many investors speculate that Quincey will eventually succeed the present Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent.

San Diego-based Suja Juice, the second most promising company according to Forbes, is known for its breakthrough High Pressure Processing (HPP) technology that preserves maximum nutrition and taste.Suja currently distributes in around 13,000 retail outlets nationwide. Suja offers three handcrafted lines of organic juices - Suja Classic, Suja Elements and Suja Essentials. Further, Suja Essentials, the company's lowest-priced offering at around $4 per bottle, launched in June 2014 has been a big hit with retailers and consumers.Per the agreement, Suja will continue to serve its existing customers and Coca Cola will venture into new channels for expanding the distribution network. The combined force of Suja with Coca-Cola North America's Venturing and Emerging Brands (VEB) are expected to enhance the brand equity of growing brands like Honest Tea and ZICO.The stake at Suja will strengthen Coca Cola's already rich portfolio and help it bolster its presence in the juice category. Coca Cola also commented that Suja's trend of nutrient-rich, organic juices perfectly complements its Natural Health Beverage (NHB) portfolio. Consumer tastes are shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters. The stake buy will help the Cola giant to expand in the premium juice category which is growing at about 15% annually.Sales of the Coca Cola's carbonated beverages are suffering due to increasing health consciousness among consumers. Though the company has relied heavily on its carbonated beverages, increasing health consciousness among consumers has compelled Coca-Cola to slowly expand its portfolio of still beverages to give it the necessary diversification.Moreover, Coca-Cola, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) made equity investments in smaller companies like a 16% stake in specialty coffee retailer, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.  ; and a 16.7% stake in energy drink maker, Monster Beverage Corporation  , to enhance growth in key categories.Investors interested in the beverage sector can also consider Cott Corporation  carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In spite of significant currency headwinds, rising volatility in global markets and declining demand for their calorie loaded sodas, this outperformance was driven primarily by aggressive marketing initiatives, cost containment and productivity improvements. The shares of these three bellwethers witnessed a decent run too.Pepsi has delivered positive earnings and sales surprises for six straight quarters. The ongoing global macro challenges notwithstanding, Pepsi did well in 2014 and continued to perform well in 2015thanks to its strong snacks business, increased pricing, better execution, cost savings/productivity gainsand brand building investments.Moreover, Pepsi raised the full-year earnings guidance along with the second quarter release, encouraged by strong year-to-date performance and a positive outlook.The maker of Pepsi soft drinks and Lay's chips is boosting in-store merchandising capabilities, the effectiveness of go-to-market systems in the international markets and identifying new productivity projects. The company has increased investments in social and digital marketing as well as advertising efficiency by focusing more on consumer-facing activity.The company's advertising and marketing plans and innovation efforts are paying off. These initiatives helped the company to deliver an overall healthy performance in 2013 and 2014 - either achieving or exceeding most of its financial goals - despite the tough macroeconomic environment. The momentum continued in the first half of 2015 with the company performing well in both the quarters.The share price of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has soared more than 15% year to date. Pepsi enjoys a competitive advantage over rivals Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper, as it sells both snacks and beverages which are complementary food categories.Sustaining its exceptional 2014 performance, Dr Pepper delivered solid top- and bottom-line results in the first half of 2015 on the back of pricing gains, innovations, powerful marketing programs and productivity improvements. Ignoring currency headwinds, the company raised the 2015 sales and earnings expectations on the second quarter conference call, backed by a stronger-than-expected first-half performance.The share price of this Zacks Rank #2 (Hold) company also rose more than 15% year to date. With a strong dollar reducing the value of international currency, Dr Pepper's relatively less exposure to foreign markets insulates it from a volatile currency environment, though only for the short term.Coca-Cola delivered positive earnings and sales surprises in both the first-half quarters.Better-than-expected sales and profits in the first half were backed by early signs of improvement from its aggressive cost-cutting/productivity and strategic initiatives. Savings from its productivity programs are being used to fund marketing programs and innovation, which in turn is slowly but steadily re-accelerating top-line growth, expanding margins and boosting returns on capital.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's disciplined quality advertising investments led to improved volume growth in the first half of 2015, especially in North America.Amid a volatile macroeconomic environment and significant currency headwinds, the soda biggies are expected to hold their own in the second half given consumer focused innovation, brand building investments, better marketplace execution, pricing actions and productivity gains.Having said that, weakening international currencies and economic slowdown in some countries will continue to weigh upon the macroeconomic environment. With a significant portion of their revenues coming from outside the U.S., sales/profits of Pepsi and Coca-Cola are being affected by the weakening of many emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar.Persistent challenges in many key emerging/developing markets like Brazil, Russia and China will dampen to an extent the strength of the U.S. economy.Moreover, headwinds from the carbonated soft drink (CSD) category are expected to continue. Soda giants are being held morally responsible over the role their carbonated sugary drinks have played in increasing the nation's obesity rates. These companies have been witnessing declining sales of CSDs over the past few years.Diet drinks haven't escaped the scanner either due to increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.As consumers grow more health conscious, the companies are also realizing the need to move beyond the sugar-laden fizzy can. So beverage companies are shifting away from high-calorie carbonated beverages toward healthier products like juices, energy and sports drinks.Moreover, these companies are offering more choices in package sizes, sweeteners and beverages, including low- and no-calorie selections. They're making drinks with evolutionary natural sweeteners and flavorings to cut calories. Coca-Cola has launched Coca-Cola Life, a naturally sweetened mid-calorie cola, across the U.S. and certain markets in Europe. Pepsi also has plans to launch lower calorie, naturally sweetened non-cola products in the U.S. this year. Additionally, an aspartame-free Diet Pepsi product is expected to be launched this month to meet the growing demand for food/drinks without artificial sweeteners.Soda companies are also buying equity stakes in smaller companies in order to diversify and grow positions in beverage categories. Coca-Cola has made a 16% equity investment in specialty coffee retailer, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.  and bought a 16.7% stake in energy drink maker, Monster Beverage Corporation  . Very recently, Dr Pepper agreed to purchase an almost 12% equity stake in BA Sports Nutrition, which owns the premium sports drink brand Bodyarmor to enter the fast growing sports drink market.Though we are encouraged by the overall growth of these beverage makers in the first half, sustaining the momentum through the rest of the year will largely depend on how they deal with the rising global uncertainty, increasing negative currency impact and CSD category headwinds.As a reminder, the soda biggies outperformed in the first half of 2014 as well. While Pepsi and Dr Pepper could sustain the momentum in the second half, Coca-Cola failed to do so due to volume deceleration in key international markets like China and Europe.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company has basked in the afterglow of its distribution deal with  since last year, when the transaction was announced. Under the terms of this partnership, which was finally concluded in June, Monster handed over its non-energy drink brands, including Hansen's Natural Sodas, Peace Tea, and Hubert's Lemonade, to Coca-Cola, in exchange for Coke's energy drink line, which features names such as NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, and Relentless.July turned about to be a pretty decent month for beverage companies across the board. After both Coca-Cola and  reported solid earnings in the third week of July, investors began bidding up shares of Monster in earnest, ahead of its August 6 reporting date: data by  .Monster's own earnings when released reflected the transformation of its business as it scales into Coke's global distribution system. The company reported a 62.4% increase in net income during the second quarter, but this was largely due to a $161.5 million gain associated with the transfer of its non-energy drink business to Coke. More pertinently, net sales improved by only 1%, to $693.7 million, as the company underwent growing pains in migrating its distribution from previous supply chain partners to Coca-Cola.Per analysis provided by Monster with its earnings release, in the first half of the year, the combined effect of accelerated deferred revenue recognition (positive $39.8 million), distribution termination and transaction costs (negative $233 million), and the nearly $162 million gain discussed above has resulted in a total drag from the transaction on net operating income of just $32 million.The realization that the operating effects of the Coke deal so far aren't enormous, coupled with CEO Rodney Sack's earnings release statement that the company has already transitioned 89% of domestic distribution rights to Coke, provided an offsetting narrative to the lack of revenue growth. As if in relief, Monster stock gained nearly 3% the day after its earnings release. Looking ahead to the second half of 2015, investors will want to keep their eyes on Monster's continuing transition into global markets within the Coca-Cola distribution system, a process that won't be nearly as smooth or quick as the domestic changeover. In particular, the next couple of quarters should begin to throw into relief the balance between international revenue growth and the currency effects of a strong U.S. dollar, as Monster begins to sell a greater percentage of its portfolio overseas. And hopefully for shareholders, the most complex parts of the Coke transaction are now completed, making top-line growth -- not to mention comparisons with prior quarters -- a bit easier.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change.

Excluding the currency impact, second-quarter earnings of 63 cents per share increased 6% as improved organic sales made up for softer margins. Organic sales increased 4% driven by positive pricing and improved volumes as a result of incremental media investments.Early signs of improvement from the productivity and strategic initiatives led to better-than-expected results in both the quarters.The company increased its marketing focus in 2014 and 2015 through incremental media investments to fund brands globally and aggressive marketing campaigns like Share a Coke to accelerate top-line growth. The company's disciplined quality advertising investments led to improved volume growth in the first half of 2015, especially in North America.Management expects 2015 to be a \"transition year\" - a time to start implementing changes to create a new operating model.In Oct 2014, Coca-Cola unveiled strategic actions to drive better profit growth in 2015. Other than aggressively cutting costs, the plan includes disciplined brand and growth investments as well as aligning incentive plans. The company is also re-franchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories to create a more efficient system. It closed several transactions in 2014 and plans to complete two-thirds of the re-franchising by 2017-end which should improve margins and drive growth.Moreover, Coca-Cola has made equity investments in smaller companies like 16% in specialty coffee retailer, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.  , and 16.7% stake in energy drink maker, Monster Beverage Corporation  , to enhance growth in key categories. Coca-Cola also has an innovative partnership with Keurig Green Mountain under which the latter will exclusively make Coca-Cola branded single-serve pods that can be used on its upcoming Keurig Cold at-home beverage system. The deal opens up an exciting packaging format for Coca-Cola's brands.Under the deal with Monster, Coca-Cola swapped its global energy drink business with Monster's non-energy drink business.These strategic investments will help Coca-Cola adapt to the changing consumer trends while accelerating innovation.However, though these initiatives benefited first-half results, management believes that a lot needs to be done to deliver the desired results amid challenging global macro conditions and significant changes at the company.Management expects the macroeconomic environment to remain volatile in the second half as well. While the macro environment is improving in the U.S., management expects persistent challenges in many key emerging/developing markets like Brazil, Russia and China.Moreover, weak CSD volumes and currency headwinds remain the persistent challenges. With more than half of its revenues coming from outside the U.S., Coca-Cola's sales/profits are being significantly affected by the weakening of many emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar.

The quarter marked a major transition period for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, as it closed the deal with The Coca-Cola Company  , or TCCC, in June and restructured its operating segments.This quarter, the energy drink company's earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate - for the second quarter in a row. Earnings of 79 cents per share fell 3.7% year over year. Net sales of $693.7 million increased a mere 0.9%, having suffered from currency headwinds, low distributors' inventory levels due to changes in distribution rights and uncertainty of independent international distributors outside the Coca-Cola network.However, gross margins were impressive, driven by lower commodity costs and a high-margin concentrate segment. Moreover, net sales outside the U.S. increased year over year in the quarter. Strong sales were reported particularly in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Under the long-term strategic deal, Coca-Cola acquired an approximately 16.7% equity stake in Monster. Coca Cola transferred the ownership of its global energy drinks business, which includes brands like NOS, Full Throttle, Ultra and Burn, to Monster Beverage, making the latter Coca-Cola's exclusive energy play. On the other hand, Monster Beverage transferred its non-energy business to TCCC, which includes Hansen natural sodas and juice products, Peace Tea and Hubert Lemonade. Monster Beverage is presently in discussion with Coca-Cola bottlers across the globe.This deal should significantly expand Monster's presence in the international energy drinks market where it currently has a limited presence. Moreover, the brands acquired from TCCC, which are produced as concentrates or beverage bases, are high-margin products. Most importantly, Monster Beverage's cash position received a major boost from the deal and its board of directors is considering a suitable return of capital strategy, such as share repurchases.Investors interested in the beverage industry may consider Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  and Cott Corporation  .

Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetr\u00e4nke AG is a German beverage company owned by Coke.Per the merger, Coca-Cola Enterprises' shareholders will receive one Coca-Cola European Partners share and one-time cash payment of $14.50 per share.Coca-Cola Enterprises will hold 48% stake, Coca-Cola Iberian Partners will own 34% with Coke commanding the remaining 18% in the new bottling company.Coca-Cola European Partners will be the largest independent Coca-Cola bottler in terms of revenues - combined pro-forma 2015 revenues of about $12.6 billion. With more than 50 bottling plants, Coca-Cola European Partners will serve over 300 million consumers across 13 Western European countries, including Andorra, Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands.With its increased scale, Coca-Cola European Partners should realize substantial synergies from supply chain savings and better operating efficiencies. The synergies are extimated to culminate into annualized pre-tax savings of $350-$375 million within three years of closing.Coca-Cola European Partners will be headquartered in London and trade on the Euronext Amsterdam, the New York Stock Exchange and the Madrid Stock Exchange.

The merger is the latest in Coca-Cola's strategy of combining its smaller bottling operations to form larger companies to improve efficiency and cut costs.In November, last year, Coke formed an agreement with South African bottler, SABMiller, and Gutsche Family Investments, to merge their bottling operations in southern and eastern Africa to form Coca-Cola Beverages Africa which would be the largest Coca-Cola bottler on the continent.

Soft revenues and weak margins dented profit during the quarter. The figure, however, matched the higher end of management's guidance range of 75 cents to 80 cents.Keurig Green Mountain's quarterly net sales decreased 5% year over year to $970 million due to decline in sales of pods as well as brewers and accessories. Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.5 percentage points (pp). Sales declined 4% on a constant currency basis. Net sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 billion by 7.6%.

Gross margin shrank 750 basis points (bps) to 36.0% of net sales. Obsolescence of finished inventory related to Keurig 2.0 had a negative impact of $18 million on margins during the quarter.KeurigGreen Mountain's much-hyped Keurig 2.0 brewer launched in August 2014 was not received well by consumers, especially because of the high price tag. Also, the unlicensed pods that consumers have been using for so long are not compatible with this brewer.Operating income plunged 28% to $176.3 million. Adjusted operating margin declined 560 bps to 18.2% due to lower gross margins and higher selling, general and administrative ratio.Approximately 94% of third-quarter fiscal 2015 net sales came from Keurig Single-Cup Brewers, pods and Keurig-related accessories, while bagged coffee, fractional packs and the Canadian office coffee services business accounted for the rest.Net sales of  slipped 1% year over year to $815.0 million as a result of negative product mix (8 pp) and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates (1 pp).Net sales of  slipped 26% year over year to $95.0 million due to an 18% decline in volume.

Net sales however increased a mere 0.9% year over year.Net sales were hurt by currency headwinds, low inventory levels maintained by the distributors due to changes in distribution rights and uncertainty of independent international distributors outside of The Coca-Cola network.Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of $23.9 million on net sales. Net sales outside the U.S. increased 2% year over year to $151.3 million in the quarter, particularly in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. However, sales in Spain, South Africa and Italy were impacted by the transition process of the deal closure. From second-quarter 2015 onwards, Monster Beverage has reported its results under three operating and reportable segments. The three segments include Finished Products, Concentrate, and Other. The Finished Products segment includes the former DSD segments excluding Peach Tea and Monster Energy drink products. The segment reported net sales of $651.2 million, up 1.2% year over year. Despite the year-over-year increase, net sales were hurt by unfavorable foreign currency. The Concentrate segment includes brands acquired from TCCC. Net sales of the Concentrate segment were $13 million for the time period between the close of the deal and the end of the quarter. The Other segment includes the former warehouse segment and the Peach Tea brand. Net sales of the Other segment declined 32.6% to $29.5 million for the quarter.Second-quarter 2015 adjusted gross margin rose 170 basis points (bps) to 56.9%, attributable to favorable changes in product sales mix, and a decrease in cost of some raw materials. Moreover, gross margin expansion was driven mostly by higher sales at the high-margin Concentrate segment.Excluding deferred revenues and distributed termination expense, adjusted operating income increased 5% to $228.4 million. Operating margin was 32.9%, up 130 bps year over year.Monster Beverage's legal expenses during the quarter were $3.5 million, down from $4.9 million in the prior quarter.Effective tax rate in the quarter was 37.3%, higher than 34.7% in the prior-year quarter, owing to reduction in some tax benefits.Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors interested in the beverage industry can also consider Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  and Cott Corporation  .

Second-quarter profits jumped 22% to $0.71 per share, but that was largely the result of completing a partnership with  , through which Coca-Cola took a 16.7% stake in the energy-drinks maker. That move added $1.4 billion to results. Without the gain, earnings would have been $0.63 per share, still up over 8% from the year ago period, and still beating analyst expectations of $0.60 per share.However, last year's earnings were depressed as a result of refranchising Coca-Cola's bottling operations, so on an apples-to-apples basis, earnings were down 1.5% year over year. Because it's been able to take advantage of pricing opportunities when they presented themselves, and coupled with higher concentrate shipments, Coca-Cola was able to report that revenues grew 4% higher in the quarter.Management laid out a strategy over a year ago to price its products in relation to the value its brand should command. Doing so at the same time consumers were moving to smaller package sizes helped the beverage maker gain the benefit of both pricing and product mix, which helped offset weakness in much of the rest of its business.International markets, where it generates over half of all its revenues, were hit by the strong U.S. dollar, and that's not likely to change soon. Coca-Cola's worst market was seemingly Latin America, where operating revenue fell 13% year over year to $973 million. Eurasia and Africa were down another 10% to $658 million. However, absent currency fluctuations, the picture looked a lot different.For example, changes in currency exchange rates swiped 24% from Coca-Cola's results in Latin America; organic revenue growth was up 11%. Eurasia and Africa suffered a 13% decline as a result of currency effects, but organic revenue growth there was otherwise up 4%.The strong U.S. dollar will continue wreaking havoc on Coke's earnings, and it says it expects foreign currency exchange rates to have an unfavorable impact on its reported results for the year, namely: As has come to be expected, Coca-Cola's still-beverage portfolio continues to outperform sparkling beverages with a 4% volume increase in North America and an overall gain of 5% because of strong improvement in Europe, Eurasia, and Africa.Importantly, in the North American ready-to-drink business, Coca-Cola reported gaining value and volume share across both still and sparkling beverages, as both juice and juice drinks and bottled water saw hefty volume gains. Also as expected, Diet Coke continues to fade, with volumes down 7% in the quarter. That follows a 6% decline in the first quarter and a 6% drop for all of 2014, suggesting consumers are rejecting the artificially flavored soft drink at an accelerating rate.Although Diet Coke remains the No. 1 diet soda in the U.S. and management says its goal is to eventually get the brand's revenues to flatten before they move higher again, it seems a bit of wishful thinking at this point. Coca-Cola believes it'll be able to gain some traction from  's changing its own diet-drink formula later this year (perhaps recalling its own spectacular failure with New Coke), but the company does admit that \"it's a work in progress and [there's] a lot more work to do.\" Coca-Cola's gains this quarter caught many analysts by surprise, but even Coca-Cola recognizes it still has its work cut out for it. The company does have a vast and growing portfolio of  in its favor, and with consumer preferences moving toward still beverages, where much of that portfolio resides, it has a bright future yet.Moreover, the Coca-Cola brand itself remains one of the most valuable in the world, and with its namesake soda still as popular as ever, this lull in performance should be seen as temporary.The Motley Fool's mission is to help the world invest, better.

Thanks to a growing energy drink market and major sales growth, MNST has been one of the fastest growing companies in the non-alcoholic beverage industry, and has seen the company's stock price more than double in the last year.Despite health-risk claims against energy drinks and a decline in the sales of traditional carbonated beverages, MNST has been able to enjoy great success in the recent past, even with other companies such as Coca-Cola  and Pepsi  deal with declining sales and popularity in their iconic sodas.Investor anticipation has been growing in the time leading up to the company's second quarter earnings report, with high levels of interest coming about in regards to how MNST's recently closed deal with Coca-Cola with affect MNST's earnings. Expectations have remained high for MNST, as the company has beaten earnings in 3 of its last 4 quarters.MNST is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), but that ranking could be on the move after the results of its latest earnings report. Below are several key highlights that have been taken from this recently released report: Monster was unable to reach the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.90. MNST reported an actual EPS of $0.79 for the quarter. (These figures take out stock option expenses) MNST also missed on revenue estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue was $752.9 million, and MNST reported actual revenue of only $693.7 million. Operating expenses for the quarter excluding distributor termination costs and transaction expenses were $166.1 million, higher than $161.9 million for the same quarter last year.

Last quarter, it posted a negative surprise of 8.82%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The carbonated soft drinks category has remained soft over the past few years. However, energy drinks, within this category, has been gaining traction. Monster Beverage's second-quarter 2015 top line should benefit from growing momentum at the energy drink category. The company's revenues are also expected to gain traction from new products launched in the U.S in the past few quarters and solid international sales.Gross margin is gaining from favorable changes in the product sales mix, higher production efficiencies and decrease in cost of some raw materials, particularly certain sweeteners. These tailwinds are expected to drive gross margin in the upcoming quarter as well.However, Monster Beverage's profitability in the second quarter will be hurt by the expenses related to the execution of its long-term deal with The Coca-Cola Company  and unfavorable foreign currency.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Monster Beverage is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The company's Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand on par at 90 cents. Though Monster Beverage Corporation's Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes a surprise prediction difficult.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies in the consumer staples sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Kellogg Company  with an Earnings ESP of +4.40% and a Zacks Rank #3.SUPERVALU Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +14.29% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Image: Monster Beverage.In the beverage industry, there's been a huge shift away from the carbonated drinks that ruled the roost for decades. In their place, energy drinks have become ascendant, and  has capitalized with one of the most impressive share-price performances of the past decade. Coming into its second-quarter financial report on Thursday, Monster Beverage stock is already at all-time highs, having more than doubled in just the past year, and investors have extremely high expectations that the energy-drink giant will be able to continue the impressive run of fast-paced growth that has put the company where it is today. Let's take an early look at where Monster Beverage is and what you can expect from its results later this week.\n  \nSource: Yahoo! Finance. In recent months, investors have had a rare crisis of confidence about Monster Beverage earnings, cutting their second-quarter estimates by a nickel per share and reducing full-year 2015 projections by about 2%. The stock, though, survived an early hiccup well and is up another 14% since late April.That early hiccup came in May, when Monster Beverage announced its first-quarter results. For the first time in a long while, Monster failed to top earnings expectations, missing the consensus forecast by a nickel per share. Sales gains also fell below the 10% level, making investors nervous about Monster's long-term prospects for accelerating growth. The stock plunged more than 10% the day after the announcement, and some investors worried that the ongoing partnership with  was distracting Monster from focusing on its organic growth opportunities.Fortunately, Monster closed on its latest deal with Coca-Cola in June, and so the energy-drink giant can finally work on consolidating its stranglehold over the industry. As part of the deal, Monster got all of Coca-Cola's energy-drink lines, while Monster gave Coca-Cola its tea, juice, lemonade, and natural-soda lines. Monster also received a valuable cash payment of $2.15 billion in connection with the deal, and Coca-Cola now has a one-sixth stake in Monster going forward.The health of the energy-drink market seems stronger than ever. Even though some health concerns have plagued the industry, sales of energy drinks could climb by more than half by 2019, according to research from Mintel. Although young adults currently make up the primary customer base for the market, parents have also increasingly turned to energy drinks, and Monster has a strong opportunity to capture its share of a growing market going forward. In particular, Coca-Cola's worldwide distribution capabilities will give Monster a leg up on other small rivals and allow it to compete more effectively against the other beverage giants in the global industry.Still, Monster is facing some challenges. In India, health regulators banned Monster's products, saying that combining ginseng with caffeine wasn't permissible. Monster asserted that its products use minimal amounts of ginseng but is preparing to try to sell ginseng-free products in India, but even though the Indian market is quite small for Monster, the ban is an unfortunate sign of how the company's global expansion will inevitably run into some roadblocks along the way.In the Monster Beverage report, listen for what the company's executives have to say about its future strategic direction. With the Coca-Cola deal finally closed, Monster should be able to turn its attention toward maximizing the growth potential from its core brands. Moreover, investors should expect greater efficiencies from using Coca-Cola's distribution network, with positive potential impacts on the expense side of the income statement as a result. Monster has huge growth opportunities ahead of it, but now it needs to prove that it can execute well on a well-thought-out strategic plan and make itself an even more powerful force in the growing energy-drink market.Bad news for your credit card company.

The increase was primarily due to improvement in Heineken's performance, in which FEMSA holds 20% participation interest, and a fall in financing expenses.Total revenue rose 5.9% year over year to Ps. 75,120 million (US$4,906.4 million), mainly on the back of strong results at FEMSA Comercio.

However, excluding Venezuela, total revenue grew 4.5%. Results were also impacted by the devaluation of the Brazilian real and the Colombian peso.

Coke now handles around 90% of Monster's U.S. distribution activity and also has been slowly taking over its overseas distribution.Overall, Monster last night said Q2 net income fell to $0.79 per share from $0.83 per share during the year-ago period, lagging the Capital IQ consensus expecting a $0.91-per-share gain.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $110 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.1% return against the $110 commitment, or a 2.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MNST's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $110 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Monster Beverage Corp sees its shares fall 26.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $105.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.50 from $110), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.7% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , and highlighting in green where the $110 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $110 strike for the 2.7% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Monster Beverage Corp (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $149.17) to be 40%.

Atlanta-based Coca-Cola on Wednesday  with a 2% slip in Q2 comparable earnings to 63 cents on a 3% revenue dip to $12.16 billion. Noncarbonated beverage sales outperformed sparkling beverage sales.Coke, which took a near 17% stake inMonster Beverage (  ) in August, has a three-year earnings growth rate of 2%. Its Earnings Stability Factor is 1 on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (most volatile).The beverage giant is also a consistent dividend payer. It raised its quarterly payout by 8% to 33 cents a share, or $1.32 for the full year, which works out to a 3.2% annualized yield vs. the S&P 500's average 1.93% payout.This is the 53rd consecutive year in which Coke has raised its annual dividend. Coke is an S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat -- a firm that has increased dividends for 25 years in a row.The stock is working on a flat base with a potential buy point at 43.93. It's trading just above its 10-week moving average and down slightly for the year. It's 7% below the entry.Rival PepsiCo is crafting a flat base with a possible entry at 100.86. The stock is closer to the buy point, at 4% below. It's trading above its 10-week line and is up nearly 3% this year.The Purchase, N.Y.-based company has a three-year earnings growth rate of 4% and an Earnings Stability Factor of 2.

PepsiCo posted flat second-quarter earnings and lower sales, but beat estimates on both metrics.There's no secret behind the shift from carbonated soft drinks to water.\"Customers have grown more health conscious and look to trade in their sugary soft drinks with healthier and more natural drinks, which bodes well for water,\" analysts at Trefis said in a report. \"This is a trend that these large soft drink multinationals can't ignore.\"Not surprisingly, the shift has benefited companies that specialize in noncarbonated beverages. One of them isMonster Beverage (  ), which makes energy drinks, fruit juices, smoothies and natural sodas under the Monster, Hansen's, Blue Sky and Junior Juice brands.Monster Beverage has run off seven straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth. Sales have risen by double-digit percentages four times over the same period. The company boasts a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, and its stock price set a record high of 149.76 on July 23.In contrast, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo -- two of the world's most recognizable brands -- continue to flounder financially.Coke has grown quarterly revenue only once in the last 10 quarters. PepsiCo, which also has a large food business, has posted lower or flat revenue four times in the last six quarters.News reports Friday saidCoca-Cola Enterprises (  ), based in Atlanta, but which bottles Coke products in Western Europe, was in \"serious discussions\" regarding a deal with Spain's Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetr\u00e4nke, in Germany, according to the Financial Times. The talks, underway for nearly a year, aim to streamline and cut production costs among soda makers.It follows guidance of Muhtar Kent, chief executive of the Coca-Cola Co., who has pressed Coke's bottlers to consolidate and help trim his company's costs, the Times reported. The news sent Coca-Cola Enterprises shares up 14%.The term \"nonalcoholic beverage makers\" pretty much describes what these companies do: make and sell nonalcoholic beverages, sold in cans, bottles or in quantity to stadiums, bars, restaurants, etc.The main differences lie in the types of products they produce. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Dr Pepper Snapple are best known for different versions of their iconic soft drinks, though each also makes bottled water and noncarbonated beverages.National Beverage (FIZZ) also makes multiflavored soft drinks as well as juices, water drinks and other products. Monster Beverage specializes in 21st Century-friendly beverages such as energy drinks and smoothies.IBD's Beverages-Non-Alcoholic group features 17 stocks and ranks No. 17 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD. The group is up about 30% since the beginning of the year, and has largely held to within the top 50 rankings since January.The biggest player in the group by a long shot is Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, with 2014 revenue of $46 billion and market capitalization of $176.9 billion. Second-largest, Mexico-basedFemsa (FMX), distributes Coke products in Mexico and other Latin American countries. It had 2014 revenue of $20.5 billion and market capitalization of $19.5 billion.PepsiCo's revenue is bigger than at either of those companies. Its 2014 revenue was $66.7 billion. Its market capitalization is $142 billion. But it belongs to IBD's Food-Packaged group because a big chunk of its sales come from food businesses such as Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats.Names that don't appear in the group, or on the U.S. stock market, include Austria-based energy drink leader Red Bull. The privately-owned company held the largest share (43%) of the U.S. energy drink market in 2014, according to CaffeineInformer. It reported $5.5 billion in 2014 sales. Monster held 39% of the market. Also privately-held Rockstar holds the third place slot, with 10% of the market.According to the American Beverage Association, nonalcoholic beverages represent a $141.22 billion market in the U.S. That includes sales of soft drinks, sports drinks, bottled water, energy drinks, juices and juice drinks, as well as ready-to-serve teas.Another industry tracker, Beverage Marketing Corp., reported that U.S. sales of nonalcoholic beverages rose 2.2% in volume last year. This was the fastest growth rate since 2006. U.S. bottled-water consumption led that increase, rising 10.87 billion gallons in 2014, up 7.3% from the prior year.Coca-Cola boosted its shoe size in the energy drink market a year ago, paying $2.15 billion for a 16.7% stake in Monster. As part of the deal, Coke acquired Monster's Hansen natural Sodas and Peace Tea, and agreed to aggressively expand Monster's distribution footprint.In return, Monster gained Coke's energy drink brands, including NOS and Full Throttle. Coke also agreed not to acquire more than 25% of Monster within the next three years. Analysts have long considered Monster a Coke takeover target.Meanwhile, sales of soda are on the wane. Beverage Digest estimated that U.S. per-capita consumption of carbonated soft drinks in 2014 fell to its lowest level since 1986. According to one projection, bottled water sales in the U.S. could pass soda sales by 2017.Globally, the shift should happen a lot quicker. A research report from Trefis notes that packaged water is expected to overtake carbonated soft drinks as the most consumed beverage worldwide this year.Citing data from Canadian, an industry researcher, Trefis said worldwide consumption of packaged water is expected to reach 233 billion liters in 2015 vs. an estimated 227 billion liters of carbonated soft drinks.Although sales of carbonated soft drinks are declining globally, emerging markets such as China hold potential for near-term growth in soft-drink sales.\"Sales in China have been growing well because it has an enormous population but low per-capita consumption,\" Fleck said. \"As income increases, we expect to see consumption increase.\"Unfortunately, the strength of the U.S. dollar vs. other currencies means a rise in overseas sales of both carbonated soft drinks, bottled water and other beverages doesn't necessarily mean a big boost in profits for beverage makers.In a recent report on Coca-Cola, JPMorgan analyst John Faucher noted that for the current quarter, Coke said foreign currency exchange \"will be a -7% headwind on revenues, -13% on operating profit, and roughly -10% on pre-tax income.\"On a more positive note, the industry is getting a leg up from the favorable pricing that comes from innovations such as minicans, analysts say, as well as from higher consumption of higher-margin organic juice drinks and other health-oriented beverages.The market for energy drinks has been occasionally rattled by health concerns, primarily related to caffeine intake among consumers who are either young or in ill health. The Food & Drug Administration has been largely quiet on the issue since 2012, although the World Health Organization did issue a warning in October recommending sales and marketing caps to protect children from dangerously high doses of caffeine.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported decent second-quarter 2015 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings while delivering in-line revenues.However, the Plano, TX, beverage company raised its previously issued guidance for sales and earnings despite higher currency headwind expectations.Second-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings of $1.13 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 by 2.7%. Moreover, earnings increased 7% year over year as strong margins offset a relatively softer sales performance.Dr Pepper's net sales rose 1% year over year to $1.66 billion as favorable segment and package/product mix and positive volume growth offset currency headwinds. Currency impact hurt sales by 2%. Excluding the impact, net sales rose 3%.Net sales were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Adjusted gross profit went up 1.7% to $983 million. Gross margins expanded 10 basis points (bps) to 59.4% as RCI productivity gains and lower commodity costs offset the unfavorable mix and currency headwinds.Higher growth of non-carbonated beverages (NCB) and allied brands (higher dollar revenue products) favorably benefits product mix and thereby total sales. However, since it increases the dollar value of cost of goods sold (COGS), gross margins are negatively impacted.Adjusted operating income increased 7% (on a currency neutral basis) to $365 million year over year. Adjusted operating margins increased 80 bps to 22.1% driven by higher sales, improved gross margins and productivity improvements.The effective tax rate was 35.3%, higher than 35.1% a year ago.Dr Pepper's sales volume is measured in two ways: 1) sales volume and 2) bottler case sales (BCS) volume. Sales volume represents concentrates and finished beverages sold to bottlers, retailers and distributors. BCS includes the sale of finished packaged beverages by the company and its bottlers to retailers and independent distributors.Sales volume, as discussed earlier, increased 1% backed by 1% volume gain in Packaged Beverages and 7% in the Latin American segment, partly offset by 1% decline in Beverage Concentrates.In the quarter, BCS volume went up 1%, less than 3% in the previous quarter, due to an unfavorable shift in Easter holiday. Though the first-quarter volumes gained from favorable Easter timing, this sales driver reversed in the second quarter. Easter fell in the first quarter of this year against the second quarter in 2014.Carbonated Soft Drinks (CSDs) and NCB volume gained 1% and 3%, respectively, both slowing down from last quarter.Overall, volumes of the Core 4 brands (Canada Dry, A&W, Sunkist soda and 7UP), including TEN versions, declined 1%, slowing down from the 4% increase seen in the previous quarter. A mid single-digit volume growth in Canada Dry was offset by similar declines in Sunkist soda, 7UP and A&W.Among others, Penafiel water went up 12% due to distribution gains and increased promotional activity. Schweppes increased 8% reflecting growth in sparkling waters and positive ginger ale category trends. Squirt gained 6%, while Crush declined 4%. Interestingly, Dr Pepper soft drink volume increased 1%, better than a similar decline last quarter.Among the NCBs, Snapple grew 11% driven by product innovation. Hawaiian Punch increased 2%, continuing the positive trend from the first quarter. Mott's dropped 7%. Clamato grew 8% backed by increased promotional activity and water category improved 6% on continued strength in Fiji and Bai 5 brands.The Fountain food service gained 4%.Geographically, volumes were up 1% in the U.S. and Canada, less than 2% in the last quarter, while increasing 7% in Mexico and the Caribbean.Beverage Concentrates: Dr Pepper's net sales from Beverage Concentrates increased 1% year over year (2% on a currency neutral basis) to $330 million. The growth was driven by favorable product mix and concentrate price increases implemented earlier in the year which offset the decline in concentrate shipments and higher discounts. In the Packaged Beverages segment, net sales rose 3% (both reported and currency neutral) to $1.18 billion driven by higher sales volume and favorable price/mix. Dr Pepper's net sales from Latin America Beverages declined 9% due to currency headwinds. However, on a currency neutral basis, sales increased 5% to $137 million on higher sales volume.The company now expects full-year 2015 earnings within the range of $3.85 to $3.93, higher than $3.80 to $3.88. The earnings guidance also reflects positive growth from $3.65 in 2014.The guidance was raised despite expectation of 4% negative currency impact, worse than 3% expected previously due to the impact of a strong dollar on its Mexican and Canadian businesses.Dr Pepper expects net sales to be up just over 1%, slightly better than prior expectation of 1% from the year-ago level. Negative currency impact is expected to hurt sales by about 2%, slightly higher than 1.5% expected earlier.The company expects lower packaging and commodity costs to reduce the COGS by about 1.5% (previously 1%) in 2015.The full-year tax rate is expected to be about 35.5%, higher than 34.6% in 2014. Capital expenditure is still expected to be nearly 3% of net sales. The company plans to repurchase roughly $500 million to $550 million shares in 2015.Dr Pepper, which has done well in the first half of the year, carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other soft drink companies, The Coca-Cola Company  and PepsiCo, Inc.  also delivered strong results for the same time frame.

Shares were up around 1% in  .The company's aggressive cost-cutting and strategic initiatives, to drive faster growth in 2015, led to the better-than-expected first-half performance. The strong first-half results clearly signal early signs of a turnaround.Second-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings of the maker of Coke and Fanta were 63 cents per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents by 5%.Earnings declined 2% year over year due to a strong dollar eroding the value of its overseas sales. Excluding the 6% impact of currency, earnings increased 4% as improved organic revenues made up for the relatively softer margins.Earnings have been adjusted for net gain related to the Monster Beverage transaction and costs associated with productivity program. Including these items, reported earnings were 71 cents per share, up 21% year over year.Per a deal with Monster Beverage Corporation  , closed last month, Coca-Cola acquired approximately 16.7% equity stake in the energy drink maker and transferred the ownership of its global energy drinks business to the latter. In return, Monster Beverage transferred its non-energy portfolio, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coca-Cola.Net revenue declined 3% year over year to $12.16 billion due to currency headwinds.Currency headwinds hurt sales by 7%, in line with management's expectations. With more than half of its revenues coming from outside the U.S., Coca-Cola's sales/profits were affected by the weakening of many emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar.Adjusting for the impact of currency, organic revenues increased 4% driven by improved volume trends. Revenues also marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.15 billion.Adjusted consolidated gross margins declined 80 basis points (bps) year over year and 90 bps sequentially to 61.5%.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 3% on a currency-neutral basis to $4.22 billion due to higher marketing expenditure.Adjusted operating income, on a constant currency basis, increased 6% to $3.15 billion. Adjusted operating margin was 26%, down 50 bps year over year as lower gross margins and higher marketing investments offset strong cost management and productivity gains. However, operating margins improved 260 bps on a sequential basis.Profit-before-tax declined 2% to $3.59 billion. Currency hurt profit-before tax by 6%, in line with the expected range of 5-6%. However, structural changes had a neutral impact on profit-before-tax.Coca-Cola witnessed 2% volume growth, better than 1% in the previous quarter.In North America, volumes grew 2%, much better than flat in the previous quarter due to improved volumes of both sparkling and still beverages. Peer, PepsiCo, Inc.  also witnessed improved volumes in its Americas segment in the second quarter, per results announced earlier this month.Among other developed nations, volumes remained stable in Europe, while that in Japan turned positive after witnessing a decline in the previous quarter. European volumes rose 1%, same as the previous quarter. Japan volumes improved 1% due to a strong performance of tea.Among the developing countries, 6% volume growth in China was offset by a mid single-digit and low single-digit decline in India and Brazil, respectively. While strong sparkling beverage performance pulled up volumes in China, India volumes were hurt by unfavorable weather conditions.Among the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, sparkling beverages (sodas) remained stable, while still beverages improved sequentially.Sparkling beverage volumes grew 1%, same as the first quarter. The Coca-Cola brand grew 1%, same as the previous quarter. Coke Zero, Fanta and Sprite grew 6%, 2% and 3%, respectively. Diet Coke, however, declined 7% as the diet drinks are coming under pressure due to increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Still beverages grew 5% in terms of volume, much better than 1% in the previous quarter as positive growth in teas, packaged water and value-added dairy was offset by decline in juice and juice drinks. Higher pricing to combat increased commodity costs and broader industry weakness hurt juice volumes.As warned by management, price/mix moderated from last quarter, increasing 1% in the second quarter, less than 3% in the first.While Latin America and North America continued to show positive growth due to the company's new pricing strategies, price/mix improved in Europe. However, price/mix declined in Eurasia and Africa and the Asia Pacific regions.Foreign exchange is expected to hurt 2015 revenues by 6% (maintained), operating income by 11% (previously 10%), and profit-before-tax by 7-8% (previously 7%).Structural changes are expected have a 1% negative impact on revenues and profit-before-tax.In 2015, the adjusted constant currency earnings per share are expected to increase in a mid single-digit range, similar to 2014 levels but below the long-term target.However, the company lowered its share buyback plan. The company now expects to buy back shares worth $2.0 to $2.5 billion in 2015, lower than $2.0-$3.0 billion expected previously. Productivity savings are expected to be $500 million in 2015. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be 22.5%.Management expects 2015 to be a \"transition year\" - a time to start implementing changes to create a new operating model.In Oct 2014, Coca-Cola unveiled strategic actions to drive better profit growth. Other than aggressively cutting costs, the plan includes making disciplined brand and growth investments as well as aligning incentive plans. The company is also re-franchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories to create a more efficient system. It closed several transactions in 2014 and plans to complete two-thirds of the re-franchising by 2017-end which should improve margins and drive growth.

The industry in which Monster operates is also highly ranked, as it is in the  .Monster also has several positive figures in areas many investors view when analyzing and making a buy decision on a stock. The company has a net margin of 15.35%, much higher than the industry average of 3.59%, as well as an extremely favorable return on equity percentage of 35.30%. While the company clearly is already in a good place and is profitable, projected sales growth of 16.09% shows that the success MNST has experienced has a great chance of continuing.Information from earnings estimates has been proven to be very helpful when it comes to the process of predicting future success, and in regards to MNST, its earnings estimate information is such that would seemingly poise the company's stock to see success in the near future.One area in which Monster shows promise is with its earnings growth estimates. For the current quarter, MNST has an EPS growth estimate of 11.11%, and an EPS growth estimate of 18.85% for the current year. EPS growth is expected to continue for MNST in the near future as well, with next year having an EPS growth estimate of 25.78%MNST has also seen positive estimate revision activity lately as analysts become more bullish on the company and its stock's future successes. For the current year, 1 analyst has upped their estimate for MNST's earnings in the last 30 days, and a total of 3 analysts have upped their estimates in the last 60 days, compared to just 1 analyst lowering their estimate in the last 30 days.Another positive sign for Monster comes in its ability to beat analysts' earnings estimates consistently, which it has demonstrated with its beats in 3 of the last 4 quarters, by an average of 5.68%. Significant amounts of success are very possible if Monster can continue to beat on the estimates analysts make for the company's earnings.Monster operates in an industry that is extremely competitive, one that has approximately 4,000 manufacturers and distributors, and is dominated by Coca-Cola  and Pepsi  , who combine to own nearly 50% of the market share. Due to this high level of competition, companies are constantly looking for partnerships and acquisition opportunities within the industry to deal with industry fragmentation and increase international prominence.This is exactly why  last year, with the deal becoming effective just recently. For Coca-Cola, the company received a 16.7% equity stake in Monster for $2.15 billion in cash, in addition to transferring ownership of its global energy drinks business that includes brands Relentless and Burn, to Monster. In regards to Monster, the company transferred its non-energy drink portfolio that included brands like Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea to Coca-Cola, in addition to making Coca-Cola its preferred global distribution partner.The deal is a great move for both companies, but especially for Monster. The company will receive a large cash inflow from Coca-Cola, and now is in prime position to increase its influence in countries outside of North America. With Coca-Cola's assistance, Monster will be able to improve its margin trends in its existing markets like Japan, but also in new markets such as China and Norway. This increased expansion could mean huge growth in revenues and profits for Monster, as well as improving its ability to compete with fellow energy drink producer Red Bull.Monster Beverage Corporation has seen great success in the last 12 months which has been a positive for both the company and its investors, and the success does not seem to be stopping in the near future. The company is projected to see substantial sales growth in the near future, and analysts are becoming more and more confident in the company's ability to see EPS growth. Combine these two positives with potentially major level of expansion, and Monster is seemingly a great opportunity for investment. The stock should be on the radar of investors everywhere, though time shouldn't be wasted as the company could be bringing profits very soon.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In addition, the cola giant transferred the ownership of its global energy drinks business, which includes brands like Relentless and Burn, to Monster making the latter Coca-Cola's \"exclusive energy play\". As previously disclosed, Coca-Cola has nominated two directors - Kathy N. Waller and Gary P. Fayard - to Monster's board bringing the total to 10 members.In return, Monster Beverage transferred its non-energy portfolio, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola Company is now also Monster's preferred global distribution partner.We believe that this is a win-win deal for both the companies. Gaining a share of the energy market seems a wise decision for Coca-Cola considering that the category is doing better than other beverages.As regards Monster Beverage, the deal will provide it full access to Coca-Cola's world-class global distribution network. In addition, the company will benefit from the addition of Coca-Cola's energy brands and become a pure energy company. The deal should also significantly expand Monster's presence in the international energy drinks market where it currently has a limited presence. Most importantly, Monster Beverage's cash position received a major boost from the deal.Coca-Cola is acquiring equity stake in other growing companies as well. The company owns 16% stake in specialty coffee retailer Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.  .Coca-Cola also has an innovative partnership with Keurig Green Mountain under which the latter will exclusively make Coca-Cola branded single-serve pods for use on its upcoming Keurig Cold at-home beverage system.Strategic investments like those with Keurig Green Mountain and Monster will help Coca-Cola adapt to the changing consumer trends while accelerating innovation.Both Coca-Cola and Monster carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked beverage company is The WhiteWave Foods Company  with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

Rising wages and cheaper fuel were the other positives.With oil and  subsiding, consumers are left with more disposable income. Commodity costs have in many cases stabilized. Consumers are also expecting lower inflation primarily due to lower gas prices. A decline in commodity prices may improve profit margins for certain staples companies.However, the continued appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to most foreign currencies will be a near-term headwind to the earnings of U.S.- based staples companies with significant international operations. Other risks include potential price wars, a competitive environment, slowdown in international markets (including continued slowdown in China), political turmoil in Russia, sluggishness in Japan and an unfavorable economic environment in Europe.If we analyze the trend on a year-to-date basis, consumer staple stocks performed well at the beginning of the year compared with the S&P 500 as a whole. However, the current situation is just the opposite as the S&P 500 index is well above the consumer staple stocks index.Industry players like McCormick & Co, Inc. (  ), Energizer Holding, Inc. (  ), General Mills, Inc. (  ), Molson Coors Brewing Co. (  ), Tyson Foods, Inc. (  ) have posted positive earnings surprises of 9.4%, 14.5%, 4.5%, 7% and 2.7%, respectively, in their recently reported quarters. On the contrary, Monster Beverage Corporation (  ) and Sysco Corp. (  ) fell short of their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, mainly due to currency headwinds.Hopefully, the second half of the year will prove to be better for these companies with a strong rebound in earnings.Consumer Staples is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit:  .As a guideline, the outlook for industries in the top 1/3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and the bottom 1/3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of #177 and higher is 'Negative.'The consumer staples sector is further sub-divided into the following industries at the expanded level (260 industry groups): Agricultural Operations, Beverages - Alcohol, Beverages - Soft, Consumer Products - Miscellaneous Staples, Cosmetics & Toiletries, Food - Miscellaneous/Diversified, Publishing - Newspapers, Soaps & Cleaning Preparations, Textile - Apparel and Tobacco.Only three of all the sub-sectors are placed in the top 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups, with Tobacco holding a Zacks Industry Rank #17, Textile - Apparel holding #64 and Soaps & Cleaning Preparations holding the #88 spot. A number of them fall in the middle portion of that group, with Food - Miscellaneous/Diversified industry holding a Zacks Industry Rank #94. It is followed by Cosmetics & Toiletries and Beverages - Soft, holding ranks of #116 and #170, respectively.The remaining sub-sectors are featured in the bottom one-third. Agricultural Operations and Consumer Products - Miscellaneous Staples share a common industry rank #184, Beverages - Alcohol holds a Zacks Rank #208 and Publishing - Newspapers is at #223.Looking at the exact position of these industries, one could say that the general outlook for the consumer staples space is neutral. Results of most of the companies have improved in the first quarter of 2015 owing to a gradual recovery in the economic environment. However, there are a few that are struggling and will take time to recover.Nearly all the consumer staple companies have reported their first quarter results, wherein the earnings \"beat ratio\" was 60.6% while the revenue \"beat ratio\" was only 42.4%.On a year-over-year basis, total earnings for this sector are expected to decline 6.3% in the second quarter compared with 1.3% growth registered in the first quarter of 2015. Total revenue is expected to decline 12.4% in the second quarter against a decline of 3.9% in the previous quarter.Annual 2015 earnings are expected to decline 2.6%, while 2016 earnings are expected to increase 8.5%. Revenues are expected to decline 10.1% in 2015, while it is expected to increase 2.8% in 2016.The sector is expected to contribute 6.5% of the total S&P 500 income for 2014, less than its 7.2% market cap weight in the index at present. This signals that the companies would take time to overcome the difficult consumer spending environment.The first quarter 2015 earnings turned out to be a mixed bag for consumer staples stocks. While on the one hand, it was characterized by a gradual recovery in economic scenario and lower fuel prices, which helped the companies to recover from the sluggishness; on the other hand, the companies faced significant foreign currency headwinds.The current trend shows that the companies would take time to overcome the difficult consumer spending environment at least til 2015.For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our '  ' report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Fearing another liquidity crisis, they hoarded the greenback, with S&P 500 non-financial companies' collective amount of cash and cash equivalents rising from less than $800 billion in the third quarter of 2008 to over $1 trillion by mid-2010.The trend has not stopped, even with ultra-low interest rates keeping returns on cash near zero. At the end of 2014, the S&P cash and cash equivalents pile had grown to $1.43 trillion, according to FactSet. Part of that has to do with lingering fears that another financial crisis will hit, but a big part of it has to do with companies not wanting to pay US repatriation taxes on their growing foreign profits, since US taxes are higher than those of most other countries.As an investor, this can be incredibly frustrating. General Electric (  ), for example, has well over $100 billion of cash parked overseas, according to a recent analysis by Credit Suisse. Given that GE has earned a return on retained earnings -- that is, the earnings it has held onto and not paid out as dividends -- of -1.9% over the past decade, investors can certainly make the case that they would be better off if GE repatriated a chunk of that money and returned it to shareholders via dividends or buybacks.But it's important to remember that some companies do a great job redeploying their cash to grow their businesses, which in the long run can turn out far better for shareholders than dividends or buybacks. Warren Buffett famously does not pay dividends at Berkshire Hathaway, because he thinks he can use the company's cash in a way that better benefits shareholders than simply paying it out in dividends. His long-term track record shows that he's right.Not surprisingly, return on retained earnings is one criterion Buffett looks at when assessing a stock, according to Mary Buffett's book Buffettology. \"Warren believes that if a company can employ its retained earnings at above-average rates of return, then it is better to keep those earnings in the business,\" writes Ms. Buffett, who worked closely with Mr. Buffett and is his former daughter-in-law. She adds, \"Whether or not the management of the company can utilize its retained earnings is probably the single most important question you must ask yourself as a long-term investor in businesses. Commitment of capital to a company that has neither the opportunity nor the managerial talent to grow its retained earnings will cause your investment boat to become dead in the water.\"So, what kind of companies have track records of growing retained earnings at high rates? Well, my Buffett-based \"Guru Strategy\", a computer model inspired by Buffett's approach (as laid out by Mary Buffett) looks for stocks with a return on retained earnings of at least 12% over the past decade. To determine this figure, we simply take the amount the company's earnings per share have increased over the past 10 years, and divide it by the amount of retained earnings it has had over that period. Here is a quartet of stocks that fit the bill, and which also have high overall scores on my Buffett-inspired model. Think twice before getting upset with these companies if and when they have high cash balances -- if history is any indication, they may be about to do something very productive for both their business and shareholders with those funds. This California-based firm ($21 billion market cap) makes energy drinks and alternative beverages under such names as Monster Energy, Java Monster, X-Presso Monster, M-3, Worx Energy and Hansen's natural sodas and juices. While Buffett himself is a big fan of Coca-Cola and its stock, my Buffett-based model prefers Monster, thanks in part to its having a 19.6% return on retained earnings over the past decade. The Buffett-inspired model also looks for consistent earnings and reasonable debt, and Monster delivers on both fronts. The firm has increased earnings per share in all but one year of the past decade, and it has no long-term debt. This parent of discounters Marshalls, T.J. Maxx, and Home Goods ($44 billion market cap) has averaged a 17.7% return on retained earnings over the past decade. In addition, it has increased EPS in each year of that stretch, and it has enough annual earnings ($2.2 billion) that it could, if need be, pay off all of its debt ($1.6 billion) in well under two years, the standard my Buffett-inspired strategy prefers. This India-based global I/T firm ($21 billion market cap) took in more than $7 billion in sales in the last year, and has generated a return on retained earnings of 16.8% over the past decade. It has also upped EPS in each year of the past decade, and has less than $200 million in debt and more than $1.3 billion in annual earnings. In addition, Wipro's 10-year average return on equity is an impressive 24.2%, and anything over 15% is a sign of the \"durable competitive advantage\" Buffett is known to seek. This Houston-based firm ($10 billion market cap) is a global leader in subsea systems and a leading provider of technologies and services to the oil and gas industry. It helps its customers improve shale and subsea infrastructures and operations to reduce cost, maintain uptime, and maximize oil and gas recovery. The company has approximately 20,000 employees and operates 24 production facilities in 14 countries.Oil and gas services companies have been hit quite hard by the downturn in  we've seen over the past year, but FMC seems to be holding up relatively well -- it actually increased earnings per share (compared to the year-ago period) in the first quarter. It has also generated a 17.8% return on retained earnings over the past decade, part of why get strong interest from my Buffett model. A couple other reasons: FMC has upped EPS in each year of the past decade, and it has enough annual earnings ($707 million) that it could pay off its debt ($1.3 billion) in less than two years, if need be.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" has recently signed a non binding letter of intent with  to expand its franchise territory.

Its popularity skyrocketed as the company crafted a strong and trendy brand.While  tried to get in on the ground floor, their reputation for cornering the soft drink space did not prove helpful in this market.

And its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just  . Get your caffeine fix, on this consumer goods edition of Industry Focus.Greetings, Fools! I am Sean O'Reilly joining you here from Fool headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. To my left is Vincent Shen. How are you today, sir? I'm doing well, Sean. How are you? Not bad. We're going to talk some energy drinks here today. Did you bring me any? Like, a Red Bull, or anything? Yeah, I'm really hopped up on caffeine right now, actually. That does sound about right. So, today we're talking about, more or less, what beverage companies are doing for growth these days because the traditional lines of Coke and  , they are not high growth markets right now. In particular, the energy drink market is what they're going for. In addition to that, have you tried this Fair Life Milk that Coke's making? That's kind of a different track for them, right? I really do not -- I can't even put them in the same room. I think Coca-Cola... When I saw that, one of our Foolish writers -- this was back in December now when it was first announced -- Asit Sharma wrote a great article about \"Coca-Cola's Next Product Is...Milk\" and then you read it and they teamed up with this huge farm in Wisconsin, I think, and they're mass producing this, supposedly, healthier milk.It's got 50% more protein and calcium and all this stuff. But it's expensive. It's $6 or $7 for a gallon. That's mucho dinero. But as we'll see in a minute, this is how these beverage companies are going about it because their major advantage is, of course, their distribution. Not necessarily owning current, awesome brands in the energy drink industry.Anyway, you've got them trying to do milk, juices, Vita coconut water, and of course the big enchilada of energy drinks. So, what's going on here? Well, like you mentioned -- I want to stop right there really quick though. Have you tried Fair Life? No. Okay. I haven't met anybody who's tried it yet. I'm not quite sure it's in Northern Virginia yet. Oh, is that the -- oh. I didn't realize it was a regional rollout for them. Oh, yeah. For sure. Yeah. Okay. So, as Sean mentioned earlier, Coca-Cola, Pepsi; they're seeing a lot -- they're basically seeing stagnant, if not decreases in their volumes year to year for their traditional carbonated beverages. Maybe 3% to 4% volume declines per year now. People in general, their health perception of normal Coke, or a Pepsi is just not good these days.Too many calories, too sugary, and there's been a lot of media attention and general awareness of health brought to that. This is why Coke has Coconut water now. So, one avenue of growth that they're trying leverage right now -- and it's kind of funny because these drinks aren't exactly healthy either. No, they're not. But they're generally identified in the category of functional beverages where they provide -- they help you stay up, they help you energize, and compared to normal, carbonated sodas, these drinks have seen double digit CAGR in the past five years. The growth -- since I was in college -- the growth has been crazy. Yes, I have to keep in mind, a good indicator of that is just the fact that there's been 100s of new energy drink products introduced in the past three years -- since 2012. So, everybody's trying to get a piece of this pie. The U.S. energy drink market is on track to hit about $21 billion, $22 billion by 2017. So, it's pretty substantial, though in the end, in the broad context of the U.S. beverage market it' sonly a single digit... A drop in the bucket, yeah. It's not huge, but when you take in the growth though, it can still have a pretty substantial impact for a company like Coca-Cola. Their profits, their revenue growth; things along those lines. So, who are the major players? Because investors don't have a ton of options. Unfortunately not. There's really only one pure play energy drink company that is publicly traded. The number one, actually, is Red Bull. Being an Austrian company they're privately owned. That founder - well, he started that in 1987. He's worth $5 billion now, or something. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah, that started in 1987. It was first introduced into the U.S. market about 10 years later -- in '97 -- and that really kicked off the entire trend. I think at this point, like I said, private companies -- the numbers are a little difficult to track down sometimes, but I think most recently, for the past year, they did something like $6 billion, $6.5 billion in sales. So, pretty substantial. They're all -- correct me if I'm wrong -- every energy drink owes its life to Red Bull. They are the ones -- they're the Coke of the energy drink market. I think, especially a few years ago before some of these other competitors really started gaining more market share -- when I thought of an energy drink, I actually just thought of it as a Red Bull. I'd say \"Get me a Red Bull.\" Even generically, for any energy drink. So, they definitely started the trend. Something that we'll see among all these companies -- Red Bull was about a 43% market share, then Monster... That's amazing. Yeah. So, these two -- Red Bull and Monster -- dominate most of the market. There's a lot of smaller players, but they're obviously the big dogs. Monster is around 39%, but recently, because of its deal with Coca-Cola, it's probably -- in the U.S. at least -- it's neck in neck. Red Bull's much more dominant worldwide. Got it. So, investors: you really can't -- unless you invested in Monster there's no real way to take advantage of this growth other than buy into Coke and Pepsi and all that stuff. Yeah, exactly. I want to touch on that a little bit later. Options besides Monster. But if you want that pure play, it really is only the one option. It's definitely an interesting stock. Monster's trading about $131 a share right now. They're up 20% already, year to date. In the past year they pretty much doubled. Up 90%. What did they do with Coke about a year ago? That actually resulted in a big jump in their stock price, too. I think it was in August they signed the deal, whereby Coca-Cola entered into this partnership. So, they acquired a stake in Monster. I think it was about 17% stake for about $2 billion. The exchange of expertise... And Monster got all of Coke's energy brands, which were arguably failing. That was basically the exchange. So, Coca-Cola will be the preferred distributor and they're probably the best one in that regard [...] Well, given what you just said, that's three wins for Monster, in my opinion. They got $2 billion in cash, they got all of Coke's brands -- like a 'gimme', or something -- and they get access to Coca-Cola's distribution, which is arguably the most effective distribution system on God's green earth. Well, it's not like Coca-Cola's coming out with nothing. Monster came about in 2002, I'm sure, as a response to Red Bull and how popular it was getting, and in the past decade they've built up a very, very competitive market share against Red Bull in the states. I think what some of these smaller players have that the bigger companies like Coke and Pepsi haven't been able to master is the marketing and the image brand that they've created. What is it that Red Bull -- they had a guy jump from space, basically? Oh, yeah. I had forgotten about that. But they do a lot of these extreme sports events. If you go on their website you can see all these different -- skateboarding, concerts, music events. When I went to a music festival in New York on Randall's Island called The Governor's Ball there are tons of representatives from Red Bull. They were doing a really good job in terms of marketing, especially to younger consumers who are setting the trend of making their products look cool, and popular. Yeah. Going back to that deal, I think that's a big part of what Coca-Cola gets because they're handling the distribution for Monster, but they're also handing over their entire energy drink portfolio, which included a bunch of brands. NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother, Relentless -- I haven't even heard of some of these. I forgot about Full Throttle. They're like \"All right. Monster, you guys have the image thing, you have the brand things down, the marketing. So, we're going to let you handle that.\" And that's essentially the exchange that they're going through. So, we're obviously Motley Fool, we like investing. What do you think of Monster as a business? Returns on equity, capital; all that stuff? The growth is really, really impressive. They've grown their revenue at about 16%, 17% CGAR over the past five years. This is compared to an overall beverage industry that's pretty much been flat, or stagnant. Right. People like their B-12 vitamins. Apparently so. It's always in those drinks; the B-12. You look at the back of these energy drinks, it's like \"Daily portion of B-12: 400%\". I'm glad you bring up the ingredients because Monster kind of bucked the trend, too. When they first introduced their drink they did the big 16oz cans. Yeah. Red Bull at the time was still a small, 8oz can. So, just to give you some perspective, one 16oz Monster drink has about 160mg of caffeine. For context, a single shot of espresso at  has about 75mg of caffeine. So, you're getting about two shots of espresso in each of these cans. If you're staying up all night playing Xbox you need it. You drink two or three of them, before you know it, you're going to be completely wired. Good to go. So, their revenue has grown at a very impressive pace. Their earnings are right on track, too. They have about 20% -- their free cash flow is strong. The thing is, their margins are really good. Coca-Cola is 27% margins for the EBITDA, and Monster bests that, even. They're over 30%. Coke's known for its pricing power. This is why it's one of Buffett's favorite companies. That's saying something right there. I think broadly, this category for energy drinks, in general, these functional beverages have been able to just command high prices. When I go to the market I see Red Bulls and they're kind of pricier than the... They're $3 or $4, yeah. So, that has contributed to the success they've had and their stock price, admittedly does reflect some pretty high expectations of investors. Like I said, they're trading about $131 a share. That's equivalent to 40x their expected 2015 earnings. So, definitely not a cheap stock. You're paying for that growth, but considering the portfolio they just took over, their agreement with Coca-Cola for distribution, the continued strength of the brand; they'll probably be neck in neck with Red Bull, if not surpass them for the U.S. market.Who knows where that can go in terms of the international growth considering what Coca-Cola can offer? I wonder if there's ever going to come a day when Pepsi offers to buy Red Bull or something. I'm wondering what the end game is because it's a private company, but eventually somebody's going to want to cash out. It certainly wouldn't be a small deal. Coca-Cola looked into doing a Monster acquisition. That's right! Yeah. A couple years ago. I think that was 2012. And they didn't, and now it's up three fold. They walked away, yeah. It's up several times that price now. Their market cap is currently about $22 billion. So, not a small acquisition by any means if somebody wanted to pursue that. I think Red Bull's probably even bigger than that. So, definitely something to consider. So, if I come up to you and say \"Vince, I really want to get in on this energy drink trend, but Monster's kind of pricey. I'm a value guy.\" What are my options then? Am I just 'stuck'? Do I have to assume that Coke and Pepsi are going to find a way to get a piece of this? Debatable. I think in terms -- Coca-Cola for example, entering this partnership is a smart move because they're not going to -- though one of their drinks, NOS, developed a pretty sizable piece of the market -- I think NOS has 3% of the market. They had $300 million in sales last year compared to Red Bull in the U.S. had 10x that.But still, they were able to build that up somewhat, but in the end, them handing that over and allowing Monster to use some of their expertise in that regard is a good play. I think, in an alternative investment option it's through Coca-Cola because some of that growth is going to hit their bottom line directly. Very good. Well, thank you for your thoughts, Vince.

Consolidated  - it will also grant expanded territories to a new bottler, Clark Beverage Group.While Coca-Cola Bottling will cater to markets in Delaware, Illinois, Indiana and West Virginia; Clark Beverage will look after the markets in Mississippi.As part of its new beverage partnership model, Coca-Cola is re-franchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories to create a more efficient system.In late April, Coca-Cola announced letters of intent granting new, expanded territories to three existing U.S. bottlers - Coca-Cola Bottling Company High Country, Coca-Cola Bottling Company United and Swire Coca-Cola USA. Also, Coca-Cola announced that it will grant additional territories to four new U.S. bottlers - Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Company, Chesterman Company, The Odom Corporation and Ozarks Coca-Cola Bottling Company. These new partnerships cover more than 5% of bottle/can volume.Under the model, Coca-Cola closed several transactions in 2014 and plans to complete half of the re-franchising by 2017-end which should improve margins and drive growth. The remaining territories are expected to be re-franchised no later than 2020.Management expects 2015 to be a \"transition year\" - a time to start implementing changes to create a new operating model.Other than the beverage partnership model, Coca-Cola is also undertaking several strategic actions to drive better profit growth in 2015. Other than aggressively cutting costs, the plan includes making disciplined brand and growth investments as well as aligning incentive plans.Though these initiatives benefited the first-quarter 2015 results to some extent, management, however, warned that the restructuring and strategic initiatives will take time to deliver the desired results amid challenging global macro conditions and significant changes at the company.Coca-Cola is acquiring equity stake in other growing companies as well.

Rising wages and cheaper fuel were the other positives.With oil and  subsiding, consumers are left with more disposable income. Commodity costs have in many cases stabilized. Consumers are also expecting lower inflation primarily due to lower gas prices. A decline in commodity prices may improve profit margins for certain staples companies.However, the continued appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to most foreign currencies will be a near-term headwind to the earnings of U.S.- based staples companies with significant international operations. Other risks include potential price wars, a competitive environment, slowdown in international markets (including continued slowdown in China), political turmoil in Russia, sluggishness in Japan and an unfavorable economic environment in Europe.If we analyze the trend on a year-to-date basis, consumer staple stocks performed well at the beginning of the year compared with the S&P 500 as a whole. However, the current situation is just the opposite as the S&P 500 index is well above the consumer staple stocks index.Industry players like McCormick & Co, Inc. (  ), Energizer Holding, Inc. (  ), General Mills, Inc. (  ), Molson Coors Brewing Co. (  ), Tyson Foods, Inc. (  ) have posted positive earnings surprises of 9.4%, 14.5%, 4.5%, 7% and 2.7%, respectively, in their recently reported quarters. On the contrary, Monster Beverage Corporation (  ) and Sysco Corp. (  ) fell short of their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, mainly due to currency headwinds.Hopefully, the second half of the year will prove to be better for these companies with a strong rebound in earnings.Consumer Staples is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit:  .As a guideline, the outlook for industries in the top 1/3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and the bottom 1/3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of #177 and higher is 'Negative.'The consumer staples sector is further sub-divided into the following industries at the expanded level (260 industry groups): Agricultural Operations, Beverages - Alcohol, Beverages - Soft, Consumer Products - Miscellaneous Staples, Cosmetics & Toiletries, Food - Miscellaneous/Diversified, Publishing - Newspapers, Soaps & Cleaning Preparations, Textile - Apparel and Tobacco.Only three of all the sub-sectors are placed in the top 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups, with Tobacco holding a Zacks Industry Rank #17, Textile - Apparel holding #64 and Soaps & Cleaning Preparations holding the #88 spot. A number of them fall in the middle portion of that group, with Food - Miscellaneous/Diversified industry holding a Zacks Industry Rank #94. It is followed by Cosmetics & Toiletries and Beverages - Soft, holding ranks of #116 and #170, respectively.The remaining sub-sectors are featured in the bottom one-third. Agricultural Operations and Consumer Products - Miscellaneous Staples share a common industry rank #184, Beverages - Alcohol holds a Zacks Rank #208 and Publishing - Newspapers is at #223.Looking at the exact position of these industries, one could say that the general outlook for the consumer staples space is neutral. Results of most of the companies have improved in the first quarter of 2015 owing to a gradual recovery in the economic environment. However, there are a few that are struggling and will take time to recover.Nearly all the consumer staple companies have reported their first quarter results, wherein the earnings \"beat ratio\" was 60.6% while the revenue \"beat ratio\" was only 42.4%.On a year-over-year basis, total earnings for this sector are expected to decline 6.3% in the second quarter compared with 1.3% growth registered in the first quarter of 2015. Total revenue is expected to decline 12.4% in the second quarter against a decline of 3.9% in the previous quarter.Annual 2015 earnings are expected to decline 2.6%, while 2016 earnings are expected to increase 8.5%. Revenues are expected to decline 10.1% in 2015, while it is expected to increase 2.8% in 2016.The sector is expected to contribute 6.5% of the total S&P 500 income for 2014, less than its 7.2% market cap weight in the index at present. This signals that the companies would take time to overcome the difficult consumer spending environment.The first quarter 2015 earnings turned out to be a mixed bag for consumer staples stocks. While on the one hand, it was characterized by a gradual recovery in economic scenario and lower fuel prices, which helped the companies to recover from the sluggishness; on the other hand, the companies faced significant foreign currency headwinds.The current trend shows that the companies would take time to overcome the difficult consumer spending environment at least til 2015.For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our '  ' report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Under the long-term strategic deal, Coca-Cola is in the process of acquiring approximately 16.7% equity stake in the energy drink maker. Coca-Cola will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business to Monster, whereas Monster will transfer its non-energy business to Coca-Cola.

The beverage industry is a prime example, where  has emerged as one of the biggest players in the relatively new energy-drink market, a niche that was pretty much nonexistent until experiencing soaring growth over the past decade. Coming into its first-quarter financial report on Thursday, Monster Beverage has already posted gains of 30% for the year, and investors still expect fast growth in what has traditionally been one of the company's weaker periods from a seasonal standpoint. Let's look more closely at the situation that Monster Beverage faces right now and what its quarterly results are likely to reveal.\n  \nSource: Yahoo! Finance. Investors have gotten more positive about Monster Beverage earnings in recent months, boosting their estimates for the first quarter by roughly 6% and adding 4% increases to their projections for the full 2015 and 2016 years. The stock has kept rising, with gains of 21% just since late January.The lion's share of Monster Beverage's gains came after its fourth-quarter financial report in February. The company reported an impressive 12% rise in revenue on 11% higher sales volume, but what really turned heads was a 65% jump in net income. Better margins from cost-cutting efforts and strong performance in its international markets showed that Monster had started to take advantage of some of its more favorable long-term opportunities, and that spurred shareholders to send the stock soaring by more than 13% the day after the report.Yet perhaps the most anticipated news will come when Monster Beverage closes on its long-awaited partnership with beverage giant  . Ever since last summer, the two companies have expected a long-term strategic partnership aimed at unifying the companies' energy-drink businesses under Monster's corporate roof while transferring Monster's non-energy drinks, such as its Hansen's Natural sodas, to Coca-Cola's control. For Monster, the move essentially has it doubling down on the future of the energy-drink niche, but it also opens up Coca-Cola's unparalleled distribution network for its use. Monster hopes that the partnership will help it with its international growth strategy while also helping it save costs throughout its coverage area.Source: Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage can't afford to get cocky about its new partnership, though. Rival Red Bull still has a market-share lead in many important markets worldwide, and its marketing strategy has greater prominence in some markets compared to Monster's campaigns. With the key millennial segment becoming an increasingly important swing market for beverage companies, Monster needs to defend its territory at the same time that it makes aggressive moves to lure Red Bull's customers away in an effort to bolster its own growth.Fortunately, Monster has a solid balance sheet that should let it take advantage of any opportunities that come its way. With nearly $1 billion in cash and no debt, Monster Beverage has the flexibility to make further strategic moves in the future.In the Monster Beverage report, take a look at whatever comments the company makes with respect to any outstanding litigation. For years, the company has been plagued by fears that its energy drinks pose a health risk to consumers, with some calling for limitations or outright bans on sales of the products. So far, Monster has been able to avoid any serious infringement on its business model, but investors can't afford to take for granted that the company will be able to fend off future attacks effortlessly. With the completion of the Coca-Cola deal approaching, though, Monster investors have many positives to look forward to that could outweigh any lingering negative concerns.

Last quarter, it posted a positive surprise of 22.03%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has remained soft since the past few years. However, energy drinks, within this category, has been gaining traction. Monster Beverage's top line in the first quarter of 2015 will benefit from this growing momentum of the energy drink category. The company's revenues are also expected to gain from its new product launched in the U.S and solid sales in international markets.However, Monster Beverage has been facing several other headwinds for the past few quarters, which is hurting its profits.New Monster Energy branded products like Ultra and Muscle Monster are cannibalizing sales of the existing brands like Absolutely Zero, Rehab, Import and Lo-Carb. We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter. Also unfavorable currency transactions are likely to hurt quarterly results.Moreover, Monster Beverage has been involved in several controversies. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently investigating the impact of caffeine in food and dietary supplements, which includes Monster Beverage products. All these regulatory and litigation issues are increasing Monster Beverage's professional service expenses, which are eroding margins.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Monster Beverage Corp. is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That's because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Its Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 68 cents. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, Monster Beverage's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies in the cConsumer Staples sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Constellation Brands Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +0.82% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Brown-Forman Corp.  with an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank #3.Treehouse Foods, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +1.72% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The largest franchise bottler of The Coca-Cola Company  reported net majority income of 57 cents per ADS (Ps. 0.88 per FEMSA Unit), which was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents but declined significantly from the year-ago quarter figure of 85 cents.Quarterly net consolidated income rose nearly 15.1% to Ps. 4,349 million (US$616.8 million) from Ps. 3,778 million (US$518.4 million) in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to rise in Heineken's first-quarter results in which FEMSA holds 20% participation interest backed by a significant gain from the sale of Heineken's Mexican packaging business. This was partly offset by slightly lower operating income as well as a marginal rise in net financing expenses.Total revenue rose 1.5% year over year to Ps. 65,199 million (US$4,367.1 million), mainly on account of strong results in FEMSA Comercio. On an organic basis, total revenue fell 1% from the prior-year quarter.FEMSA's gross profit dipped 3.1% year over year to Ps. 25,689 million (US$1,720.7 million). However, gross margin contracted 190 basis points to 39.4% owing to weaker margins at both Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Comercio's OXXO Gas that generates lower margins than retail business.FEMSA's operating income declined 1.5% to Ps. 5,858 million (US$392.4 million) from Ps. 5,946 million (US$449.2 million) in the year-ago period. On an organic basis, operating income fell 1.9% year over year. Moreover, consolidated operating margin contracted 30 bps to 9% because of the swift growth of low-margin FEMSA Comercio business, which is shrinking the company's consolidated operating income.Total revenue at  S.A.B. de C.V.  dropped 11.2% year over year to Ps. 34,374 million (US$2,302.4 million) mainly due to the negative impact of using SIMADI exchange rate to convert the results for its Venezuela operations coupled with the devaluation of the Brazilian real and the Colombian peso. However, on a currency neutral basis and excluding Venezuela, total revenue grew 5.5% driven by an increase of average price per unit case in almost every region along with volume growth in Colombia, Argentina and Central America.Coca-Cola FEMSA's operating income for the quarter declined 6.3% to Ps. 4,504 million (US$301.7 million) from the year-ago quarter. However, the segment's operating margin expanded 70 bps to 13.1% in the quarter. On a currency neutral basis and excluding Venezuela, operating income was up 10.6%. revenue increased 18.9% year-over-year to Ps. 28,987 million (US$1,941.6 million), while organic revenue growth was of 12.5%. The rise was mainly attributable to the opening of 154 new stores in the quarter and a 4.3% rise in same-store sales of OXXO stores. Growth in same-store sales was led by an increase of 4.2% in average customer ticket and a marginal rise in store traffic. The company opened 1,151 new stores in the last 12 months. As of Mar 31, 2015, the company operated 13,007 OXXO stores and 232 OXXO Gas stations.Operating income for the quarter rose 26% year over year to Ps. 1,304 million (US$87.3 million).

Outside of the ring, the boxer has also had a lucrative career by endorsing products, serving in the House of Representatives in the Philippines, and coaching -- and even playing -- in the Philippine Basketball Association.Pacquiao's endorsements include  Butterfinger candy bar. Source: With all of these impressive accolades ahead of the big fight this weekend, we decided to investigate the zesty fighter's net worth. Despite Pacquiao's various income streams, his professional boxing career is his primary wealth generator. Today, Pacquiao has earned roughly $300 million in the ring, according to  's calculations and media reports.The fighter's impressive earnings streak dates back to 2008, when his PPV battle with de la Hoya put him on the map. That fight earned him $11 million, plus a $15 million bonus and launched his status as a money-making headliner. Since then, Pacquiao's earnings have tended to increase annually, with a few drops along the way, as reflected below:To top off those figures, Pacquiao had an incredibly lucrative 2014, raking in $41.8 million, which earned him 11th place on  Highest Paid Athlete List for the year. A whopping $41 million of those earnings came from his fights against Brandon Rios and Timothy Bradley. Pacquiao picked up another $800,000 for the year in endorsements,  reported. (He's endorsed brands including  ,  Energy, Hennessy, Wonderful Pistachios, and San Miguel Beer.) Beyond those two incomes, the Pacman also received 240,000 pesos -- or roughly $15,600 -- last year for his role as a congressman, according to the  of the Philippines. Heading into the ring to face Mayweather this weekend, the Pacman stands to increase his riches by over $100 million -- and that's considered the  end of a 60/40 revenue split. Because Mayweather holds more perceived drawing power for viewers -- and because he's also undefeated heading into the fight -- Pacquiao will make less off of the main event,  reported.Those estimates could even be low for a fight that already has an estimated $74 million in ticket sales at the 15,000-seat  Grand in Las Vegas and could do as much as $300 million in PPV sales,  reported  The fight has also scored $35 million in foreign rights fees, over $13 million in sponsorship, and it will be shown on closed circuit in a number of venues as well, the site added.At the end of it, though, both the IRS and the Philippines will take their cuts. (Boxers, of course, do not have to make their salaries public, but some of Pacman's payouts have received extended  because of taxation conflicts between his home country and the United States.) Nevertheless, Pacquiao should leave the ring with a fortune that's a staggering amount in this history of professional boxing.Apple forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Earnings increased 9.5% year over year mainly due to higher net sales.During the quarter, net sales rose 3.8% from the year-ago figure to $1.45 billion on the back of improving sales volumes, and favorable segment and product mix, which were partially offset by currency headwinds. Sales volume increased 2% year over year backed by gains in all the segments. Net sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion by 2.1%.Adjusted gross profit went up 2.3% to $851 million due to higher revenues. Adjusted operating income increased 9.3% year over year to $271 million backed by higher sales.The effective tax rate was 35.5%, lower than 34.4% in the prior-year quarter.Dr Pepper's sales volume is measured in two ways: 1) sales volume and 2) bottler case sales (BCS) volume. Sales volume represents concentrates and finished beverages sold to bottlers, retailers and distributors. BCS includes the sale of packaged beverages by the company and its bottlers to retailers and independent distributors.Sales volume, as discussed earlier, increased 2% backed by 4% volume gain in Packaged Beverages and 3% gain in the Latin American segment, partly offset by 2% decline in Beverage Concentrates.In the quarter, BCS volume went up 3% as Carbonated Soft Drinks (CSDs) and non-carbonated beverages (NCB) volume gained 3% and 5%, respectively.Overall, volumes of the Core 4 brands (Canada Dry, A&W, Sunkist soda and 7UP), including TEN versions, increased 4%, as a double-digit increase in Canada Dry was partially offset by low single-digit declines in Sunkist soda and 7UP. A&W remained flat in the quarter. Squirt increased 15%, and Schweppes increased 8%. These increases were partially offset by 1% decline in the Dr Pepper brand due to continued declines in diet. Fountain foodservice volume, however, increased 1%. Dr Pepper's net sales from Beverage Concentrates increased 2% year over year as concentrate price increases implemented at the beginning of the year and lower discounts in the quarter were partially offset by 2% decline in concentrate shipments. Segment operating profit increased 6% year over year due to net sales growth, a planned reduction in marketing investments and lower IT costs. In the Packaged Beverages segment, net sales rose 5% driven by higher sales volume and favorable product mix were partially offset by increased promotional activity during the quarter. Segment operating profit surged 10% year over year backed by net sales growth and ongoing productivity improvements. Dr Pepper's net sales from Latin America Beverages increased 14% on a currency neutral basis driven largely by increased sales volumes. Segment operating profit surged 89% (excluding currency) as net sales growth and ongoing productivity improvements were partially offset by increases in logistics costs and other operating expenses.The company expects fiscal 2015 earnings within the range of $3.80 to $3.88.

Yet coming into Thursday afternoon's first-quarter financial report, few Monster Beverage investors expected to see the big one-time items related to the deal, which the company hopes will close as scheduled later this quarter.Looking beyond those figures, though, Monster didn't post the strong growth that investors have come to expect. Let's look more closely at Monster Beverage, and what's ahead for the company for the rest of 2015. The key to understanding Monster Beverage's financials this quarter is to figure out which figures are comparable. When you look at net sales, but take out the impact of accelerated deferred revenue stemming from the Coke transaction, growth of just 9.5% resulted in adjusted net sales of $587 million, well below the $601 million consensus among those following the stock. Similarly, adjusted earnings of $0.62 per share fell more than $0.05 short of shareholder expectations.The impact of the Coke deal, though, was massive. Because of the replacement of Monster's existing distributors, the company had to incur termination fees of $206 million, which it included as charges against net income in the first quarter. The accelerated recognition of deferred revenue added $40 million to Monster's top line, but that figure will merely take sales away from future quarters.Fundamentally, Monster Beverage still performed well in many areas. Case sales volume jumped another 11% year over year, to 57.8 million, and Monster saw a huge jump in per-case pricing, with $10.85 per case representing about a 5% improvement from the year-ago quarter. Gross margins climbed by 2.6 percentage points, and even rising operating expenses didn't stop operating margins from improving by nearly two percentage points.Net income margins also rose, helping to support higher profits. Domestic sales were relatively strong, but Monster's international performance left something to be desired. Overall, net sales outside the U.S. weighed in at $113 million, down about 2% from the first quarter of 2014.Source:  user Mike Mozart.CEO Rodney Sacks looked forward to the conclusion of the deal with Coca-Cola and its future positive effect on earnings. \"We are making good progress in working through transitional issues and look forward to the closing of the transaction in the second quarter,\" Sacks said, and \"we anticipate that this relationship will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries as well as access to new geographies.\" Even with the distraction of the big Coca-Cola deal, Monster Beverage hasn't stopped focusing on its own business. The company launched its Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab Peach Tea + Energy drinks during the quarter, and Sacks said that customer response to the new products has been positive. By taking maximum advantage of the current consumer preference for still drinks compared to the sparkling beverages that Coca-Cola is famous for, Monster Beverage has put itself squarely in the sweet spot to maximum future growth potential.At the same time, Monster Beverage has done everything it can to make the coming transition as smooth as possible. The company said that about 84% of its distribution rights within the U.S. have made the transfer to Coca-Cola's network, and the impact on Monster's retail numbers was minimal. In May, Monster Beverage hopes to get about a third of the remaining 16% transferred over to the new network.Nevertheless, traders in Monster Beverage focused primarily on the earnings miss, with shares of the stock falling almost 3% in the first hour of after-market trading following the announcement. In the long run, it's far more important for Monster to make the most of Coca-Cola's distribution capabilities, as well as the new energy-drink brands it will acquire from the beverage giant as part of the deal. If that goes well, then a momentary move downward in the share price will soon be long forgotten.

After negative publicity surrounding the health risks of consuming too much caffeine slowed growth in 2013, the energy-drink market resumed its run last year.Health risks apparently weren't shown to be strong enough to hold back core energy-drink consumers for too long.\"The fact is, a lot of core consumers of energy drinks -- young males -- don't tend to pay a lot of attention to health concerns,\" Amit Sharma, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, told IBD.Industry watchers say the category is poised for healthy growth the next few years at least.That's good news for the two dominant players in the energy-drink market: Corona, Calif.-basedMonster Beverage (  ) and its chief rival, the Austrian company Red Bull.Sharma, for one, recently assured his clients that it was safe not only for most people to consume energy drinks, but also to invest in Monster Beverage.In a client note, Sharma pointed to \"mounting scientific evidence\" that consuming energy drinks in moderate amounts is safe. Together with Monster Beverage's voluntary labeling and marketing changes, he said, the risk of adverse regulatory action is largely removed.Monster now displays its total caffeine on packaging and an advisory warning that its energy drinks are not recommended for children, caffeine-sensitive people and pregnant or nursing women. It also reduced marketing programs to consumers under 18.How does Monster view health risks related to its energy drinks? Company executives declined to comment on any aspect of the business. But the first comment from CEO Rodney Sacks in a Feb. 26 conference call following its fourth-quarter report said it all: \"We reiterate that our products are safe.\"Monster's gross sales in the quarter grew 12.1% vs. the prior year to $696.3 million. Earnings shot up 63% to 72 cents per share, sending Monster's stock up 13% to 141.Earnings for the full year jumped 42% over 2013 to $2.77 per share vs. 5% year-over-year growth in 2013. Gross sales for the year grew 9.3% to $2.8 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2015 earnings to rise 22% to $3.37.\"We think there is more upside to the stock,\" said Sharma, who has an outperform rating on it.The energy-drink market peaked in 2011 and 2012 on double-digit sales growth, according to the Mintel Group, a  research agency. Mintel forecasts that energy-drink sales in the U.S. will grow around 40% from 2014 to 2019, or nearly 7% a year on average, as new users join the core cohort of 18- to 34-year-old males.Red Bull is the market leader in energy drinks worldwide. It's been selling energy drinks overseas longer and in more countries than Monster. But in the U.S., where Monster derives most of its sales, Monster and Red Bull are running neck and neck.\"Monster has been pulling up on Red Bull, and they are almost tied now,\" said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest.Monster Beverage was called Hansen Natural until the name got changed in 2012 to reflect the company's greater sales from Monster energy drinks than from natural soda and tea.Hansen launched its first energy drinks in 1997 and followed five years later with Monster Energy, which still comes in supersized, 16-ounce black cans featuring neon claws and Goth lettering on the outside and various vitamins and herbs on the inside -- in addition to a blast of caffeine.Nearly 80% of Monster's sales are in the U.S., where Monster is growing faster than the overall energy-drink market.Red Bull is growing a little faster than Monster this year, however, due to the launch of new flavors, Sharma says. But he expects Monster's U.S. sales this year to grow in double digits.Monster is rolling out at least a couple of new products this year, such as recently launched Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab Peach Tea + Energy.But the biggest change will come from a deal withCoca-Cola (  ), set to close in the current quarter. Coke will acquire a 16.7% stake in Monster and become its preferred distribution partner worldwide.Under terms of the $2.15 billion transaction, Coke will transfer ownership of its energy-drink brands, including NOS and Full Throttle, to Monster. And Monster will transfer to Coke its nonenergy drinks business, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea.\"Monster gets access to the powerful Coke bottling system,\" said Sicher. \"Coke gets a significant equity stake in a very fast-growing beverage company, and its bottlers get more distribution of Monster.\"Coke's new role \"will certainly accelerate the timeline for Monster's expansion into international markets,\" Sharma said.Monster's international sales have already been growing faster than domestic sales. Sacks said in the call that Japan is \"becoming one of our largest international markets.\" He added that expansion in Germany, Great Britain, Greece, the Netherlands and Chile is also going well.One potential new market is China, Sharma says.\"You could argue that over time, Coca-Cola will help Monster go into that market,\" he said. \"It's one of the biggest energy-drink markets, and Monster is not in that market today.\"In a recent research report, analyst Theo Brito of BTIG suggested that at least $1.2 billion in new revenue opportunities could be up for Monster under the Coke \"brand swap\" from expansion into new consumer niches.Such new niche segments could include \"edgy millennial women,\" baby boomers and more affluent consumers overall, he noted. But still, young males \"may always be the largest energy drink consumer.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" 's  third-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings matched expectations while revenues fell short. Moreover, the consumer goods giant lowered its fiscal sales expectations to reflect the \"unprecedented currency devaluations.\"P&G's third-quarter adjusted earnings of 92 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings declined almost 8% year over year including currency headwinds of 18 cents per share. Excluding currency headwinds, earnings increased 10% on the back of pricing and mix gains and productivity savings.P&G's net sales declined 8% to $18.1 billion. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.5 billion by 2.2%. As expected, currency headwinds hurt sales by 8%, while divestitures had a negative impact of 1% on sales. We would like to remind investors that this is the fifth time that P&G has missed sales in a row due to currency headwinds and sluggish sales in the Beauty, Hair and Personal Care businesses.Organically (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues were up 1% driven by pricing and mix gains, which made up for softer volumes. Pricing increased sales by 2%, while product mix increased it by 1%, offsetting a volume decline of 2%.While organic sales at the Grooming, Healthcare and Baby, Feminine and Family Care segments picked up from the year-ago quarter, Beauty, Hair and Personal Care businesses slowed down. Fabric Care and Home Care segments remained flat in the reported quarter.Core gross margin improved 20 basis points (bps) to 49.5% as productivity cost savings and pricing benefits were offset by currency headwinds, higher commodity costs, investments in innovation and capacity building and unfavorable geographic/product mix.Core selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 50 bps (as a percentage of sales) to 30.8% as productivity savings were offset by currency headwinds. Core operating margin declined 30 bps to 18.7% due to higher SG&A ratio.The Cincinnati-based company was compelled to lower its sales outlook in view of a higher-than-expected negative impact from currency. However, management reiterated its core earnings per share guidance.Net revenue is expected to decline in the range of 5%-6%, against the prior expectation of a decline of 3%-4%. Currency is expected to hurt revenues by 6%-7%, much higher than 5% expected previously. Organic sales are now expected to be in low single digits for fiscal 2015, as against the prior growth expectation of low-to-mid single-digit range.The company continues to expect core earnings per share to be flat or decline in a low single digit range in fiscal 2015. Management continues to predict currency impacts to hurt core earnings per share by 12%. Excluding currency headwinds, management expects double-digit core earnings per share growth.Slowing  growth, strong currency headwinds, market level challenges in the Ukraine, Russia and the Middle East, Venezuela, Argentina and Hong Kong and rising commodity costs have made the operating environment challenging for P&G, hampering its growth.P&G is in the process of divesting around 100 underperforming brands to concentrate better on fewer core strategic brands. In this regard, the company sold off its American and Asian pet care business to Mars, Inc. and European pet care business to Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.  last year.Moreover, the company has signed a deal to divest its Duracell batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.  in exchange for Berkshire's equity stake in P&G. The divesture is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2015. However, these structural changes and other initiatives to boost organic growth are yet to translate into top-line improvement.P&G carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked company from the broader consumer staples sector is Monster Beverage Corporation  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Read:  ).FTC believes this preliminary conjunction would temporarily stop the deal while an FTC administrative law judge hears the case. The court's hearing on the FTC's motion is scheduled to begin on May 5.Sysco's merger with US Foods has been controversial from the beginning. The FTC was concerned that the merger would reduce competition nationwide and in local markets for foodservice distribution, as these two companies happen to be the only two food distributors to offer nationwide contracts to deliver food and other supplies to hotels, hospitals and fast food restaurants. A combination of these two companies would control 75% of the national market, according to the FTC, and would give them enough power to control or raise prices for customers.Sysco's officials challenged the commission's view and stated that competition level will not be affected as their business is based on local markets, where competition is fierce.Sysco has been trying to resolve FTC's concerns over the past 12 months related to its acquisition of US Foods for approximately $8.2 billion, inclusive of debt. Not only this, in order to seek FTC's approval for the merger, Sysco, on Feb 2, agreed to sell 11 facilities of US Foods to the Performance Food Group, contingent upon the closing of its proposed merger with US Foods. However, FTC still finds this offer inadequate as these divestitures will not help to restore lost competition.The deal is important for both the companies, as together they are expected to improve efficiencies, particularly in supply chain, merchandising and general and administrative activities. The merger will give Sysco increased size and scale and will also provide significant cost savings opportunities. In fact, the merger would help create one of the largest food companies in the country.Sysco now carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked companies in the broader consumer staple sector include Monster Beverage Corp.  , Tyson Foods, Inc.  and Altria Group, Inc.  .

However, the food/beverage giant expects a greater-than-previously-expected foreign exchange impact on its 2015 sales and profits.With around half of its revenues coming from outside the U.S., Pepsi's sales and profits are being affected by significant currency headwinds due to the recent weakening of many foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Especially, recent currency fluctuations in Venezuela, Russia and Mexico pose a major concern.Pepsi's first-quarter 2015 core earnings per share of 83 cents comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents by 5.1%. Earnings increased 1% year over year even as currency headwinds eroded sales.Currency hurt earnings by 11%, much higher than 7% in the previous quarter, since a strong dollar eroded the value of Pepsi's overseas sales. In constant currency terms, adjusted earnings grew 12%.Despite difficult global macroeconomic environment and significant currency headwinds, increased product pricing, lower taxes, better execution and productivity gains boosted earnings.Core earnings exclude the impact of restructuring charges, including which, reported earnings per share came in at 81 cents, up 3% year over year.Total sales declined 3% year over year to $12.22 billion largely due to currency headwinds. Foreign exchange hurt revenue growth by 8%.Excluding foreign exchange impact, revenues increased 4.4% on an organic basis as higher price/mix gains made up for the softer volumes. Revenues also marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.19 billion.Higher snacks sales in the Americas and developing/emerging markets made up for a softer global beverage performance.Organic revenues grew 10% in developing/emerging markets. In the Americas, organic revenues grew 4% in the Frito-Lay snacks segment helped by higher volumes and pricing. Core revenues grew 2% in the beverage business, softer than 3% improvement in the previous quarter.Pepsi witnessed an effective net pricing gain of 4%, higher than 3.5% in the past quarter. Volumes grew 1%, slowing down from 1.5% growth in the last quarter, due to softer beverage business.Organic snacks and beverage volumes grew 2% and 1%, respectively.Organic volumes increased 3% in the Frito-Lay segment, while improving in the other American snacks businesses. Organic volumes were flat in Latin America Foods - better than 2% decline in the previous quarter, and grew 2% in Quaker Foods - much better than flat growth in the last quarter. Organic snacks volumes declined 1% in Europe but grew 9% in developing and emerging markets.With regard to beverages, volumes slowed down in all regions - America, Europe as well as developing/emerging markets.Organic beverage volumes declined 5% in Europe versus an increase of 3% in the previous quarter. In developing/emerging countries, organic beverage volumes grew 1% also slowing down from 1.5% in the past quarter.In the Americas, beverage volumes declined 1% versus a similar increase in the last quarter. Rival, The Coca-Cola Company  , which reported just a day back, also witnessed a slowdown in American beverage volumes in the first quarter.Carbonated soft drinks (CSD) of these large beverage companies have been seeing declining sales trends over the past few quarters due to category headwinds. Weak consumer spending environment, cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness - consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concern - are hurting CSD demand and thereby the sales of Coca-Coca, Pepsi and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  .Core gross margins improved 150 basis points (bps) backed by strong pricing, effective revenue management strategies and productivity gains.Core constant currency operating profit improved 8% to $1.83 billion. Core operating margins grew 18 bps as gross margin gains offset higher marketing costs and an impairment charge related to dairy joint venture.Core effective tax rate was 23%, lower than 23.7% a year ago.Pepsi expects to continue to face macroeconomic headwinds in 2015, mainly due to weakening international currencies.Though Pepsi maintained its previously issued 2015 constant currency earnings guidance, it raised its estimate for negative currency impact on sales and profits in 2015. Currency is now expected to hurt earnings per share by 11% and revenues by 10% in 2015, higher than previous expectation of 7% for both.Pepsi expects core constant currency earnings per share to increase 7% in 2015. The target is in line with management's long-term goal of high single-digit core constant currency earnings growth.Excluding headwinds from currency and structural changes, organic revenues are expected to grow in the mid single-digit range, also in line with the long-term targets.Commodity inflation is expected in the low-to-mid single-digit range, higher than previous expectation of low single-digit. Productivity savings - expected to be $1 billion - would be used to offset headwinds from cost inflation and thereafter reinvested in the business.Also, management plans to return $8.5-$9.0 billion through dividends and share repurchases.The core tax rate is expected to be approximately 25% for 2015, same as in 2014.

The year-over-year improvement was driven by a 6% jump in core shipments.Moreover, depletions improved by 8% in the quarter, gaining from depletion growth for its Angry Orchard, Twisted Tea and Traveler brands, offset by a trivial fall in depletion for its Samuel Adams brand.The company's gross profit climbed nearly 10% year over year to $99.6 million while gross margin expanded 100 basis points (bps) to 50% in the quarter. The improvement can be attributed to price increases partly compensated by unfavorable product mix.Advertising, promotional and selling expenses fell 1.8% to $60.2 million as a decline in expenses incurred on point of sale and local marketing, due to the timing of new product launches, were only partly offset by rise in investments in media advertising and enhanced freight to distributors because of higher volumes.General and administrative expenses increased 8.2% to $17.2 million driven by an increase in salary expenses.Operating income in the quarter came in at $22.1 million, up 64.9% from the year-ago quarter level of $13.4 million, with the operating margin improving 380 bps to 11.1%.Boston Beer ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $122.2 million. Debt and capital lease obligations, excluding current portion, stood at $471 million while stockholders' equity was $495.1 million.During first-quarter 2015, the company generated approximately $21.2 million of cash from operating activities, while it deployed nearly $18.7 million toward capital expenditure, primarily for investing in its breweries.In the first quarter as well as during the period from Mar 29 through Apr 24, the company bought back nearly 53,000 shares for $14.3 million. Following this, Boston Beer had shares worth roughly $28.3 million remaining under its $350 million authorization.Going forward, management expects competitive headwinds to intensify in the industry. Hence, it intends to remain focused on making further investments in advertising and promotion of brands, and to bring about innovations. The company is smoothly progressing with the rollout of its Traveler brand and has received favorable response from the national media, distributors, retailers and drinkers.Also, the company continues to focus on improving its supply chain structure in order to provide better customer service and preserve beer freshness. Finally, the company stated that though these initiatives could weigh on its earnings initially, these are most likely to drive profits in the long run.Subsequent to this outlook, management retained its projections for 2015, expecting earnings per share to range from $7.10-$7.50.Further, the company reiterated its full-year projections for depletions and shipments growth in a band of 8%-12%. Management continues to expect 1%-2% improvement in prices, gross margin of 51%-53% and advertising, promotional and selling expenses of $25-$35 million, including ongoing investments of $10-$15 million in Alchemy & Science. Effective tax rate expectation for 2015 is maintained at 38%.Capital expenditure for 2015 is anticipated to be in the range of $80-$110 million, including about $3-$5 million in capital investments for its existing Alchemy & Science projects.Currently, Boston Beer has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Though sales slightly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.63 billion, it declined 4% from the prior-year quarter due to foreign currency headwinds.Excluding the aforementioned headwinds, organic sales grew 5% from the prior-year quarter, driven by 3% volume gains and 1% improvement each from net selling prices and product mix.Adjusted operating profit in 2015 (excluding charges for organizational restructuring, charges for pension settlements and for Venezuelan balance sheet re-measurement) grew 7.2% to $815 million in the first quarter. This reflects an increase in organic sales and $90 million of cost savings from the FORCE (Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere) program and $10 million of savings from the organization restructuring announced in 2014. Input costs also decreased $10 million in the quarter. However, currency fluctuations reduced adjusted operating profit by $75 million. The segment includes products like disposable diapers, training/youth/swim pants; baby wipes; feminine and incontinence care products.Sales decreased 3% on a year over year basis to $2.3 billion in the quarter due to unfavorable currency impact, which offset the 2% increase in net selling prices and 4% volume growth. Sales declined in North America, developed markets outside North America and developing and emerging markets.Segment operating profit was flat at $455 million in the quarter, benefiting from organic sales growth and cost savings, partially offset by unfavorable currency rates and higher manufacturing-related costs. The segment includes bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products for household use.Segment sales declined 7% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter due to unfavorable currencies and lower selling prices, which offset the impact of higher volumes. While sales in North America increased 2%, other two developed markets outside North America and developing and emerging markets declined in the quarter.Segment operating profit increased 13% to $291 million owing to benefits of cost savings, reduced manufacturing costs and lower marketing, research and general expenses, partially offset by unfavorable currencies. The segment consists of facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers and a range of safety products.Segment sales declined 1% on a year over year basis to $0.8 billion in the first quarter of 2015 due to unfavorable currency offset by positive sales volumes and product/mix. While sales in North America increased 3%, other two developed markets outside North America and developing and emerging markets declined in the quarter.Unfavorable currency effects led to a decline of 1% in segment operating profit to $134 million, which overshadowed the gains from organic sales and cost savings.During the first quarter, the company acquired the remaining 49.9% interest in its subsidiary in Israel for approximately $150 million. As a result, the company is now targets 2015 share repurchases of $0.7 billion to $0.9 billion compared to the previous target of $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion.In Oct 2014, the company initiated a restructuring program in order to improve organization efficiency, improve its underlying profitability, increase the company's flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives and offset overhead costs stemming from the spin-off of the company's health care business.The restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, with total costs anticipated to be $130 million to $160 million after tax. It will result in cumulative pre-tax savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million by the end of 2017.During the first quarter of 2015, restructuring costs were $5 million after tax while savings amounted to $10 million.The company continues to expect 2015 earnings in the range of $5.60 to $5.80 per share, up 2% to 5% from adjusted earnings per share of $5.51 in 2014. Organic sales growth is expected in the range of 3% to 5%.Foreign currency exchange will negatively impact sales by 9% to 10% and operating profit by 10% to 11%. Both of these ranges are 1 point more negative than prior assumptions. The company continues to expect unfavorable Venezuela currency to reduce total company sales and adjusted operating profit in 2015 by approximately 3% and 4%, respectively.During the fourth quarter 2014 conference call, the company had stated that it expects adjusted operating profit to grow in the range of 1% to 4% in 2015. Cost savings of at least $300 million are expected from the company's FORCE program, whereas savings of $60 million to $80 million are expected to come from the 2014 organization restructuring initiative.Kimberly-Clark has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the consumer staples sector include Monster Beverage Corp.  , Tyson Foods Inc.  and Hormel Foods Corp.  .

The company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results on the back of strong volumes at its beer business and encouraging wine and spirits sales.Further, the company's strong free cash flow generation and confidence in growth prospects urged it to reward its shareholders with a dividend program. The company announced its first-ever dividend of $0.31 per share, payable on May 22, to shareholders on record as of May 8. While the company initially targets a dividend payout ratio of 25%-30% of its adjusted net income, with continued strength in cash generating ability and sustained growth, it expects to return more value to shareholders in the future through dividend hikes.Following a strong fourth quarter, management provided a favorable guidance for fiscal 2016. Constellation Brands envisions adjusted earnings to be in the range of $4.70-$4.90, compared with $4.44 per share reported in fiscal 2015. On a reported basis, earnings per share in fiscal 2016 are anticipated to be in the range of $4.55-$4.75.Better-than-expected results and an encouraging outlook triggered an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate, as analysts are optimistic about Constellation Brands' future performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate increased nearly 1% to $4.84 for fiscal 2016 and 1.5% to $5.53 for fiscal 2017 in the past 7 days.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is capable of carrying the growth momentum further, driven by acquisitions and expansions. This is evident from Constellation Brands' recent 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois and the related acquisition of the glass plant in Nava, Mexico. This acquisition will help the company to gain better control of its glass needs in terms of quality, flexibility and cost-effectiveness.Further, as the largest wine company in the world, Constellation Brands has a formidable portfolio of well-known brands and enjoys a predominant position in the premium wine and beer market in the U.S. Moreover, the company's consistent focus on brand building and its initiatives to include new products in its wine and spirits business are likely to be key revenue drivers for the stock.However, its highly leveraged balance sheet and the risk of increasing taxes remain concerns for the company. Moreover, it faces intense competition from other well-established players in the industry, which may dent its operating performance.Better-ranked stocks in the related beverages-soft drinks industry are Monster Beverage Corp.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd.  and Cott Corp.  , both holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Under the joint venture, Archer Daniels and Tate & Lyle jointly own three corn wet mills, one each in Slovakia, Bulgaria and Turkey. Additionally, both companies own a 50% stake in a wet mill in Hungary.As part of the aforementioned agreement, Archer Daniels will acquire full ownership of two corn wet mills in Bulgaria and Turkey, along with the 50% stake in the wet mill in Hungary. For this, it will pay \u20ac240 million in cash and transfer the ownership rights of the corn wet mill in Slovakia to Tate & Lyle.Further, as a part of the deal, Archer Daniels has agreed to supply crystalline fructose from the Turkey facility to Tate & Lyle. Also, Tate & Lyle has decided to make Archer Daniels the exclusive agent to sell liquid sweeteners and industrial starches produced by its EU plants. Archer Daniels expects to close the transaction by this summer, subject to regulatory approvals.Archer Daniels' management expects new opportunities to open up in the European sweetener market as the sugar production quotas in the EU come to an end. This will lift the artificial cap on cereal-based sweeteners, hence, improving the European demand for sweeteners.With the acquisition of these corn assets from Eaststarch, Archer Daniels expects to cater to the growing demand for sweeteners, and also enhance its capability to satisfy the increasing demand for Starch in Europe. The addition of these assets is expected to improve Archer Daniels' global daily grind capacity for corn by 7.5% to nearly 3 million bushels per day.Together, the Bulgaria, Turkey and Hungary facilities make for a daily grind capacity of nearly 200,000 bushels. While these facilities primarily produce sweeteners and starches, the Hungary facility also produces ethanol for fuel, beverage and industrial uses.Archer Daniels has been strategically undertaking steps to manage its business portfolio, as evident from its actions involving the smooth integration of the WILD Flavors acquisition, the divestment of its South American fertilizer business and agreements to sell its global cocoa business to Olam and chocolate business to Cargill.These are likely to help the company in realizing value from its businesses and invest the same in the best possible resources to enhance returns and minimize earnings volatility.Archer Daniels currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $95 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.60. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.8% return against the $95 commitment, or a 2.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MNST's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $95 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Monster Beverage Corp sees its shares fall 32.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $90.40 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.60 from $95), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.8% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp, and highlighting in green where the $95 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $95 strike for the 2.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Monster Beverage Corp (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $139.84) to be 38%.

As of Feb 28, 2015, the company had $7,137.5 million of long-term debt (excluding current maturities) and its total shareholders' equity stood at $5,881.3 million.During the fiscal, Constellation Brands generated $1,081 million of cash from operations and free cash flow of $361.6 million.Moreover, the company has initiated its dividend program, under which quarterly cash dividend of 31 cents per share on Class A shares and 28 cents per share on Class B shares will be paid on May 22, 2015 to shareholders of record as of May 8, 2015.Following a strong fourth quarter, management provided a favorable guidance for fiscal 2016. Constellation Brands envisions adjusted earnings to be in the range of $4.70-$4.90, compared with $4.44 per share reported in fiscal 2015. On a reported basis, earnings per share in fiscal 2016 are anticipated to be in the range of $4.55-$4.75. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Constellation Brands is pegged at $4.81 per share, which could witness a revision following the company's guidance.Coming to sales, the company expects its beer segment sales to increase in the high-single digit range, with mid-single digit volume growth. On the other hand, its wine and spirits business sales are expected to grow in the low-to-mid-single digit range. Operating income at the beer business is expected to increase 10%-12%, while wine and spirits operating income is projected to grow in the low-to-mid-single digit range.Certain factors were considered before providing the earnings guidance, such as an interest expense expectation in the range of $325-$335 million, an approximate tax rate of 30.5% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 204 million.Moreover, the company expects capital expenditures in the band of $1.05-$1.15 billion for fiscal 2016. This is expected to include $900 million to $1.05 billion for the beer business. Pertaining to this guidance, the company hopes to generate free cash flow in the range of $100-$200 million.Constellation Brands currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Grade as its new executive vice president and CFO, replacing Chris Kreidler, who is leaving the company for his personal interests. Kreidler will continue to serve as CFO through Aug. 31, 2015, and work closely with Grade and Sysco's senior executive team till Grade takes up his position from Sep 1. Kreidler has also agreed to stay on through the end of the year as an advisor to the company.Kreidler has many achievements to his credit during his tenure as the CFO. His strong leadership in capital markets, long-term planning, mergers and acquisitions insight, and integration planning for the US Foods merger helped the company to perform and grow amid several challenges.Sysco's new CFO - Grade - was surely one of the strong contenders for the position with nearly 20 years of experience in key finance and commercial roles. Currently, Grade is serving as the senior vice president of finance and chief accounting officer and was responsible for field finance, commercial finance, financial planning and analysis, financial reporting, and shared services accounting.Grade joined Sysco as a staff auditor in 1996 and has held a variety of senior finance and commercial roles, including CFO of Sysco Chicago and Sysco Canada. He was also promoted to president of Sysco Canada in 2010 and then became senior vice president of foodservice operations, north region and Canada in 2012.Overall, the company's long term fundamentals are solid. The company's growth strategy remains strong and its efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiency are appealing. The company has implemented several short-term steps and longer term strategic initiatives to accelerate sales and mitigate the ongoing gross margin pressure. These actions are gaining traction and the company expects to see gradual improvement in these areas through 2015. The company also expects additional progress in productivity over the next several months.We believe Grade, with his in depth knowledge and experience of local operations, is expected to serve the company better and its customers.Sysco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

's (  -  ), namesake brand, Pepsi, knocked off arch-rival  's (  -  ) Diet Coke to secure the number two spot among soda brands, per the latest Beverage Digest report.Reportedly, Diet Coke has been at the #2 spot since 2010 when it pushed Pepsi to the #3 spot.Coca-Cola's Coke, however, remains the most popular soft drink in the U.S., as measured by volume. However, its volume increased only 0.1% last year. Pepsi, Diet Coke and Mountain Dew trailed Coke and witnessed volume declines during the year.Going by the report by Beverage Digest, a leading beverage industry newsletter, sales of carbonated beverages (CSDs or sodas) declined for the 10th straight year in 2014. Overall, soda volume slipped 0.9% in 2014. Both soda giants, Pepsi and Coca-Cola, suffered CSD volume declines.Weak consumer spending environment, cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting CSD category growth. Consumers are particularly vigilant about the high sugar content and related obesity concerns.Among CSDs, the cola segment in particular has come under fire as consumers are opting for alternative beverage offerings. Also, possible new taxes levied on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers - Coke, Pepsi and  -  ) - leading to lower volumes and weak sales.Notably, however, the 0.9% decline in 2014 was less than the 3% drop in 2013 due to improved marketing efforts by the cola giants.The report suggested that the diet soft drinks performed worse than their regular versions. The slide in the regular soft drinks market started quite a few years back while the diet versions have begun to struggle of late with consumers becoming increasingly aware of artificial sweeteners, like aspartame.As such, beverage companies are making naturally sweetened low-calorie drinks. Last year, Coca-Cola launched a reduced-calorie, naturally sweetened cola, Coca-Cola Life. Coca-Cola Life is sweetened with cane sugar and stevia leaf extract and contains 35% less calories than the leading colas. Pepsi also expects to launch a lower calorie, naturally sweetened non-cola product in the U.S. this year.However, according to Beverage Digest, sales volume across the entire beverage industry, including non-carbonated beverages and water, increased 1.7% in 2014 better than a 1.6% decline seen the year before.

The production facilities are a part of Coca-Cola Amatil's Indonesian subsidiary Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia (CCAI) Cikekodan plant in Bekasi, West Java. This investment is a part of $500 million investment that The Coca-Cola Company has planned for the Indonesian market.In Oct 2014, The Coca-Cola Company announced its plans to create a joint venture with CCAI with an investment of $500 million. The investment will support production, warehousing and cold-drink infrastructure over three to four years.In fact, during the last three years, CCAI invested more than $300 million to set up 18 new production facilities, deployed 150,000 coolers and three big distribution centers. Further expansion of production facilities in Indonesia will strengthen the company's position in the Indonesian market and increase its ability to serve the increasing demand in the region.Other than Indonesia, Coca-Cola has a commanding presence in the developing and emerging markets of Latin America, India, Russia and China.Coca-Cola is highly optimistic of its Indian operations where the company owns four of the top five sparkling brands as well as the top juice brands in India. Since 2007, Coca-Cola has been witnessing volume growth in the country aided by popular brands like Thums Up, Sprite and Maaza.Coca-Cola is also confident of its long-term prospects in China. Coca-Cola plans to make huge investment in China over the next few years to build plants, distribution, coolers, brands and equipment.

Excluding the impact of currency, earnings of 44 cents increased 5% driven by improved organic revenues and cost cuts. Organic revenues increased 4% driven by an extra selling day, improved soda sales and better volume and price trends in North America amid an improving economic scenario.Management expects 2015 to be a \"transition year\" - a time to start implementing changes to create a new operating model.In Oct 2014, Coca-Cola unveiled strategic actions to drive higher profit. Other than aggressively cutting costs, the plan includes targeting brand and growth investments as well as aligning incentive plans. The company is also refranchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories to create a more efficient system. It closed several transaction in 2014 and plans to complete 2/3rd of the refranchising by 2017-end and the remaining territories no later than 2020 to improve margins and returns. Management started implementing these initiatives in the fourth quarter which led to the better than expected results in the quarter.Moreover, Coca-Cola owns 16% stake in specialty coffee retailer Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.  . Coca-Cola also has an innovative partnership deal with Keurig Green Mountain under which the latter will exclusively make Coca-Cola branded single-serve pods for use on its upcoming Keurig Cold at-home beverage system. The deal opens up an exciting new packaging format for Coca-Cola's brands.Coca-Cola also plans to purchase a 16.7% stake in energy drink maker, Monster Beverage Corporation  , for $2.15 billion. The transaction is expected to close at the beginning of the second quarter. Under the deal with Monster, Coca-Cola will swap its global energy drink business with Monster's non-energy drink business.These strategic investments will help Coca-Cola adapt to changing consumer trends while accelerating innovation.Management, however, warned that the restructuring and strategic initiatives will take time to deliver the desired results amid challenging global macro conditions. Management expects the economic environment in 2015 to be more volatile than 2014. While the macro environment is expected to improve in the U.S., management expects deflation environment in Europe and continued softness in many emerging and developing markets.Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This global leader in flavors and spices has launched 21 new products including flavored sea salts, chili peppers and burger sauce mix-ins. The new innovations are inspired by the McCormick Flavor Forecast trend reports and just perfect for the grilling season.While the burger sauce packets give a bold flavor to the steakhouse burgers and contain enough seasoning to make tastier and juicier patties, McCormick's new sea salt grinders would add freshness and flavor to the dishes. Moreover, McCormick Gourmet's three new chili pepper varieties would offer a wide range of options to spice up the meals at home.Other new products from McCormick brands include OLD BAY HOT Seasoning, Zatarain's Cajun Chicken Flavored Rice, Zatarain's Creamy Parmesan Rice Mix, Zatarain's Creamy Cajun Style Pasta.McCormick regularly enhances its products through innovation in order to remain competitive and tap the rising demand for new flavors, spices and herbs, which are fast replacing demand for sugar, salt and fat. Last December, McCormick had introduced 25 new products including Skillet sauces and gluten-free recipe mixes to satisfy the growing consumer demand for flavor. Gluten-free mixes are becoming very popular among health-conscious consumers. These are made of natural herbs and spices and do not contain any artificial flavors. (Read:  ).We note that the company has witnessed a 20% rise in spice, herb and seasoning purchases in the last five years, owing to the rising demand for flavors. Some of the popular new launches in 2014 include Vahine dessert item, Kamis seasonings and Ducros recipe mixes. In 2013 too, the company introduced recipe mixes in France and Poland and launched new products for value-minded consumers, as well as premium items for more involved and affluent cooks.We believe the announcement of new flavors will surely enable consumers to explore bold, more intense flavors at home that they may have seen in restaurants, foods trucks and online. In addition, this will help the company boost its sales.Overall, we are encouraged by McCormick's increasing focus on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing initiative, the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement ('CCI') program, which started in 2009. In addition, McCormick's product innovation and expansion in emerging markets also remain its strengths.McCormick has recently delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, despite difficult retail and competitive conditions in many markets. However, it has lowered its earnings guidance for 2015, possibly due to apprehensions of higher material costs. (Read:  ).Currently, McCormick has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The novelty of making your own soda at home appears to have worn off for SODA, as the company now finds itself in a bit of trouble.SODA is moving further away from the 'soda' part of its name and into a variety of other carbonated products. The latest of which focuses on sparkling water which is probably good news since many people are starting to trend away from sodas or at least reduce them a bit in their regular diets.These trends have already started to hit SODA in recent months as the company has seen big declines in its soda starter kit portfolio. Some of the recent quarters have seen year-over-year declines approaching 35% for this metric so clearly consumers are starting to shift their tastes.If this wasn't enough, competitors are starting to get in on the home carbonation game which is a trend that could easily crush margins for SODA. Green Mountain is partnering with Coca-Cola on a Keurig Cold machine and with the top brand in the world of beverages getting into the home carbonation market, it could continue to be a tough time for SODA in the future. No wonder SODA is moving in on the more fragmented carbonated water business!But can flavored & carbonated water save SODA's business and pump the company back to growth? Probably not, at least if you look to recent analyst estimate revisions for SODA stock. According to these people who follow the company the closest, prospects for SODA are looking pretty dim in the near term.Over the past two months, the consensus EPS for SODA's current quarter has declined from 15 cents to just six cents per share. We have also seen a similar trend for the current year as the consensus EPS has stumbled from $1.26 two months ago to just 93 cents today.This bakes in truly awful growth rates for SODA with the current quarter and current year numbers (yoy) coming in below -25%. Add in the fact that SODA finds itself in an industry in the bottom 10% and it is tough to be bullish on SODA these days.Given these factors and the rising competition in the space, investors shouldn't be surprised to note that we have given this stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The stock has already lost about 50% of its value in the past year, and it is really tough to get optimistic on SODA right now.So while SODA might be a strong sell, there are actually a few beverage stocks which do make the grade. One of the top picks right now in this department looks to be Monster Beverage (  ), a company that has earned itself a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).MNST has seen rising earnings estimate revisions in the past few weeks and it is expected to grow at an impressive clip as well. In fact, MNST has a Growth Score of B thanks to double digit margins, cash flow growth, and projected EPS growth. So if you are looking for an impressive stock in this market segment, make sure to check out Monster Beverage as it is clearly better positioned than SODA for the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This includes the payment of Big Heart Pet Brands' net debt of about $2.5 billion, which was refinanced by the company. The deal was announced on Feb 3.San Francisco-based Big Heart Pet Brands is a leader in premium-quality, branded pet food and pet snacks, and has placed Smucker in the $21 billion pet food and snacks category, one of the largest and fastest growing categories in the U.S.The acquisition is expected to contribute about $2.4 billion to net sales in fiscal 2016, with an estimated annual growth rate of 4%-5% over the next several years. It will also be slightly accretive to the company's fiscal 2016 earnings. Adjusted earnings are expected to increase approximately 10% in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. Annual synergies of approximately $200 million are expected within the first three years of ownership, with approximately $40 million to $50 million of synergies expected to be realized in fiscal 2016.Big Heart's iconic brands including Meow Mix, Milk-Bone, Kibbles 'n Bits, 9Lives, Natural Balance, Pup-Peroni, Gravy Train, Nature's Recipe, Canine Carry Outs and Milo's Kitchen will further strengthen the company's solid portfolio consisting of leading brands like Smucker's, Folgers, Dunkin' Donuts, Jif and Crisco to name a few.With the rising number of U.S. households adopting pets, we believe the acquisition to have strategic advantages for Smucker. In fact, according to the American Pet Products Association, about 39% of the estimated $59 billion pet-related expenditure was on food last year. Keeping these facts in mind, Smucker believes that the pet food business has potential to become a key revenue driver, besides its existing food and beverage businesses.Of late, Smucker has been actively pursuing acquisitions in both the U.S. and overseas. In early Sep 2014, Smucker completed the acquisition of Seattle, WA-based Sahale Snacks, Inc., which manufactures and markets premium, branded nut and fruit snacks. The acquisition is expected to contribute approximately $25 million to fiscal 2015 sales. (Read:  ).Even before that in Aug 2013, the company had made the acquisition of Enray Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of premium organic, gluten-free ancient grain products. Smucker took control of Enray's flagship brand truRoots, which has helped the company to grow across the rapidly growing gluten-free market. The acquisition is expected to add sales in excess of $50 million annually, thereby increasing the scale of the company's natural foods and specialty businesses.Other acquisitions by Smucker include Seamild in China, Hillshire Brands Company's North American foodservice coffee and hot beverage business in 2012, and the coffee brands and business operations of Rowland Coffee in 2011. These acquisitions have also added iconic brands to the company's portfolio and strengthened its presence in the U.S.Smucker holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Earnings also increased 13% from the 62 cents per share earned a year ago. The increase was driven by top-line growth, higher income from unconsolidated operations and a lower tax rate.The global leader in flavors and spices delivered first-quarter revenues of $1.01 billion, which grew about 2% year over year. Excluding currency headwinds, revenues grew 6%, driven by strong increases in both business segments. Sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $986 million by 2.5%.Despite a positive sales environment, the company's operating income was affected by unfavorable currency rates and higher material costs. Excluding special charges, adjusted operating income declined 2.4% to $122 million in the first quarter.However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew 1% from the year-ago period, driven by sales growth and cost savings, offset in part by the unfavorable impact of higher material input costs and increased retirement benefit expense.The company expects a more favorable operating income scenario over the near term, owing to pricing actions and increase in cost savings. Segment revenues increased 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by increased volume and a better product mix courtesy of product innovation, brand marketing support and expanded distribution. Sales increased on a constant currency basis in all the regions of Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and the Asia/Pacific.Adjusted operating income of the segment was $91.5 million, slightly lower than the prior-year quarter, with the benefit of sales growth and cost savings not being able to offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs, increased retirement benefit expense and product mix. Segment revenues increased 7% year over year on a constant currency basis in the first quarter, driven by higher volume and product mix, as well as pricing actions. Higher segmental sales were contributed by the all the three regions of EMEA, Americas and the Asia/Pacific.Adjusted operating income of this segment was almost flat at $31 million, as the benefit of higher sales and cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs and increased retirement benefit expense.McCormick has lowered its earnings guidance for 2015, possibly due to apprehensions of higher material costs. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of $3.44-$3.51 per share, lower than the previous guidance of $3.51-$3.58, provided during the fourth-quarter 2014 conference call. The new adjusted earnings range is however higher than $3.37 per share reported in 2014.The company continues to expect sales to increase 4% to 6% in local currency. Adjusted operating income is expected to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency from $608 million in 2014.McCormick's Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program is expected to contribute at least $65 million, and savings from the announced streamlining and reorganization actions are estimated at $20 million for 2015.Currently, McCormick has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Though the terms of the deal were not disclosed, all required regulatory approvals were received.Founded in 1972, Mount Shivalik is a popular name in the strong beer market in India. It was the first in the country to launch a strong beer in 1984 under the brand Thunderbolt.Per the deal, Molson Coors has acquired Mount Shivalik's entire brand portfolio, including the Thunderbolt beer brand. Mount Shivalik owns brewing operations in the states of Punjab and Haryana and has a strong brand presence across a number of other northern states in India, including Jharkhand, Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. Molson Coors has also acquired distribution for Thunderbolt in Bihar.Molson Coors debuted in India in Jun 2011 with the purchase of a controlling stake in Cobra India, thereby creating the joint venture Molson Coors Cobra India. In 2013, Molson Coors Cobra collaborated with Mount Shivalik through a brewing and distribution agreement whereby each party would brew and distribute each other's brands in their respective markets.The acquisition of Mount Shivalik will create new opportunities for Molson Coors to introduce its brands in India. The addition of Thunderbolt will also boost the company's beer portfolio. On the other hand, Mount Shivalik, through the partnership, will get industry leading brewing expertise, brand reach and operational efficiency to grow its brands even further in India.The acquired business will continue to be called Mount Shivalik Breweries for some time and will be headquartered in Chandigarh. This will operate as a separate entity from Molson Coors Cobra with a separate governing board.Molson Coors has a strong foothold internationally and has made international acquisitions in the past to expand its portfolio in new and emerging markets. The most important of them was the acquisition of the nine breweries of StarBev (renamed to Central Europe operations) in Jun 2012, which enhanced its premium brands portfolio and accelerated its expansion in the emerging markets of Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. The acquisition of StarBev also helped improve volume growth.We believe the acquisition of Mount Shivalik will also bring new opportunities for Molson Coors and would help in boosting volumes and the top line.Molson Coors holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked players in the beverage industry include Monster Beverage Corporation  , Cott Corporation  and Constellation Brands Inc.  .

Monster had plenty of good news for its shareholders in that announcement, highlighted by a massive 65% jump in profits.Monster managed that result by booking a huge drop in operating costs even as sales leaped higher by 12%. Those two happy trends combined to produce a 50% improvement in profitability: Net income margin grew by 7 percentage points to hit 21% of sales.Monster also announced that its pending deal with beverage king  will close in the second quarter of the year. \"The Coca-Cola transaction continues to present a unique opportunity for us,\" said Monster CEO Rodney Sacks. \"[Monster] will be bolstered by [Coca Cola]'s energy brands in a number of geographies, providing us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies, as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts,\" according to Sacks. In addition to that game-changing partnership, investors can look forward to other big improvements in Monster's business this year. The company should book strong international sales, particularly in Japan, which is becoming one of Monster's biggest markets. Meanwhile, new product launches like the Rehab Peach Tea and Energy Ultra Sunrise should help sales keep chugging along in the U.S.Overall, Wall Street pros expect Monster to book 18% revenue gains in 2015. Profits are targeted to jump 22% to $3.37 per share, up from $2.77 per share in the 2014 fiscal year. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks. But if you want to make sure that 2015 is  best investing year ever, you need to know where to start.

Adjusted earnings of 88 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents by a penny. However, earnings slipped 9% year over year as the strong top-line performance was offset by incremental marketing investments, currency headwinds and unfavorable comparisons from the year-ago period. Net sales rose 3% year over year to $1.51 billion backed by improving sales volumes.Dr Pepper delivered a strong performance in 2014, beating management's expectations for both earnings and sales growth driven by pricing gains, innovations, powerful marketing programs and productivity improvements. We believe that improving U.S. consumer sentiment, increased marketing support and Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) driven cost savings will lead to strong results in 2015 as well. The share price of the company soared 54.5% in 2014 and 7% year-to-date in 2015.Overall, Dr Pepper has sound long-term fundamentals - strong position in the flavored CSD market, aggressive cost savings from the RCI program and regular cash returns to shareholders. Last month, the board of directors approved a 17.1% increase in quarterly dividend as well as an additional share repurchase authorization of $1 billion.However, sluggish volumes of its carbonated beverages, including the diet versions, due to CSD category headwinds are a persistent overhang. Weak consumer spending environment, cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness - consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concern - are hurting CSD category growth. This coupled with new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales of major soft drink makers like The Coca-Cola Company  and PepsiCo, Inc.  . Management expects the CSD category headwinds to continue in 2015.Dr Pepper carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked beverage company is Monster Beverage Corporation  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

However, these can also lead on the downside when the growth story is over, so it is important to find companies which are still seeing strong growth prospects in their businesses.One such company that might be well-positioned for future earnings growth is  (  ). This firm, which is in the Beverages industry, saw EPS growth of 42.1% last year, and is looking great for this year too.In fact, the current growth estimate for this year calls for earnings-per-share growth of 20.9%. Furthermore, the long-term growth rate is currently an impressive 21.3%, suggesting pretty good prospects for the long haul.And if this wasn't enough, the stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 4.7%. Thanks to this rise in earnings estimates, MNST has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which further underscores the potential for outperformance in this company.So if you are looking for a fast growing stock that is still seeing plenty of opportunities on the horizon, make sure to consider MNST. Not only does it have double digit earnings growth prospect, but its impressive Zacks Rank suggests that analysts believe better days are ahead for MNST as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The once unknown firm has risen to prominence and is now a $23 billion company. And while the company is best known for its namesake of Monster Energy drinks, MNST has branched out into sodas, juices, and teas too, becoming a formidable player in the sector.Though MNST has already seen great growth, the company actually has solid prospects to continue this run well into the future. This is especially true when investors look to recent earnings estimate revisions as analysts seem to still be bullish on the company's prospects.Over the past thirty days, it is hard to find an analyst that has not become more bullish on MNST. For the current year, the current quarter, and next year time frames, not a single analyst in our consensus has lowered their estimate, while eight have raised their estimates for the current year time frame alone.These moves have led to a modest increase in the consensus too, showing just how much analysts believe in the near term prospects of MNST. And with the latest revisions to earnings estimates, MNST is expected to post EPS growth of 20% both this year and the next.And while these lofty expectations might be a little concerning to some, it is worth noting that MNST is riding a nice winning streak when it comes to earnings season, including its most recent report where it beat estimates by 22%. While a series of misses are before this nice run, it may just be that MNST has finally figured out to match estimates and clearly this is paying off for Monster stock.Thanks to these factors, it shouldn't be too surprising to note that MNST has earned itself a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This means that we are expecting strong levels of outperformance to continue from this company in the near term and that we are looking for the solid growth levels for MNST to remain the story for this beverage stock.If you are seeking a company to shake up the stodgy beverage market, look no further than Monster Beverage. The company has burst onto the scene and has really made a name for itself with its novel lineup of products.Customers seem to be embracing this approach too, as we have seen an impressive trend for MNST recently, including operating income that has doubled over the past five years. And with current analyst estimate revision trends moving in the right direction, it is hard to argue that MNST is an excellent stock that is worthy of closer inspection right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Students are starting to question the value of degrees from many institutions in this space, while the government seems poised to move more student loan debt into a position that can be wiped out in bankruptcy.If these trends weren't enough, many 'traditional' schools have moved into the online university realm, dulling the appeal of some for-profit education centers in the process. So clearly, competition and a changing environment are really having a negative impact on a number of companies on this space, making them very precarious investments right now.One company that exemplifies this negative trend is undoubtedly American Public Education (  -  ). This for-profit education company focuses on two segments-American Public Education and Hondros College of Nursing-and it has been under pressure in this difficult environment.The company has seen wild swings lately, and shares are easily underperforming the S&P 500 both YTD and over the past year. But unfortunately for APEI, this doesn't look likely to be the end of the trend by a long shot. This is especially true if investors look to recent earnings estimate revisions which suggest that more pain is on the way.Analysts appear to be universally bearish on APEI's recent prospects, as it is nearly impossible to find someone who has raised their outlook for the company's earnings in the past two months. Instead, we have witnessed six revisions lower in the past thirty days for the full year period, and four lower in the past 30 days for the current quarter.But it is the magnitude of these revisions which is the real story, as analysts now expect APEI to earn just 49 cents a share in earnings this quarter, a far cry from the 62 cents a share that was projected just a month ago. It is now expected that APEI will have a year over year earnings contraction of over 16%, further showcasing the bearish short term trend.Internet TV is gradually gaining market traction in the U.S. Of late, the legacy pay-TV industry in the country has been facing severe competition from online video streaming service providers. The low-cost over-the-top video streaming service has resulted in massive cord cutting that is currently threatening the pay-TV business model. Internet TV has emerged as a strong alternative to counter this competitive threat.Technically, Internet TV is somewhat similar to pay-TV offerings. Internet TV shows can be viewed using a broadband connection and mobile gadgets like tablets, smartphones, Roku box, smart TV, to name a few. To sum it up, Internet TV offers a TV Everywhere experience to subscribers. We believe that the growing deployment of super-fast 4G LTE wireless technology and significant adoption of portable mobile devices are the primary reasons propelling the popularity of Internet TV.In Feb 2015, DISH Network Corp. (  -  ), the second largest satellite TV operator, commercially launched its Internet TV service called \"Sling TV\" throughout the U.S. The Sling TV service is available for $20 a month and offers several channels including ESPN, ABC and Disney Channels of Walt Disney, along with HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel of Scripps Networks Interactive and several AMC Network channels. Customers will also be able to access add-on packages for an additional $5 per month.Recently, Verizon Communications Inc. (  -  ) announced that its Internet TV offering will include channels for AwesomenessTV and DreamWorksTV, and will feature more than 200 hours of original programming. Verizon stated that its targeted audience will be teens and young adults who will be served largely through mobile video offerings. The company seeks to focus on two different categories of viewers through its Internet TV service and fiber-based FiOS TV offerings.In the same league, a couple of days ago, the U.S. division of Sony Corp. (  -  ) announced that it will launch its new PlayStation Vue Internet TV service in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia within the next two weeks, followed by a national rollout later this year. Under this service, Sony is likely to offer a large array of top-rated channels from 21st Century Fox, CBS, Comcast's NBC Universal and Viacom. Although Sony has not revealed its pricing plan, several industry analysts estimated that the price for the offering could range from $60-$80 per month.Every day, the analysts at Zacks Equity Research select two stocks that are likely to outperform (Bull) or underperform (Bear) the markets over the next 3-6 months.Updated throughout every trading day, the  provides analysis from Zacks Equity Research about the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets.Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous analyst coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

We believe lower-than-expected second quarter fiscal 2015 results and narrowed guidance for fiscal 2015 have dampened the investors' confidence and thus the share price decline.United Natural missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in the second quarter due to continued weakness in the Canadian dollar.Second quarter fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents by 1.5%. However, it grew 16.4% from the prior-year quarter earnings driven by year over year top-line growth, operating income growth and robust acquisitions.Quarterly net sales of $2.017 billion increased 22.5% year over year driven by a continuous increase in demand for the company's organic and natural food products and robust acquisitions. Tony's Fine Foods (acquired during fourth quarter fiscal 2014) contributed significant net sales of approximately $232.6 million. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Tony's Fine Foods, sales increased 8.4%. However, the company marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.024 billion.In the second quarter, the company recognized a non-recurring reduction in net sales of $7.7 million to reflect a customer obligation. Currency headwinds also pulled back revenues by approximately $2.1 million. Net sales were also negatively impacted by severe weather throughout the Northeast and Southeastern U.S.On a channel basis, supermarket sales increased 26.6% in the second quarter and represented 27% of total sales. Supernatural channel sales increased 16.7% and represented 35% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Sales growth in the Independent channel was 22.2% and it constituted approximately 32% of total sales. Food service comprised approximately 4% of total sales and increased 64.2% in the second quarter.Despite year over year increase in revenues, gross margin declined 145 basis points to 14.8% in the reported quarter. The main reason for the decline was due to the impact of lower gross margin associated with Tony's Fine Foods. The remainder was mostly due to unfavorable customer mix, lower fuel surcharges, higher freight costs and currency headwinds.Adjusted operating income increased 17.2% to $57.2 million, despite a 13.8% increase in operating expenses.Adjusted for the impact of a reduction in net sales, adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 are expected in the range of $2.90 to $2.99, an increase of approximately 15.1% to 18.7% over fiscal 2014 earnings of $2.52. Earlier the company expected earnings in the range of approximately $2.88 - $3.01 per share.United Natural has revised its guidance for fiscal 2015 due to continued currency headwinds and the impact of a $7.7 million reduction in net sales recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. It now expects sales in the range of $8.19 billion to $8.29 billion compared with the prior range of $8.13 billion to $8.38 billion. This marks an increase of 20.5% to 22.0% over fiscal 2014 sales of $6.79 billion.With increasing demand for a healthy lifestyle, food safety and environmental sustainability, the demand for organic products is growing rapidly. Moreover, it is believed that the growth rate of the natural products industry has outpaced the growth of the overall food-at-home industry.In addition, United Natural has taken the inorganic route to expand its distribution network, customer base and boost long-term growth. The company acquired Trudeau Foods during first quarter fiscal 2014, which helped it to enhance its position and increase its market share in the specialty products industry. The acquisition also helped United Natural to expand its products in the markets of Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. We expect the company's acquisition of Tony's Fine Foods to broaden its reach across all of its markets.United Natural has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked food companies include Flower Foods, Inc.  and Supervalu Inc.  , which hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Excluding the change in pension value, the figure came in at $18.1 million.The filing also stated that Kent let go of $2.5 million annual incentive for 2014 to which he was entitled due to the company's underperformance during the year.Coca-Cola's 2014 total revenue declined 2% while adjusted net income declined 3%. The company's performance was below expectations due to challenging global macro environment, carbonated soft drink (CSD) category headwinds and currency headwinds.Kent cited the \"difficult but necessary decisions\" taken by the company to implement its strategic initiatives as the reason behind rejecting the cash performance bonus.In Oct 2014, Coca-Cola unveiled some strategic measures to drive profit growth in 2015. These include increased marketing investments in its brands, more aggressive productivity savings and modification in the incentive compensation structure to include more direct performance measures such as revenue growth.Management expects 2015 to be a \"transition year\" - a time to start implementing changes to create a new operating model.Coca-Cola plans to re-franchise the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories by 2017-end which should improve margins. Moreover, the beverage giant is in the process of developing a new partnership model through equity investments like those in Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.  and Monster Beverage Corporation  as well as pursuing mergers & acquisitions to enhance growth in key categories.Last year, in March, Coca Cola was criticized for its unreasonably high management pay by David Winters, chief executive and founder of the Wintergreen Advisers, an investment fund which owns a significant equity stake in the company.

Results for the quarter were adversely affected by foreign exchange rate.Net sales for the third quarter inched up 1% year over year to $1,093 million. However, on an underlying basis (excluding negative currency impact and other adjustments), sales grew 5%. Moreover, after deducting excise taxes, sales came in at $813 million, up about 4% from the prior-year figure of $782 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was $816 million.Growth in the quarter came on the back of the company's strong portfolio of premium American whiskey brands and a balanced geographic approach.In the reported quarter, Brown-Forman's gross profit increased 4% to $553 million from $532 million in the year-ago comparable quarter, primarily due to favorable price mix. Consequently, gross margin improved 130 basis points (bps) to 50.6%. On an underlying basis, gross profit increased 7%.Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) rose 1% from the year-ago quarter to $163 million. On the other hand, advertising expenses fell 3% year over year to $112 million. On an underlying basis, SG&A expense increased 6% and advertising expenses were up 3%.Operating income jumped 7% year over year to $272 million, with the operating margin expanding 130 bps to 24.9%, as the benefit from improved gross margin was more than offset by higher expenses and adverse impact of foreign exchange. On an underlying basis, operating income rose 8%.Brown-Forman ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $250 million and long-term debt of $748 million. The company's total shareholders' equity stood at $2,041 million, as of Jan 31, 2015.During the first nine months of fiscal 2015, Brown-Forman generated $375 million of cash from operations. Also, over the same period, the company repurchased 3 million shares for $269 million. This leaves the company with $184 million of its $250 million share buyback authorization.On Jan 20, 2015, the company announced a quarterly dividend of 31.5 cents a share, payable on Apr 1 to shareholders of record as on Mar 10. This brings the company's annualized dividend to $1.26 per share.Anticipating stability in the global markets going forward, the company reaffirmed its fiscal 2015 guidance range of 6% to 8% growth in underlying sales. Moreover, operating income is still expected to increase in the band of 9% to 11% on an underlying basis. Underlying results for the year are expected to gain from the company's accelerated growth in the U.S., coupled with favorable fourth-quarter comparisons.However, the company anticipates the ongoing foreign exchange headwinds to continue to negatively impact fiscal 2015 results. The company expects operating income for the year to include a negative currency impact of mid-single digit. Additionally, Brown-Forman forecasts an additional 5 cents per share impact on its earnings per share for fiscal 2015, bringing the negative currency impact for the full year to 20 cents per share. Consequently, the company downgraded its earnings guidance to a band of $3.15-$3.25 per share.Currently, Brown-Forman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the beverages-alcohol industry are SABMiller plc  and Constellation Brands Inc.  .

Shares of the company have been rising ever since it reported strong fourth-quarter 2014 results on Feb 12.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues, while delivering in-line earnings. Moreover, the company provided a decent sales outlook for 2015.In fact, this natural, organic and plant-based food/beverage maker has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in each quarter of 2014. It has also delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four quarters.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company saw earnings per share growth of 36% last year backed by innovation, increased scale, supply chain initiatives and pricing actions.We believe that the company is poised well for this year, while its products enjoy strong demand due to the natural/organic food revolution. Shares surged 55% in 2014 and almost 20% year-to-date.WhiteWave Foods' fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share (excluding investments related to a Chinese joint venture) of 27 cents were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but a penny above management's expectations of 25 to 26 cents. Earnings grew 24% year over year driven by solid sales and margins.Sales increased 34% year over year to $911 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $898 million by 1.5%. The top-line increase was also above management's expectation of around 30% growth. Strong organic growth and the acquisitions of Earthbound Farm (Jan 2014) and So Delicious (fourth quarter) drove sales.The strong top-line performance came despite the currency headwinds and lower-than-expected contribution from Earthbound Farm due to difficult weather conditions.Organically (excluding Earthbound Farm and So Delicious), revenues grew 11% as both the North American and European businesses reported strong volumes.Adjusted operating profits grew 43% year over year to $87 million. Adjusted operating margins (excluding Earthbound and So Delicious) expanded 120 basis points in the quarter driven by solid top-line growth, cost leverage from increased sales and realization of supply chain savings.Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected within $1.08 to $1.12, excluding investments in the Chinese joint venture.Excluding currency headwinds of 5 cents, constant currency earnings are expected in the range of $1.13 to $1.17.For the full year, sales growth is expected in the high-single to low-double digits range. Excluding currency headwinds, sales growth is expected in a low double-digit range.Management expects adjusted total operating income to grow in the high-teens to low-twenties on a constant currency basis.For the first quarter, management expects adjusted diluted earnings per share to range within 20 to 22 cents, excluding the China joint venture costs.

Excluding currency headwinds, sales growth is expected in a low double-digit range.Adjusted total operating income growth is expected in the high-single to low-double digits range on a constant currency basis. First-quarter growth rate is likely to be slightly lower than the full year due to higher marketing investments to support product launches, moderately higher commodity costs and higher start-up costs related to a new plant.

Notably, gross sales outside the U.S. increased 16.1% year over year during the fourth quarter.The revenue upside was also driven by solid sales of the Original Monster Green energy, Java Monster and Zero Ultra drinks. In fact, even the latest launch - Ultra Sunrise - performed well in the quarter. Some of the other brands that did reasonably well in the quarter include Juice Monster and Punch Monster.Moreover, fourth-quarter 2014 gross margin rose 360 basis points (bps), attributable to favorable changes in product sales mix, increase in production efficiencies and decrease in cost of some raw materials, particularly certain sweeteners. The gross margin increase was also supported by higher prices of the 24-ounce Monster Energy brand energy drinks and the Peace Tea line offerings.Operating income improved a handsome 43.1% owing to higher income from international regions such as Europe and Japan.We believe Monster Beverage has also been witnessing rising estimates as investors have pinned their high hopes on The Coca-Cola Company  deal which was initiated in Aug 2014.Under the long-term strategic deal, Coca-Cola will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business to Monster Beverage. Also, Coca-Cola will gain ownership of Monster Beverage's non-energy business.

In volatile times like these, there are certain stocks that work better than others. Some have large cash positions, some are recession-resistant for a variety of reasons, and some just have such a powerful brand that market swings won't affect them as much.We asked three of our analysts to tell us their favorite stocks for volatile markets, and here is what they had to say. Choosing  as a defensive stock pick certainly runs against the grain in many investors' eyes, as the tech giant has historically offered investment exposure that could magnify market volatility for shareholders. Yet on numerous occasions over the past couple of years, Apple's stock has moved independently of the market, sometimes sagging when most tech stocks climbed, and other times posting strong gains even when its peers were going nowhere.What Apple has that many other stocks lack, though, is dependable performance. The company's most recent quarterly results are just the latest example of Apple's strength, with the success of the iPhone 6 line of smartphones accentuating the stranglehold that the iDevice-maker has over the high end of the mobile market. Moreover, Apple has grown its dividend recently and instituted massive buyback programs that could help put a floor under the stock in the event of a downward move for the broader stock market. Apple's extensive cash hoard also gives it the opportunity to benefit from any future market crash by making smart strategic acquisitions on the cheap. All told, Apple has a lot of desirable characteristics that conservative investors value, and that makes it a logical pick to protect against market volatility. has so many things that make it perfect for this role in your portfolio, I couldn't possibly list them all in a reasonable amount of words. Focusing on the ones that matter the most, though, should be sufficient.To start, Berkshire's holding companies are immensely diverse, meaning the company isn't overexposed to any one industry that could drag the stock down excessively. These businesses range from railways to utilities, to insurance companies with exposure to multiple markets and geographies, to manufacturing of consumer and industrial products.Second, Berkshire always carries a significant cash position, more than $62 billion through last quarter. Not only does that cash mean stability in rough seas, but it gives CEO Warren Buffett -- likely the greatest investor of our lifetimes -- the ammo he needs for his \"elephant gun.\"Third, few companies have the kind of management Berkshire does, and I'm not even factoring Buffett or longtime partner Charlie Munger in when I write that. The reality is, neither of these men are involved in the daily operations of the subsidiaries where more than 300,000 Berkshire employees work. The quality of people running all of those excellent businesses is a significant reason Berkshire is such a rock-solid, stable investment.Combine these things, and you have a business that's built to last, and should be a source of strength in even the worst markets. One great stock for a volatile market is Coca-Cola is the  around the world with 17 brands each with over $1 billion in revenue, and 20 more with between $500 million-$1 billion in revenue. While soda consumption is declining in developed markets, Coca-Cola has a long runway of growth in emerging markets as more consumers join the global middle class. The company has also been diversifying into newer fast growing non-alcoholic beverage categories, most notably last year by forging partnerships with  and  .With so much brand power and a massive distribution network built over decades in growing markets around the world,  allowing it to put new brands into their distribution network and gain economies of scale that upstarts could only dream about. It is because of that brand power, distribution network, and economies of scale that it will be near impossible for anyone to ever  .The reason the stock is great for volatile markets is that the company pays a quarterly dividend that it has steadily grown for over 52 years -- since 1963. At current prices, Coca-Cola has a forward yield of 3.1%, that's 75% higher than the market's yield of 1.8%.The large dividend is great for volatile markets as research has shown that dividend-paying stocks are less volatile than the average stock as the stock price is supported by their high yield. Legendary contrarian investor David Dreman found in \"When the Bear Growls: Bear Market Returns 1970 - 1996\" that a high-yield dividend strategy declined half as much of the market during down quarters.This is important with lower volatility as you are more likely to keep investing during declines instead of getting emotional and selling your shares. When the market and your portfolio are down, you can take comfort in knowing that with your dividends coming in you will have cash to take advantage of the low prices and opportunities created by the volatility.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could ensure a boost in your retirement income of as much as $60,000. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans used them, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion... every year!

Yet the niche creation of its Monster energy drink proved to be the game changer for the company, which saw revenue soar from $50 million in 2003 to nearly $740 million in just the  of 2014.That meteoric rise led the company to change its name to Monster Beverage in 2012.

The cause? Mixed economic data, including a downward revision of fourth-quarter GDP.Despite today's decline, the DJIA index had its best monthly gain since January 2013. Monthly gains were 5.5% for the S&P 500 - the biggest since October 2011 - and 7.1% for the Nasdaq, the biggest since January 2012.Today's Scorecard: Mixed economic data gave investors little enthusiasm to push stocks higher Friday. This morning, the second revision of the Q4 2014 GDP registered at 2.2%, which beat expected growth of 2.1%. Still, the figure slipped from the previous estimate of 2.6%, and the pace is a steep decline from the Q3 2014 final reading of 5%.Meanwhile, the February reading of the Chicago PMI, an index of business activity in the U.S. Midwest, slipped to its lowest level since July 2009.Now, check out the other top market stories - plus get our new profit tip for investors:High-margin specialty drugs are prescription medications that treat complex, chronic, and debilitating diseases. They're very expensive - as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars.The market for these medications will quadruple over the next five years. Consumer spending on these drugs hit $87.1 billion in 2012. In five years that number will soar to $401.7 billion.Some of the priciest high-margin specialty drugs include Soliris, developed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, and Elaprase, by Shire. Soliris treats a rare blood disorder and costs patients roughly $410,000 per year. Elaprase treats Hunter syndrome and costs $375,000 per year.Those hefty price tags have caused these drug makers' stocks to surge. Since 2010, Alexion has gained 625%, and Shire 275%.The biggest profit play of all in high-margin specialty drugs comes from makers of hepatitis C treatments. An April 2014 report from Express Scripts found that spending on hepatitis C drugs is expected to increase by more than 200% in both 2015 and 2016.Newer and more convenient treatments in the coming years will drive sales. And the high price of these hepatitis C drugs will propel the stocks of the pharmaceutical companies that make them to new heights.

Yet  has been one of the top-performing stocks since the turn of the millennium, and the company owes nearly all of its success to the booming popularity of its Monster energy drinks. With the beverage maker set to report fourth-quarter financial results on Thursday afternoon, Monster Beverage investors have high hopes it can sustain its impressive track record of growth and produce even more profitable results in 2015. Let's take an early look at what we're likely to see from Monster Beverage this quarter and how those results could set the company up for success throughout the year.\n  \nSource: Yahoo! Finance. Over the past few months, investors have been generally positive in their views on Monster Beverage earnings, raising their estimates for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015 by about 1% to 2%. The stock has continued its upward trajectory, climbing another 11% since mid-November.The Hansen's beverage line is set to transfer to Coca-Cola. Source: Monster Beverage. in November bolstered the stock's positive momentum, as investors were generally pleased with the beverage company's ability to keep growing. Even though revenue didn't rise as much as anticipated, Monster's earnings continued to pick up pace, sustaining a growth rate above 30% for the third quarter in a row. Monster's market share also demonstrated the company's strength in the energy-drink space, with command of more than 36% of the convenience-store market, surpassing archrival  's 34%.One key to Monster Beverage's success has been using its pricing power to boost its overall profit margin. After suffering a downward trend in late 2012 and 2013, Monster has returned its average case sales price to 2011 levels.Prices can drop temporarily as the company offers promotional discounts to attract new customers, but as it builds up its loyal customer base, those consumers have proven willing to stick around and pay more for the product.Still, Monster faces a number of unanswered questions. As the company releases new products, it runs the risk of cannibalizing sales of its existing brands rather than bringing new customers into its fold. Moreover, Monster is still dealing with the uncertainty of potential product liability claims, with concerns about the long-term health effects of high levels of caffeine and other ingredients within energy drinks across the industry.Some worry that new products could simply lead existing customers to switch drinks. Source: Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage investors also need to see exactly how the operational aspects of its partnership with  will play out. The plan involves Monster transferring its Hansen's Natural brand and other nonenergy drinks to Coca-Cola, while Monster will have access to Coca-Cola's extensive worldwide distribution system. Coke's global reach could help accelerate Monster's growth abroad and also help reduce overhead costs associated with distributing its products.In the Monster Beverage report, look to see what the company has to say about the Coca-Cola transition. Some analysts expect disruptions to Monster's sales in the short run as retailers get used to a new way of doing business with the beverage company, and Monster said recently it expects about $280 million in costs from the transition. Still, Monster Beverage has the potential to benefit far more from the long-term savings and new sales opportunities the deal will create, and so most investors will want to see what guidance the energy-drink giant offers for 2015 and beyond. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

For 2014, net sales jumped almost 10%, to $2.5 billion, producing 43% higher net income and full-year earnings of $2.77 per share.CEO Rodney Sacks expressed his satisfaction with the report. \"We are pleased to report another quarter and year of continuing sales growth,\" Sacks said, and he particularly called out \"solid sales growth in Japan, which is becoming one of our largest international markets.\" The company is also excited about its most recent energy-drink flavor launches, which Sacks sees as an integral part of Monster's strategic plan in 2015. The big news going forward, though, will be the completion of Monster's deal with Coca-Cola. Under the arrangement, Monster will get ownership of Coca-Cola's existing lineup of energy drinks in exchange for Monster's non-energy-drink beverages, including Hansen's Natural sodas.Moreover, Monster will enjoyed most-favored status as a distribution partner globally, helping to accelerate its worldwide expansion, and leveraging Coca-Cola's global presence to increase awareness and open up new potential markets. As Sachs sees it, the deal will provide Monster with \"complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies, as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts.\" Monster hopes to complete the deal during the second quarter of 2015.CEO Rodney Sacks, testifying before Congress in 2013. Source: C-SPAN.One interesting consequence of the company's international success was a drop in Monster's effective tax rate. Some of Monster's foreign subsidiaries end up having no income-tax expense because of deferred tax assets that they have on their balance sheets.The one concern that Monster discussed was the potential impact of regulatory and litigation expenses related to the safety and advertising of energy drinks. Monster spent just $2.9 million during the fourth quarter on those costs, but the $20.6 million it spent throughout 2014 was 15% higher than its 2013 expenses.Monster Beverage shareholders were certainly pleased with the results, as the stock climbed 7% in the first hour-and-a-half of after-hours trading following the announcement. Yet investors won't truly get a full sense of just how big the Coca-Cola deal will be until it actually closes. For that, Monster Beverage shareholders will have to wait until the second half of 2015; but by all indications, it looks as though it will be worth the wait. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

In fact, the energy drink category increased in mid-single digits in the U.S during the third quarter of 2014.

Beginning investors learn early and often to diversify their investments, both across asset classes and among industries, and they are told that diversification lowers risk and can protect your nest egg from a collapse like the one we've just seen in the oil market. However, diversification can also be a siren's song for investors, supplanting better ideas and leading them into areas they'd be better off avoiding. Here are three reasons to keep your diversification in check.The more assets you own, the more work you have to do. As an individual investor, you should keep tabs on your holdings by following quarterly earnings reports and other major news items. Realistically, you only have so much time to devote to following your stocks. Probably, five or 10 is the most you can reasonably keep track of and sustain an interest in. Investors who get carried away and buy 100 different stocks will have trouble staying informed. Even on Wall Street, the average research analyst, who does this as a full-time job, only follows about 30 companies.Instead of devoting your energy to diversification, focus on finding good investments and keeping an eye on them. Should conditions change to affect your thesis, you can sell and buy something else, limiting your holdings to a reasonable number.The more investments you have, the more likely it is that you're mixing your best ideas with mediocre ones. Most investors have more expertise or understanding or in one area than others. If there's a certain industry you know well, you're probably better off investing in that area than blindly diversifying into businesses you don't understand.Warren Buffett, the greatest investor in history, has shunned diversification specifically for that reason. He avoids tech stocks because he doesn't understand that industry, and has focused primarily on insurance, banking, and consumer goods companies, the areas he is most familiar with. Understanding those businesses and how to value them is what's made Buffett such a great investor. Knowing what to avoid has also helped, too. Bet on your best ideas, not on half-baked theories.Diversification and its cousin, rebalancing, teach us to avoid risk even if it could cost us increased returns. Low risk and average returns seem to be the goal, but your best investments can often turn into multi-baggers, making up for mediocre returns in the rest of your portfolio. The worst you can do with a stock is lose the money you put in, so a portfolio with a few big winners and some losers will do a better than one with all stocks generating average returns. Big winners also often come from the same industry. The two best-performing stocks of the last 10 years were both beverage companies:  and  .Diversification and rebalancing limit risk, but they also tend to put a cap on returns. Depending on your investing goals, this can be very poor trade-off to make.For the investor looking to limit risk in the stock market, buying an index fund is a better way to do it than hand-picking 100 different stocks, and it can help avoid fees that come with an advisor or a brokerage account. If you're looking for income, holding defensive, dividend-paying stocks like utilities and consumer staples is one solid strategy, and selling covered calls can also help. ProShares offers an ETF of the  Dividend Aristocrats, which gives investors easy access to a group of stable companies that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Historically, dividend aristocrats have outperformed the broader market.Diversification in and off itself isn't a bad strategy, but it's easy to get carried away. The goal of investing, after all, isn't a diversified portfolio; it's a growing one. To that end, concentrating on your strengths, keeping the number of investments manageable, and relying on dividends and index funds for security and income can often be better paths to that goal than diversification.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could ensure a boost in your retirement income of as much as $60,000. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans used them, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion... every year! And once you learn how to take advantage of these loopholes, you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.  that details how you can take advantage of these strategies.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC.

Coca-Cola's stock returned just 7% in 2014, including dividends, compared to 14.5% for the  . However, the company made several moves last year that could bear fruit in 2015 and beyond.2014 was a year of deal making and diversification. Coca-Cola's biggest moves included taking equity stakes in and forging partnerships with  and  .Last February, Coca-Cola announced a long-term partnership with Keurig, maker of the eponymous coffee brewer and K-Cup single-serve coffee pods. As part of the deal, Coca-Cola bought a 10% stake in Keurig for $1.25 billion, and later exercised a right to purchase an additional stake, bringing its total interest to 16% of Keurig's outstanding shares.In addition, Coca-Cola announced in August that it would buy a 16.7% stake in Monster Beverage for $2.15 billion.These deals mark an important turning point in Coca-Cola's history and could pave the way for another century of shareholder value creation.Coca-Cola has a tough road ahead of it, but the company might be on its way to solving some of its biggest challenges in the coming year. Consumption of the company's core beverage -- carbonated soft drinks -- declined for the ninth straight year in the United States during 2013 and likely fell again in 2014.Creating a new distribution channel with the upcoming in-home Keurig Cold device could increase demand for soft drinks and other Coca-Cola beverages. Keurig Cold is expected to be released later this year, potentially providing the spark that reignites consumer interest in soft drinks.Keurig also helps Coca-Cola diversify its product line away from the fading soft drink market. Even after the Keurig Cold is introduced, Keurig will still be reliant on the U.S. coffee and tea market for most of its sales. If the Keurig Cold performs well, Coca-Cola could make a bid for the entire company -- increasing the beverage giant's exposure to the coffee market.Monster provides even greater diversification for Coca-Cola in a growing market. As part of the deal struck last year, Monster transferred its non-energy brands -- including Hansen's Natural Sodas, Peace Tea, Hubert's Lemonade, and Hansen's Juice Products -- to Coca-Cola. In return, Coca-Cola transferred its energy drink brands to Monster and became Monster's leading global distribution partner.The big market opportunity for energy drinks provides enormous upside in the Monster deal. Although Monster's 2013 revenue was just 4.8% of Coca-Cola's revenue, the company has a long runway for growth. Monster's energy drink volume increased by 7.7% in 2013, according to  . As the category grows, energy drinks will likely capture more shelf space in convenience stores by replacing diet soft drinks.Moreover, Coca-Cola's global distribution system should accelerate Monster's expansion in foreign markets. With relationships in nearly every country on Earth, Coke can introduce Monster's products to new markets faster than Monster could on its own. This could spark higher growth in the years ahead.Finally, Coca-Cola needs to cut costs even as it ramps up new offerings. The company plans to save $2 billion annually -- or 4.3% of 2013 revenue -- by 2019 through cost-cutting and supply chain optimization. Achieving the cost reduction target would provide a meaningful boost to Coca-Cola's operating margin, which hovers around 22% of sales. Investors should keep an eye on the company's progress to ensure the promised cost savings actually materialize. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks. But if you want to make sure that 2015 is  best investing year ever, you need to know where to start.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the September put at the $95 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.00. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.2% return against the $95 commitment, or a 6.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MNST's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $95 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Monster Beverage Corp sees its shares fall 19.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $91.00 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.00 from $95), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6.4% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp, and highlighting in green where the $95 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September put at the $95 strike for the 6.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Monster Beverage Corp (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $118.58) to be 39%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ividend aristocrat stocks can be a rewarding place for investors to find steady income because they represent companies that have consecutively increased their dividend payouts annually for the last 25 years or more. Below, three Motley Fool contributors explain why  ,  , and  are three of the best dividend aristocrat stocks money can buy today. : PepsiCo stands out as one of the top dividend aristocrats today because it offers investors both low risk and high dividend growth for many years to come. True, its dividend yield of 2.69% is slightly below Coke's 2.83% yield. However, Pepsi has grown its dividend by more than 151% in the past decade, compared to 117% growth in Coke's dividend over the same period. data by  .Pepsi increased its dividend by as much as 15% in June 2014 to $2.62 annually, up from $2.27 per share. This too is markedly above Coca-Cola, which currently pays an annual dividend of $1.22 per share. Nevertheless, Pepsi also has other things going for it, such as its robust snacks business. Thanks to its Frito-Lay business, Pepsi is the world's largest snack food company by market share. Moreover, its snack division boasts 22 brands that  pull in annual sales north of $1 billion. This means Pepsi should have plenty of cash on hand to continue rewarding investors well into the future.Pepsi is now on pace to return a whopping $8.7 billion to its shareholders in fiscal 2014 through higher dividends and share buybacks. Investors will get more color on these returns next month when the company  its fiscal 2014 fourth-quarter and full year results. Until then, it is encouraging to know that Pepsi has paid a dividend every year since 1952, and has increased its payout for the past 42 consecutive years. This, together with the company's ability to generate strong cash flow, makes PepsiCo one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks to own today. : I'm going to take the Pepsi challenge against Tamara here and select rival Coca-Cola, a Dividend Aristocrat with a similarly enviable track record of dividend growth. With a 52-year track record of raising its dividends every single year, Coca-Cola beats out the No. 2 U.S. soft-drink seller by a full decade. Its 2.9% dividend yield also inches out PepsiCo.Admittedly, investors have been far more concerned about Coca-Cola than PepsiCo lately, as Coca-Cola's pure play on beverages has left it more exposed to the backlash against sugary and diet carbonated drinks in recent years. Yet even with PepsiCo's snack business to buffer it from the blow, Coca-Cola has nevertheless made moves to bolster its future growth. In particular, strategic investments in  and  have allowed Coca-Cola to profit from the success of both of its peers while also maximizing the value of assets like Coca-Cola's distribution network. Coca-Cola has also made its own moves away from its namesake beverage lines, with water and other still beverages making up a growing portion of the company's overall revenue. With many shareholders having completely discounted the Coke brand's value, just about anything other than a worst-case scenario for carbonated soft drinks could give Coca-Cola stock a big pop on top of its other growth prospects. :  While it often gets lost in Procter & Gamble's shadow, Colgate-Palmolive is a legendary stock on its own. In the 20-year period through the third quarter of 2014, the stock had delivered an amazing 1,166% total return to investors. This dwarfed the 532% return for the  . Colgate-Palmolive shareholders have enjoyed steady growth thanks to the company's market-leading products, including its namesake Colgate toothpaste, Palmolive dish soap, and a large pet care business.Colgate-Palmolive is an international powerhouse and grew organic revenue last quarter by 3.5% due largely to the emerging markets. The company derives just 18% of its sales from North America. Its unit volume increased 2.5% in Europe and 1.5% in Latin America. It's true that revenue and earnings from international markets are being negatively affected by currency fluctuations, but the underlying organic growth is strong. The company also performs well in North America -- domestic volumes grew 3% last quarter.Colgate-Palmolive's regular quarterly dividends and regular dividend increases have added up for shareholders over the years. The company has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1895, and Colgate-Palmolive has increased its dividend for 51 years in a row. With regular earnings growth and a rock-solid dividend, Colgate-Palmolive is a compounding machine, which makes it one of the best Dividend Aristocrats to buy today.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed.

With current trends toward ever-greater collection and analysis of information,  is well-placed to capitalize on increased demand for its information-management software and services. In the company's fiscal second-quarter financial report Tuesday afternoon, OpenText stayed on course with solid growth in revenue and earnings. Yet now that it has completed its $330 million acquisition of  , OpenText will need to show that its now-boosted exposure to the data analytics and visualization industry will translate to greater sales and profitability going forward. Let's take a closer look at OpenText's latest results and whether the company can sustain its growth pace heading into 2015.OpenText's fiscal second-quarter results included some impressive growth figures, even though some of them won't be quite as strong as investors would have preferred to see. Total revenue climbed 29% from year-ago levels, but that actually was less than the 34% sales growth that analysts had expected. OpenText managed to match expectations on the earnings front, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.97 representing a 23% gain from last year's fiscal second quarter.Yet a deeper look reveals more about OpenText's performance during the quarter. Revenue from the key Cloud Services segment soared more than 259% to $151.3 million and now makes up nearly a third of OpenText's entire sales base. Customer Support revenue also made more modest gains of almost 3% to $179.5 million, helping to offset declines in License and Professional Services sales. Overall, revenue from recurring sources grew 39% from year-ago levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of the strategy that OpenText has followed to ensure consistent financial performance even at the expense of the short-term gains that selling permanent licenses can bring.Source: OpenText.On the other hand, currency exposure played a role in holding back some of OpenText's growth. About half of the company's revenue comes in the form of U.S. dollars, but the euro makes up nearly a quarter of revenue, with the British pound and the Canadian dollar also responsible for substantial amounts of sales. Weakness in those currencies translated to less dollar-denominated revenue for OpenText, with CFO John Doolittle attributing $0.04 per share of lost earnings to currency headwinds.Nevertheless, the tone at OpenText was upbeat. CEO Mark Barrenchea bragged about what he called OpenText's \"strongest product line up ever.\" Even more importantly, Barrenchea specifically pointed to the Actuate acquisition as allowing OpenText \"to significantly enter the world of business analytics, allowing customers to analyze and visualize a broad range of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.\"OpenText had no shortage of successes during the quarter. Among high-profile clients, OpenText brought on  and  as cloud-services customers, and other companies such as  ,  , and  joined OpenText's ranks as license customers. OpenText also acquired Informative Graphics, whose offerings in the commercial document management and publishing software realm OpenText will integrate into its existing suites of products.Source: OpenText.Yet the biggest question on investors' minds is how much the Actuate acquisition will help broaden OpenText's reach. Barrenechea noted that \"analytics is an imperative to enabling a Digital-First World,\" and he believes that the customers that Actuate already has should complement OpenText's existing offerings well while also opening up OpenText's customer base to better visualization and big-data processing tools.Clearly, OpenText's recent acquisitions have given it more tools to use in building a lucrative portfolio of product offerings for customers. The big question, though, is whether customers will appreciate OpenText's efforts enough to stick with the information-management company against competition from other industry players. With the data analytics movement picking up steam, though, momentum should remain on OpenText's side this year and well into the future. recently revealed the product of its secret-development \"dream team\" -- the Apple Watch.

Historically, KMX gains an average of 1.3% in January, 1.7% in February and a whopping 6.3% in March.Monster Beverage (MNST) has been putting up market killing returns for more than a decade, and January will offer yet more outperformance.After flirting with falling below its 50-day moving average for the first half of last year, MNST moved convincingly to the upside five months ago and hasn\u2019t tested resistance at that key level ever since. Heck, MNST has been so strong, October\u2019s market-wide selloff barely registered.You can thank The Coca-Cola Co () for all that. MNST has been a fundamental and technical buy ever since KO took a 17% stake in the company back in August. Seasonality is likewise on the beverage company\u2019s side. Over the last 10 years, MNST delivered an average January price gain of 3.3%.The market is typically very kind to this paints and coatings maker in January, giving Sherwin-Williams (SHW) a long-term average monthly gain of 1.7%. But that\u2019s not all SHW has going for it. Indeed, this is a stock with an impeccable (albeit boring) long-term chart.There are no bells and whistles with SHW, at least not on a technical basis. You won\u2019t find a death cross or golden cross as you peel back the years. All you\u2019ll find is near-rock-solid support at the 50-day moving average, and great reluctance to even test the 200-day moving average.No wonder SHW has quietly destroyed the market over pretty much any time frame you care to chart.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["e expect  (  ) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter and full year 2014 results on Feb 12.Last quarter, it posted a positive surprise of 11.4%.In fact, the beverage company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 16.53%.Our proven model shows that Dr Pepper Snapple is likely to beat earnings this quarter because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +2.30%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. Dr Pepper Snapple carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which when combined with a +2.30% ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Dr Pepper had an impressive run in 2014 delivering strong profits in all the three quarters reported so far. This was driven by pricing gains, productivity improvements and lower interest expense and taxes.Dr Pepper raised its earnings outlook twice in 2014 following better-than-expected results. Management also raised its top-line expectations concurrent with the third quarter results driven by better soda volumes. We believe the strong momentum to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Dr Pepper has been curtailing costs by reducing inventory and storage costs. The company's cost reduction efforts has also improved cash flows. This allows it to regularly return cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.On Feb 5, Dr Pepper Snapple announced a dividend hike of 17.1% to 48 cents per share to be paid on Apr 7 to shareholders as of Mar 18. The company also announced an additional $1 billion share buyback program apart from the $3 billion program announced earlier, taking the total repurchase authorization to $4 billion.Here are some other companies in the beverage/food sector that you may consider, as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with an Earnings ESP of +2.22% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The company has already started notifying the employees from Thursday.The layoffs are part of Coca Cola's $3 billion restructuring plan, announced in October last year. The company is planning to cut costs as it is facing a decline in sales of soda due to rising health concerns, like peer PepsiCo, Inc. (  ).Coca-Cola's current four-year productivity and reinvestment program was launched in Feb 2012. In Feb 2014, the company expanded the scope of the program to generate $1 billion of additional productivity savings by 2016. In Oct 2014, the company further extended this productivity initiative and is now targeting $2 billion in annualized savings by 2017 and $3 billion by 2019.The program will focus on initiatives like restructuring of the global supply chain including optimization of the manufacturing footprint in North America, investing in technology to streamline operations and implementing a zero-based budgeting program. The resultant savings are expected to fund marketing programs and innovation which in turn will re-accelerate top-line growth, margin expansion and returns on capital.Moreover, Coca-Cola is in the process of re-franchising the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories by 2017-end. In Apr 2013, Coca-Cola announced plans to launch a beverage partnership model in the U.S., under which it will grant new expanded U.S. territories to its bottlers to distribute beverages.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also acquiring equity stake in other growing companies. Coca-Cola bought 10% stake in Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (  ) in Feb 2014 for about $1.25 billion and subsequently announced its intention to increase its stake to up to 16% gradually. Coca-Cola also plans to purchase 16.7% stake in energy drink maker, Monster Beverage Corporation (  ) for $2.15 billion. The new beverage partnership model should improve margins, going forward.Management expects 2015 to be a \"transition year\" - a time to start implementing changes to create a new operating model to streamline and simplify its structure.Though the initiatives sound encouraging, management remains apprehensive of the broader economic challenges in 2015. Management warned that earnings growth could miss the long-term target in both 2014 and 2015.

Brown-Forman plans to expand Jack Daniel's market share in the developed markets, such as France and the U.S., and emerging markets such as Russia, Poland, and Mexico, where the whiskey category is in the early stages of development. In the near future, the company seeks to expand the sphere of other brands, such as Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Single Barrel and Jack Daniel's ready-to-drink within Jack Daniel's.Moreover, we expect the company's pricing strategy, product innovation and penetration in emerging markets to drive growth.The Louisville, KY-based company managed to post a year-over-year increase in its second-quarter fiscal 2015 top- and bottom-line results despite an adverse impact from foreign currency translation. The company's earnings of 97 cents per share climbed nearly 1% year over year, but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05.Net sales for the second quarter increased 5.2% year over year to $1,135 million, backed by sales improvement witnessed in various brands, particularly its Jack Daniel's trademark. Moreover, after deducting excise taxes, sales came in at $877 million, up 5.3% from the prior-year figure of $833 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was $896 million.Coming to the expectations for fiscal 2015, the company reaffirmed its fiscal guidance range of 6% to 8% growth in underlying sales, on the assumption that the international market conditions will not worsen going forward.However, the company came up with cautious earnings guidance for fiscal 2015 as it expects foreign exchange headwinds to continue. The company lowered its earnings guidance to a band of $3.15-$3.35 per share for fiscal 2015, compared to $3.25-$3.45 projected earlier. This, in turn, pulled down the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upcoming quarter, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 over the last 30 days.Moreover, stiff competition and risks arising from overseas market operations may adversely impact its performance. The company also remains prone to probable increase in excise taxes that may negatively impact its bottom line.Currently, Brown-Forman carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

It will be available at supermarkets, convenience stores and on premise accounts throughout the country by early 2015. Both Coors Light and Coors will be available in 12-ounce bottles and both will be available for purchase from Jan 12, 2015, onwards. Coors Light will be available in 12-ounce cans as well.The launch of Coors Light and Coors in the Chilean market is part of Molson Coors' brand expansion strategy. Through this partnership, Molson Coors will also be benefited from CCU's vast knowledge of the Chilean market and world class distribution system.We note that Chile's premium beer market has been steadily growing since 2009. In fact, in 2014, sales of Premium International beer brands represented an estimated 19% of Chile's total beer industry, per sources. Thus, the introduction of two new premium beer brands will appeal to the growing number of Chilean import beer drinkers. It would also boost CCU's reputation as the distributor of highest quality products to Chile's consumers.Despite macroeconomic headwinds, Molson Coors is one of the world's largest brewers in the U.S. and boasts a strong portfolio of well-established brands, including Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Carling and Staropramen, as well as craft and specialty beers like Blue Moon, Creemore Springs and Cobra. Through continuous innovation, the company has been able to grow its market share. The company also spends on marketing and advertising to increase brand awareness.However, we note that Molson Coors has been posting negative beer volumes in the U.S. and Canada for quite some time due to weak consumer demand as a result of a difficult consumer spending environment. Molson Coors continues to expect weak demand in the coming quarters due to macroeconomic headwinds.Amid the economic challenges, it is encouraging that the company is focusing on expanding its brands internationally and to a place like Chile where the demand for premium beer is growing. We expect the new partnership with CCU to strengthen the market share of the above-premium category of beers, and thus boost volumes.

Yet just when it seems like the energy-drink specialist has finally topped out, Monster Beverage finds a way to kick itself into overdrive once again and produce even better performance. That's what happened in 2014, as Monster Beverage stock rose another 65% after attracting the interest of a longtime competitor. Let's take a closer look at Monster Beverage's 2014 and what lies ahead for the beverage company going forward. data by  . Throughout the first half of 2014, Monster's performance was uninspiring. Even though the beverage company kept on posting reasonable revenue growth -- sales jumped almost 11% in the first quarter from year-earlier levels -- Monster's stock responded negatively, as investors longed for the faster growth rates that the company achieved in past years. Moreover, despite every attempt to reassure consumers, persistent worries about the  continued to plague the company, and that translated into some hesitancy among investors to push share prices even higher.That all changed in August, when  announced that it would take a  . That move certainly benefited Coca-Cola, which has struggled to make a splash in the energy-drink space, with its own offerings falling short on market share. But for Monster Beverage, it provides valuable access to Coca-Cola's highly efficient distribution network, and that will help the company especially in the international markets, where rival Red Bull has had a much larger presence than Monster.Coca-Cola's deal with Monster led to a 30% surge in Monster's stock in a single day; after that, the shares proved unstoppable.  come from the fact that the company will divest what has become its non-core non-energy drinks -- including Hansen's Natural and Blue Sky sodas, as well as Peace Tea -- to Coca-Cola, making itself an even purer energy-drink play going forward, and benefiting from strong growth rates in that space. Moreover, even though  continue to slow in the third quarter, gains in earnings per share seemed to satisfy most investors. The big question for Monster Beverage's future growth involves whether current trends in the broader beverage market will support energy drinks. Long-term trends against carbonated soft drinks have clearly hurt that business compared to Monster's, and many industry analysts see government moves, like  , as a much larger attack on soda, even though energy drinks like Monster's are also subject to the tax. With a solid grip on the valuable younger demographic groups, Monster has the capacity to build lifelong loyalty if it can successfully navigate the ever-changing trends in the beverage industry.Source: Flickr via Benpop318.International markets also represent a major growth area where Monster needs to boost sales. In just the five years from 2008 to 2013, Monster managed to grow its share of overall revenue from its international business from less than 8% to more than 20%, and its total international sales have risen almost sixfold in that time span. Efforts to release new products will play an important role both domestically and overseas; but even more important is for Monster to capitalize on early success in countries like Japan in order to build up a solid base of customers on which it can build up its overall foreign presence.Investors have already gotten massive returns from holding Monster Beverage stock, and 2014's big gain only adds fuel to the fire of those who think the stock might not have much energy left to move higher. With all the competitive advantages at its disposal, though, 2015 isn't necessarily doomed to be a post-sugar high letdown for Monster and its shares. The year 2015 is shaping up to be another great one for stocks. But if you want to make sure that 2015 is  best investing year ever, you need to know where to start.

Although some dividend companies are likely to reduce the amount they pay out to investors this coming year, our Motley Fool experts believe these three companies might be in line for a dividend hike. My bet for a 2015 dividend booster is specialty real estate investment trust  . This REIT concentrates on the management of medical facilities and related assets such as doctors' offices, hospitals, and senior living amenities.That's a great niche, considering that the huge baby boomer generation is now entering its twilight years and needs the sort of care these facilities provide.But even before the boomers went gray, HCP was delivering for its shareholders. The REIT has been consistently profitable since its IPO in 1985. Better yet, it has not only paid a dividend in every single quarter for nearly 30 years, but also raised that distribution each year it has been in business.As a result, HCP's annual disbursement (paid in quarterly installments) has shown a pronounced upward lift over the years. It now stands at $2.18 per share, for a beefy yield of 4.8%.At the moment, investors are rightly concerned about the impact of an expected 2015 Federal Reserve rate hike on REITs' results. But HCP has weathered interest rate bombs before and thrived, so this doesn't present too scary a threat.Source: Coca-Cola There are no guarantees in investing, but I'm confident  will continue its 52-year run of annual dividend increases by boosting its payout in 2015. Earlier this year, Coca-Cola gave investors a 9% dividend hike, and its current yield of 2.8% is well above what many blue-chip stocks pay.Many investors worry about the pressure on Coca-Cola's core carbonated soft-drink business, with adverse sales trends and regulatory scrutiny hurting the segment. Yet Coca-Cola has moved aggressively in other directions, with noncarbonated beverages and water offering new avenues for growth. Moreover, Coca-Cola has realized the value of making strategic partnerships with other major players in the industry, with stakes in  and  both opening up opportunities for the soda giant to participate in their respective innovations and make greater use of its distribution network to enhance profits. Coca-Cola pays out just two-thirds of its earnings in the form of dividends, so the company has a sufficient margin of safety to boost its payout without jeopardizing further opportunities to make smart strategic moves and continue a legacy of success that has endured for more than a century. One stock that is long overdue for a dividend increase is  , which has been stuck paying out $0.01 per share per quarter since the end of the financial crisis.Citigroup is much improved since then, and the bank is growing in the right ways. For instance, it reported a 9% year-over-year revenue increase during the  , fueled by solid gains in trading revenue and institutional banking.Even the Citi Holdings division, which holds the bank's legacy assets, produced $1.6 billion in revenue, 26% more than last year. The bank has made great progress in getting rid of Citi Holdings' assets in order to focus on its core businesses, reducing the size of the division from $290 billion in assets in 2011 to just over $100 billion now.To sum it up, Citigroup is a much healthier bank than it was a few years ago, and the numbers reflect this. In fact, the company's Basel III supplementary leverage ratio increased from 5.1% to 6% over the past year. All that progress has me convinced 2015 will be the year that Citigroup is finally allowed to raise its dividend.

That's because if you can identify a winning stock before it takes off, it can have a life-changing impact on your finances.In order to find those stocks, though, it helps to know what you're looking for. Looking back at the past to find out what helped drive highly successful companies to lofty share-price heights can help reveal a lot about the attributes that are likely to define future stock market winners. And when you see the latest list of top-performing stocks from the past decade, you'll quickly notice some things that nearly all of them have in common. With that in mind, let's cut to the chase and reveal the market's 10 best stocks since the beginning of 2005:\n  \nSource:  . Includes only stocks listed on major U.S. exchanges with verifiable stock price histories and substantial volume throughout the period.Perhaps the most interesting thing about this list is  on similar looks back in past years. Monster Beverage was formerly known as Hansen Natural, but the energy-drink giant has continued in its efforts to be an innovator in the beverage business.Green Mountain has added the name of its popular Keurig single-serve brewing machine to its corporate moniker, but its returns have only accelerated in recent years.  , and it continues to drive growth with its focus on petroleum additives to boost power and efficiency.Yet the thing that really stands out among these 10 companies is that, with the exception of market behemoth Apple, every single one of these stocks had a market capitalization of less than $1 billion a decade ago. What investors can learn from that is that if you expect to get truly life-changing returns from stocks, you can't expect to find them in the biggest, most prominent and well-known companies in the market. Instead, you have to dig deeper and take a look at parts of the market that many Wall Street analysts leave untouched -- small companies that often take some digging just to find out what they actually do, let alone what their potential is for future growth.Source: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.In addition, you can easily see the impact of large-scale industry trends by looking at successful stocks of the recent past. Biotechnology stocks are well represented on the list, with Regeneron, Illumina, and Alexion all posting impressive gains. Each of these companies can point to its own individual success stories, including Regeneron's macular degeneration drug Eylea, Illumina's groundbreaking work on genetic sequencing, and Alexion's orphan-drug success from rare-blood disorder treatment Soliris. But they're also representative of a larger trend throughout the biotech sector that has enabled many astute investors to cash in on the favorable results there.Source: Apple.Finally, one last lesson you can learn from looking at several of these stocks is: Once you find a winner, don't be in a hurry to let it go. Countless numbers of investors have sold off their holdings in Apple during the years, convinced that it had no more room to rise after its huge gains. Yet the company has defied expectations, continuing to cash in on its product lineup while coming out with new and innovative products that hold the promise of even more blockbusters ahead. Similarly, Priceline has long established itself as the dominant online travel portal in the industry, but it continues to fight for market share and keeps extending its reach across the globe in search of new growth opportunities.Great investors never stop looking for the top stocks of tomorrow. But they also know where to look to have the best chance of spotting future winners.

However, revenues missed the consensus mark as the consumer food company continues to battle weak demand in the U.S. and slowdown in some of the international markets.Second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents by 5.3% - the first earnings beat after four back-to-back negative surprises. Earnings also beat management's guided range of 75-77 cents issued last month. We believe that a shift in timing of expenses led to the earnings beat.Earnings, however, declined around 4% year over year as sales and margins remained weak. On a constant currency basis, earnings were flat.Adjusted earnings exclude restructuring costs and certain other items.Total revenue of the global consumer food company declined 3% year over year to $4.71 billion and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.84 billion by 2.7%.In constant currency terms, sales declined 1% as U.S. sales continued to lag, while growth slowed in key emerging markets. General Mills, like other food companies, is battling weak global food industry trends.Price/mix added 1% to revenues, same as the last five quarters. Volumes declined 2%, same as the last quarter. Foreign exchange dragged revenues by 2%.Adjusted gross margin declined 80 basis points (bps) to 34.9% due to lower sales and unfavorable product mix.Advertising costs declined 9%. Despite lower advertising costs, adjusted operating margin declined 40 bps to 17% due to lower sales and gross margins. However, we note that both gross and operating margins improved from the previous quarter. : Revenues from the U.S. Retail segment declined 4% year over year to $2.86 billion due to decline in both price/mix and volumes. Price/mix declined 1%, while volumes declined 3% as a result of weak food industry trends.Sales growth in the Snacks and Yogurt divisions was offset by declines in the Big G cereal, Baking Products and Meals segments.General Mills' core cereals business continues to underperform due to weak category growth. Lower demand for cereals due to competitive pressures from alternatives including yogurt, eggs, bread and peanut butter are hurting category growth.Despite lower advertising costs, segment operating profit declined 10% to $616 million due to weak revenues. Revenues in the International segment declined 6% year over year to $1.32 billion because of currency headwinds. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 9% on net sales.On a constant currency basis, international sales rose 3% driven largely by price/mix gains.While price/mix added 3% to net sales growth, volumes remained flat.Constant currency sales grew 14% in Latin America, 2% in Asia-Pacific and 4% in Europe. However, sales declined 7% in Canada due to business disruption.Segment operating profit declined 2% on a constant currency basis to $134 million due to lower revenues. On a year-over-year basis, the Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment's quarterly revenues improved 4% to $530 million led by yogurt, frozen breakfast, cereals and snacks. Volumes declined 1%, while price/mix increased 5%. Segment operating profit rose 13% year over year to $96 million.Management retained the previously provided fiscal 2015 outlook, while pointing out that operating condition in the U.S. markets is becoming more challenging.We would like to remind investors that management had slashed it revenue, operating profit and earnings per share guidance last month in response to continued weak food-industry trends in the U.S. and slowing growth in the key emerging markets.Fiscal 2015 net sales are expected to increase at a low single-digit rate in constant currency, including the impact of the 53 rd week and the September buyout of natural foods company, Annie's Inc.

Currency headwinds are expected to hurt earnings by 5 cents.As previously indicated, General Mills expects to exceed the targeted $400 million of HMM (Holistic Margin Management program)supply chain savings in fiscal 2015.In addition, General Mills is undertaking Project Century which includes streamlining the North American manufacturing and distribution operations targeting possible reduction in capacity and overhead costs. In addition, the company is making efforts to further reduce overhead costs which, coupled with Project Century, are expected to generate cost savings of $40 million in the second half of fiscal 2015, within $260 to $280 million in fiscal 2016 and exceed $350 million in fiscal 2017.General Mills carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These three turnaround stories struck our panel of Motley Fool contributors as the strongest rebounds of 2014. cleaned out the executive suite to come back from a data security scandal.  struck a game-changing partnership to end nearly two years of eternal Mondays.  came back from the edge of oblivion. Read all about these turnarounds here:Image source: Target. : Discount retailer Target is my pick for the best turnaround story of 2014. Investors may recall that in the fourth quarter last year, Target revealed that as many as 70 million shoppers had their personal information stolen. Hackers obtained data including payment card numbers, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Target's public relations image took a severe hit as a result. Its stock price fell from $64 per share to $55 per share by May, and the data breach ultimately cost Target's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel, a 35-year company veteran, his job.If that wasn't bad enough, Target has also lost a lot of money throughout the year on its Canadian expansion campaign. Target aggressively opened new locations in Canada over the course of the past year, which made sense at the time because Target was previously limited to the United States. Last quarter alone, Target lost $211 million in Canada before interest and taxes. Target is racking up losses because it's been forced to discount prices significantly to lure shoppers in. The hope is that eventually Target's stores will stand on their own legs, but this hasn't happened yet. Target's comps in Canada look bad, with same-store sales up just 1% last quarter.But all that looks like a distant memory now. Customers clearly forgave Target for the data breach, as U.S. same-store sales were up 1.2% last quarter, which was better than the company projected. The company delivered a 20% dividend increase to shareholders this year, and Target's stock price is now at $72 per share. Another tailwind is that Target management expects the improving retail environment, boosted by falling  , to set the stage for a strong holiday shopping season in the U.S. and Canada. This would cap off a fantastic turnaround year for Target.Image source: Rackspace. : Few companies can claim to have suffered a more tumultuous year than Rackspace Hosting.

Moreover, the western European bottler of The Coca-Cola Company (  ) warned that currency headwinds will hurt its profits in the New Year.In 2015, constant currency adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase in the range of 6-8%. Currency translation is expected to be a headwind in 2015 versus a tailwind in 2014. According to recent rates, currency is expected to hurt 2015 earnings by approximately 7% - a stark contrast to the expected benefit of 3% in 2014.Both adjusted constant currency net sales and operating income are expected to be slightly positive in 2015.Management had previously stated that it expects to have limited benefit from the improved commodity cost outlook in 2015 as the benefits have already been realized in 2014.As currency shifts unfavorably, commodity cost tailwinds decline and ongoing economic softness and operating challenges persist, 2015 could prove to be a challenging year for Coca-Cola Enterprises.Coca-Cola Enterprises has been facing a tough retail consumer and competitive environment in many European countries. Management expects the ongoing economic softness and operating challenges to persist in the fourth quarter as well as in 2015, thereby limiting revenue growth.Management has increased its focus on high growth brands and regular brand and package innovation to deal with the challenging environment.In 2015, the company expects to repurchase at least $600 million of its shares. Cash flow is expected in the range of $650 million to $700 million. Capital expenditures are expected within $325 million to $350 million.In 2014, adjusted earnings are still expected to increase approximately 10% in constant currency. Moreover, according to recent rates, currency is expected to benefit 2014 earnings by approximately 3%.Adjusted constant currency net sales are expected to be flat. Adjusted constant currency operating income is expected to increase in the low single-digit range.We would like to remind investors that Coca-Cola Enterprises has lowered the full-year 2014 sales and profit outlook twice this year due to ongoing macro and competitive pressure in Europe.Also, it is noteworthy that the sales and profit guidance range for both 2014 and 2015 are far below the company's long-term targets. Over the long term, net sales are expected to grow in the 4-6% range and operating income within 6-8%.Coca-Cola Enterprises continues to expect free cash flow for full-year 2014 to be $650 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be less than $325 million, comparing unfavorably with the previous expectation of approximately $325 million. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27%.In 2014, the company expects to repurchase shares worth $925 million, higher than $800 million expected earlier.

The ubiquitous brew that was the most popular beer in the country for much of the 19th and 20th centuries has been in decline for over a generation.  , its parent company, seems to have finally come to terms with it, based on its new marketing campaign.The beer brand is taking the spotlight away from its trademark Clydesdale horses in favor of an ad campaign targeting millennials, stepping back from a long-held strategy of going after all age groups. That means the brand will be featured as a sponsor of Jay-Z concerts and food festivals, because 50% of millennials  and its TV ads will look something like this:The spot, entitled Round Up Your #HolidayBuds, features several young people telling the camera who they'd like to share a Bud with. It's a charming commercial, but it ignores a simple truth. Young people aren't drinking Budweiser. In fact, 44% of 21-27 year-olds have never even tasted it, according to Anheuser-Busch. That's a remarkable fact, considering Budweiser was the No. 1 beer in the country for much of their childhood, and is still No. 3.Today, Bud Light reigns supreme among beers. It took the top spot form Budweiser in 2001, and now rakes in nearly three times the sales of the former champ, but cannibalization isn't the only reason for Bud's demise. The rise of craft beers has slowly chipped away at the dominance of macrobrews like Bud, and for the first time last year, shipments of craft beer, at 16.1 million, topped Budweiser at 16 million. That's down from Bud's peak in 1988 at 50 million barrels.There may be a greater obstacle than marketing for Budweiser to regain growth, however: taste. After all, the brand has an advertising budget in the range of $500 million. If young people aren't drinking it, it isn't because they haven't heard of it. According to  , in a crowd-sourced survey Budweiser rated a 57, or \"awful,\" on a scale of 1 to 100. Historically, Budweiser's strength was never its taste though. Its success owes instead to clever marketing. Early on, the beer was never a favorite among local St. Louis drinkers, but became the first national brand as founder Adolphus Busch was the first to pasteurize, use refrigerated rail cars, and bottle on a large scale. He also plied bars into serving it by helping to pay licensing fees and rents. The rise of craft beers, which offer a wide range of varieties and richer flavors than traditional beers, fits right in with millennials' taste in other categories.  ,  , and  , all staples of the past generation, are seeing consumption declines in the U.S, while fast-casual chains like  are on the rise, and energy drinks like  and other still beverages have seen the most growth in that industry.Despite the rise of craft beer, there is one macrobrew that has found a following among millennials: Pabst Blue Ribbon. Sales of PBR have nearly doubled over the past five years, to 6 million barrels a year, a success very much attributable to its hipster street cred, and that credibility began with one simple decision. In 1985, Paul Kalmanowitz bought the rapidly declining company for $63 million and banned advertising, betting that the low price and decent taste would sell itself. The strategy worked as the brand gained an indie following. Earlier this year, the company was sold for $700 million, a gain of more than 1,000% from Kalmanowitz's purchase price.For Budweiser, there seems to be a lesson there. The young and floppy-haired of America don't like being marketed to, and they don't like industrially processed stuff that tastes bad. Plenty of other brands millennials are fond of, like Chipotle, have followed this formula, eschewing traditional advertising, especially on TV.But as the rise of craft beer attests, hipster styles and tastes have gone mainstream, and what was mainstream is no longer cool. In its quest to be accepted, Budweiser may be forgetting the first rule of hipsterdom: You can't try to be hipster; you just have to be hip. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

Moreover, the Atlanta-based company has been battling lower demand for carbonated soft drinks amid rising health consciousness and related obesity concerns among consumers.The beverage giant expects full-year 2014 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth in the range of 4% to 5%, excluding currency headwinds. This is in line with management's expectation of 2014 EPS growth rate coming in below the long-term range of a high single-digit increase announced at the conference call.Foreign exchange volatility is expected to hurt 2014 EPS by 7%.In the fourth quarter, management expects adjusted currency neutral EPS growth to be flat to slightly positive. Foreign exchange is expected to hurt operating income by 6-7% (lower than previous expectation of 7%) and EPS by 9%.As previously indicated management does not expect 2015 EPS growth to be any different from 2014 - falling short of the long-term target. Currency headwinds are expected to hurt 2015 profit before tax by 5-6%. The company also expects to buy back shares worth $2.5 to $3.0 billion in 2015.During the third quarter conference call, Coca-Cola announced the expansion of its productivity initiatives and plans to streamline its operations to drive revenue and profit growth. Concurrent with the latest press release, management announced that it is progressing well on the plan.Under its productivity program, Coca-Cola is targeting $2 billion in annualized savings by 2017 and $3 billion by 2019. The resultant savings are expected to fund marketing programs and innovation which, in turn, will re-accelerate top-line growth, margin expansion and returns on capital.The company also has plans to re-franchise the majority of its company-owned North American bottling territories by 2017-end. In April last year, Coca-Cola announced plans to launch a beverage partnership model in the U.S., under which it will gradually grant new expanded U.S. territories to its bottlers to distribute beverages.Moreover, the company is acquiring equity stake in other growing companies. Coca-Cola bought 10% stake in Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (  ) in Feb 2014 for about $1.25 billion and subsequently announced its intention to gradually increase its stake to up to 16%. Coca-Cola also plans to purchase 16.7% stake in energy drink maker, Monster Beverage Corporation (  ), later this year for $2.15 billion. The new beverage partnership model should improve margins, going forward.Management expects 2015 to be a \"transition year\" - a time to start implementing changes to create a new operating model.Though the initiatives sound encouraging, management remains apprehensive of the broader economic challenges in 2015.The Coca-Cola Company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Lower shares outstanding owing to share buybacks also contributed to the bottom line.Revenues of $1.04 billion grew 3% year over year in the quarter. On a local currency basis, sales increased 2%.

Consumers want something better than the syrupy sweet carbonated beverage, so volumes will continue falling quarter after quarter.But Wall Street analysts believe there's a way out of the morass: a partnership with  to tap into the dairy alternative beverage market that could hit $14 billion in sales in the U.S. by 2018.WhiteWave Foods Silk brand almond milk is the top-selling plant-based beverage. Photo:  via Flickr.Coke forged partnerships this year with  and  , showing it is open to such dealsto juice sales. With soda volumes locked in a  , a switch to nondairy plant-based beverages, or PBBs as they're called, might offset the trend, and industry leader WhiteWave Foods would make the perfect partner.There are three mains reasons it could work:But a better question to ask might be, does WhiteWave Foods even need Coca-Cola? Reuters first broached a potential hookup in 2012, believing the maker of almond and soy milk would be a good acquisition target for Coke or  . Analysts at  have now resurrected the idea, citing Coke's 16% stake in Keurig and 16.7% position in energy drink maker Monster as opening the door to explore a partnership with WhiteWave.Both the at-home soda and energy drinks markets carry risks that PBBs don't. DIY soda might have  and energy drinks carry a lot of health claims baggage. Plant-based beverages, on the other hand, have a huge runway before them and are healthy. Analysts see dairy alternative beverages growing at a 15% compound annual rate through 2018 even as per-capita milk consumption has fallen 23% since 1975. Almond milk alone is a near-$738 million business, accounting for 70% of PBB sales in the U.S., even supplanting soy milk as the top PBB. Coconut milk, cashew milk, and other plant-based derivatives are growing as well.WhiteWave Foods acquisition of So Delicious gives it a new gateway into plant-based desserts. Image: So Delicious Dairy Free.Coke could do worse by getting into the PBB market. It would certainly have a better chance at success than its just-launched  , which encourages consumers to pay more for a beverage they're drinking less of.PBBs are a premium drink, too, which contributed to WhiteWave Foods' superior third-quarter performance:WhiteWave also finished the acquisition of So Delicious at the end of October, giving it a gateway into the fast-growing frozen plant-based desserts category. It hardly seems WhiteWave needs Coca-Cola to goose its distribution. Although Europe accounts for just 15% of WhiteWave's total sales, revenue jumped 24% in the third quarter and operating profit surged 82% higher. The Alpro brand has a dominant 42% market share in Europe..Even in Europe, WhiteWave Foods completely dominates the market where its products are marketed under the Alpro brand. Photo:  via Flickr.But Coke's reach extends far beyond the confines of the continent. It operates a worldwide supply chain featuring over 1,200 bottling operations that make Coca-Cola a very local business in the 200 countries in which its products are sold. Tapping into the soda maker's global distribution network could elevate sales of PBBs even further.Even though WhiteWave is investing in additional capacity expansion in Europe, a Coke partnership could bring its plant-based beverages into markets it hasn't considered yet or isn't able to exploit. While analysts have been pushing the partnership concept for several years, and Coca-Cola showed in 2014 it had merit, WhiteWave is in position to drive a harder bargain than did either Keurig or Monster. Access to Coke's distribution network isn't essential for continued growth.On the other hand, Coca-Cola needs WhiteWave Foods to make up for slack soda sales and the very real limitations of its existing partnerships. Coke might be willing to invest much more than the $2 billion it put into the other two deals, or even decide it needs to buy WhiteWave outright.Plant-based foods and beverages are more than just a fad, and seem to have a better future than either soda or premium milk products. They look superior to DIY soda machines and energy drinks as well. That could make WhiteWave Foods a very valuable partner indeed. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

Harris characterizes that as \"a nearly unmatched show of reputation consistency.\"How has it done this?By forever investing in its brand in ways that matter to consumers. It doesn't have to be the top-ranked company in everything -- in fact, it was only ranked highest in two of the six categories, vision and leadership and financial performance -- but consistently hitting singles and doubles elsewhere makes it the most well-rounded of businesses.Despite producing a product with seriously declining levels of volumes sold (diet soda), Coca-Cola still resonates with consumers.It does so through  , such as its \"Share a Coke\" campaign that encourages the social sharing of its beverages; helping  in Dubai connect with loved ones back home (though it was criticized for profiting from the effort); and  here at home (another controversial ad in some quarters).But Coke also proves willing to invest in technologies and markets to reach new customers.

For others, their nosebleed valuations only stick red flags around larger problems.Three Motley Fool contributors would like to warn you about a few consumer goods stocks that belong in the second category. Read up on why they wouldn't touch  ,  , or  with a ten-foot pole at current prices: : Keurig Green Mountain is one of the best performing stocks so far this year, with shares up more than 107% year-to-date. The K-cup creator received a vote of confidence from  earlier this year when the king of pop increased its stake in the specialty coffee company to 16%, thereby becoming Green Mountain's largest shareholder. However, the stock looks wildly overpriced today, with shares of Keurig Green Mountain now trading near the stock's 52-week high at around $154.Sure, as the leading supplier of single-serve coffee brewers and portion packs, Green Mountain benefits from strong market share and brand recognition. Yet, much of this optimism is already priced into the stock. The stock currently trades at 41 times earnings, giving it a price-to-earnings ratio that is among the highest in the industry, particularly compared to the S&P 500's average P/E of 20.With Green Mountain's stock trading near all-time highs, there is little room for error or misstep on the part of management. I think this makes it a risky investment at this point, especially with so much emphasis on the company's upcoming launch of its Keurig 2.0 system and cold beverage offerings. : Burger King shares have doubled since  . If you squint just right, in a certain light, the fast-food chain's skyrocketing share prices make a little bit of sense. But most of the time, Burger King's soaring shares just seem doomed to a drastic correction somewhere down the lone.Let's start with the (limited) upside. Burger King's earnings have more than tripled in two years. Profit margins have surged as the burger chain  .

These are the drivers behind Burger King's surging share prices.Sounds like a sales pitch so far, doesn't it? Well, it gets a lot worse. Burger King may have found a new groove, but investors are overpaying for these shares -- by a lot.Let's compare and contrast with archrival  .You can buy a McDonald's share for 19 times trailing earnings and 3.3 times sales. These are farly average figures for the restaurant industry, with the earnings-based ratio running a little low and price-to-sales sitting a little high.Burger King shares sell for 10.8 times trailing sales and a nosebleed-inducing 65 times earnings.Look, I'm no stranger to paying a premium for rapid growth or rich margins. But I do have a problem with ultra-high prices on one of the largest players in a very mature industry, and that's what we're looking at here.35% of Burger King's shares are sold short these days. At these prices, I can't argue with the pessimists.Image source: Author. : Tamara highlighted an old consumer favorite of mine, and it's hard to disagree with her analysis. Green Mountain's stock is up more than 500% in two years, but its P/E ratio has also quadrupled in that time. But Green Mountain isn't the only caffeinated beverage purveyor that's ridden a wave of investor optimism to new highs over the past two years -- Monster Beverage is up 140% in two years, but its P/E ratio has nearly doubled, from just over 20 to more than 40 today.Like Green Mountain, Monster is a leader in its space (energy drinks), and has enjoyed strong fundamental growth over the past few years. But in the past five years, its P/E has averaged 27.9, which is far lower than it is today.  to rates more indicative of a mature industry than one with a long runway ahead, and while its earnings have been improving at a more rapid clip, that trend can't continue forever in a retail-oriented industry that has limits to its pricing power.Make no mistake, Monster is a great company and has been a great stock to own over the years. I often go out of my way to find my favorite Monster flavors (Ultra Black, followed by Red and Blue, if you were wondering) when I need an energy boost. But in a market downturn, high-priced stocks are usually the hardest-hit, and optimism around Monster's recent deal with Coca-Cola may wear out before the deal's full benefits can be known.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction is expected to close in 2015.The agreement followed the Letters of Intent The Coca-Cola Company signed with Reyes Holdings in Feb 2014. (  )Reyes Holdings is one of the largest global food and beverage distributors. The company has successfully worked with strong brands in mature markets like North, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific. The Coca-Cola Company, whose North American business has been soft for some time, is likely to benefit from this agreement in the near future.The deal is intended to improve the efficiency of its operating territories and boost overall profits in the U.S. The Coca-Cola Company is shifting to a more franchise-based model, where it grants territories to its bottling partners across the country.In Sep 2014, Coca-Cola inked a definitive agreement with Troy Taylor, Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Central Florida, in order to grant the territories of Tampa/St. Petersburg, Ft. Myers, Ft. Pierce, Lakeland and Sarasota. The company expects to complete initial transactions with each of these bottlers in 2015. This agreement also follows letter of intent signed in Feb 2014.Prior to that, in Apr 2013, Coca-Cola launched its new beverage partnership. According to the new model, from Jan 1, 2014, the North American business of Coca-Cola was segregated into a traditional company and bottler operating model. Consequently, Coca-Cola granted new expanded U.S. territories to five of its bottlers to distribute its beverages. The five bottlers include Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, Coca-Cola Bottling Company United Inc., Swire Coca-Cola USA, Coca-Cola Bottling Company High Country and Corinth Coca-Cola Bottling Works, Inc.The company has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the last few quarters.

This was driven by pricing gains, productivity improvements and lower interest expense and taxes.The share price of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has soared 51.5% year-to-date. Moreover, Dr Pepper has delivered positive earnings surprises for four quarters in a row.Continuing the strong performance for the first half, Dr Pepper posted yet another solid quarterly result in the third quarter.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues.

The company expects adjusted earnings to be in a range of $3.56 to $3.62, up from $3.43 to $3.51 expected previously.

This global leader in flavors and spices has recently announced new flavors for this winter.McCormick has introduced 25 new products including Skillet sauces and gluten-free recipe mixes to satisfy the growing consumer demand for flavor.The company has offered seven varieties in skillet sauces, which would make the meat and vegetables more flavorful in just 15 minutes. Sweet & Smoky Sloppy Joes can make the American meal a little sweet, while Fire Roasted Garlic Chili sauce would enhance the taste of the meal with its fire-roasted garlic and chili pepper.The other five sauces include Smoky Applewood BBQ Chicken with Bacon; Taco with Chipotle & Garlic; Sesame Chicken Stir-Fry; Fajita with Roasted Chili, Garlic & Lime; and Sicilian Chicken with Tomato, Basil & Garlic.McCormick is also offering four popular recipe mixes and that are also gluten-free for its health-conscious consumers. These are made of natural herbs and spices and do not contain any artificial flavors. These mixes are certified by the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness and will be available for the same price as regular mixes. These include Gluten-Free Turkey Gravy, Gluten-Free Brown Gravy, Gluten-Free Taco, and Gluten-Free Chili.In addition, the company is also introducing some new spices, recipe mixes, seasoning blends, and Latin-inspired flavors.We note that the company has witnessed 20% rise in spice, herb and seasoning purchases in the last five years, owing to the rising demand for flavors. Some of the new launches in 2014 include the Vahine dessert item, Kamis seasonings and Ducros recipe mixes.In 2013, the company introduced recipe mixes in France and Poland and launched new products for value-minded consumers, as well as premium items for more involved and affluent cooks. Sales of new products launched across both its segments over the past three years accounted for 9% of fiscal 2013 sales.We believe the announcement of new flavors for the winter will surely help the company boost sales.Overall, we are encouraged by McCormick's increasing focus on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing initiative, the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement ('CCI') program, which started in 2009. In addition, McCormick's product innovation and expansion in emerging markets also remain its strengths.However, weak demand from quick service restaurants, mainly in the Asia-Pacific region, remains a concern over the near term. In Asia, demand has been impacted by consumer concern about bird flu in China.

Comps sales were ahead of management's expectations and grew on the back of 1%, 7%, 6% and 2% year-over-year increase in same-store sales at Marmaxx, Home Goods and TJX Canada, respectively. However, unusually warm weather in Europe resulted in a 1% decline for TJX Europe.Notably, comps growth was lower than the prior-year figure due to reduced discretionary spending and unfavorable foreign currency translation.TJX Companies' pre-tax profit margin inflated 0.4 percentage points (pp) from the prior-year quarter to 13% of sales. Gross margin was up 0.1 pp year over year to 29.4% mainly due to the higher revenues.Selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales went down 0.4 pp to 16.2% due to favorable adjustments on insurance reserves.In the reported quarter, TJX Companies spent a total of $448 million to repurchase 7.5 million common shares.The company also announced its plan to repurchase approximately $1.6 to $1.7 billion of common stocks during fiscal 2015.TJX Companies tightened the fiscal 2015 outlook following the third-quarter results.

Some of the brands that did well in the quarter include Juice Monster, Punch Monster energy drinks and Peace Tea Line.Net sales of the Direct Store Delivery (DSD) segment increased 7.6% to $609.9 million due to higher sales volumes of Monster Energy drinks, Ultra and Java Monster lines.Net sales of the Warehouse segment increased 10.1% to $26.0 million due to higher sales of Hubert's Lemonades and aseptic juices.Gross sales outside the U.S. increased 14.3% year over year to $173.2 million in the quarter.

The 60-calorie, 8-ounce cola drink was initially launched in Chile and Argentina earlier this year.Sales of the carbonated beverages of Coca-Cola as well as other soda makers, PepsiCo, Inc. (  ) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (  ), are suffering due to the shift in consumer preference toward low-calorie drinks. Consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concerns.Accordingly, Coca-Cola is trying to reinvigorate the category by offering more choices in package sizes, sweeteners and beverages - including more low- and no-calorie selections. In addition, the company is providing increased marketing support through strong integrated marketing campaigns like \"Share a Coke\" and \"Coke with Meals\" driving immediate consumption transactions; and providing transparency in labeling.Pepsi is also testing cola variants using evolutionary natural sweeteners in several markets. Moreover, it expects to launch lower calorie, naturally sweetened non-cola products in the U.S. this year.Dr Pepper launched the low-calorie version of its Dr Pepper brand of soft drinks - Dr Pepper TEN - in 2011 and thereafter expanded the platform with the rollout of TEN versions of 7UP, Sunkist Orange Soda, A&W Root Beer, Canada Dry Ginger Ale and RC Cola brands in the U.S. in early 2013.

Source: The Coca-Cola Company.On Election Day, voters in California took to the polls to make their voice heard on the political process ... and soda. That's right: Voters in Berkeley and San Francisco decided to vote in favor of an initiative to tax sugary drinks at higher rates -- one penny per ounce in Berkeley and two cents per ounce in San Francisco. And while both initiatives achieved a plurality, only the Berkeley tax will become law, by winning 75% of the vote. San Francisco's vote fell short of the two-thirds approval needed to pass.While many outside the traditionally liberal bastions of Berkeley and San Francisco may think taxes and regulations against sugary drinks goes too far (see: Michael Bloomberg's soda ban),  investors need to pay attention to these developments. And it really doesn't have to do with the taxes itself, but rather sentiment -- simply put, consumers are abandoning the product because of health concerns. The campaign against the tax focused on personal choice and increased grocery prices, but considering both municipalities voted for their respective measures in pluralities, that argument fell flat. Perhaps that's because the science is in that sugary drinks can contribute to a host of medical issues, including diabetes, heart disease, and tooth decay. As such, Coca-Cola faces a huge perception issue that appears to be increasing in scope, instead of decreasing.And a quick peek into Coca-Cola's financial results shows how devastating this trend has been for the company. Recently, the company replaced its chief marketing officer, Joseph Tripodi, after it announced that it would probably fall short of its sales targets for the second year in a row. The company also said it would probably miss the profit estimates it earlier set. And after watching overall soda sales fall in the United States for years, the company is now facing issues in foreign and developing markets. To turn around the company's flagging sales, Coca-Cola appears to be doubling down on energy drinks, going by its 16.7% stake in  . The company hopes to help Monster grow into a more international brand by lending a hand in both distribution and logistics. And Monster is growing revenue at more than a double-digit clip on a year-over-year basis.And right now, energy drinks seem to be rather immune from what's plaguing the soft drink industry, although it is entirely possible for that situation to change. Remember that Coca-Cola once used athletes and celebrities to sell its flagship soda. It still does, but now the advertisements come across as hollow, amid all the health concerns.Rather than use mass marketing, energy drinks tend to market by product placement and sponsorship efforts designed to reach its youthful target audience. And with only a 2% share of the soft drink market, the industry can continue to grow before facing those concerns. However, Coca-Cola may have a way to reverse its deteriorating reputation with customers: Coca-Cola Life. The green-labeled, 60-calorie, 8-ounce soda boasts no artificial sweeteners and uses a mixture of stevia and sugar to keep its calorie count low. And if the newest findings from Haynes & Co. (  ) are of any indication, the company has a hit on its hands.The findings found 70% of purchasers highly rated the product's taste, and 45% of respondents have replaced the majority of their normal soda purchases with Coca-Cola Life. In addition, they like the green labeling of the bottles and cans, which appear to be Coca-Cola's attempt to convey a more natural and less processed product.Will this be a long-term solution? Probably not. But with sales flagging amid negative product perception, it can't hurt, either.

On the other hand, Gutsche Family Investments has majority stake in Coca-Cola Sabco, a South African bottling company of Coca-Cola.Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, with about 30 bottling plants, will cater to 12 countries with potential revenue of $2.9 billion.According to the agreement among the three companies, 57% of the equity stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will be held by SABMiller, 31.7% by Gutsche Family Investments: and the rest 11.3% by The Coca-Cola Company.As part of the deal, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire worldwide rights to SABMiller's Appletiser brand and acquire or license rights to another 19 non-alcoholic ready-to-drink brands in Africa and in Latin America for a cash consideration of about US$260 million.However, SABMiller will retain ownership of its non-alcoholic malt beverages in Africa and Latin America and its Coca-Cola franchises in El Salvador and Honduras.Initially, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will produce and distribute Coca-Cola beverages in nine countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Namibia, Comoros and Mayotte.Later SABMiller will also include its Swaziland soft drinks operation and its listed subsidiaries in Botswana and Zambia.The Coca-Cola Company, a Zacks Rank #4 company, is in the process of shifting to a more franchise-based model under which it will gradually grant new expanded U.S. territories to five of its bottlers to distribute its beverages.In Nov 2014, The Coca-Cola Company entered into a definitive agreement to grant its territories in the greater Chicago area to Great Lakes Coca-Cola Distribution, L.L.C., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reyes Holdings, L.L.C.

The energy drink company does not offer quarterly guidance, but Wall Street expects Monster to come through with earnings of $0.66 per share on $642.7 million in revenue, which works out to anticipated year-over-year growth rates of 24.5% on the bottom line and 8.9% on the top line.Dedicated Monster investors might be looking for better numbers, however, in light of the company's  with soft-drink kingpin  , which was announced during the third quarter. The true impact of this deal won't be known on Thursday, and it might not be known until well into 2015, but it certainly sees to be a long-term game changer for Monster. What else should investors look forwhen Monster reports the quarterly numbers? Let's dig into the details.If you're not familiar with Monster's deal with Coke, now's the time to familiarize yourself --  . The gist of this deal is that Monster will become a more globally diversified pure-play energy-drink company, transferring its nonenergy-drink brands to Coca-Cola in exchange for Coke's current energy-drink portfolio and an expanded distribution arrangement, That is on top of the $2.15 billion Coke invested for a sizable minority stake in Monster.We might not see much (or any) of this in Monster's third-quarter earnings, but you can be sure that it will be a hot topic during the company's , and management will probably be eager to crow about its pending Coke-backed plans for world domination. The deal won't be the key to Monster's third-quarter results, but it's so important to the company's long-term plans that any further information might well be the driving force on Monster's share price for the rest of the year.No surprise for a maturing business, Monster has seen its top-line growth dwindle from consistently strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in the early part of the decade to high single-digit growth for most of the past few quarters. For a while, it seemed Monster was running into a problem faced by many maturing businesses, as it couldn't sustain EPS growth rates above its top-line growth rates for very long, but things have been looking up in 2014:Sources: Monster Beverage earnings reports.Monster's EPS grew at far higher rates for the first two quarters of 2014 than it has in years, and analysts expect this trend to continue into the third quarter. Some of this is undoubtedly due to the periods against which these quarters are compared -- the first quarter of 2013 saw Monster's only year-over-year EPS decline in this decade, and the second-weakest quarter of the decade came immediately afterward. But a good part of Monster's strengthened earnings can also be explained by better pricing power, as its sales price per 192-ounce equivalent case rose to its highest mark of this decade in the second quarter. That $10.49-per-case sales price translated into decade-high operating margins, which translated in a fairly straightforward way to record-high net margins:Sources: Monster Beverage earnings reports.The company had not seen four consecutive quarters of strengthening case sales prices in this decade until the streak began in mid-2013; however, this progress could reverse itself in the third quarter, to investors' disappointment. However, Monster's deal with Coke has undoubtedly given it a stronger hand on the distribution side, and this could well translate into consistently higher case sales prices -- and thus higher margins. As we've already discussed, the Coke deal probably won't show up on the earnings statement for the third quarter, but case sales prices are something to keep an eye on going forward, to see if Coke's backing can help Monster lock in better deals with its major customers.Monster doesn't report its international sales on initial 8-K earnings reports, but it does offer some detail on both its conference call and its official 10-Q and 10-K filings. About 23% of its gross sales were to international customers in the first half of 2014, a share unchanged from the first half of 2013. Going back further, we can see a gradual increase in international sales over the past few years:International sales have nearly doubled as a share of Monster's revenue over the past six years, and its deal with Coke promises to greatly expand the company's international reach. Presentation slides offered as part of that deal indicate it will expand Monster's international revenue to account for roughly 5% more of its total revenue. Investors should keep an eye on Monster's international revenue figures with mental calculator at the ready. If international revenues account for 25% of revenue in the third quarter, they may well be worth 30% (or more) of Monster's revenue in the third quarter of 2015.What will you be watching when Monster reports its third-quarter earnings on Thursday?

The company racks up solid growth year in and year out, and pays a nice dividend to shareholders. PepsiCo's results this year once again prove what a strong business it is, and PepsiCo's growth is measurably better than its close rival  .For these reasons, I bought shares of PepsiCo several months ago. I continue to view PepsiCo as a superior investment to Coca-Cola. However, one pressing issue raised in recent weeks has led me to doubt my investment. PepsiCo is being pressured to split the company into two parts. While I would love to own my shares of PepsiCo forever, splitting up the company would compel me to sell my shares in one of the two remaining businesses. I've written about Coca-Cola and PepsiCo several times, and each of my articles carries a recurring theme. Coca-Cola is a highly profitable company with a world-class brand, which is why many investors, including none other than Warren Buffett, own the stock. However, I believe Coca-Cola's accolades have much more to do with the company's past performance than its future trajectory. I have consistently favored PepsiCo for the past few years because of its strategic vision.Case volumes of sparkling beverages have flat-lined for several quarters in a row. This is particularly true in developed markets like North America, where consumers are taking real notice of their eating and drinking habits. High-calorie, sugary beverages simply aren't being consumed at the rates they once were, for their reputations as being unhealthy. For example, Coca-Cola's net revenue is down 2% over the first three quarters of 2014, year over year. Meanwhile, global case volumes are up just 2% during this period. While emerging markets are helping to keep sales from falling more significantly, developed economies like the United States still comprise a large portion of Coca-Cola's sales. Revenue in North America is down 1% over the first three quarters.To be sure, this is definitely affecting PepsiCo as well, only PepsiCo took a much different approach than Coca-Cola. In response to changing consumer preferences, PepsiCo built up its food business. The company owns several brands across categories, including Quaker and Frito-Lay, to the point that PepsiCo's revenue split is virtually 50-50 between food and beverages. By contrast, Coca-Cola has stood still. It's made equity investments in  and  , but those won't be nearly enough to offset soda's decline.PepsiCo's food business is keeping the company's growth intact, even when it comes to mature economies. Over the first nine months of the year, PepsiCo's beverage business produced flat revenue growth in the Americas. By contrast, its Frito-Lay and Quaker businesses grew revenue by 2% over the first nine months in the Americas. This might not seem like much, but the fact that PepsiCo is still growing in the U.S. in such a difficult environment is a credit to the strength of its diversified portfolio.Even in the emerging economies, it's the food business that is doing most of the heavy lifting. In Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, PepsiCo grew food volumes by 11% last quarter, but grew beverage volumes by just 3%. For several months now, pressure has mounted from activist investors like Nelson Peltz for PepsiCo to pursue a spinoff. The rationale for this move is that if PepsiCo let loose its faster-growing food company, it could increase shareholder value by earning a higher valuation multiple than the current combined company does.However, this would leave investors with a very hard choice. Essentially, instead of one strong company, investors would own shares of a very strong company and a very weak company. There would be little incentive for investors to keep the \"bad\" company in their portfolios. It stands to reason that the slow-growth beverage stock would carry a far lower valuation multiple as a result.Because of this, I don't see how shareholders would be better off. If PepsiCo decides to split into two parts, I would sell the beverage company and retain the food company.

Last quarter, it posted a positive surprise of 6.58%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Though the carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has remained soft in 2014, energy drinks is one of the few categories that continue to gain momentum. In fact, the energy drink category increased in mid-single digits in the U.S during the second quarter of 2014. This growing momentum of energy drink category is expected to drive the demand for products of Monster Beverage, which in turn is expected to contribute to the company's top line in the upcoming quarter.However, new Monster Energy branded products like Ultra and Muscle Monster are cannibalizing sales of the existing brands like Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb. Revenues are also impacted by lower growth rates of the energy category in Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, particularly Eastern Europe. Third quarter 2014 results are expected to be impacted by these trends.In addition, Monster Beverage has been facing several other headwinds for the past few quarters, which is hurting profits.Monster Beverage has been involved in several controversies. The Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating the impact of caffeine in food and dietary supplements, which includes Monster Beverage products. All these regulatory and litigation issues are increasing Monster Beverage's professional service expenses, which are eroding its margins. We believe third quarter profits will also be pulled down by high legal costs.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Monster Beverage Corporation is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The ESP for Monster Beverage Corporation is -1.47% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 67 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher at 68 cents. Monster Beverage Corporation carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which when combined with a -1.47% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies in the consumer goods sector that can be considered as our model shows that these have a favorable combination of elements:Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A.B de C.V.

The largest craft brewer of the United States posted earnings of $2.79 per share for the quarter that surged 47.6% year over year and also came well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.35.Results for the quarter mainly benefited from robust increase in shipments and a notable decline in operating expenses per barrel due to fall in employee benefit expenses as well as a shift in timing of certain advertising promotional and selling expenses.Net revenue soared 25% year over year to $269.7 million and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $259 million primarily owing to an increase of 23% in core shipment volume.Moreover, depletions improved by a solid 21% in the quarter gaining from efficient sales execution, support from distributors and retailers, the quality of the company's beers, innovation and strong brands. An improvement in the company's Samuel Adams, Angry Orchard and Twisted Tea brands were primary contributors to the growth of brands.The company's gross profit increased approximately 23.9% year over year to $143 million. However, gross margin remained flat with last year at 53% as the benefit of rise in price was fully offset by a negative impact from product mix, and higher packaging and ingredient costs.Advertising, promotional and selling expenses soared nearly 15.9% to $65 million because of higher investments in media advertising, point of sale, increased costs for extra sales personnel and enhanced freight to distributors due to higher volumes.General and administrative expenses remained almost flat at $15.7 million primarily due to increase in salary expenses fully offset by lower consulting and benefit costs.Operating income in the quarter came in at $60.6 million, up 43.6% from the year-ago quarter level of $42.2 million. Operating margin expanded 300 bps to 22.5% due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales.Boston Beer ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $57.2 million. Long-term debt excluding current maturities stood at $528 million while stockholders' equity was $412.4 million. Further, during the nine months of 2014, the company generated approximately $102.6 million of cash from operating activities while it deployed nearly $128.3 million toward capital expenditure.Despite reporting solid third-quarter results, the company maintained its earlier fiscal 2014 guidance and provided a preliminary forecast for fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2014, the company reiterated its earnings per share guidance of $6.00-$6.40. However, the company expects actual results to deviate from the targeted numbers.Underlying the reiterated guidance, the company maintained its projections for 20%-24% depletions and shipments growth, 2% increase in prices, gross margin of 51%-53%, and advertising, promotion and selling expenses of $37-$45 million. Effective tax rate for the period is now projected to be approximately 37.5%.The company highlighted plans to invest around $3-$5 million in its existing brands developed by Alchemy & Science. These expenses form a part of the projected increases in advertising, promotional and selling expenses for the year.However, the company lowered its estimated capital spending for the year and now expects it to be in the range of $150-$160 million, compared with its previous forecast of $160-$185 million. Moreover, the company stated that its capital spending forecast includes capital investments related to Alchemy & Science projects of $7-$9 million.For fiscal 2015, the company expects depletions and shipments to rise 10%-15%, improvement in prices of 1%-2%, gross margin of 51%-53% and advertising, promotional and selling expenses of $25-$35 million, which includes $6-$12 million worth ongoing investments in Alchemy & Science brands. Effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 is expected to be 38%.Capital expenditure for fiscal 2015 is currently anticipated in the range of $80-$100 million, which includes about $5-$7 million capital investments for its existing Alchemy & Science brands.Currently, Boston Beer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Analysts had expected $641.8 million in net revenue and $0.67 in earnings per share. Monster narrowly missed on the top line with $636 million in revenue, but its reported earnings of $0.70 came out ahead of Wall Street's bottom-line projections.Investors barely touched Monster's shares in after-hours trading on Thursday, indicating a lack of either excitement or disappointment regarding the results. That's because this was a report largely devoid of real surprises, with Monster still in the interregnum between announcing a huge partnership with  and actually putting that partnership to work. Monster's top and bottom lines are definitely starting to look like those of  , as quarterly revenue growth has been lower in each of the past three quarters while EPS growth rates are at their highest levels in years:Sources: Monster Beverage earnings reports.As you can see, Monster's revenue has now grown by less than 10% year-over-year in five of the past eight quarters, while its EPS growth is now advancing some of the fastest rates of this decade. Monster's trailing 12-month revenue is up by 49% from the third quarter of 2011 to the current quarter, while its EPS has grown by 74%. It's hard to interpret these results as anything other than a company that's reaching the limits of its market size but hasn't yet reached the limits of its power over that market. In the company's , Monster CEO Rodney Sacks highlighted some energy-drink market data from the end of October that supports this view. Sales of energy drinks were up 4.8% year-over-year in October, with Monster's 8% growth running ahead of the overall market. The company's market share in the convenience-store segment was essentially unchanged year-over-year at 36.3%, ahead of  's 34% share.To better understand how Monster has propelled its earnings higher despite slowing growth, let's look at its case sales data:As you can see, Monster's case sales volume growth has progressed along more or less the same path as its revenue growth. However, Monster's ability to extract higher prices per case has strengthened recently after undergoing a period of weakness in 2013 -- the same period that produced some of Monster's weakest EPS growth rates. By compiling quarterly case sales prices into a trailing 12-month average, we can see a clearer correlation between sales prices and EPS growth:Monster may not be able to sustain these higher case sales prices, as its business in early 2013 is more or less the same as its business today. The company often relies on \"limited-edition\" flavors and discount promotions to drive new sales, which can lead to quarterly fluctuations in case sales prices. Case sales prices were higher year-over-year in the third quarter, but declined sequentially, which seems to be a recurring trend, since every third quarter in this decade has resulted in lower case sales prices than the quarter preceding it. Case sales prices should improve in the fourth quarter, pulling Monster's margins higher as well.All in all, this was a rather business-as-usual quarter for Monster. It may be a while before investors can get a better idea of Coke's impact on Monster's business, as that deal isn't expected to close until the first quarter of 2015.

Coke will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy-drink brands such as NOS and Full Throttle to Monster, making Monster its exclusive energy-drink play. And Monster will transfer its non-energy-drink brands, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coke, making Monster a pure energy-drink play.The transaction would give Monster access to Coke's massive global distribution system, with Coke becoming Monster's preferred distribution partner globally. Coke and Monster will amend their current distribution agreement in the U.S. and Canada by expanding into additional territories and entering into long-term agreements.At the deal's closing, expected late this year or early 2015, Coca-Cola will make a net cash payment to Monster of $2.15 billion. In exchange, Monster will issue to Coca-Cola the shares of Monster stock.The agreement's potential overseas impact has gotten investors thirsty for Monster.\"They're excited about the longer-term prospects of a much bigger international franchise that shows up much more quickly than without Coke,\" said UBS Securities analyst Stephen Powers. \"The biggest benefit that I see and most investors see is that in partnership with the Coke system globally, Monster should be in a much better position to realize international growth opportunities.\"Monster, he adds, has had some \"struggles\" on the international front because it hasn't found the best distribution partner in every market.He says that the pact should give Monster \"the explicit backing of the Coke system as the default partner,\" with the Coke bottler as Monster's distributor in most markets.\"The Coke bottler is probably the most capable bottler in the market,\" he adds. \"The question is how much can that accelerate its growth opportunity, how fast and by what magnitude?\"Powers estimates potential international growth to be in the mid- to high teens on a constant-currency basis into 2020. This year, he expects overseas growth to be 13.5% on a constant-currency basis, up from a 12% rise in 2013.\"I'd like to believe there could be upside to my international estimates,\" he added.But until there's more \"clarity\" on how quickly some of the new markets will be opened where Monster doesn't distribute now, like China, it will be difficult to assess the upside, he says.If there is a \"more material upside,\" he adds, it would probably be in 2016 and 2017 vs. 2015 because of the \"ongoing transition\" in some of these overseas markets.Monster executives declined to comment for this story. But on the conference call announcing the deal, Monster CEO Rodney Sacks cited a number of benefits to the pact with Coke.\"We are absolutely aligned with Coke by having all the brands in different countries,\" he said. \"It really gives us the energy offering to the individual bottlers in each country.\"It also enables us in conjunction with the bottlers to determine strategies in each country for pricing. Where do we position the different product(s)? What are the market strengths? In many ways, this will obviously be a great tool to help us compete as a company and with a future of earning profits in many of these countries where we have struggled to date.\"Cowen analyst Vivien Azer considers Monster's partnership with Coke to be a \"notable positive development.\"The reason? \"On the international side, there is an opportunity to improve the margin profile,\" she said. \"But that will take time.\"In her initiation report on Monster, Azer noted that while the company has been rapidly expanding its international presence over the last few years, \"(the) build-out has had its challenges in terms of finding suitable manufacturing as well as contending with product loss due to shipping.\"As a result, she adds, its international margins still \"lag\" those of the company's U.S. business.\"Under the new agreement with KO, MNST now has the opportunity to attempt to move their international manufacturing and distribution to the KO system, which should offer longer-term benefit,\" she said in the report.She also sees the pact benefiting its U.S. business.\"In the U.S., the absence of non-energy drinks will alleviate the top-line drag these drinks have had on Monster,\" she told IBD. \"While the addition of Coke's recently fast-growing energy-drinks brands can prove beneficial.\"She sees \"potential revenue synergies\" in the U.S. as Monster \"optimizes its portfolio in a move toward exclusive pure-play energy-drink status.\"As a result of the deal, she expects a \"noticeable accretion\" in full-year revenue growth in 2015 to 23% vs. a year earlier for the total company. That would be up from her estimate for a 9% revenue increase in all of 2014.Not that Monster has needed a boost. The company has seen four straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth. In the second quarter, earnings rose 31% to 81 cents a share, ahead of the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for 75 cents. Sales rose 9% to $687.2 million.Analysts expect full-year 2014 earnings to rise 32% to $2.58 a share.

Folks are scaling back on soda consumption, and both  and  have been countering the trend by expanding into new product categories.Overall soda volumes have fallen for nine years in a row according to industry watcher Beverage Digest, slipping 3% last year. Diet sodas used to be a growing niche, but that category took an even harder hit than non-diet beverages last year.Let's crack open a can in order to take a closer look at the two soft drink giants.With millennials turning to everything from fancy iced coffee brews to adrenaline-juicing energy drinks to provide caffeinated kicks it really wasn't a surprise to see both Coke and Pepsi slip in popularity again this past quarter.Coca-Cola's sparkling beverage sales in North America declined 1% during the third quarter, and that was actually slightly better than its rival. Coca-Cola scored with its Share a Coke campaign that saw Coke cans featuring terms of endearment and personal names. Pepsi was a relative laggard with its carbonated-soft-drink volume slipping 1.5% in North America during the same period.The cola wars are over. Coke and Pepsi lost. There are too many parents and regulators worried about what sugary soft drinks are doing to children in terms of childhood obesity and diabetes. Pepsi used to market itself as the choice of a new generation, but now we're seeing that it's not the choice of a new generation. It's not Coke, either.If investors are trying to assess the better investment they're going to have to look beyond each beverage behemoth's namesake soft drinks.Coca-Cola may be the larger of the two meandering purveyors of pop, but PepsiCo has been working on broadening its portfolio for decades. Frito-Lay snacks, Quaker oatmeal, and Gatorade are part of the PepsiCo empire. In fact, PepsiCo generated more money from food than it did beverages last year.Coca-Cola has tried to make up for lost time by taking minority stakes in  and  earlier this year. The investments make sense. Keurig's the undisputed champ in single-serve coffee. Monster joins Red Bull as the two titans in energy drinks, a market where both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have tried to wrestle their way in but couldn't unseat the two kings of the adrenaline-pumping hill. More importantly, coffee and energy drinks are growing at a time when carbonated sodas are not.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have poured money into bottled water and juice lines. They know that there's more to life than sparkling beverages. PepsiCo has the upper hand when it comes to diversifying away from liquid fuel, but CocaCola's portfolio of non-soda beverages is starting to get impressive.The market valuations on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are surprisingly similar. Both stocks fetch 19 times next year's projected earnings. That's a pretty steep multiple for two companies growing so slowly -- analysts see revenue climbing 1.1% and 2.5% and Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, respectively, next year -- but naturally there's a premium to be paid for the iconic brands under their watch.Both stocks also command similar yields with extensive streaks of payout boosts. Coca-Cola's 3% yield narrowly tops PepsiCo at 2.8%.When PepsiCo hiked its dividend by 15% in May it made it 42 consecutive years of increasing payouts. Coca-Cola's streak stretched to 52 years when it pushed through its latest boost in February.The valuation battle is ultimately closer than one would think and it seems that the cola wars wage on. However, it's hard not to give PepsiCo the upper hand here. It's simply been more consistent. Analysts see PepsiCo growing its revenue and earnings this year, and that's something that can't be said about Coca-Cola. It's also easier to warm up to PepsiCo's broader product lines at a time when sparkling beverages are falling out of favor. Both stocks should continue to serve investors well -- with more dividend hikes along the way rewarding the patient -- but PepsiCo has a slight edge over Coca-Cola in the only cola war that matters. The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their non-dividend paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute.

The company revealed that quarterly performance was negatively impacted by inventory cut by U.S. wholesalers and stagnant demand in Brazil after the 2014 FIFA World Cup.AB InBev's third-quarter normalized earnings of $1.42 per share increased 4.4% from the year-ago level of $1.36. The company's bottom-line results mainly benefited from strong revenue and organic EBITDA growth and lower financing costs. However, quarterly earnings were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50.Revenues for the quarter registered organic growth of 2.3% and reached $12,239 million. However, it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,465 million. The year-over-year organic growth was mainly driven by a 4.3% rise in revenues per hectoliter (hl) resulting from the company's ongoing revenue management and premiumization initiatives, partially offset by a 2.6% fall in total volume.In the said quarter, cost of sales grew 2.9% organically to $4,966 million primarily due to higher depreciation charges owing to increased investment in Brazil and rise in packaging costs in Mexico. On a constant geographic basis, cost of sales increased 6.7% per hl.The company's normalized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) grew 1.3% year over year to $4,745 million, while as a percentage of sales it contracted 37 basis points to 38.8%.Concurrent with third-quarter results, the company's board declared an interim dividend of \u20ac1 for 2014 to be payable on Nov 14 to the shareholders of record as on Nov 13.Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, AB InBev expects improvement in volume in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil and China. The company's net revenue per hectoliter will likely grow at par with inflation while cost of goods sold per hectoliter is expected to increase in the low-single digits. Furthermore, AB InBev intends to make capital expenditure of $3.7 billion for innovation and capitalization of emerging opportunities in the market.AB InBev currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

I have a penchant for companies that actually make money, for example, and generally prefer enduring consumer products to trends. The soft beverage business used to be all about enduring brands; nobody could challenge Coca-Cola () or PepsiCo (). In the last few years, however, upstarts such as Monster Beverage () have stolen the spotlight and reported great growth as the established brands have stagnated somewhat. Beneath all of this, though, there is another market, inexpensive, store brand versions of the branded drinks - you know \u201cDr Popper\u201d and the like.As the Monsters of the beverage world have gained ground on the old traditional names, so the companies that operate quietly in the background producing store and generic branded soft drinks have also come under pressure. In an improving economy, that is hardly a surprise. More confident consumers with a few extra dollars in their pockets are way more likely to splash out on a recognized brand name than to buy a store\u2019s own brand. The 1 year chart for the largest producer of store branded beverages, Cott Corporation (), tells the story.Cott, 1 yearThat ugly looking chart is not without good reason either. When Cott reported earnings on Wednesday they missed expectations for the second time in three quarters, with EPS of $0.07 versus a consensus estimate of $0.11. With the negative reaction to those results, however, we may now be at a point where the valuation of COT makes it an attractive play for investors who don\u2019t mind taking a risk. If we extend the chart out to 5 years the reasons to take a chance at these levels become more obvious.Cott, 5 yearsAs you can see, this $6 level has been critical in the past. At the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012 the stock twice bounced off the level before rallying to over $11. Should it break through, however there is another likely support level at the 5 year low of $5.41. That also provides a good, logical level for a stop loss. Stopping out on a clean break of that level would limit potential losses to around 10 percent, which should be manageable for any trader or active investor.As I have said many times before, though, no amount of support or convenient, inexpensive stop loss levels matter one iota if there is no reason to think that the stock will arrest its decline. In the case of COT, though, there is. The stock is being pummeled as if consumption of store brand beverages is coming to a complete halt. That, of course, won\u2019t happen. There will always be a hard core of consumers who place value over marketing.The other thing to bear in mind is that, while Cott has disappointed, the last two quarters have been profitable. In fact the company has a trailing 12 month free cash flow of over $110 million, or about 20 percent of the current market capitalization. Given that, and a book value of $5.98 per share, a significant move lower from here looks unlikely.It could be that Cott\u2019s glory days and dynamic growth are behind them, but they still have a solid book of business and are making money. That would suggest that the collapse in the stock should stop soon and when it does a squeeze on the short interest, which has been steadily climbing and is at the highest level since the end of last year, could give some impetus to any turnaround. That makes buying at this easily identifiable support level a risk worth taking.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [".K.-based spirits maker and distributor  (  ) recently inked a deal with the owners of Tequila Cuervo la Rojena SA de CV to gain full control of the tequila brand Don Julio.

The deal also requires the early termination of Casa Cuervo's production and distribution agreement for Smirnoff in Mexico.The deal is expected to close in early 2015 and will add 0.6% to earnings per share by 2015-end.There have been rumors regarding Diageo's interest in buying Jos\u00e9 Cuervo, the leading tequila brand, produced by Tequila Cuervo La Roje\u00f1a, S.A. de C.V, since 2003.

The decline even accelerated in 2013, as total industry volume fell 3% versus declines of 1.2% in 2012 and 1% in 2011.Coca-Cola has increased its marketing efforts to sustain sales lately, and management is quite encouraged about customer response to its Share a Coke campaign during the second quarter of 2014.

However, the trend toward healthier eating and drinking is a long-term phenomenon that is clearly observable across different product categories. Marketing spending can buffer the decline in soft drinks sales to some degree, but there is no reason to expect changing industry dynamics anytime soon.Not everything is bad news for Coca-Cola, though, the company is the volume leader in the global still drinks industry, a category in which it owns 11 brands making over $1 billion in annual revenues each. This includes remarkably popular names such as Powerade, Dasani, and Minute Maid, among others. Coca-Cola registered a healthy increase of 5% in global still-sales volume during the second quarter.Besides, growing personal income levels in emerging markets provide considerable opportunities for growth over the long term, both in traditional soft drinks and in healthier products. Total sales volume in China grew at an impressive 9% during the second quarter, while volume in India increased in the double digits.The company is also putting its deep pockets to use by venturing into different growth areas, such as energy drinks and home soda, via equity investments and partnerships with smaller and more dynamic companies. Financial resources, marketing firepower, brand recognition, and global scale are key strategic advantages that Coca-Cola is leveraging to accelerate growth.The company recently purchased 16.7% of  for $2.15 billion. Monster will be Coca-Cola's exclusive energy drink, and the soda giant will put its enormous distribution network behind the energy brand. Energy drinks are not exempt from criticism when it comes to health considerations, but sales are still growing strongly on a global basis.Coca-Cola also recently announced intentions to increase its ownership in  to 16%. The two companies are working together to bring Coca-Cola products for use in Keurig's platform, Coca-Cola's soft drinks brands will be introduced in Green Mountain's Keurig Cold machine and Honest Tea is becoming the first Coca-Cola brand to be available via K-cup packs.In February of this year Coca-Cola announced its 52nd annual dividend increase, raising payments by 9%, from $0.28 to $0.35 per share. This brings the dividend yield to roughly 2.9% at current prices.During the first six months of 2014 Coca-Cola paid dividends for $1.34 billion and allocated $1.95 billion to share buybacks, so investors are being generously rewarded with cash distributions via both methods. The company produced $3.44 billion in free cash flows during the period, which shows that the business is clearly strong enough to sustain growing dividend payments in the coming years.When comparing dividends versus earnings, Coca-Cola features a very reasonable payout ratio of less than 60% of earnings forecasts for 2014, confirming that dividend sustainability is out of question for the global juggernaut.Coca-Cola will need to adapt to changing consumer habits, and this could drag on performance in the middle term. But the company benefits from exciting opportunities for growth via multiple venues, and it generates more than enough cash flows to sustain growing dividend payments over time. Coca-Cola has what it takes to continue paying increasing dividends for decades to come and this makes it a good dividend stock to buy in coming years.

(  ) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (  ) - pledged to reduce calories that Americans consume by 20% by 2025.At the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) 2014 CGI Annual Meeting in New York City, the companies agreed to promote bottled water, no-or-lower-calorie beverages and smaller portion sizes to achieve the shared goal. The soda giants are facing tremendous pressure over the role their carbonated sugary drinks have played in escalating the nation's obesity rates.The companies are also required to provide calorie counts and promote calorie awareness on vending machines, self-serve fountain dispensers and retail coolers in convenience stores, restaurants and other locations.The move comes amid a difficult operating environment for the beverage industry. These companies have been seeing declining sales trends of their carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) for the past few years due to category headwinds. Growing health and wellness consciousness - consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concerns - have been affecting CSD sales of all major soft drink makers.With increasing health consciousness among consumers, the companies are realizing that future profit and sales do not lie in a sugar-laden fizzy can. As a result, the beverage companies are shifting away from high-calorie carbonated beverages to produce healthier products like juices, energy and sports drinks.Moreover, the companies are offering more choices to customers in package sizes, sweeteners and beverages (including more low- and no-calorie selections). The companies are also making drinks with evolutionary natural sweeteners and flavorings aimed at reducing calories. Coca-Cola has launched Coca-Cola Life, a naturally sweetened mid-calorie cola in Chile and Argentina and plans to expand it to other markets through the rest of the year. Pepsi also expects to launch lower calorie, naturally sweetened non-cola products in the U.S. this year.All the three beverage giants carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as they outperformed expectations in the first half of this year.

It's one of the most universally known brands in the world and has a tremendous financial track record of growth and enriching shareholders for many decades. Interestingly though, Coca-Cola is at somewhat of a crossroads. Its flagship sparkling beverages are losing favor with consumers in developed economies because of shifting consumer preferences away from sugary, high-calorie drinks. This is reflected in sluggish case volume growth for Coca-Cola over the past several quarters, particularly in North America.In response, Coca-Cola is about to embark on new product categories to drive innovation for the future. The most significant of its initiatives includes partnerships with  and  on developing new product lines that could revolutionize their industries.Here is a breakdown of Coca-Cola's recent past, its future, and whether this dividend stock is a buy right now. Coca-Cola has made a series of investments in Keurig Green Mountain, and the two companies are about to collaborate on a brand new major product. Coca-Cola took a 16% stake in Keurig Green Mountain, and the two companies will prepare the launch of the Keurig Cold beverage platform as part of a 10-year agreement. Coca-Cola sees the at-home beverage platform as a compelling opportunity. In addition, Coca-Cola took a 16.7% stake in Monster Beverage Corporation. This gives Coca-Cola a presence in energy drinks, which are a higher-growth corner of the beverage market than soda.These investments don't carry a lot of risk for Coca-Cola. The company could strike gold with the Keurig Cold system if the technology is universally adopted. Moreover, partnering with Monster Beverage could be an effective way to diversify its business. And, considering the investments amount to a small sum given Coca-Cola's massive coffers, these are certainly ideas worth pursuing.This is especially true when you consider Coca-Cola's growth is less than impressive. Coca-Cola produced constant-currency revenue growth of just 3% last quarter and over the first half of the year. In addition, Coca-Cola generated 6% constant-currency earnings-per-share growth last quarter. Its financial performance was dragged down by sluggish case volumes. Global unit case volume grew 3% last quarter internationally, but volumes in North America were flat.What investors can continue to count on is Coca-Cola's dividend. The stock yields a healthy 2.9%, and has raised its dividend for 52 years in a row. This places Coca-Cola in truly elite company among dividend payers. Coca-Cola is a highly profitable company, produces solid growth of revenue and profits like clockwork every year, and rewards its shareholders with a rock-solid dividend. But whether the stock should be bought right now is somewhat debatable, because Coca-Cola is fresh off an incredible rally over the past few years that has left the stock looking a bit pricey.Coca-Cola stock sits near $42 per share, very close to its all-time high. This has raised the valuation of the stock to 22 times trailing earnings per share, a multiple that represents a five-year high. The stock trades for 19 times forward earnings estimates, which is a fairly high multiple for a megacap company that isn't expected to produce huge earnings growth going forward.That's why, while Coca-Cola is a great dividend stock, now might not be the best time for new investors to jump in. That being said, if prospective investors get a meaningful pullback from its current level, Coca-Cola is a great company and a long-term winner. Investors will still receive modest earnings growth, with the potential for better results ahead if its strategic investments in Keurig Cold Mountain and Monster Beverage pay off. While not pounding the table to buy Cocal-Cola stock, dividend investors can surely count on Coca-Cola continuing its streak of annual dividend increases. The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their non-dividend paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute. They also know that a well-constructed dividend portfolio creates wealth steadily, while still allowing you to sleep like a baby.

From a geographical perspective, Coca-Cola has done an amazing job in penetrating new markets; but the fact that the company has already established a presence in more than 200 countries across the globe means that it no longer has the low-hanging fruit of undeveloped markets in its future. Instead, Coca-Cola has to work at persuading consumers to buy more of its products, and that requires a longer-term mind-set that won't necessarily give short-term traders the quick results they prefer.The job of raising demand for Coca-Cola's traditional carbonated products has gotten tougher lately, as health issues have had a negative impact on consumer attitudes. On one hand, some have presented evidence establishing  . Yet, even in the diet-drink realm, sales volumes have dropped sharply, as recent studies have linked artificial sweeteners to issues like kidney problems and diabetes. Coca-Cola and rival  are both working hard at  , but it could still take time to reverse customer wariness.In response,  of substantial stakes in beverage companies outside its core competence. With double-digit percentage stakes in both coffee giant  and energy-drink pioneer  , Coca-Cola has recognized the value of different segments of the beverage business, and it believes that it can take advantage of the efficiencies of the Coca-Cola distribution network to squeeze even more profits from these already lucrative businesses. Still, the payoff from these investments could take time to materialize, and investors expect no growth in earnings per share this year, and only minimal gains in 2015.Dividend investors can take some solace from the fact that Coca-Cola has the time to let its longer-term strategies play out. With the company paying out just more than 60% of its earnings per share in dividends, Coca-Cola can afford to continue its rate of rising payouts without jeopardizing its ability to allocate the rest of its capital toward growing its business. Moreover, earnings per share have taken a sizable hit from the currency impact of a strong U.S. dollar on Coca-Cola's global business, and if those foreign-exchange trends flatten out or reverse themselves, it could lead to further growth in the future.Despite its challenges, Coca-Cola isn't likely to stop rewarding shareholders for their patience in sticking with the beverage giant as it considers how to transform itself to find new growth opportunities. With such strong brand recognition, Coca-Cola has the potential to remain a Dividend Aristocrat for the next half-century.

Since 1928, the  over the course of September, making it by far the the worst month for stocks.With the tide going against them, finding stocks to buy can be pretty difficult \u2014 especially if we\u2019re looking for stocks to buy that put up positive gains, not just outperform a money-losing market with slightly smaller declines.In searching for stocks to buy for September, technical analysis is your friend. Target stocks should be sending positive technical signals such as accelerating price momentum to the upside, as well as strong seasonality. No, there\u2019s no such thing as slam-dunk stocks, but having the charts on your side sure improves the odds.With that, we searched the S&P 500 for stocks to buy for September by looking for names flashing signals of technical strength. Upward price momentum and a track record of outstanding seasonal returns helped make the case for everything from pharmaceuticals to apparel retailers.Here are five stocks to buy for this month:Avago Technologies\u2019 (AVGO) chart is a thing of beauty if you like relentless and hefty gains. Not only does it keep setting new 52-week highs, but it uses support at its 50-day moving average as a springboard to more upside ahead.Price momentum keeps chugging away, too. AVGO shares are currently trading 15.3% above their 50-day MA and 33.6% above their 200-day. True, the relative strength index of 96 shows AVGO to be overbought \u2014 but overbought conditions can persist for a long time. Besides, any selloff will be short and shallow down to the 50-day MA.And historically, AVGO loves September, putting up a average monthly gain of 2.5% over the last decade, according to data from Thomson Reuters Stock Reports.Like AVGO, F5 Networks (FFIV) has a chart that portends more gains. The upside has been relentless, and you can count on that 50-day moving average for springy support.Yes, the RSI of 86 suggests FFIV is overbought, but again, that\u2019s a condition that can last for a long time \u2014 and that 50-day MA has been a solid floor.As we said, the upside has been relentless. Notching new 52-week highs, FFIV shares currently are trading 9.7% above their 50-day MA, and 18.8% above their 200-day moving average of $105.84.Perhaps most important, FFIV loves this time of year. Shares gain an average of 3.7% in September and 12.3% in October.Monster Beverage (MNST) stock crossed its 50- and 200-day moving averages to the upside a few weeks ago and hasn\u2019t looked back. Although that has put the RSI of 76 into overbought territory, price momentum suggests more gains to come this month.MNST shares currently are trading 22.4% above their 50-day MA and 29% above their 200-day. MNST also is closing in on its 52-week high.Seasonality is at the stock\u2019s back, too. Over the last 10 years, MNST gained 3.3% over the course of September. Just for good measure, it added another 2.1% in October.TJX Cos. (TJX) recently crossed above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and this time the momentum suggests the stock can stay there.Heck, TJX hasn\u2019t traded above both averages simultaneously since April. But now it looks like it can stick.TJX is about 6% below its 52-week high and narrowing the gap. Meanwhile, TJX shares currently are trading 10.5% above their 50-day MA and 3.5% above the 200-day. The RSI of 77 is clearly in overbought territory, but after the latest breakout, that shouldn\u2019t cause anything more than a slight pause in the uptrend.TJX also is a steady seasonal performer, gaining an average of 1.5% in September and 1.4% in October.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is on the cusp of being overbought at an RSI reading of 70, but momentum and seasonality should keep it chugging along through September.REGN is setting new 52-week highs and is trading well above its moving averages. Indeed, REGN shares currently sit 11.4% above their 50-day MA and 18% above the 200-day. Except for a brief dip below its 200-day MA in June, REGN finds support at that level.Seasonality is very much in favor of REGN heading into September, as well. Over the last decade, REGN has gained an average of 6.4%, according to data from Thomson Reuters Stock Reports.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n Oct 9, 2014, we issued an updated research report on  (  ).On Aug 7, this energy drink company reported mixed results for second-quarter 2014.Monster Beverage's second-quarter adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.6% and the year-ago figure by 31.5%. This came on the back of solid margins, better cost leverage and a lower tax rate.Though the energy drink company delivered strong earnings during the quarter, Monster Beverage has been facing several headwinds.Despite year over year increase, net sales of the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5%. Revenue was hurt by soft growth in the Energy category in both the U.S. and international markets. Further, cannibalization of existing brands sales by new products continued to hurt revenues.On the other hand, Monster Beverage experienced a steady rise in the professional service expenses associated with litigations and regulatory issues. The company has lately been involved in several controversies. The Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating the impact of caffeine in food and dietary supplements, which includes Monster Beverage's products. All these regulatory and litigation issues are heightening the company's professional service costs. Monster Beverage's legal expenses during the quarter amounted to $7.9 million, up from $5.0 million in the prior quarter.Despite all headwinds, Monster Beverage's recent deal with The Coca-Cola Company (  ) is very encouraging.On Aug 14, Monster Beverage inked a deal with The Coca-Cola Company, which involved the sale of an equity stake and swapping of some brands with the cola giant.Under the long-term strategic deal, Coca-Cola will acquire approximately 16.7% equity stake in the energy drink maker for $2.15 billion in cash. Coca Cola will transfer the ownership of its global energy drinks business, which includes brands like Relentless and Burn, to Monster Beverage making the latter Coca-Cola's exclusive energy play. In return, Monster Beverage will transfer its non-energy portfolio, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coca-Cola. Finally, Coca-Cola will become the former's preferred global distribution partner providing Monster Beverage full access to the cola company's world-class global distribution network.The deal is also expected to significantly expand Monster's limited presence in the international energy drinks market. Most importantly, Monster Beverage's cash position will likely receive a major boost from the deal.Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other stocks in the industry include Barfresh Food Group Inc (  ) and True Drinks Holdings, Inc.

While the company is facing considerable challenges in adapting to the trend toward healthier drinks consumption, this global juggernaut has what it takes to continue paying sweet and sparkling dividends over years to come. Let's take a look at Coca-Cola and three important reasons why the global soft drinks leader is a top dividend stock.Sales and cash flows are very important when analyzing dividend stocks, but competitive strengths are even more vital. After all, cash flows don't come out of thin air; a company needs to have a strong enough business model in order to produce growing cash flows in the long term and protect its profits from the competition.Coca-Cola is the undisputed leader in the global soft drinks industry; the company owns a remarkable portfolio of 17 brands, each making more than $1 billion in global revenues. In addition, Coca-Cola has a pipeline of 20 more sparkling and still beverage brands generating annual sales of between $0.5 billion and $1 billion each, many of which will probably become billion-dollar brands in the medium term.Source: Coca-Cola.Coca-Cola's colossal bottling and distribution network provides another source of competitive advantage allowing the company to keep competitors at bay and efficiently introduce new products in markets around the world. Massive scale and abundant financial resources are additional sources of strength for the company. Consumers in developed markets are increasingly conscious about the health implications of the food and drinks they consume. This represents an important headwind for Coca-Cola, especially when it comes to generating volume growth in big markets such as the U.S.On the other hand, the company owns 11 billion-dollar brands in the noncarbonated category that continue performing strongly: Sales volume in still beverages increased by an impressive 5% during the second quarter of 2014, and Coca-Cola gained both volume and value share across categories such as sports drinks, tea, energy, coffee, and water during the quarter.Emerging markets offer plenty of room for growth in the coming years, both in traditional carbonated drinks and healthier products. Nearly 800 million consumers will enter into the middle class by the end of this decade, and Coca-Cola is in a position of remarkable strength to benefit from growing income levels and consumer demand in emerging markets over the years ahead.The company is also capitalizing new opportunities for growth via partnerships and acquisitions like the ones it's doing with  and  .Coca-Cola has recently purchased 16.7% of Monster Beverage for $2.15 billion. Monster is now becoming Coca-Cola's exclusive energy play, and it will have access to the company's enormously valuable distribution network. This is clearly a huge positive for investors in Monster Beverage, and it also shows how Coca-Cola can leverage its financial resources and other competitive strengths to rapidly enter an excitingly growing category such as energy drinks.Coca-Cola bought a 10% of Keurig Green Mountain for $1.25 billion in February; the company then announced plans to raise its ownership level to 16% of Keurig. Coca-Cola and Keurig Green Mountain signed an agreement to introduce Coca-Cola's products for use in Green Mountain's forthcoming Keurig Cold machine, and they have recently expanded the partnership by making Honest Tea the first Coca-Cola brand to be available via K-cup packs.Coca-Cola needs to be careful not to cannibalize its traditional channels too much with its partnership with Keurig Green Mountain. However, it's good to see the company taking an innovative approach to distribution and focusing on opportunities for growth via new channels. Last, but not least, Coca-Cola is a cash-flow generating machine. The company has consistently generated abundant cash flows through all kind of economic scenarios over time, and it has the financial strength to comfortably cover dividend payments.In the first six months of 2014, Coca-Cola produced $3.44 billion in free cash flows, while dividend payments accounted for only $1.34 billion over that period. In comparison to earnings, current dividend payments represent less than 60% of earnings forecasts for 2014, quite a safe payout ratio for such a solid industry dividend juggernaut.Coca-Cola has translated its consistently growing cash flows into rising dividend for investors through the decades; the company has increased dividends over the last 52 consecutive years, including a 9% dividend hike for 2014. Coca-Cola yields approximately 3% in dividends at current prices.Growth rates in developed markets may remain subdued until Coca-Cola can compensate the decline in soft drinks sales with healthier alternatives. However, considering its remarkable competitive strengths, opportunities for growth in several areas, and outstanding cash flow generation capabilities, Coca-Cola is a top dividend stock to hold for the long term. The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their non-dividend paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute.

However, the best  also have the potential for the stock price to increase faster than the broader market. Stocks that have good dividend yields and are also undervalued give income investors an added bonus.  ,  , and  fit the bill.\n  \n Coca-Cola's 3.1% yield is enticing on its own, but the stock price could also provide a good return if a few things go its way. Coca-Cola is primarily a soft drink company, but it is diversifying into other categories as well. Most notably, the company invested $2.15 billion in  and more than $1.25 billion in  in exchange for equity stakes in both companies.Coca-Cola already distributes Monster Energy, making the two companies natural partners. The investment could pay off big time if the regulatory cloud hanging over the energy drink category blows away without damaging Monster's earning power.Keurig Green Mountain is also a natural partner for Coca-Cola. Not only will Keurig's new Cold brewer introduce Coca-Cola's beverages to a new channel, but its successful Keurig Hot system gives the soft drink giant exposure to the fast-growing single-serve coffee segment. If Keurig Cold and Keurig Hot 2.0 experience strong sales in the coming year, Coca-Cola's investment could pay off for shareholders.Despite its diversification in the U.S. beverage market, Coca-Cola's long-term future largely depends on global beverage volume. The company's beverage volume grew just 2% last year, but more robust growth might be just around the corner. The global population consumed 94 servings per capita of Coca-Cola beverages in 2012 -- a 3% annual growth rate since 2002. A 50% increase in its beverage volume growth rate could send Coca-Cola shares higher in the coming years.Not only does Procter & Gamble have an attractive 3.2% yield, it is also a chronic dividend raiser. Earlier this year, the company increased its dividend for the 58th straight year. With a 61% payout ratio, there's little doubt that Procter & Gamble will increase the dividend again next year -- and for many years after that.However, investors who buy Procter & Gamble shares are getting more than just an almost-guaranteed 3.2% return. They're also getting a wide-moat company that may soon increase its profit margin for just 17 times forward earnings. That multiple might turn out to be misleadingly high as Procter & Gamble generates an increasing amount of its earnings in international markets, thereby reducing its effective tax rate. All else equal, this will allow the company to grow earnings faster than it grows revenue.Procter & Gamble's tax rate has been declining for years as it shifts profits overseas. Source: Morningstar.If you think Philip Morris International only has a few more years of strong profitability left, you could miss out on a great investment opportunity. If the stock's 4.6% dividend yield isn't enough to get you interested, its valuation might. Philip Morris trades at a lower valuation than  despite having better prospects.Philip Morris was spun off from Altria in 2008 after the U.S. tobacco giant decided its international operations had better growth prospects and should trade separately. That theory proved correct, as Philip Morris grew earnings per share 62% from 2009 to 2013, while Altria's earnings per share grew by 39% over the same period. Although the future is uncertain, Philip Morris will likely continue to grow earnings per share faster than its U.S. counterpart because of its ability to enter less-regulated emerging markets.As a result, Philip Morris' stock could be a steal since it trades at a lower forward price-to-earnings ratio (15 vs. 16) and the same yield (4.7 %) as Altria -- even though its prospects are better. If the market turns out to be wrong, investors who grab Philip Morris here could get a great dividend and even better capital appreciation.There is no guarantee that Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Philip Morris International will beat the market, but investors who buy these stocks today will own three solid dividend stocks that may also be undervalued. For buy-and-hold investors, there's hardly a better combination. The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their non-dividend paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute. They also know that a well-constructed dividend portfolio creates wealth steadily, while still allowing you to sleep like a baby.

Coca-Cola is acquiring a 16.7% equity stake in Monster for $2.15 billion, and the companies are planning several major strategic initiatives.There is much more to this deal than Coca-Cola simply acquiring a portion of Monster for a hefty chunk of change. Both companies are exchanging portions of their brand portfolios with each other, setting the stage for a long-term global strategic relationship. As part of the agreement, Coca-Cola is transferring its 12 energy drink brands to Monster, while Monster is transferring its non-energy drink segment (such as Hansen's, Blue Sky, and Peace Tea) to Coca-Cola.Sources: Monster and Coca-Cola.Notably, Monster is gaining energy drink brands NOS and Full Throttle, along with 10 other international brands available in nearly 30 countries. Coca-Cola's energy drink segment brought in about $330 million in total sales in 2013; Monster's non-energy drink segment did $150 million in sales in 2013 (less than 7% of overall sales). Monster, in other words, will see an immediate sales boost and expanded international presence as a result of this brands transfer. See how this transfer will affect Monster:Sources: Monster and Coca-Cola.This brand transfer makes a lot of sense for Monster. The company's non-energy drink segment was becoming an increasingly minuscule portion of its overall business (despite my fondness for Blue Sky sodas growing up). It has been clear for quite some time that the Monster brand -- and energy drinks -- are the lifeblood of the company. The company wouldn't have switched its name from Hansen Natural to Monster Beverage in 2012 had this not been the case.As a result of this deal with Coca-Cola, Monster is becoming a \"pure play\" in the energy drink beverage market, and the company can solely focus its efforts on energy drinks. Most notably, perhaps, is that this immediately extends Monster's global presence by taking on Coca-Cola's energy drink brands such as Burn, Relentless, and Mother. In fact, more than 50% of Coca-Cola's energy drink sales come from outside North America. The incoming Coke brands will more than double Monster's market presence in several international geographies.Sources: Monster and Coca-ColaIn sum, Monster is diversifying its base of brands while expanding its global reach in the energy drink market. These are exactly the trends we want to see as patient investors. Beyond the equity investment and business transfers, additional pieces of this agreement sweeten the deal:Having Coca-Cola as a long-term strategic partner and stakeholder significantly strengthens Monster's global competitive advantage. \"We expect the transaction to significantly accelerate our growth and results of operations internationally,\" Monster CFO Hilson Schlosberg said.Assuming the agreement goes through (it is expected to close by the end of 2014 or early 2015), in the short term, Monster will focus on integrating the Coke brands into its business and do a country-by-country evaluation to determine where to prioritize expansion efforts. Monster's balance sheet -- which was already stellar before this agreement with $827 million in cash and no debt -- will have well more than $2 billion in cash once the deal is closed. This should be more than enough capital for Monster to integrate the new brands, continue investing in product development, and further expand around the world.Looking long term, there are still massive markets that Monster has yet to tackle, namely China. Monster CEO Rodney Sacks said he wants to enter the Chinese market in the next five to 10 years. Sacks and Schlosberg have both been with Monster since 1990 and have done a marvelous job growing then-Hansen from a small beverage player into a global juggernaut with the Monster brand. With these two still chugging away and as passionate as ever -- now backed by the resources and global distribution channels of Coca-Cola -- this agreement with Coca-Cola symbolizes the beginning of Monster's global growth story.

In particular, I wanted to find the rare companies that are operating with zero debt. To me, these are the companies to be celebrated; these are the great stocks to buy.I\u2019ve never ; especially when companies pile on debt, albeit at wonderfully low rates of interest, in order to do so. Share repurchases are supposed to be the capital allocation lever of last resort. In recent years they\u2019ve become the first choice., there are only 23 S&P 500 companies with zero debt. Of that selection, I think three of them are great stocks to buy. Let\u2019s dig into the numbers to find out why.In August, Monster Beverage (MNST) got into bed with Coca-Cola () in an effort to boost its growth overseas.  of Monster as part of the deal. The non-cash side of things has Coke transferring its energy drink business to Monster, and in return Monster will give Coke its non-energy drink business which includes sodas, teas, and lemonade.Coca-Cola made the deal as a way to hedge its bet on the energy drink business. If things work out, KO will likely buy out the rest of Monster at some point in the future. If it doesn\u2019t, Coke caps its energy drink investment at $2 billion plus whatever they\u2019d spent to date developing Full Throttle, etc. That\u2019s a wise use of its capital.Monster did the deal to gain access to Coca-Cola\u2019s global distribution network. If it wants to compete with Red Bull on an international basis, not just in the U.S., it needs shelf space on every continent. Coke gives it that and more. While it\u2019s unfortunate that Monster was forced into the arms of Big Red, this deal is as win/win as any I\u2019ve seen come down the M&A pike in many years, a big reason why it\u2019s one of my three great stocks to buy.As great stocks go MNST is one the best. A $10,000 investment in MNST in 2003 is worth $616,000 today; the same $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 is worth just $22,000. The last decade has been very good to .But that\u2019s the past.In its , its non-energy drink business generated just 5% of overall revenue and less than 1% of contribution margin, a metric used by Monster to indicate profitability. Clearly its focus is on the energy drinks. These other products now have a home where they will be better supported and quite possibly even thrive. Getting rid of this distraction despite it being a hard choice (non-energy drinks are the original foundation of its business) was the only way to go.International sales hit 23% in Q2. That doesn\u2019t seem bad until you consider that Red Bull  outside the U.S. and still manages to outsell Monster on Monster\u2019s own home turf. That\u2019s embarrassing, but totally fixable.With Coke involved, I could see international sales above 50% within 3-5 years. The only fly in the ointment, something Red Bull and its other competitors also face, is the . It\u2019s a wildcard for sure, but it\u2019s the only thing keeping MNST stock from another decade of strong returns.When it comes to great stocks to buy, this is one of the best.My second choice of great stocks to buy is especially appropriate at the moment because it\u2019s going through a lull, . I\u2019m talking about Tractor Supply (TSCO), the Tennessee-based retailer that sells everything for the gentleman farmer. Its combination of goods isn\u2019t found in too many places, which keeps Walmart () and other big-box chains from capturing its market. for a number of reasons, including very soft same-store sales growth at 1.9% year-over-year \u2014 530 basis points worse than in 2013. TSCO management saw unusual weakness in the first half of the quarter, but the second half was exactly as expected. I\u2019d consider this nothing more than a blip that happens from time to time.TSCO is one of the most consistent retailers I know. , it has increased revenues every year and operating income in all but one. With more than 1300 stores in 48 states, it has delivered 25 consecutive quarters of comparable transaction count. In other words, traffic\u2019s not letting up, and customers continue to buy more. Sometimes, however, life just gets in the way.As long as TSCO continues to open 100 or more stores each year, (they aren\u2019t in Canada but that\u2019s another story) and these stores perform as expected, I see no reason why its stock can\u2019t average . The company is that well-run, making TSCO stock a great choice for your portfolio.When I think of S&P 500 companies, I immediately think of smokestacks and manufacturing plants. But then I remember companies like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), the fast-casual concept that has taken America by storm. I don\u2019t why, but being able to get a beer and burrito quickly at a moderate price is one of life\u2019s simple joys.Steve Ells found a concept that resonated with customers, and he ran with it all the way to the end zone. America was built by people with good ideas, and Chipotle definitely is one of them. Sure, it\u2019s just a restaurant, but it\u2019s one that has been giving Yum Brands () fits ever since McDonald\u2019s ()  when the nascent brand had just 14 stores open after five years in business. By the time McDonald\u2019s spun-off its 90% interest in Chipotle in 2006, CMG had 460 locations scattered across the country. I\u2019m sure not a day goes by when the Golden Arches doesn\u2019t regret cutting CMG loose.CMG\u2019s . Revenues grew 28.6% on the strength of its comps and 45 store openings, and net income grew 25.5%. Its comps are , a great position for any restaurant chain to be in.At 21 years, old Chipotle it\u2019s just getting going. Don\u2019t fear the $600-plus stock price, because in a couple of years you\u2019ll be worrying about the $1,200 stock price \u2014 and so on. When it comes to great stocks to buy with no debt (and almost $800 million in cash), CMG has to be at the top of any list.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) saw a big move last session, as the company's shares fell by more than 5% on the day.

The news sent both stocks higher last week, with Monster climbing more than 30% to trade around $93 a share on Friday. While the deal creates a unique opportunity for both Coca-Cola and Monster, it also comes with some added risk. Let's take a closer look to uncover the good, the bad, and the ugly of the soda giant's latest transaction.Source: The Motley Fool. Faced with slowing sales of soda in the U.S., Coke is looking to fast-growing beverage categories such as single-serve and energy libations for future growth. The energy drink market reportedly grew 4% in 2013, compared to a 3% decline in carbonated beverage sales over the same period, according to an article in Adweek..Therefore, what better way to spark growth than by taking a stake in Monster, which, according to Euromonitor data compiled by  , currently controls roughly 35% of the $9 billion U.S. energy drink market? Under the terms of the agreement, Coke will have the option to increase its stake to 25% over the next four years.Of course, Monster also stands to benefit from the deal. If there is one thing that Monster lacks it is international exposure -- something that Coke has an abundance of. In fact, Monster currently generates less than 25% of its sales outside of the United States, according to  . However, the company could nearly double its sales going forward with access to Coke's massive global distribution network, according to the  which cites research firm Sanford C. Bernstein. .The global energy drink market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of roughly 13.38% between 2013 and 2018, according to data from Research and Markets cited by Reuters. For comparison, the global soft drink market is expected to grow just 4.3% between 2012 and 2017, according to research from Data Monitor. Going forward, Monster could leverage Coke's massive distribution network to expand its market share worldwide in this fast-growing beverage category. Coca-Cola, after all, boasts the world's largest beverage distribution system, which reaches customers in more than 200 countries today. Additionally, Coke sold a record 28.2 billion unit cases of its beverages last year through this distribution network .As part of the deal, Coke will put its energy drink brands including Full Throttle under Monster's control, whereas Monster will give its non-energy segment drinks such as Hansen's Natural Sodas to Coca-Cola.Given its strong balance sheet, Coke could have easily purchased Monster Beverage outright. However, the ugly truth is that doing so would have made Coke significantly more vulnerable to Monster's controversial products. The move also shields Coca-Cola's warm and fuzzy polar-bear-adorned brand image from being tarnished by Monster's brash branding.Energy drinks have come under heavy scrutiny in recent years because of health concerns. The Food and Drug Administration launched an  in 2012 looking into five deaths that were reportedly linked to Monster Beverage. The FDA later said it found no problems with two primary additives, taurine and guarana, found in Monster drinks. However, the FDA said it has not reached any final decisions and is still investigating the health risks of energy drinks. This could lead to increased regulations on the sale of energy drinks down the road.Yet, by simply owning a stake in Monster Beverage, Coke is able to take on less risk in this controversial drink category. The important distinction here is that Coke will now be distributing energy drinks but won't actually own them. Moreover, this arrangement gives Coke an opportunity to accelerate growth in the $9 billion domestic energy drink market without taking on all of the risk. \"The Coca-Cola Company will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally and Monster will become the Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play,\" according to a company press release.This strategy has worked well for Coca-Cola lately. If you remember, the king of pop also took baby steps when investing in Honest Tea and later Zico coconut water. Coke took a 40% stake in Honest Tea in 2008 before buying the remaining stake in 2011. The company followed a similar path with its calculated buyout of Zico in 2012.Ultimately, taking a small stake in Monster with the option of adding to that position in the future is Coke's safest bet given the dark side of energy drink perception in the U.S. today.Apple recently recruited a secret-development \"dream team\" to guarantee its newest smart device was kept hidden from the public for as long as possible.

In addition, Coca Cola will transfer the ownership of its global energy drinks business, which includes brands like Relentless and Burn, to Monster Beverage making the latter Coca-Cola's exclusive energy play. Coca-Cola will also get to nominate two directors on Monster Beverage's board.In return, Monster Beverage will transfer its non-energy portfolio, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coca-Cola.

Gaining a share of the energy market seems a wise decision by Coca-Cola considering that the energy drinks category is doing better than other beverages. In fact, energy drinks was the only category in the broader liquid refreshment beverages (LRB) sector that saw positive growth last year.The companies have reportedly been in talks over Monster's takeover by Coca-Cola. However, analysts commented that taking a stake in Monster was a better decision than a full acquisition as it will allow Coca-Cola to benefit from the energy drinks market without having to handle the controversial category. Energy drinks face significant regulatory headwinds due to concerns about their potential health effects.This deal - the second major partnership by Coca-Cola this year - clearly shows that the maker of Coke, Diet Coke and Sprite is striving to diversify its portfolio beyond carbonated soft drinks which are likely to remain under pressure due to growing health and wellness consciousness.In February this year, Coca-Cola bought 10% stake in Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.

Under the deal, Keurig Green Mountain will exclusively make Coca-Cola branded single-serve pods for use on its upcoming Keurig Cold at-home beverage system that will make cold beverages. The deal opens up an exciting new packaging format for the Coca-Cola brand.As regards Monster Beverage, the deal will provide it full access to Coca-Cola's world-class global distribution network. In addition, the company will benefit from the addition of Coca-Cola's energy brands and become a pure energy company. The deal should also significantly expand Monster's presence in the international energy drinks market where it currently has a limited presence. Most importantly, Monster Beverage's cash position should get a major boost from the deal.Both Coca-Cola and Monster Beverage carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Nominal PPI for June was left unrevised at +0.4%, while the core was lowered to +0.1% from +0.2% initially.The Empire State manufacturing index fell back to 14.69 in August from a four-year high of 25.60 in June, missing forecasts for a more modest decline to 20.0. The futures index, however, rose to 46.8, a 2.5-year high, from 28.8 the month prior.In corporate news, Coke (  ) is buying a 17% stake in Monster Beverage (  ) for $2.15 billion, Applied Materials (  ) and Autodesk (  ) both beat earnings expectations, helping Nasdaq futures outperform, while better-than-expected earnings for JCPenney (  ) should underpin the retail sector.Global equities were all higher as well in reaction to encouraging news from Iraq following al-Maliki's decision to step-down as Iraq Prime Minister, and continued calm in Ukraine where Russia appears to be honoring its commitment to assist in humanitarian aid.-Dow Jones Industrial up 0.28%-S&P 500 futures up 0.22%-Nasdaq 100 futures up 0.33%SENTIMENTNikkei up 0.02%Hang Seng up 0.62%Shanghai Composite up 0.92%FTSE-100 up 0.71%DAX-30 up 0.87%PRE-MARKET SECTOR WATCH(+) Large cap tech: higher(+) Chip stocks: higher(+) Software stocks: higher(+) Hardware stocks: higher(+/-) Internet stocks: mixed(+/-) Drug stocks: mixed(+) Financial stocks: higher(+) Retail stocks: higher(+-) Industrial stocks: higher(+) Airlines: higher(+) Autos higherUPSIDE MOVERS:(+) MNST (+26.31%) Coca-Cola (  ) pays $$2.15 billion for 16.7% stake(+) ACHN (+18.13%) Results show 100% of patients HCV RNA undetectable at four weeks(+) AMAT(+4.73%) Just misses Q3 sales estimate but EPS tops by a penny and outlook in lineDOWNSIDE MOVERS:(-) NQ (-14.20%) CFO KB Teo Resigns(-) JWN (-3.55%) Trunk club acquisition will dilute FY14 EPS by 3%-5%The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hares of  (  ) soared more than 30% on Aug 15, reflecting investors' confidence in its Aug 14 deal with  (  ), which includes the sale of an equity stake and swapping of some brands with the cola giant.Under the long-term strategic deal, Coca-Cola will acquire approximately 16.7% equity stake in the energy drink maker for $2.15 billion in cash. In addition, Coca Cola will transfer the ownership of its global energy drinks business, which includes brands like Relentless and Burn, to Monster Beverage making the latter Coca-Cola's exclusive energy play. Coca-Cola will also get to nominate two directors on Monster Beverage's board.In return, Monster Beverage will transfer its non-energy portfolio, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coca-Cola. Finally, Coca-Cola will become the former's preferred global distribution partner and expand its current distribution relationship with the company in North America to include additional territories.The transaction, expected to close later this year or early the next, is awaiting regulatory and customary approvals.We believe it is a win-win deal for both the companies. Gaining a share of the energy market seems a wise decision by Coca-Cola considering that the energy drinks category is doing better than other beverages. In fact, energy drinks was the only category in the broader liquid refreshment beverages (LRB) sector that saw positive growth last year.The companies have reportedly been in talks over Monster's takeover by Coca-Cola. However, analysts commented that taking a stake in Monster was a better decision than a full acquisition as it will allow Coca-Cola to benefit from the energy drinks market without having to handle the controversial category.

Still, it can be useful to keep an eye on what smart folks are doing. 13F forms can be great places to find  .For example, a glance at the latest quarterly 13F filing from Bridgewater Associates shows that its largest new position, and its 27th-largest holding, is  .Bridgewater Associates is one of the world's largest hedge fund companies -- and in 2010 and 2011 it ran the best-performing hedge fund as well. Bridgewater was founded by Ray Dalio, who in making his investment decisions focuses on macroeconomic factors such as inflation, currency exchange rates, and GDP growth. He's clearly skilled, as Bridgewater's $13.3 billion portfolioattests.Let's look at some reasons why Bridgewater might like Coca-Cola -- and why you might want to consider it for your portfolio. For starters, there's a reliable dividend that has been paid each quarter for 94 years and has been raised each year for the past 50 years. The yield was recently 2.9%, and it has been increased at an average annual rate of 8% over the past five years .The company boasts 17 brands that each generate more than $1 billion in sales annually. These include Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, Powerade, Minute Maid, Simply, Georgia, and Del Valle. Its beverage distribution network is the world's largest, with sales in 200 countries and territories and more than 1.9 billion servings distributed daily. That network is a powerful competitive advantage.Coca-Cola has grown into a massive company, but room for  remains, especially in developing markets, where a growing middle class is likely to consume more and more beverages. For example, my colleague Ted Cooper has  that \"Brazil's per capita consumption has grown at 5.5% per year over the last 20 years and shows no sign of slowing down.\"In recent news, Coca-Cola agreed to spend $2.15 billion for a 16.7% stake in energy drink giant  . That's  not only because of the eye-popping price tag -- and not only because it adds to Coke's involvement in the fast-growing realm of energy drinks -- but because the deal has the companies swapping some drinks. Monster will take over Coke's energy drinks (think NOS and Full Throttle), while Coke will take over Monster's non-energy drinks, such as Hansen's Natural sodas, Peace teas, and Hubert's Lemonade. That makes Monster a pure play focused solely on energy drinks, while Coke gains new brands for its powerful marketing team to sell.This isn't Coke's only significant deal, either. It owns a  in  and has bought many brands in recent years, such as Honest Tea. Growth by acquisition is a reasonable strategy for Coca-Cola, which can use its deep pockets and massive distribution network to wring more value from new brands.Warren Buffett is comfortable owning a big chunk of Coca-Cola because he has little doubt that years from now, the company will still be selling billions of servings of beverages around the globe. Still, the company faces some challenges. For one thing, it's hard for a company of its size (market capitalization: $180 billion) to grow briskly. Next, it lacks the diversification of rival  , which boasts a massive lineup of snacks.Perhaps most importantly, the beverage landscape has shifted in recent years, with sodas losing share to drinks such as waters, tea, and energy drinks. Domestically, Coca-Cola's sales volume has been  recently (though international numbers have been better). Sales of diet sodas have also dropped due to consumer concerns about sweetener safety. The company has addressed this, in part, by introducing \"  ,\" sweetened with stevia. It's also seeing solid growth among its nonsoda offerings.Overall, investors at Bridgewater see more to like than to worry about at Coca-Cola, and they have loaded up on the stock. Given its mammoth brands, reliable dividends, deep pockets, and growth prospects, the company is well worth considering for your portfolio, too. The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their non-dividend-paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute. They also know that a well-constructed dividend portfolio creates wealth steadily, while still allowing you to sleep like a baby. Knowing how valuable such a portfolio might be, our top analysts put together a  that should be in any income investor's portfolio.

In addition, revenues continued to be eroded by cannibalization of sales of existing brands like Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb by new products such as Ultra and Muscle Monster products.However, net sales rose 8.9% year over year driven by higher sales of new products like Ultra and Monster Original Green energy drink. Some of the brands that did well in the quarter include Java Monster, strawberry and peanut butter cup Muscle Monster energy drinks and Peace Tea Line.Net sales of the Direct Store Delivery (DSD) segment increased 9.8% to $660.1 million due to higher sales volumes of Monster Energy drinks.Net sales of the Warehouse segment decreased 9.5% to $27.1 million due to lower sales of Hubert's Lemonades.Gross sales outside the U.S. increased 12.3% year over year to $180.2 million in the quarter. The company witnessed a 14.6% increase in sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Second-quarter 2014 gross margin rose 190 basis points (bps) to 55.2% attributable to a decrease in cost of goods, particularly sweetener, increased sale of the Ultra line and a decline in allowances.Operating income increased 20.3% to $215.8 million owing to higher operating profit from international operations such as the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Operating margin was 31.4%, up 300 bps year over year, on the back of solid revenue, partially offset by higher professional service cost.Monster Beverage has been involved in several controversies. The Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating the impact of caffeine in food and dietary supplements, which includes Monster Beverage's products. All these regulatory and litigation issues are increasing the company's professional service cost. Monster Beverage's legal expenses during the quarter were $7.9 million, up from $5.0 million in the prior quarter.As a percentage of revenue, distribution costs decreased 10 bps to 4.4% while selling expenses declined 110 bps to 10.5%. The company benefited from a decline in premiums, point of sale and other marketing expenses.Effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.7%, lower than 39.3% in the prior-year quarter, owing to profits earned in foreign subsidiaries.The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $373.1 million as of Jun 30, 2014, compared with $312.0 million as of Mar 31, 2014. During the second quarter of 2014, the company did not repurchase any shares under its existing share repurchase program.Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the consumer goods industry include The WhiteWave Foods Company (  ), Pepsico, Inc.

Last quarter, it posted a positive surprise of 12.2%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Though the carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has remained weak in 2013, the energy drink market has shown some positive momentum. However, Monster Beverage Corporation has been facing several headwinds for the past few quarters, which is hurting its profits.Monster Beverage has been involved in several controversies. The Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating the impact of caffeine in food and dietary supplements, which includes Monster Beverage products. All these regulatory and litigation issues are increasing Monster Beverage's professional service expenses, which are eroding its margins. We believe the second quarter profits will also be pulled down by these legal costs.In addition, new Monster Energy branded products like Ultra and Muscle Monster products are cannibalizing sales of the existing brands like Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb. Revenues are also impacted by lower growth rates for the energy category in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, particularly Eastern Europe. Second quarter 2014 results are expected to be impacted by these trends.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Monster Beverage is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.32%. Monster currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies in the consumer staples sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Pinnacle Foods Inc. (  ), Earnings ESP of +3.03% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (  ), Earnings ESP of +2.30% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).SUPERVALU Inc.

This is the last major reporting week of this earnings season, with 65 S&P 500 members reporting results.But plenty of reports are still to come, particularly from small-companies. Using the S&P 600 as the proxy for the small-cap space, we have seen results from 362 of the index's total members or 60.3% of its total membership. While only two sectors for the large-cap index have roughly half of their companies in the still-to-report category (Retail & Consumer Discretionary), we have four sectors in that category in the S&P 600 (Retail, Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Oil/Energy).Any way you look at it, the 2014 Q2 earnings season has been very positive - the growth rates are better, more companies are coming ahead of estimates, and there is even some modest improvement on the guidance front.Guidance still remains weak, with most companies providing guidance guiding lower. But the proportion of companies guiding lower is smaller than what we have been seeing in recent quarters. And even those that don't offer guidance have been qualitatively talking up their business outlook. (  )Total earnings for the 380 S&P 500 members that have reported already are up +9.3% from the same period last year, with a 'beat ratio' of 66.8% and a median surprise of +2.5%. Total revenues are up +4.8%, with a revenue 'beat ratio' of 56.1% and a median surprise of 0.8%.The table below shows the summary scorecardThis is a better performance than what we have seen from this same group of 380 companies reported in recent quarters, as the charts below shows.The beat ratios, particularly on the revenue side, were tracking notably above recent historical levels earlier, though they have come down somewhat in recent days and are now more in-line with what we are used to seeing in recent quarters.Technology results have been the strongest that we have seen in a while, with total earnings for the sector up +14.2% on +7.3% higher revenues. The sector's strong growth numbers notwithstanding, beat ratios remain below the aggregate for the S&P 500, implying that the growth bump was largely expected. The earnings and revenue beat ratios for Technology are tracking below the S&P 500 as well as what we had seen from the sector in other recent quarters.We have opposite situation in the Finance sector, where we don't have much growth, but results still came in better than expected. With results from 87.5% of the Finance sector's Q2 results already out, earnings are up +1.6% on +1.1% revenues. But as the charts below of 'beat ratios' for the sector show, results have been overwhelming surprising to the upside.Stock prices of small-cap stocks have been underwater this year, with the S&P 600 down -4.5% vs. a gain of +5.1% for the S&P 500 in the year-to-date period. This underwhelming stock price performance is getting confirmed by the group's mixed results thus far in the Q2 reporting cycle.As of Friday, August 1, we have seen Q2 results from 362 S&P 600 members or 60.3% of the index's total members. Total earnings for these 362 companies are up +16.6% from the same period last year on +9.2% higher revenues, with 51.4% beating EPS estimates and 38.1% coming ahead of top-line expectations.In terms of comparison to other recent quarters, the earnings growth is better than what we have seen from the same group of 362 small-cap companies in 2014 Q1 as well as the average growth rate of the last four quarters. But the earnings beat ratio is in-line with what the same group has performed over that same period. The top-line performance presents a mixed picture, with the growth rate modestly better while the beat ratios tracking lower.A word about the beat ratios for the small-cap stocks may be in order. While roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 companies beat EPS estimates on average, the ratio is a lot lower for the small-cap index, with about 50% of the S&P 600 companies beating earnings estimates.Here is the updated Q2 scorecard for the S&P 600 indexThe composite (or blended) growth picture for Q2, combining the actual results for the 380 S&P 500 companies that have reported with estimates for the 120 still-to-come reports, shows total earnings increasing by +7.8% on +3.7% higher revenues and modestly higher net margins. This would follow earnings growth of +1.4% in Q1 on +0.7% higher revenues. The Q2 earnings growth rate has been steadily going up, as more companies report and beat estimates.The table below compares what is expected for Q2 with what was actually achieved in Q1.Total earnings in Q2 are on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record, surpassing the last record set in 2013 Q4. The chart below shows these quarterly earnings totals, with estimates for the coming quarters all in the record territory.As discussed in this report, the earnings results thus far represent a notable improvement over what we have become accustomed to seeing in recent quarters. But is it a one-off bounce from the low levels in Q1 or the start of something sustainable and enduring?The ongoing revisions trend in estimates for the current period appears to be indicating that this favorable trend can be sustained. We will see how the revisions trend unfolds through the remainder of this reporting cycle, but estimates for 2014 Q3 have held up very well thus far - better than what we have seen over comparable periods in other recent quarters.For a detailed look at the earnings picture, please check out our weekly  .Want more articles from this author?

In his book, he somewhat famously said that one of the things that led him to one of his most successful investments -- undergarment manufacturer Hanes -- was his wife's affinity for the company's new pantyhose.But while focusing on \"what you know\" can be a helpful starting point, it's far from the be-all and end-all of investing. In fact, in the revised version of One Up on Wall Street, Lynch said many had misinterpreted his advice.\"Peter Lynch doesn't advise you to buy stock in your favorite store just because you like shopping in the store,\" he wrote, \"nor should you buy stock in a manufacturer because it makes your favorite product or a restaurant because you like the food.\" These are merely good starting points, he said.His bottom line: \"Never invest in any company before you've done the homework on the company's earnings prospects, financial condition, competitive position, plans for expansion, and so forth.\"I couldn't agree more. With that in mind, I thought it would be interesting to highlight some firms with popular products or services that are also fundamentally and financially sound. Each of these gets approval from one of my Guru Strategies -- investment models based on the approaches of history's best investors (including Lynch). The clothing retailer isn't the hot stock it once was, but its apparel remains quite popular. Gap has grown earnings at a 14.5% clip over the long term (I use an average of the three-, four-, and five-year growth rates to determine a long-term rate), part of why my Lynch-based model is high on the $18-billion-market-cap retailer. Its moderate growth rate and high ($16 billion) annual sales make it a steady \"stalwart\" according to the Lynch approach. To find stocks selling on the cheap, Lynch famously used the P/E-to-Growth ratio, adjusting the \"growth\" portion of the equation to include yield for stalwarts, since they often pay solid dividends; yield-adjusted P/E/Gs below 1.0 are signs of value. When we divide Gap's 16 P/E by the sum of its growth rate and yield (2.1%), we get a yield-adjusted P/E/G of 0.96 -- a good sign. While its shares are no longer skyrocketing as they were a few years back, the popularity of iPads, iPhones, and all sorts of Mac computers is undeniable. And while growth has slowed (how could it not), my Lynch-inspired model thinks the stock is still a buy. It likes Apple's 15.6 price/earnings ratio and 42% long-term growth rate , which make for a 0.38 P/E/G ratio. (Growth could be significantly slower going forward and it would be a good buy at this price.) Another reason the model likes Apple: the company's very reasonable 14% debt/equity ratio. This California-based firm makes energy drinks and alternative beverages under such names as Monster Energy, Java Monster, X-Presso Monster, M-3, Worx Energy and Hansen's natural sodas and juices. It gets a 100% score from my Warren Buffett-based model, thanks in part to its having upped EPS in all but one year of the past decade. The model also likes that it's averaged a 34% return on equity over the past decade, and has no long-term debt. Ads from this Bermuda-based parent of the Kay and Jared jewelry chains seem to be everywhere these days as the firm continues to post strong growth. With a long-term growth rate of 25.3% and a 23.8 P/E, Signet has a 0.94 PEG ratio, a big reason why the Lynch approach likes it. In addition, Signet has a debt/equity ratio under 1%, showing the kind of conservative financing this model likes to see. Founded in 1982, this Minnesota-based restaurant/bar chain seems to be surging in popularity. It has over 1,000 locations across all 50 states in the United States, as well as in Canada and Mexico. It's been expanding rapidly and has plans for even more growth.The stock gets strong interest from my Martin Zweig-based strategy, thanks in part to its strong, accelerating growth. EPS grew 71% last quarter, up from an average of 41% in the previous three quarters, which was up from 22% long term. The Zweig model also likes that sales growth -- not one-time factors -- has driven earnings growth over the long term (25% long term sales growth rate, using an average of the 3-, 4- and 5-year sales growth rates). And it likes that the firm's debt/equity ratio of just 7% is far below the restaurant industry average of 158%.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Certainly, there will be smiling faces as GoPro () opens for trading tomorrow.Maker of the versatile, go-anywhere camera, GoPro priced its 17.8 million share offering at $24, at the high end of the expected $21 to $24 range.Because it priced near the high end of the range, with 123.1 million outstanding shares, the company will kick off trading with a value just shy of $3 billion.With $985.1 million in revenue for the year ending 2013, GoPro would find be valued at nearly 3x sales, in-line with mammoth companies like Procter & Gamble ().

Last quarter, it reported a negative surprise of 2.22%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Monster Beverage has been consistently missing earnings estimates for the past seven quarters due to headwinds from higher professional costs, currency headwinds, and increased tax rates.Due to growing health and wellness consciousness the carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has now declined for the ninth straight year. The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers with lower volumes and weakening sales.Recently the diet versions have begun to struggle with consumers being increasingly aware of diet sweeteners. However, the energy drink market has been gaining momentum, increasing at a high single digit in the fourth quarter 2013.Some of its new products such as Monster Ultra Blur energy drinks, the new Muscle Monster line, tea plus pink lemonade and the energy Monster Rehab line are performing better than expected. In fact, the company introduced several new products throughout 2013 and has a lineup of products for 2014. However, these new products have been cannibalizing sales of its older brands such as Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb, for the past few quarters, a trend which is expected to continue in the upcoming quarters.The company has been facing several controversies of late. There has been much speculation on whether its energy drinks are suitable for consumption especially by children and adolescents. The Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating the impact of caffeine in food and dietary supplements, which includes Monster Beverage products. The report is pending.In addition, the company is incurring higher professional service costs due to these regulatory and litigation issues. Any undesirable changes in regulations will impact the company's operations and demand for its products. Moreover, the pace of overall economic recovery is relatively slow. The consumer environment in the U.S. continues to be challenging despite moderate recovery.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Monster Beverage is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is -4.08%. We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies in the consumer staples sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +1.72% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Excluding currency translations, revenues declined 2.5% due to decline in volumes.Volumes plummeted 1.5% in the quarter, as against 2.5% growth in the preceding quarter, mainly due to a decline in volumes in Great Britain. A combination of operating strategies including disciplined pricing under competitive conditions, the transition in packaging from 2-liter PET bottles to 1.75-liter PET bottles and wet weather conditions, led to a 9% decline in volumes in Great Britain.

The sales growth rate of this region in the quarter was however lower than 9.3% in the prior year quarter due to weakness in the energy category in the region.First-quarter 2014 gross margin rose 140 basis points (bps) to 53.5% due to a decrease in cost of goods sold and a decline in allowances.

However, core earnings exclude a 2-cent gain from the sale of assets in Europe. Including the gain, earnings stood at 83 cents, up 7% year over year driven by strong organic revenue gains and solid margins. Currency hurt the fourth-quarter earnings by 3.0%, significantly lower than management's expectations of 6%. In constant currency terms, adjusted earnings grew 10%.Despite difficult consumer spending environment, lower-than-expected currency headwinds, aggressive marketplace investments, better execution, lower taxes and productivity gains boosted profits in the quarter.Core earnings exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment charges and mark-to-market gains. Including these factors, reported earnings per share were 79 cents, up 15.0% year over year.Total sales in the quarter were flat year over year at $12.62 billion. However, structural changes, mainly beverage re-franchising transaction in Vietnam, pulled down revenues by 0.5% in line with management's expectations. Foreign exchange hurt revenue growth by 3.0%, lower than management's expectation of 4%. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.47 billion by 1.2%.Excluding these factors, revenues increased 4.0% on an organic basis. Better volumes, strong snacks performance, improvement in Europe and sales gain in developing/emerging market offset a softer American beverage performance and weakness in Mexico.PepsiCo witnessed an effective net pricing gain of 3% in the quarter, lower than the past three quarters. Volumes increased 1% in the quarter, slightly better than flat growth in the last quarter.While organic snacks volumes grew 2%, beverages were flat in the quarter.Organic volume of the American snacks segment increased 1%, slowing down from 3% seen last quarter. While volumes remained strong in the Frito-Lay North America segment, it declined in the Latin American snacks business due to weak revenues in Mexico. Higher food and beverage taxes in Mexico hurt revenues in the quarter. Organic snacks volumes grew 3% in Europe and 4% in developing and emerging markets.As regards beverages, while Pepsi's American and European volumes improved, developing/emerging market volumes declined from the last quarter.Organic beverage volumes increased 3.0% in Europe but declined 1% in developing/emerging countries.In the Americas, beverage volumes remained flat, though improving sequentially. However, while non-carbonated beverages' volume grew in the quarter, carbonated soft drinks (CSD) remained a weak spot due to category headwinds.Last month, Beverage Digest, a leading beverage industry newsletter said that CSD volumes declined 3% in 2013 - the ninth straight year of decline. The CSD category is suffering due to growing health consciousness since consumers have become particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concerns.

Core constant currency operating profit (including gain on sale of European assets) improved 7.0% to $1.87 billion in the quarter. Core operating margins grew 54 bps as organic revenues growth and productivity gains offset headwinds from higher operating and advertising/marketing costs.Management maintained its previously provided outlook for 2014. In 2014, Pepsi expects core constant currency earnings per share to be approximately $4.50, representing an increase of 7% from $4.37 reported in 2013. The target is in line with management's long-term goal of high single-digit core constant currency earnings growth.Excluding headwinds from currency and structural changes, organic revenues are expected to grow in the mid single-digit range, also in line with the long-term targets.Currency is expected to hurt 2014 earnings per share and revenues by 4% and 3%, respectively.Commodity inflation is expected in the low single-digit range in 2014. Productivity savings are expected to amount to $1 billion in 2014, which will be used to offset headwinds from cost inflation and thereafter, reinvest in the business. The core tax rate is expected to be approximately 25% for 2014, slightly lower than the 2013 level.

Net sales of $540.9 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6% and rose 14.7% year over year on the back of a robust increase in sales in international markets and successful launch of new products in the U.S.The company has been incurring significant foreign currency transaction losses due to unfavorable currency translations especially in Japan, Australia and South Africa.

The CSD category declined for the ninth straight year in 2013 due to growing health consciousness since consumers have become particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concerns.

Earnings grew 5% year over year on a constant currency basis as positive price/mix gains, strong developing market volumes and cost control made up for higher marketing costs.In the quarter, net revenue declined 4% year over year to $10.58 billion due to headwinds from currency and structural changes. However, revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.56 billion helped by better pricing and volume growth than previous quarter.Currency and structural changes hurt revenues by 4% and 2%, respectively. Adjusting for the impact of currency and structural changes (primarily bottler merger in Brazil and the sale of 51% stake in the Philippines bottler completed in 2013), constant currency revenues increased 2% in the quarter.

Last month, Beverage Digest, a leading beverage industry newsletter said that CSD volumes declined 3%, the ninth straight year of decline for CSDs.The CSD category is suffering to growing health consciousness since consumers have become particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concerns. Also, possible new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting the CSD sales. These challenges have also been felt by other major soft drink makers -  (  ) and  (  ) - leading to lower volumes and weak sales.Overall, developed market volumes declined 1% as positive growth in Japan and Australia was offset by 4% decline in Europe. European volumes were hurt by a shift in Easter timing from first quarter last year to second quarter this year and weak sparkling beverage volume in Great Britain.In developing/emerging markets, volumes grew 3% as both China and Brazil showed sequential improvement. While strong marketing campaigns around the Chinese New Year improved volumes by 12% in China, activation of the FIFA World Cup, Carnival holiday and better weather conditions led to renewed momentum in the Brazil business. Volumes grew 6% in India and Russia.Among the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, while still beverages showed improvement from the previous quarter, sparkling beverages volumes slowed down.Sparkling beverage volumes declined 1% in the quarter, which compared unfavorably with flat growth in the fourth quarter.

Currency and structural changes were major reasons for this decline. These factors impacted revenues by 2% and 5%, respectively.The major structural changes the company underwent during this period were a bottler merger in Brazil and the sale of 51% stake in Philippines bottling operations. In fact, excluding the impact of these factors, constant currency revenues increased 4% in the quarter.The company's numbers are an indication of the wider issue of slowing beverage sales in the U.S. Coke experienced 1% volume growth in the reported quarter, lower than 2% in the previous quarter. Volumes declined 1% in North America due to softer volume trends of sparkling beverages.Consumer preferences are changing because of greater awareness about health issues such as rising obesity. This is why concerns about the company's future performance prevail. Coke has been unable to match estimates on EBITDA for four out of five quarters. The score is three out of five in case of revenues.The company announced plans to expand its productivity and reinvestment program to generate $1 billion in productivity savings by 2016.

Sales volume declined 4% year over year. Net sales narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48 billion by 1.4%.Volumes were hurt by the difficult operating conditions faced by carbonated soft drinks (CSDs), in North America and a slow consumer spending environment.Changing consumer preferences, increasing health consciousness and rising obesity concerns, possible new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures have tremendously pressurized the CSD category in North America.Adjusted operating income increased 10.2% year over year to $323 million during the quarter.Dr Pepper's sales volume is measured in two ways: 1) sales volume and 2) bottler case sales (BCS) volume. Sales volume represents sales of concentrates and finished beverages sold to bottlers, retailers and distributors. BCS includes the sales of packaged beverages by the company and its bottlers to retailers and independent distributors.Sales volume, as discussed earlier, was down 4% in the quarter as a 4% volume gain in the Latin American segment was offset by a 6% volume decline in Beverage Concentrates and a 2% dip in Packaged Beverages segments.In the quarter, BCS volume declined 2% as CSDs and non-carbonated beverages (NCB) volume dipped 2%.

Segment operating profit declined 1% (excluding currency impact) to $218 million owing to net sales decline. In the Packaged Beverages segment, net sales declined 2% on a currency neutral basis at $1.03 billion. Mix gains were offset by a volume decline of 2%. Segment operating profit declined 18% (excluding currency impact) to $107 million due to volume decline and charges related to withdrawal of a multi employer pension plan. Dr Pepper's net sales from Latin America Beverages increased 9% on a currency neutral basis to $116 million, driven largely by mix gains and volume growth of 4%. Segment operating profit improved 14% (excluding currency) in the quarter to $16 million as sales growth and productivity gains offset increasing commodity, manufacturing and other operating costs.For full-year 2013, Dr Pepper's adjusted earnings per share of $3.20 exceeded the company's expected range of $3.04 to $3.12 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 by 3.6%.

In 2014, the company intends to introduce juice cocktail under the Peace Tea brand. The company will also launch the Punch Monster product line in 2014.However, Monster Beverage like other beverage giants is seeing sluggish sales due to softness in the North American beverage industry.

In addition, revenues continued to be eroded by cannibalization of sales of existing Monster Energy brands. Taking all these factors into account, we maintain our Neutral recommendation on the stock.Headquartered in Corona, CA.

Their fund was up 21.82% this year through Aug. 30. That topped 96% of their large-cap growth rivals, averaging 15.56%, as tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 was up 16.15%.The fund is outperforming 98% of its peers over the past three years and 84% of its peer group over the past five years.Co-manager Greg Dunn, 37 years old, spoke with IBD from his office in Santa Fe, N.M. Your fund has some interesting features. You run a concentrated portfolio. You buy stocks when they're trading at a discount. You can invest in stocks of any size. Tell me what each trait contributes. Concentration lets us focus on our best ideas. We tend to hold 40 to 55 stocks. It varies depending on whether we're finding a lot of opportunities and the risk profile of each investment. We're around 50 now.We consider our price target on each stock a representation of intrinsic value. And we don't own a stock unless we believe there is upside from the current price. So we always buy at a discount.Size flexibility reflects our three-basket structure. Our emerging-growth leaders tend to be more aggressive stocks, smaller and faster growing. They're generally sitting in front of a large opportunity.The second basket, our growth industry leaders, tends to be midcap or large caps. These have leadership positions. They're more mature companies.The third basket holds our consistent growers. They add a little defensive nature to the portfolio. They tend to have a good element of visibility. They often have a subscription model or recurring revenue and good earnings visibility. What sort of an edge do you get from your three-basket tack? The three baskets add diversification. They let us balance risk from more conservative to more aggressive growth stocks. Stocks perform differently in different markets. This lets us aim for good performance throughout investment cycles. How do you divvy your cash among the three baskets? We want about 33% in each. You make bottom-up investment decisions. But sector weights reflect where you tend to look for leaders. Why is software your largest sector currently? There's a lot of innovation and change there. Part of our weighting is exposure to SaaS -- software as a service. It is disruptive to software on the premises. Lower cost. Faster upgrade cycles.Another reason is that we like software companies that have expertise serving a specific vertical niche.Guidewire Software (  ), for example, developed a software platform for property and casualty insurers. The core platform covers policy claims and billing systems. For years the software that insurers used was in-house, antiquated, inflexible and expensive to maintain. Guidewire's works much better. Its value proposition is really strong. And it is addressing a big market, which is bigger than $10 billion. Their share is less than 5%. But they're starting to win big deals that validate them within the industry. So Guidewire's strength is not delivering software via the cloud. They're an exception to that preference. In this case it's their vertical integration that you like? Guidewire is primarily on-premise. Their software enables core business processes that need to be on premise. Yes, they're an exception. With Guidewire, we like how they have developed deep vertical expertise to disrupt an industry that has lacked software innovation for a long time. Financials were one of your strongest sectors in the second quarter. What worked there? We don't own traditional financials like big banks. But we found what we think are interesting growth companies. One isWisdomTree (  ), one of the largest ETF companies. They're benefiting from the flow of assets into passive investment vehicles.We've gotCharles Schwab (  ), which benefits from rising rates because of their money market funds. They've been losing money on their money market funds due to low rates. As rates rise, they can make money there. Rising rates are the biggest swing factor to earnings corporatewide.Schwab brokerage clients have some portion of their assets in cash, in Schwab money market funds. Schwab normally charges a fee on assets. But with rates so low, Schwab has waived the fees. And of course on the banking side if rates go up, Schwab should benefit like any bank.The stock has run up from 14 a share at the end of last year to around 21. So we trimmed around some big moves to get the weight at an appropriate level for us. We still like it. Consumer staples was another successful Q2 sector. What do you like there? We've been underweight in consumer staples. We call them expensive defensives. But we do find some names in that space attractive.Monster Beverage (  ) makes energy drinks. There's a secular trend toward energy drink consumption in the U.S. and around the world. And Monster is a leading player.In consumer discretionary, we likeDollar Tree (  ). They're a value proposition, with a nice assortment of consumable and discount goods with good price points.They have a base of about 4,800 stores, growing close to 10% a year with an opportunity to reach 7,000.They also have a Canadian opportunity, with 160 stores that can go to 1,000.They trade at a similar multiple to their peers, but we feel they're a better company. They have better real estate, merchandise mix, and long-term growth prospects. Health care also helped. Why do you likeGilead Sciences (GILD)? They're a leader in the treatment of HIV. They've grown their share of HIV treatment from 40% in 2004 to 82% last year. And there are still a lot of infected patients who are not being treated, so there's room for patient growth.Now they're moving into the hepatitis C market, which is huge. We think they have the best cure. They're trading at a single-digit P/E multiple. But at their rate of growth, they won't be growing at a single-digit pace. So there's an opportunity to get upside. Energy is a small sector for you, but it was a third good one in Q2. What are some favorite plays? We ownContinental Resources (CLR) andSanchez Energy (SN). Both are shale plays. CommVault Systems (CVLT) is new to the portfolio. What do you see powering the resumption of its uptrend after a wobbly Q2? We had been following it, waiting for an opportunity to get involved. We bought it in June when it had a pullback.Their software provides backup, archive and recovery solutions. We think they're a best-of-breed market share gainer.They've got multiple secular drivers: data growth, the move to the cloud, virtualization, mobility and the bring-your-own-device trend. They let companies reduce costs and risks associated with protecting, recovering and accessing data across an enterprise.In their first-quarter conference call, they were cautious in their outlook, mirroring what a lot of tech companies were saying. We didn't see weakness in their results, but management's tone spooked people a little. Priceline.com (PCLN) is up about 50% this year. You've indicated that you still find it attractive. How so? They're the best in the travel space. They were the first mover in Europe, and that market is still developing.It does not have nearly the penetration of online travel booking as the U.S.The hotel market is more fragmented, and Priceline is doing a better job than competitors at getting hotels onto their platform.They have a first-mover, sustainable advantage there. Stratasys (SSYS) is another newcomer to the portfolio. Why did you trim it shortly after opening your position? We bought it in March. Our trim was mostly to manage position size. It's an emerging-growth, early-sta  that can be expensive and volatile. So we like to keep that sort of position at a reasonable range. But we think the 3D (prototyping) space is interesting, and they're an early pioneer. LinkedIn (LNKD) has more than doubled this year. Did you trim in recent quarters for risk management or concerns over fundamentals? We bought in November when the stock was under pressure. We didn't have any concerns. We were just managing our size. The stock had grown into a bigger weight than we felt was appropriate. We've really liked them since they came public.The thing that's attractive is that they've got the professional network locked down. We don't think there will be multiple professional networks. And we like the way they monetize their recruiter tools. Their talent solutions give employers access to this huge database of passive job seekers at a good price in comparison to using a recruiter. CoStar Group (CSGP) is another relative newcomer. What do you like about this real estate data provider? They offer customers online access to a database of commercial real estate information, which has been researched and verified. That information is very valuable and difficult to replicate.They are able to sell subscriptions to their clients, and they have very high renewal rates. The competitive barriers to entry are high. The business model is very profitable and scalable. And we may be in the early innings of a multiyear recovery in commercial real estate. Portfolio Recovery (PRAA) is another name you've been trimming. Due to fundamentals or due to weight management? They've had a great performance, so the weight got bigger than what we think is appropriate. We continue to like them.This stock can be controversial because it is debt collection business. They buy defaulted credit card portfolios at pennies on the dollar, then they try to collect. But they are the best operator in this business. Hedge funds and speculators used to bid on credit card receivables, then sell the portfolios to collection agencies. But many of those other buyershave left the market. So prices for defaulted portfolios are more attractive. You've been trimmingSVB Financial Group (SIVB). Another example of risk control, or are you concerned about fundamentals? This is the same story. It's been a strong stock, so we've been trimming to get back to an appropriate weight.Silicon Valley Bank specializes in serving start-up and technology companies. They are also one of the few banks that benefits from higher interest rates. The majority of their loan book is floating rate and will benefit as rates move higher. And their net interest margin has been compressed by low interest rates.Much of their deposits are in noninterest bearing checking accounts, so their cost of funding did not drop as rates declined, while their average loan rate did drop. We expect this to reverse. Your 50-stock portfolio size is close to the 55-stock ceiling of your range. Have cash flows been above normal? And if they have, are you doing anything special to manage the inflow? Cash flow has been modestly positive. No portfolio management challenges. Positive cash flows allow us to proactively manage position sizes. How do you and co-manager Tim Cunningham divvy up buy and sell decisions? Are you both generalists or do you each specialize in certain industries? Tim and I make all the buy and sell decisions together. Everyone on the team is working as a global generalist.

Therefore, they argue, it is best not to even try. Investors should simply invest in index funds and forget about it.At first glance, this would appear logical because in truth their statistics are true and valid. On a total return basis, the vast majority of investor funds that are professionally managed do in fact underperform the S&P 500 on a total return basis. However, with this article I intend to illustrate that there is a significant flaw with this line of reasoning.However, before I delve too deeply into discussing the great flaw, I would like to comment briefly on a few extenuating reasons why many actively managed accounts might underperform. For brevity's sake, I am not going to try to list all the extenuating circumstances, for that would be the thesis for a separate article. In other words, a comprehensive discussion would be too extensive, and not the true focus of what I intend to offer with this article.Some of the most prominent reasons for failure to outperform are management fees and costs, over-diversification, restrictions imposed by investment policy statements, and perhaps the biggest factor - being victims of their own success. The first couple of reasons are self-explanatory, therefore, I will limit my focus to the last reason I presented.For example, a small and newly created mutual fund might put together an extraordinary track record over its first few years of existence. This extraordinary record could be a function of both its small size, and perhaps the fact that it was created during an attractive market environment. In other words, it was created at a time when stock valuations (prices) were low.However, assuming they do in fact create a great record, that will often attract significant amounts of new money. But it is quite possible, and perhaps even quite common, that their greatest inflows will come during a time when the market environment has become unfavorable. In other words, they get a bucket load of money at precisely a time when it's difficult for them to invest it at attractive valuations. However, invest it they must. Consequently, future performance will suffer as a result.In contrast, if a mutual fund produces a poor track record over a certain period of time, it will often suffer extensive liquidations. These liquidations are then theoretically occurring at precisely a time when their better judgment would suggest buying stocks over selling them. In other words, they are forced to sell undervalued selections instead of the more prudent strategy of buying or at least holding on. I could go on, but I hope the reader gets the point. Active managers face numerous extenuating circumstances that the \"market\" is spared.I want to be clear that I am not attempting to justify underperformance. Instead, I am simply attempting to illustrate a few prominent reasons why it happens. Moreover, what follows will deal with what I consider to be a more important concept which I will frame in the form of a question.  My answer is emphatically no, and my reasons represent the main thesis behind this article.I did not title this article as I did to be provocative. Instead, I believe the title puts a spotlight on the importance of how I believe portfolios should be properly designed and constructed. Rather than worrying about beating the market, I believe that portfolios should be designed based on the individual investor's specific goals, objectives and risk tolerances.With that said, I am also suggesting that an S&P 500 index fund may be a completely inappropriate investment choice for certain investors. There are numerous reasons why I believe this to be true. However, my primary reason is because the S&P 500 index may fail to meet a specific investor's goals, objectives and risk tolerances on many fronts. I will elaborate more on this important point later in the article. But first, allow me to present a 20-year  of the S&P 500 index with performance to establish a benchmark that I will later utilize to support my thesis.I chose the following 20 calendar year Earnings and Price Correlated graph of the S&P 500 for several reasons. First of all, the 20-year graph represents the full extent of the data available. Second, it also represents a starting period when the S&P 500 was reasonably within a range of its earnings justified fair valuation. Therefore, as I will show in a moment, long-term performance will closely correlate with earnings growth as price follows earnings over the long run. Moreover, the graph also vividly reveals periods in time when the S&P 500 became overvalued with price deviating from the orange line. But regardless of the time frame I used, the most important metric I want to establish is the S&P 500's current dividend yield of 1.8% (red circle). This will be a focal point of this article as I proceed.For those sticklers for detail, I also include the following graph plotting the historical year-end P/E ratio of the S&P 500 over this 20 calendar year time frame. Note that the beginning P/E ratio of the S&P 500 was 17.6. This would indicate that it was in fact modestly overvalued based on my fair value calculation of a P/E of 15. In other words, the S&P 500 was, based on my standards, moderately overvalued at the beginning of 1994, but only modestly so. In other words, the S&P 500 was not overvalued enough to invalidate my thesis.The following 20 calendar year performance over this time frame is presented below (Note: The precise dates of this performance measurement are from December 31, 1993 to the S&P 500's close on October 16, 2013). Furthermore, the following performance report separates total return into its two components. The capital appreciation component of 6.7% per annum correlates closely to the 7.1% earnings growth rate, adjusted for the modest premium valuation mentioned above.But the most important metric, and the second component of total return, that I would like the reader to focus on is the dividend income stream that the S&P 500 produced. Not only will this represent an income benchmark, it also simultaneously illustrates why I contend that the S&P 500 may not be an appropriate choice for certain types of investors. However, not providing enough current yield may not be the only reason that an S&P 500 index fund may be inappropriate for retirees in need of income. There are also the issues of inappropriate levels of risk, as well as several specific constituents in the S&P 500 that retirees should never own. In other words, it doesn't matter that they are hidden within the construct of an index of 500 companies; they are simply inappropriate stocks that retirees should avoid.The only way to see this clearly is by dissecting the S&P 500 index through a careful review of each of its 500 constituents. Some may feel that this is a task that is beyond their ability or even desire to attempt. Fortunately, Premium subscribers to F.A.S.T. Graphs\u2122 can complete this task rather quickly, efficiently and easily. By going to the 16  , I was able to review each of the 500 S&P 500 constituents in approximately 30 minutes. Frankly, it was an eye-opening exercise.Once I went into the Portfolio Review section I created the following report that organized the 500 constituents of the S&P 500 in order of highest performance to lowest over the last 20 calendar year time frame. The annualized performance number on the portfolio review is a total return calculation that includes both capital appreciation and dividend income. My purpose of organizing the S&P 500 in this construct was so that I could garner a detailed and precise understanding of where performance (total return) came from, how it was generated and which constituents outperformed versus which that didn't.Since the total analysis is beyond the scope of this venue, I offer the following excerpts in order to make my points. First, I present the portion of the report comprised of the top 15 S&P 500 constituents that generated the highest annualized performance. Here I would like to acknowledge that there are some imperfections with this analysis. For starters, not all of the best performers provided the full complement of 20 years of performance. In fact, most the top 10 constituents provide records for only as little as 3 years out to 17 years.However, the primary purpose of this analysis was for me to identify not only what companies, but what types of companies were producing the S&P 500's outperformance. Frankly, I can state with great confidence, that the vast majority of these top 15 candidates presented in my partial report below are emphatically inappropriate investments for retirees desirous of an adequate current dividend yield, and the opportunity to see that dividend income stream grow over time.Additionally, these were not the only S&P 500 constituents that I felt were inappropriate for the dividend growth investor to own. There are over 100 S&P 500 constituents that pay little or no dividends. Clearly these are not appropriate investments for those seeking income. As I went through each of the 500 constituents, I found numerous other examples of inappropriate companies. But for now, I offer the following 15 best-performing S&P 500 constituents as measured by the highest annualized performance (Note: not all of the following names provided performance over the entire 20 year time frame).For brevity's sake, I offer the following two example S&P 500 constituents that did include a full 20-year record that I feel clearly illustrate that, and why, they are not appropriate for income-seeking investors. My first example is Monster Beverage Corp (  ). Clearly, as the graph reveals, this is an incredible growth stock. However, it should also be clear that it also represents a much riskier type of investment than a blue-chip stalwart dividend growth stock like Coca-Cola (  ) or Clorox (  ) (I will provide graphs on both of these later). Not only does it not pay a dividend, price volatility is also rather extreme at times. .My second example, Celgene Corp, also represents a similarly inappropriate holding for the retired dividend growth investor. Although both of these examples represent solid growth stocks with powerful long-term performance histories, they may or may not provide the income that a retired dividend growth investor would need to live off of.Therefore, it would only be through the harvesting of shares that any income could be had. Frankly, that is a job easier said than done, at least in my opinion. On the other hand, both of these would have been great choices for investors with a goal of achieving aggressive above-average long-term growth of capital. But that fact alone does not make them appropriate low risk, conservative income-producing investments that those in retirement need.My next Portfolio Review excerpt of all the S&P 500 constituents skips all the way to the bottom in order to review the 15 worst-performing companies in the S&P 500. Once again, based on a thorough review of each, I would emphatically contend that none of these names belong in the portfolios of income-seeking retirees. Of course, that statement is notwithstanding the horrible performance that each produced over the past 20 years.As an interesting aside, the S&P 500 index itself would have been the 335th worst performer out of 500. In other words, there were only 166 constituents that underperformed the index itself.Here I will present 3 examples of the 15 worst-performing S&P 500 constituents that I believe are inappropriate holdings for retirement portfolios. I will let the graphs speak for themselves, and only state that their poor long-term earnings histories (the orange line) and poor long-term dividend records (the pink line) clearly validate why they would be inappropriate investments for retirees.Up to this point, I have been suggesting that the S&P 500 may not be the appropriate choice for retired investors seeking income. Moreover, I contend this to be true regardless of the fact that the vast majority of actively managed portfolios don't outperform the index. This is true primarily because for the retiree in need of income to sustain an acceptable standard of living, total return is not the answer. Instead, total income is of paramount importance. Consequently, and most importantly, the S&P 500 simply does not generate enough income to get the job done. However, the only way that it could generate enough income for the retiree to live off of would be through the harvesting of shares to generate the needed cash flow. This creates several problems and challenges for the investor.For starters, the very act of harvesting shares each year to meet income needs reduces the amount of investor capital available for distributions. Consequently, even if the S&P 500 does outperform, the effect of reducing shares diminishes its ability to produce an adequate income stream to an even greater extent. The following comparison of the S&P 500 versus a rationally constructed dividend growth portfolio illustrates my point. What you will discover is that the S&P 500 does not outperform over the 20 calendar year due to the continuous erosion of shares from harvesting.With this analysis I am contrasting the S&P 500 offering a current yield of 1.81% with a dividend growth portfolio designed to provide a minimum need of 3%. Thereby illustrating the negative effects created by the necessity to harvest enough shares to make up the difference between 1.8% current income and the need for a minimum of 3%.My previously presented analysis was hypothetical in nature and based on the assumptions made. What follows next is also hypothetical, but the difference being that it offers real-life examples of actual blue-chip dividend stalwarts, most of which (15 out of 20) have beaten the S&P 500 on a total return basis over the past 20 calendar years. However, and most importantly supporting the primary thesis of this article,  .Now, before I present the following analysis, I have a few words for the diehard advocates of indexing who might cry foul by arguing that I have cherry picked the portfolio. If it is appropriate to argue that indexing is the best way to invest based on historical evidence indicating outperformance, then I will counter that argument by saying it is also appropriate to build a portfolio of individual stocks based on their historical outperformance over the S&P 500. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.The following Portfolio Review is comprised of 20 blue-chip dividend growth stocks that together provide an average current dividend yield of 3% per annum. The S&P 500 is included as a 21st ticker for comparison purposes. The reader should note that only five of these selections have underperformed the S&P 500 on a total return basis (annualized performance).As an interesting aside, a comment made on one of my recent articles suggested the idea of throwing out the worst performing stocks in the S&P 500 thereby creating a portfolio that could outperform. The following portfolio is presented in the spirit of that idea. However, I have taken it one step further. Since the focus of this article is on providing the appropriate equity investment choice for dividend-seeking retirees, I created a portfolio of 20 dividend paying blue chips, each with a current dividend yield that was greater than the current yield on the S&P 500.The following performance history is the typical total return performance calculations that are reviewed in all the studies citing indexing outperforming active managers. I have highlighted each year that the portfolio underperformed the S&P 500 on a total return basis. Note that the annualized performance of the portfolio significantly outperformed the S&P 500 even though the portfolio underperformed the S&P 500 no less than nine times out of twenty, with one year a virtual tie.However, and most importantly as it relates to this article, annual dividends (the income component) is not separately revealed. Later I will show a year-by-year comparison of the portfolio's total dividends to the S&P 500's total dividends.The following portfolio appraisal shows the date-to-date\nperformance of each of the 20 Fools Errand portfolio constituents.\nNote dividends have been accumulated in a money market account and\nnot reinvested.The following portfolio appraisal shows the date-to-date performance of each of the 20 Fools Errand portfolio constituents. Note dividends have been accumulated in a money market account and not reinvested.In order to provide greater insight into the power of a well-constructed dividend growth portfolio, I provide the following 20 calendar year Historical Earnings and Price Correlated graphs plus their performance on six prominent dividend paying blue chips. For fairness, I have included some that have outperformed the S&P 500 on all fronts, as well as two that underperformed based on total return. However, all six of these examples provided more cumulative total dividend income than the S&P 500. This last point is ignored by the standard total return calculation. However, for the dividend growth investor it is the most important performance measurement.As an interesting aside, even Consolidated Edison would outperform the S&P 500 if the dividends of both were reinvested.The primary purpose of this article was to present the argument that trying to build a portfolio based on the idea of outperforming the market is not necessarily the appropriate course of action. Although total return is certainly a consideration worthy of investor attention, it should not necessarily be the driving force behind constructing an appropriate portfolio. Considerations for the amount of risk investors are willing to take should also be part of the thought process.Moreover, total return does not necessarily represent the final answer. The amount of income a portfolio is capable of generating may take precedence over capital appreciation. This would be especially true for the prudent retiree desirous of creating a portfolio capable of meeting their long-term needs for income. For these investors, it would be nice to get some capital appreciation along the way, and certainly desirable. However, you cannot spend capital appreciation unless you are willing to harvest some of your principal in order to get it. Moreover, if you harvest principle, then you are simultaneously left with fewer assets (shares) with which to generate income in the future.The moral of the story is that a portfolio should be designed with the intention of meeting the needs of the investor designing it. If in the accumulation phase, then going for maximum capital appreciation may be a good course of action. However, once the need to harvest income from your portfolio kicks in, then focus should shift to dividend income over capital gain. In short, there is more to building a portfolio than focusing on total return only. Therefore, trying to beat the market may, in fact, be a fool's errand.Disclosure: Long KO, CLX, PEP and ED at the time of writing.

Last quarter, it posted a negative surprise of 14.3%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Molson Coors is struggling in terms of sales volume decline for the past three years. In Canada, the substantial excise tax increase in Qu\u00e9bec, which was enforced in Nov 2012, lowered volumes further as the company has a significant market share in Qu\u00e9bec.Despite its marketing investments in the Miller Lite and Molson Brands, volume growth has been rather inconsistent. The recovery in the U.S. economy and the acquisition of the StarBev business are likely to boost volumes eventually but we do not expect the change to reflect in the second quarter.Moreover, the company's limited cash due to debt obligations related to StarBev acquisition has forced the company to discontinue its buyback policy. The company expects to use its cash principally for deleveraging debt for the next 2-3 years and therefore it does not expect to make any further repurchases in the coming quarter. This is expected to hurt earnings growth in the second quarter.However, we feel that Molson Coors' increased focus on non-beer drinks and high-profitable areas of the U.S. beer market is expected to drive sales in the second quarter, as it had in the first quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive earnings expected surprise prediction (ESP) (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as shown below. The Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.38 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher at $1.39. That is a difference of -0.72%. Molson Coors holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution investors against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies in the consumer staples sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), Earnings ESP of +5.66% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). (  ), Earnings ESP of +3.13% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). (  ), Earnings ESP of +1.43% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" 's (  ) second-quarter 2013 adjusted earnings of 77 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents by 2.7% and the year-ago earnings of 73 cents by 5.5%. Favorable impact of 1 cent per share from currency translation, decline in operational expenses and lower share count led to year-over-year growth in earnings.During the quarter, net sales dipped 2.5% to $2.16 billion. Reported revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21 billion. Sales in the quarter were adversely impacted by worse-than-expected weather conditions and a sluggish consumer spending environment. In Jun 2013, management had already warned that cold and wet weather conditions in the second half of May and the beginning of June could hurt volumes significantly during the peak summer selling season.Coca-Cola Enterprises, one of the largest bottlers of  (  ), has been facing many other challenges lately. These include steep price competition in Great Britain, overall soft macro economic conditions and difficult beverage market conditions in France due to the increase in French excise tax (FET). Some of these challenges have been more persistent than expected, thus tempering the fisrt-half results.The company's net pricing per case decreased 0.5% whereas cost of sales per case increased 2.0% in the quarter. Volumes (bottle and cans) declined 2.5% in the quarter. Volumes declined 2.5% in continental Europe and 1.5% in Great Britain.Sparkling drinks volume declined about 2.5% with beverages from Coca Cola down 2.5%. Still beverages witnessed a decline of 2%. However, Coca Cola Zero managed to post growth of as much as 13%. Also, energy drinks volume grew 3% with Monster posting a substantial growth of 15%.Gross margins were hurt by about 160 basis points (bps) owing to higher cost of sales and adverse mix in Great Britain. Comparable operating income declined 4% despite a 5% decline in operating expenses owing to the continuing expense control initiatives.Coca-Cola Enterprises began its third share repurchase program worth $1.5 billion in Jan 2013. The company continues to expect repurchase of shares worth at least $1 billion during 2013.The company withdrew its previously provided outlook for fiscal 2013 in Jun 2013 due to lower visibility for the near future. However, management has updated the guidance this time.It now expects adjusted earnings per share in a range of $2.45 to $2.50. At the current rates, currency translation is expected to reduce full-year earnings per share by less than 1%, down from the earlier guided range of 1%-2%.The company expects net sales to grow in the low single-digit range, down from previously guided range of low-to-mid-single digits. The company has slashed its net sales guidance twice this year.Operating income is expected to increase in the low-to-mid-single digits range, down from mid-single digits range guided earlier.Coca-Cola Enterprises expects free cash flow for fiscal 2013 to be around $450 to $500 million. Capital expenditure is expected to be around $325 million. The company expects the weighted average cost of debt to be around 3% and effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 28%.Despite an unimpressive guidance, the company is hopeful of better business conditions in the third quarter, thanks to recent weather improvements. It is still counting on the remaining summer season to bolster its sales in the upcoming quarter.Coca-Cola Enterprises carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some other consumer staples stocks that are worth a look include  (  ) and  (  ) both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) - also known as FEMSA - reported lower-than-expected bottom-line results for the second quarter of 2013. This largest franchise bottler for  (  ) posted net majority income of 77 cents (Ps. 1.00) per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of US$1.22.Moreover, quarterly net consolidated income of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company fell nearly 6.6% to Ps. 5.078 billion from the comparable year-ago quarter income of Ps. 5.437 billion. The decrease was primarily due to foreign exchange losses in connection with Coca-Cola FEMSA's U.S. dollar denominated debt position and increased interest expenses resulting from the recently issued bonds by Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Comercio.Total revenue grew 4.1% year over year to Ps. 62.047 billion ($4.982 billion), mainly aided by improvement in revenue at FEMSA Comercio. On an organic basis, total revenue climbed 3.1% from the prior-year comparable quarter.FEMSA's gross profit rose 5.3% year over year to Ps. 26.325 billion ($2.114 billion), and gross margin expanded 50 basis points (bps) to 42.4%. The increase was primarily driven by gross profit improvement at the company's Coca-Cola FEMSA segment.FEMSA's operating income increased 9.1% to Ps. 7.294 billion ($0.586 billion) from Ps. 6.686 billion ($0.494 billion) in the year-ago period. Consolidated operating margin improved 60 bps to 11.8%, primarily driven by increased gross margin at Coca-Cola FEMSA due to lower raw-material costs, which were benefited by a strong Mexican currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. On an organic basis, operating income increased 8.0% year over year.Total revenue at Coca-cola FEMSA was almost flat year over year at Ps. 36.260 billion ($2.912 billion), as revenue growth of 6.3% in the Mexico & Central America division was offset by the negative impact from currency devaluation in South America. However, on a currency neutral basis and excluding the non-comparable effect of Grupo Fomento Queretano and Grupo Yoli in Mexico, total revenue rose 12.7%.The segment's operating income for the quarter grew 9.1% to Ps. 5.142 billion ($0.413 billion) from the year-ago quarter. Consequently, Coca-Cola FEMSA's operating margin expanded 120 bps to 14.2% in the quarter.FEMSA Comercio registered revenue growth of 11.7% year over year to Ps. 24.808 billion ($1.992 billion), mainly attributable to the opening of 279 net new stores in the quarter and a 0.9% upside in same-store sales. The growth in same-store sales was primarily driven by an increase of 1.1% in average customer ticket, partially offset by a 0.1% drop in customer traffic. The company opened 1,026 net new stores in the last 12 months, bringing the total store count to 11,015.Operating income for the said quarter rose 6.7% year over year to Ps. 1.952 billion ($0.157 billion). However, the segment's operating margin contracted 30 bps to 7.9%, primarily due to increased operating expenses on new store openings, development of organizational and IT structure as well as specialized distribution channels.FEMSA, which competes with  . (  ), had cash balance of Ps. 46.572 billion ($3.585 billion) at the end of the second quarter. Long and short-term debts were Ps. 44.457 billion ($3.422 billion) and Ps. 11.686 billion ($899.4 million), respectively. Moreover, FEMSA incurred capital expenditure of Ps. 3.581 billion ($0.288 billion) toward incremental investments at Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Comercio.Apart from FEMSA, other stocks in the Beverages-Brewers industry that are worth considering include  (  ), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["riday's session closes with the NASDAQ Composite Index at 3,423.56.

Youngsters get charged up from the caffeine and other ingredients in such stimulating drinks. AMA will be meeting this weekend to debate and possibly decide on this ban. The meeting could possibly result in a recommendation to curb sales of such stimulating drinks to youngsters.If the ban gets through, it may significantly hurt the sales of this California-based energy drink maker, whose Monster Energy brand of energy drinks represents more than 90% of total revenue.Other beverage giants like  (  ) and  (  ) also make energy drinks and may face a setback with the proposed curb on advertising of such drinks. As it is, these cola giants are seeing sluggish sales of its colas due to changing consumer preferences and increasing health consciousness. Rising obesity concerns, possible new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are also affecting PEP and KO's carbonated beverage sales. However, unlike Monster Beverage, energy drinks make up a very small part of their product portfolio.Forbes.com reported that these high-energy drinks have become increasingly popular in recent years with sales increasing 240% from 2004-2009.

New York's attorney general had subpoenaed energy drink makers, including Monster, and the FDA is also looking into the safety of these drinks.San Francisco's city attorney is now suing Monster Beverage for marketing its energy drinks to children, saying the products pose severe health risks.The company reported its first quarter results on May 8, 2013.

Net income per diluted share also decreased 10.4% to $0.37 from $0.41 per share in the Q1, 2012. The earnings were substantially short of the Zacks consensus estimate of $0.47 per share.The company has disappointed its investors in each of the last four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 11%.According to the company, results were hurt by $8.3 million of distributor termination obligations, $4.7 million of foreign currency transaction losses and $3.0 million of legal costs.Due to disappointing results, quarterly and annual estimates have been revised downwards in the past week by five analysts.Zacks consensus estimate for the current quarter now stands at $0.64 per share versus $0.68 per share, 7 days ago, while the full-year consensus estimate is $2.15 per share now, down from $2.26 per share.While the global energy drinks market continues to grow, rising health risk concerns and resulting lawsuits will continue to affect the stock.MNST is currently Zacks Rank # 5 (Strong Sell) stock and it also has a longer-term recommendation of \"Underperform\".Given above reasons, we would advise the investors to stay away from this stock for the time being.Investors looking for exposure to the Beverage-soft drinks industry can consider Pepsico (PEP)-a Zacks rank #2 (Buy) stock.

Last quarter, it posted a 12.77% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Dr Pepper has been witnessing sluggish top-line growth on account of weak volumes for the past few quarters. Sales volume has been down due to difficult operating conditions faced by the carbonated beverages (CSD) segment in North America. Changing consumer preferences, increasing health consciousness and rising obesity concerns, possible new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures have transformed the carbonated beverages category to a sluggish growth category in North America. These category headwinds are significantly affecting Dr Pepper's CSD volumes, which comprise around 80% of its business.We believe CSD volumes will continue to lag this quarter. Poor weather conditions in North America may further pull down beverage sales.Second-quarter profits are expected to be hurt by higher marketing investments and difficult year-over-year comparisons. Sales in the second quarter of 2012, however, benefited from lower discounts. Marketing investments are expected to be higher due to brand investments to support Dr Pepper's TEN platform.Dr Pepper is trying to reinvigorate its CSD category by making healthier and tastier alternatives. In 2011, Dr Pepper launched the low-calorie version of its Dr Pepper brand of soft drinks, Dr Pepper TEN. The 10 calorie drink has gained decent success, driven by solid brand support.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dr Pepper is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Zacks ESP is -1.1%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 83 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher at 84 cents. Dr Pepper carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies from the consumer staples sector, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), Earnings ESP of +5.97% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Shares were down nearly 14 percent to $38.75 in late trading.Over the last six months, Monster shares have been under significant pressure as the company has been experiencing some operating headwinds. It would appear, however, as if investors were somewhat optimistic heading into the earnings release. The stock closed the regular trading day down just 0.26 percent to $44.97 despite a better than 300 point loss for the Dow Jones Industrial Average after Tuesday's election results.Monster reported net income for the fiscal third quarter of $86.1 million or $0.47 per share. This was an increase versus last year's corresponding period when the company earned $82.4 million or $0.44 per share. The results, however, came up significantly short of Wall Street earnings estimates of $0.55 per share. Revenus also missed Street consensus expectations.Monster reported total sales for the period of $541.9 million. While this was a significant increase versus last year's $474.7 million in sales, it missed consensus estimates of $578.48 million by a fairly wide margin. Despite the fact that the quarter was a record for the company, the results show that the company's business is not matching up to the growth rates that investors have come to expect.Monster's Chairman and CEO Rodney Sacks acknowledged the slowing trends at his company. He said, \"While the Company achieved less robust growth in sales dollars than in previous quarters, gross sales for the Company in October 2012 increased by approximately 28 percent over the same month last year.\"While Monster is still growing at an impressive rate, investors are likely to re-calibrate their forward-looking projections in the wake of the report. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Monster said that its net income rose 22.7 percent to $1.47 per diluted share versus the same period last year.Monster is an impressive secular growth story, but its valuation is also rich for its industry. Prior to the plunge in after-hours trading, the stock had a P/E ratio over 25, and a forward P/E of 18.5. Its PEG ratio, which is a measure of the company's P/E divided by its growth rate was 1.51. While this is not exactly exorbitant, generally a PEG closer to 1 would be considered a conservatively valued stock.In the wake of the third quarter results, Monster's recent downtrend will continue on Thursday. If the stock were to open where it is currently trading in the after hours, it would represent a new 52-week low in the name.The 52-week high in the stock is just below $84.00 or more than twice as much as its current price.

Click below to watch the video!---For many of you, this is almost a holiday week, as many Americans are using the opportunity created by the July 4th holiday on Wednesday (worst possible day!) to take some time off. So I'm taking the opportunity to publish a favorite piece of silliness.In the days before computers, e-mail, printers and Xerox machines, there were still humorous pieces that circulated through the business offices of America. They were typed, and many of them were fuzzy because they were produced at the back of a stack of copies made with carbon paper. They weren't really much higher in quality than the stuff that makes the rounds of the globe by e-mail, but they were a lot more trouble to produce, which meant that there were fewer of them. Scarcity produces value.I still have a collection of those old \"pass-it-on\" pieces, and in honor of June, the month of brides (and bridezillas) I want to share one with you. This is from the early 1960s, when JFK was still president. I collected it when it was published in my hometown newspaper, the Medford (Oregon) Mail Tribune.I clipped it out and I'm reproducing it here because I've always liked it and don't want it to fade away like the yellowed piece of newsprint that I've kept for so long. I think it's a useful corrective to the towering ego-trips of many young women on \"their day.\" With any luck, someone will put it on the Web and it will last forever. All the place names are in Oregon.(If you need an investment rationale, you can remind yourself that June is a traditional month for marriages and that with over two million weddings that cost an average of $27,000 each, this is a major industry. )Groom Simply Stunning In Peachy-Keen OutfitGRANTS PASS (AP) Bob Grant, publisher of the Illinois Valley News, published his version of a wedding after the expected information failed to reach him.He collaborated with Don Rosenberg of Cave Junction, father of the bridegroom and came up with the following version of the Gibbons-Rosenberg wedding in Cave Junction:\"Leland was beautiful in a black suit of wool with matching lapel pressed down sharply against the chest. Peering out of the left breast pocket were four tips of a cleverly folded white linen handkerchief while on the left lapel, quaintly held by placing the stem through an unused buttonhole and securing it with a small silver hat pin, was a white carnation.\"He wore a shirt of white nylon, severely plain, which was held together at the front by little buttons of plastic. Around his neck and under the shirt collar was a tie of black jersey, knotted carefully in decorative style, and held to the shirt front with a clamping device of gold plated brass. The cuffs of the shirt sleeves were closed with links of the same plated metal.\"On his left wrist he wore a mercury battery-powered watch, a Christmas gift from his father, that was held in place with a metal band. His trousers, of simple pleated design, matched the coat and were supported by a belt of black goatskin. His shoes, of black horsehide, covered socks of some dark material and were fastened with a bow.\"He wore no hat and had his hair combed back and then forward from the forehead in a slight wave with no visible means holding it in position.\"The bride wore the customary white.\"[If you're serious about trying to cash in on the marriage biz, you might take a look at XO Group (XOXO), the company that runs TheKnot.com, which caters to the wants and needs of brides to be. The company also runs a bridal registry and publishes magazines for those getting married and those having babies. From 2002 through 2006, XOXO was a very hot item. It fell off the dock in 2007 and 2008, and has been hacking around since then. Cute company name and symbol, though.]--- Here's this week's Contrary Opinion Button. Remember, you can always view all of the buttons by  .Popularized by Will Rogers, whose humorous wisdom resonated with the common man. It reminds us that real common sense comes from thinking differently from the common man at times of mass irrationality.When the common man believed Internet stocks would go to the moon in 2000 \u2026 when he believed Bernie Madoff was a genius \u2026 and when he believed in late 2008 that America's financial system might actually fail \u2026 at all those times, he lost his common sense because his thoughts melded with those of the irrational crowd \u2026 and he paid the price.[Editor's Note: And speaking of common sense, with the July 4th holiday coming up on Wednesday, I'd also note that Thomas Paine's pamphlet, Common Sense, which was published in 1776 and sold 500,000 copies in its first year, was also uncommonly eloquent in its plea for American independence.]---In case you didn't get a chance to read all the issues of Cabot Wealth Advisory this week and want to catch up on any investing and stock tips you might have missed, there are links below to each issue.In this issue, Lou Gagliardi, editor of  , discusses the art of balancing risk and return in investing and the importance of finding companies with strong balance sheets.

But before you buy, it's important to understand that small company stocks act differently-and therefore must be handled differently-from other stocks.One area in which small-cap stocks require special handling is in stop losses.As a general rule I recommend stop-losses to protect my earned profits in a small-cap stock position. But because small-cap stocks act differently from most other types of stocks, there are additional considerations.Generally, small-cap stocks demonstrate much greater price volatility than mid-cap or large-cap stocks-fluctuations of 15% or more are typical (and they don't need specific company or news events to trigger the volatility). It's therefore important to keep the stop-loss in your head, not as an order to your broker.Let me give you an example of how using a stop-loss could have turned out to be a painful financial experience for me:Over a decade ago, when I was invested in Monster Beverage (  ), formerly Hansen Natural, the stock fell out of the sky. A single 600 sell-side transaction (at the time, about 15% of the average daily volume) sent the share price down 35% and I was instantly looking at a paper loss of $15,000. If I'd had a stop-loss in place, I'd have missed out on the best investment of my lifetime, as Hansen went on to give its early investors returns in excess of 30,000%.The lesson here is that an investor can get paid very well for stomaching the motion sickness that comes from owning small-cap stocks, but you absolutely need to keep on your toes.---Another potential downside to small-cap stop-losses is that they reveal your plans to the market makers.A market maker is a broker-dealer firm that accepts the risk of holding a certain number of shares of a particular security in order to facilitate trading in that security. Each market maker competes for customers' orders by displaying buy and sell quotations for a guaranteed number of shares. Once an order is received, the market maker immediately sells from its own inventory or seeks an offsetting order. This process takes seconds.Market makers know when we place a sell order, so they can take out our stops by a penny in order to add the stock to their accounts.To avoid this from happening, I recommend mental stop-losses, rather than actual stop-loss orders.---So right about now you're asking when stop-losses make sense.I think a stop-loss is in order when you want to preserve the hard-earned gains you've achieved in a stock but you aren't yet ready to book them.Step one is to determine the lowest rate of return you're willing to accept on the stock. Use the stop-loss as your own personal profit guideline. I usually stick with a return of 35%.The rationale is that you want a stop-loss that's low enough that it would be triggered only if demand for the company's product has seriously deteriorated (you don't want to get tossed out of a stock because the price wavered in a sour stock market).If you are confident that the company and its markets are sound, you may want to lower your stop-loss.But when the stock is acting poorly despite your optimism and prospects for the company, you may want to raise the stop-loss to a level that makes you comfortable.Your guide to small-cap investing.Thomas GarrityEditor, The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ew York's attorney general has initiated a probe to determine whether leading energy drink makers have misled their consumers about the ingredients and nutritional value of energy drinks manufactured by them. The investigation requires information from three large companies --  (  ),  (  ) and Living Essentials LLC. As investigation progresses, more companies may be asked to furnish additional information about their products.The ingredients and nutritional value of the energy drinks, and their marketing by the concerned companies will be reviewed. The investigation will check the amount of caffeine and other artificial ingredients added to the drinks such as fruit flavors, vitamins B, taurine and ginseng. It may also be noted that the term \"energy drink\" is an ill-defined marketing term, which is not included under any FDA regulation.The energy drinks industry, worth $8.9 billion, grew at a double-digit rate in fiscal 2011. The authority has been planning to impose restrictions on the sale of soda beverages and the present probe will be an addition to the move.This investigation may impose further restrictions on beverage companies. As a result, the companies may not be able to capitalize on the increasing demand for energy drinks among young adults.Given the rise in lifestyle diseases, more people are concerned about the nutritional value of packaged food. As a result, most of the companies are now focusing on increasing the health quotient of their food products. The stress is on producing food products with simple natural ingredients with minimum preservatives and optimum processing.Net revenue of PepsiCo's beverage segments, PepsiCo Americas Beverages, slipped 5% year over year (organically up 2%) to $5.35 billion in the second quarter of 2012.

One reason: They've avoided price wars in North America as soda consumption falls. \"At least for now the cola wars are behind us,\" said Bernstein research analyst Ali Dibadj.Internationally, soft-drink giants are packaging soda in smaller-size, higher-margin containers, and expanding further into energy drinks, sports beverages, flavored water and bottled tea.Carbonated drinks are still the core business. Muhtar Kent, Coca- Cola's chairman and chief executive, calls the Coke brand \"the very oxygen of our business.\"Beverages are sold through nearly every imaginable retail nook in the global economy.Among the most profitable channels are the fill-a-cup type fountain sales seen in fast-food chains and convenience markets. Fountain drinks bring single-serve prices and forgo the cost of packaging in bottles or cans.It is also the segment most at risk if measures like New York City's proposed ban on supersize sugary drinks spread to other localities. Coke has the largest exposure, with about 70% of the U.S. fountain soft-drink business, says Beverage Digest.For soda sold in bottles, cans and other packages, trademark-brand beverage companies such as Coca-Cola or Dr Pepper sell proprietary concentrates to licensed bottlers. The bottlers mix and package the concentrated syrups with carbonated water and sweeteners, to produce beverages.In emerging markets, concentrate sales continue to earn high margins for Coca-Cola and others, says Bernstein's Dibadj.Bottlers have lower profit margins, usually ranging from 2% to 4%, wrote Standard & Poor's analyst Esther Kwon in a June report.In North America, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have acquired their major bottling networks. Dibadj says they did so in part because the bottling networks weren't investing enough to innovate in their operations. \"They bought the bottlers to fix them,\" he said.Unlike fast-growing emerging markets, such as China and India, beverage consumption in the U.S. rose only 0.7% in 2011, says Beverage Marketing Corp. Carbonated soft drinks fell 1.8% from the year earlier.A sweet spot, of sorts, was low-calorie Coke Zero, which gained market share in 2011 as soft-drink makers continued to fight back with diet-oriented products. Dr Pepper Snapple launched 10-calorie Pepper Ten in October 2011. It plans similar 10-calorie drinks in other brands, such as 7Up, RC Cola and A&W, says Kwon.In March, PepsiCo debuted its 60-calorie-per-can Pepsi Next -- half the calories of a regular Pepsi.\u0095  Develop thirst-quenching products that cut calories but preserve taste. \"Mid-calorie offerings are an attempt to strike a balance between the sugar and calorie content of the drink and its taste,\" said S&P's Kwon.Noncarbonated beverages are a smaller market, but rapidly gaining share. In volume, energy drink consumption jumped 17.2% in 2011 from the year earlier, says Beverage Marketing. Ready-to-drink coffee rose nearly 10%, sports drinks were up 7.6%, and bottled teas gained 5.6%.The beverage industry is highly consolidated, says Kwon, with Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Dr Pepper Snapple representing about 88% of U.S. retail sales.PepsiCo also owns Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods and is part of IBD's packaged foods group. Despite their size, the soft-drink giants don't rule in emerging categories.PepsiCo and Coca-Cola own the two biggest sports-drink brands, Gatorade and Powerade. PepsiCo andStarbucks (  ) partnered in ready-to-drink coffees.However, Lipton and Arizona are leaders in bottled teas, a market Snapple also pioneered. Privately held Red Bull andMonster Beverage (  ) are the biggest makers of fast-growing energy drinks.In 2011, Red Bull generated about $6 billion in revenue, making it roughly three times the size of Monster. Austria-based Red Bull's sports-related marketing has been a big driver of its growth, analysts say.Monster, which gets roughly 14% of sales outside North America, aims to expand in Europe, Latin America and Asia. Its international operations have been losing money but may soon turn profitable, says Goldman Sachs analyst Judy Hong. Still, Monster faces a tough rival in Red Bull, whose goal is doubling its revenue in five years, says UBS analyst Kaumil Gajrawala in a research note.One strength of Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Dr Pepper Snapple as competition intensifies is their ability to push multiple brands. Coca-Cola has more than 500 brands across the globe, including Diet Coke, Sprite, Dasani water, Full Throttle energy drinks, Minute Maid juices, Odwalla smoothies and Powerade sports drinks.\"If you want to be a big company in the refreshment beverage industry today, you really have to be in multiple categories; you can't be a one-trick pony,\" said Gary Hemphill, a senior vice president at Beverage Marketing.Coca-Cola denied in May that it was in talks to buy Monster. Still, the Atlanta-based giant has used takeovers to get a foothold in emerging niches.In 2007, Coca-Cola acquired Vitaminwater maker Glaceau for $4.1 billion, a price tag some analysts thought too high. In 2009, China's government blocked Coca-Cola's $2.4 billion bid to acquire China Huiyuan Juice Group, the country's largest juice maker.The company has upped its stake in British smoothie maker Innocent to 58% and last year acquired organic seller Honest Tea.\"With more than $20 billion in free cash flow generation likely in the next three years,\" S&P's Kwon says, Coca-Cola \"will continue to look to bolster its position in the noncarbonated arena worldwide.\"CEO Kent has told analysts it may pursue small \"bolt-on\" deals, similar to Honest Tea, but plans to focus on internal product development.Beverages, like most food products, are a heavily regulated industry. The caffeine content of energy drinks as well as health claims for noncarbonated drinks are scrutinized by consumer groups.In 2010, Coca-Cola was sued over Vitaminwater. The same year, the Food and Drug Administration warned Dr Pepper Snapple over food labels on green tea.In May, a federal judge ordered the makers of POM Wonderful to cease making claims over the benefits of pomegranate juice.Research and development is focused on producing low- or no-calorie drinks that use natural sweeteners instead of artificial ones like aspartame. Beverage companies aim to use natural sweeteners in both carbonated and noncarbonated products.The industry has had big hopes for Reb A, a zero-calorie sugar substitute derived from the stevia plant, native to South America.At PepsiCo, zero-calorie SoBe Lifewater; G2 Natural, a new Gatorade product, and Tropicana's Trop 50 orange juice, use stevia, says Kwon. Coca-Cola uses stevia-based sweeteners in Sprite, Vitaminwater, Odwalla juice and many other products.However, Coca-Cola has yet to roll out a big-volume Coke product using stevia. It might be holding off, analysts say, because stevia sweeteners are said to have a licoricelike after-taste, which may put off some consumers.Overseas expansion is key. Latin America overtook North America as Coca-Cola's volume leader in 2007, notes Dibadj. Last year, the company pledged to spend $3 billion in India within three years. In June, it boosted its commitment in India to $5 billion through 2020, and the company still sees room for growth in Africa and Indonesia.Monster, meanwhile, has just started marketing or will soon launch in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong, as well as Chile, Peru and Ecuador in Latin America.\u0095  If the economy improves, the profitable fountain business would benefit.Companies may tap new consumer taste preferences, such as coconut-flavored water.\u0095  C ambridge, Mass. is mulling a soda ban similar to New York's proposal. Other cities may follow. New York's ads showed gelatinous fat oozing out of a soda bottle.Regulation of energy drinks or taxation of sugared products are also possible, analysts say. Soft-drink makers need to put up defenses, says Tom Pirko, an analyst at Bevmark Consulting.\"Brands are so iconic,\" he said. (Soft-drink makers) have been fighting back effectively. They don't want big soda to look like big tobacco.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["tocks ended mixed on the first trading day of the fourth quarter as positive manufacturing data was somewhat offset by discouraging comments from the central bank chairman. Benchmarks started the day on a winning note boosted by a surprise jump in manufacturing sector activity. However, a chunk of the gains were eroded after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested that the rate of growth might be \"insufficient to put people back to work\".The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.6% and closed at 13,515.11. The Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) rose 0.3% and finished yesterday's trading session at 1,444.49. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 3,113.53, after falling 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) added 3.8% to settle at 16.32. Consolidated volumes on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq were roughly 6.3 billion shares, marginally lower than the year-on-year daily average volume of 6.38 billion. The advancers on the New York Stock Exchange outpaced the declining stocks; as for 60% stocks that gained, 37% stocks closed lower.The initial spark for the day was provided by a report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) that said economic activity in the manufacturing sector had expanded for the first time since May. An increase in new orders and employment drove the manufacturing sector higher in September. According to the ISM, \"The PMI registered 51.5 percent, an increase of 1.9 percentage points from August's reading of 49.6 percent, indicating a return to expansion after contracting for three consecutive months. The New Orders Index registered 52.3 percent, an increase of 5.2 percentage points from August, indicating growth in new orders after three consecutive months of contraction\". For the first time in four months the PMI registered a reading above 50. The report noted: \"A reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally contracting\". Consensus estimates had projected the figure to come in at 49.9%.Separately, PMI data was also released for China and the Euro-zone. The euro zone PMI for September was revised upward to 46.1 from its earlier reading of 46. The August reading for the same was 45.1. The PMI readings suggested contraction as it remained below 50. Nonetheless, the euro rose against the dollar by 0.3% following the paltry improvement in the region's PMI. Separately, China's official PMI was up from 49.2 in August to 49.8 in September.Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Commerce said construction spending had decreased 0.6% from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $837.1 billion in August. This was the biggest decline since July last year and the second consecutive month of declines.As already mentioned, comments from the Fed Chairman had somewhat dented the markets yesterday. Speaking at the Economic Club of Indiana, Bernanke defended the bond buying plan. However, investor sentiment took a hit when he said the economy is unable to grow at a pace fast enough to reduce the high level of unemployment. He said: \"Our concern is not really a recession. Our concern is that growth will continue but at a pace that's insufficient to put people back to work\".Separately, investors awaited Moody's verdict on Spain's sovereign rating. Moody's Investors Service has so far left the financial arena apprehensive over whether it will downgrade the country's sovereign rating to 'junk'.However, Moody's made a statement regarding the quantum of funds that would be required to revive Spanish banks. Previously, consultant Oliver Wyman had said around 59.3 billion euros ($76.3 billion) would be required to revive the Spanish banks. But, Moody's said that such recapitalization is \"credit positive, but may be insufficient.\"Coming to the sectors, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) was the major gainer, surging 0.7%.

Despite, the meager gains, the S&P 500 extended its stay in the green into a fifth consecutive day. However, the Dow closed in the red as investors were caught in a dilemma, whether to focus on positives at home or the negative economic reading from China.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) dropped 0.08% to end 10.45 points lower at 13,165.19. The Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) edged up a mere 0.04% to finish yesterday's trading session at 1,402.80. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3% and was up to 3,018.64. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index shed 0.3% and settled at 15.28. Consolidated volumes on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were roughly 5.41 billion shares, once again lower than 2011's daily average of 7.84 billion shares. Advancing stocks moved past the decliners on the NYSE; as for 53% stocks that gained, 43% closed in negative territory.Markets struggled to find definite direction through the day's trading session. While the benchmarks added modest points in the morning, they slipped into the red soon after noon, only to rebound once again. Investors have gained strength from what has become the S&P 500's longest winning stretch since March this year. Apart from trading over its psychological level of 1, 400, the S&P 500 has gained over 10% since June 1, when it registered a five-month low. A major factor behind this uptrend is the earnings results by S&P 500 companies. A Bloomberg data noted that 72% of the S&P 500 companies have managed to outperform the Street estimates in the second quarter.Investors were faced with both positive as well negative developments yesterday. The dilemma was evident in the benchmarks' movement. For one, investors were greeted by further encouraging labor data. The U.S. Department of Labor reported that the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims dropped 6,000 from prior week's revised figure of 367,000 to 361,000 in the week ending August 4. This also compared favorably with consensus estimates of 370, 000. As a quick reminder, this is the second set of positive labor data after a strong government nonfarm payroll report had helped benchmarks snap their four-day losing streak last Friday.Thus, investors' confidence about labor conditions was buoyed for the second time. Meanwhile, the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, through the Department of Commerce, reported that trade deficit narrowed in June. According to the data: \"Total June exports of $185.0 billion and imports of $227.9 billion resulted in a goods and services deficit of $42.9 billion, down from $48.0 billion in May, revised. June exports were $1.7 billion more than May exports of $183.3 billion. June imports were $3.5 billion less than May imports of $231.4 billion\". Consensus estimates had expected a trade deficit of 47.5. The trade deficit was at its lowest in 18 months.Amidst these positives, investors' sentiment was somewhat jolted after China's factory output growth was down to the weakest level in over three years. The second-largest economy's yearly industrial output growth weakened to 9.2% in July, according to National Bureau of Statistics. This was lower than June's level of 9.5%. Also, 'the finished goods inventory sub-index of the manufacturing purchasing managers index' was down to 48 in July as against June's reading of 53.2, thus suggesting a contraction. Further, there was evidence of slowing demand for raw materials as the producer price index suffered a yearly decline of 2.9% in July.Thus, investors struggled to gain a perspective, leaving benchmarks unsure of a definite direction. As for the individual stocks, E TRADE Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:  ) jumped sharply by 6.9% following an announcement that CEO Steven Freiberg has been sacked. On the earnings front, Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:  ) reported soft sales numbers but managed to edge past estimates. However, the company's shares lost 1.2%. Monster Beverage Corp (NSDAQ:  ) slumped 9.7% after missing estimates. Meanwhile, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:  ) and Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:  ) were slated to report their results after the closing bell.Separately, English soccer club Manchester United was en route to finalize its initial public offering and Financial Times quoted a close source saying that \"Institutional investors have shown strong interest\". Each share of the 19-time English Premier League champion boasting star players like Wayne Rooney and Nani will reportedly be priced in the range of $16 to $20. Manchester United will trade under the ticker name MANU and the club giant will be offering 16.7 million class A shares.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nergy fuel company Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:  ) will be taking the place of Sara Lee (NYSE:  ) in the S&P 500 Index after the close on June 28th. The longtime American food brand will be swapping places with Monster following its decision earlier this month to become absorbed under the  (NYSE:  ) name.Sara Lee will step down onto the S&P MidCap 400 Index come Thursday, as its anticipated coffee and tea spin-off agreement is expected to be made final that day.  is set to begin operating Sara Lee's beverage business next week following the June 1st announcement that the company would be separating its household products, meats and baked goods from its brews.As one beverage maker takes a step down, another will reign in its place. Monster's transition into the big leagues solidifies that the company will be going up against the most prevalent beverage competition in the world, with The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:  ), PepsiCo (NYSE:  ) and Dr. Pepper Snapple (NYSE:  ) being just a few renowned names that the drink distributor will soon join on the S&P 500 Index.The transition comes at a time when Sara Lee has been experiencing lackluster sales and Monster Beverage is continuing to ignite the interest of investors worldwide.\"Monster has experienced strong sales and profit growth since going public in 1995, as Americans guzzled down its namesake energy drink, a blend of sugar and Vitamin B packaged in tall-boy cans streaked with claw marks. Meanwhile, Sara Lee suffered. Sales fell from $17.6 billion in 2002 to only $8.7 billion last year,\"  recently reported.In the beginning of June, Monster's sales were up 28.3% with no signs of crashing. Goldman Sachs maintained that the growth was incredibly encouraging and exceeded the firms forecast as the brand continues to be on the up and up.Replacing a business in transition with a more lucrative and stable company may be the best decision for all parties involved in the flip-flop. Regardless of the outcome, it will certainly be refreshing for investors and analysts to see Monster Beverage on the S&P 500 next week.Monster is currently up about 2.5% in pre-market trading at $76.58, while Hillshire Brands closed yesterday at $28.25, up approximately 10% year-to-date.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["riday, June 22, 2012Relief at the lower than expected downgrades of major banks by a rating agency is expected to be a key factor in today's trading action, as the data docket is otherwise on the thin side.

Stocks posted one of their best weeks of 2012. The great run followed on the heels of the worst news-driven weeks of the year.ETF Stocks looked back in history to find similar bouts of volatility. Unfortunately, the majority of the yo-yo weeks were found during the great depression era. If history suffers d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, investors can expect more of the past two week experience, major swings of red and green.June\u2019s second full week of trading could see early gains as the world sighs relief rally following Spain\u2019s $100 billion bailout commitment from the EU (where does all this money come from?).We can see the NASDAQ rallying to its 50-day average of 2950. It\u2019s also where some resistance can be found. So, there are two reasons the index can turnaround if it flirts with the key benchmark.It is our view that investors should view a continued rally cautiously. ETF Stocks holds this view because volume dwindled as the stock market tacked on gains, days after day. Typically, an inverse relationship between volume and price is a combo with a short shelf life; one, the other, or both must give way.Obviously, ETF Stocks hopes rising volume follows, make that forces stocks higher. However, fingers crossed investing strategies fare about as well two-legged car chasing dogs on the highway.With the back-history of consecutive volatile weeks, resistance ahead, and a run of poor global economic news, we might suggest employing short-term trading strategies in the current environment.We have our eye on a few tradable stocks. Each of the following NASDAQ companies triggered a few of ETF Stocks favorite technical buy signals.While our computer models say the preceding stocks have short-term bullish characteristics, we always suggest using stops to minimize losses for those occasions when our signals are wrong.If you\u2019d rather diversify by owning an exchange-traded-fund, First Trust  owns four of the five stocks mentioned up top.

The latest PMI info showed business activity in the U.S. Midwest slowed more than expected in April, falling to its lowest since November 2009 as new orders slipped.We didn't see too many earnings results yet this week, but the pace will surely pick up tomorrow. However, M&A/partnership news helped move several names. Shares of Sunoco (  ) closed up 19% on  (  ). Also spiking higher were shares of book retailer Barnes & Noble (  ) on news  in book retailer Barnes & Noble Inc's (  ) digital and college units. There were likely plenty of short-sellers having a tough morning, as BKS shares, which closed at $13.68 on Friday, were recently trading a touch above $22 a share. Ouch! Elsewhere, we saw selling in earnings-related plays Humana (  ) and NYSE Euronext (  ). Coca-Cola (  ) shares edged lower on rumors the company is preparing a major takeover offer for competitor Monster Beverage (  ), or possibly a strategic partnership.As we get set to start the month of May tomorrow, pundits begin to tout the age-old \"sell in May and go away\" strategy. As is the case with many pieces of \"conventional wisdom,\" this strategy is by no means fool-proof. If you'd sold in May 2009 and stayed in cash, for example, you would have missed out on incredible gains.Furthermore, dividend investing isn't about trying to time the markets (which is nearly impossible to do, by the way). Instead, dividend investing is more about consistently investing each month and stockpiling dividend payouts. So if you are a long-term income investor, ignore the scuttlebutt from the media, and proceed as dividend investors always do: searching for the best ideas to invest in month after month.The New York Times ran a great story this past weekend about how start-ups are being advised by venture capital investors to hold off on producing any revenue early in their company's development. This strategy allows the big money chase to push valuations higher and higher as the start-ups raise rounds of financing.We just saw Instagram acquired by Facebook this month for $1 billion, and the company had zero revenues. This trend will last until the spigot shuts off, usually whenever the stock market has a deeper pullback. When that will be is anyone's guess. You can be sure, however, that the wider (mostly oblivious) media will pick up on the start-up valuation insanity long after the correction happens. In the meantime, the stories can't help but make great television.It's funny how the sports world never seems to learn its lesson regarding investing big money in athletes with questionable character issues. One of the big stories out over the weekend highlighted an NFL draft pick selected in the second round. Supposedly, the player had a great deal of talent, and could have been drafted in the very first round.The player had some personal issues when playing at a big-name college, however, and eventually was forced to transfer to a much smaller school to play college football. Additionally, the young athlete has reportedly fathered four different children with three different women (by the age of 23, mind you). If I were looking to invest in talent, whether it was sports-related or not, I'd be looking a bit deeper to see if the risk/reward made any sense to pursue.Whether you are building an organization, or even looking for that perfect spouse, you should pay close attention to any character issues with your prospects. No one is perfect, but rolling the dice on a person with obvious flaws generally isn't a good idea. One lesson I learned from my parents was that when something was very difficult in the beginning, it would probably get even more difficult later on down the line. This rule of thumb is one of my favorites, and I suggest you share it with your own kids and grandkids.In business, the top organizations tend to scope out their talent pool with a microscope. This fact means that young folks should be very careful in their decision-making process. You'd be surprised how important character is when it comes down to deciding between several candidates.We just debuted our brand new 275-page eBook, exclusively on Dividend.com!

I think that lots of people enter another world when they get off the plane at McCarran International Airport, and in their minds, the dollars in their pockets turn into Monopoly money.If you go to Las Vegas, you have to be aware that you are entering the most tightly engineered mechanism for separating you from your money ever created. Every aspect of the casino experience, down to the pattern of the carpet and the level of light and noise, has been studied obsessively to find out what will induce you to make bets when the odds are not in your favor.You know the odds aren't in your favor because they are available for you to look at. And you have to know that the longer you play the higher the probability that you will lose. It's just the law of statistics, but it's still The Law.But what if you could turn the table of Vegas? That's happened in the past, when statistically minded teams of smart kids showed up and began to count cards at the blackjack tables. The result? Casinos banned them from playing ... forever.The one area I know of where you can actually put the odds on your side is in stock market investing. And specifically, I'm thinking of the Cabot approach to market timing.The basic idea is to avoid the markets when they are in a downtrend and jump in when they are trending up. It's a simple matter of looking at indexes that represent the performance of groups of stocks, and observing whether they're above their 25- and 50-day moving averages. (You can see the details on how this works by  )Think about this for a minute. If you were at a craps table in Las Vegas and there was a little light on the table that told you when the odds had shifted in your favor, what would you do? Personally, I'd sit there with my hands in my pocket until the light went on.You might also think about it in terms of a sailing ship getting ready to leave the harbor. Traditionally, sea captains would wait until the tide was going out before lifting the anchor. Any captain who tried to get under way while fighting the current would soon have been an ex-captain.Investing in growth stocks (and that's the style that I use) requires a big helping of discipline with a side order of patience. Markets will try to pull you in before the odds are truly in your favor. And you'll be tempted to jump the gun and roll the dice before the light goes on.Don't do it. Odds are you'll regret it. And, as Las Vegas teaches us, you can't really fight the odds.---Here's this week's Contrary Opinion Button. Remember, you can always view all of the buttons by Clever. It means simply that groupthink can never bring above-average performance. Decades ago, the marketing people at IBM popularized the phrase, \"No one ever got fired for buying IBM equipment.\" Trouble is, those people who opted for the safety of the herd never got beyond middle management. [Editor's Note: Investing is a risky business, but managing that risk by following what the herd is doing just creates new risks. Consensus is just one more way of being wrong with confidence. Thinking for yourself isn't comfortable, but the rewards are great.]---In case you didn't get a chance to read all the issues of  this week and want to catch up on any investing and stock tips you might have missed, there are links below to each issue.In Monday's CWA, Tim Lutts approves of private businesses taking over the job of launching satellites and servicing the International Space Station.

I say \"inevitable\" because one of the few truths about the stock market is contained within the old axiom of \"what goes up must come down.\" (Which was referring to gravity, but still applies here.)The whipsaw action of earlier this week made that clear; Monday and Tuesday morning saw the market go up, while a sharp reversal Tuesday afternoon and a gap down on Wednesday morning erased those gains. This leaves the intermediate-term trend of the market squarely on the bearish side of the needle. And because of this, you're left with a single question: What do you do now?There are a few options facing investors dealing with a downturn like this. First is to completely cash out your portfolio and wait for the market to turn around. This is perfectly all right as a method as it guarantees that you'll have the liquidity needed to jump into the market when it starts to swing higher again. This means you can watch the downswing of the correction without worrying about losing your shirt if more stocks begin hitting lower highs and lower lows.However, one key downside of cashing out your entire portfolio is that you're not in the best position to take advantage of any potential upswing. Neither you nor I know when the correction will stop and stocks trend higher again, so completely cashing out your portfolio strikes me as a bet that there won't be any gains made in the next few months.The second option for dealing with a market correction is to sell your weakest stocks when the market trend turns but let your strongest stocks ride. This is the strategy of  Editor Mike Cintolo, as well as that of  Editor Paul Goodwin. Mike and Paul both have high percentages of their portfolios in cash right now--the Market Letter portfolio is 59% in cash and the  model portfolio is 50% in cash. (It's worth noting that Mike's been trimming his portfolio since his market-timing indicators started sending warning signals on April 10 and Paul's been trimming his portfolio since the end of February.)For growth investors like Mike and Paul, this strategy makes a lot of sense. If the market is weak, then moving to protect the gains of your portfolio is a sound idea. And holding onto your strongest stocks also allows you to take advantage of the inevitable upmove in the market whenever it decides to happen. For more details on Mike's strategy,  , and for more on Paul's strategy you can  .The third way of dealing with a market correction is to not cash out your holdings at all, and in fact to purchase even more stocks. The reasoning behind this is that as the broad market declines, undervalued stocks of good companies become available for the savvy investor.This third approach is what Roy Ward practices in  . It's the classic buy low, sell high mentality and market conditions like today's showcase the  strength even more than market advances. Benjamin Graham, the creator of the value-investing system Roy adapted in the 1960s, enjoyed average returns of 20% per year no matter what the condition of the broad market.The reason for this is Graham didn't get suckered in by the hype surrounding stocks like  or  . He applied his system of security analysis to determine the underlying value of a company. If the company was at a decent discount to what Graham determined was fair value, then he purchased the stock. Once those factors didn't line up ... well then he sold it and invested in another stock instead.Roy's system helps you take advantage of any advance in the broad market. If you're interested in Roy's picks, which have included  ) at 257 (he's still holding), please  .Those are only three methods of protecting your gains in a market correction. None of them are better than any of the others, and the one you choose depends more on your risk tolerance than anything else. I'll also leave you with one more thing. No matter how you deal with a market decline, the best thing you can do is stick with the system that works for you.--- Here's this week's Contrary Opinion Button. Remember, you can always view all of the buttons by The digital font of the first number tells you this button was likely created in the early 1970s, and from that we get a clue to its meaning-that the \"modern world,\" meaning at least the widespread use of computers and possibly the evolution of the oligarchical collectivist society as depicted in George Orwell's novel, might arise within the next decade. Happily, it didn't, and the major factors behind successful investments remain unchanged.---In case you didn't get a chance to read all the issues of  this week and want to catch up on any investing and stock tips you might have missed, there are links below to each issue.Cabot Wealth Advisory 5/21/12 -- The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of Options TradingOn Monday,  Rick Pendergraft discussed how crucial proper money management is when it comes to options trading.On Thursday, Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter Editor J. Royden Ward discussed how to find undervalued stocks in the current market environment using a simple screening process. Featured stocks:  and Happy Investing,Matt DelmanEditor, The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoWith all of the headwinds swirling around stocks today, many investors are seeking the safety of cash. It's a wise move, but not for the reasons you may think. Cash is not just \"safe,\" but it is also firepower for the next major upward move in the stockmarket . Right now, the  is tumbling, but it's crucial for you to be in a position to jump into the market when a bottom has come in. You'll know it's there when the market is no longer plunging (or occasionally surging) and instead is trading in a tighter range.So if you don't have cash on hand right now, where do you find it? Among your portfolio's best performers. It may seem counterintuitive to part with your most impressive stock picks right now, but you need to know two things. First, they may eventually succumb to the current weak stock market, and their likely higher-than-normal price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios means they could fall by a hefty amount. Second, the losers in your portfolio are just as often a victim of poor  , and can often be oversold in these times of distress.With that in mind, I've compiled a list of 2012's top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 and S&P 400 (which is comprised of  stocks). Every one is up at least 25% since the year began, and all sport a forward multiple that is at least 50% higher than the  (based on both 2012 and 2013  forecasts).I got a chance to dig into this group, and have drawn a clear conclusion. These stocks have mostly moved up for justifiable reasons and don't necessarily make good short candidates. But in many instances, it's simply hard to see any further upside from here. So converting them into cash right now makes ample sense -- especially if you think the market may slip further from here.Take  as an example. The company caught the market off-guard in mid-April by announcing the sale of roughly 800 patents (and the licensing of 300 more) to  for roughly $1.06 billion.  instantly shot up, but now that this one-time event has passed, investors should realize this is a company still struggling for relevance. First-quarter sales and operating profits were roughly 5% below year-ago levels. And though management has done a nice job of stemming even deeper erosion, it's hard to see how AOL will again be a growing company. is another stock that may have already locked in much of its gains. The maker of energy drinks has been a very solid growth story, and has an impressive stock chart to show for it.Yet the company's current growth spurt may be a bit deceiving. Sales grew between 10% and 15% in 2008, 2009 and 2010, before shooting up 31% to $1.7 billion in 2011. Sales are on track to rise another 25% this year, surpassing the $2 billion mark. But it's unclear if sales can keep rising at a fast pace. Analysts currently expect sales growth to slow to around 15% in 2013 and 2014. But one never knows if a market is partially saturated or fully saturated until the moment that growth cools.Meanwhile, it's hard to find a beverage stock that trades for nearly 30 times next year's  forecasts -- and for good reason. The broader beverage category grows very slowly, and the energy drink segment will eventually feel that pull as well.Part of the reason this stock is so richly-valued is that rumors have swirled that  or others might want to buy the company. I discount those rumors, but if I'm wrong, then this would be a bad stock to short. Yet it surely looks like a good candidate for profit-taking, as expectations of a further expansion in the forward multiple seem hard to digest.Lastly, investors have done very well by investing in  , but caution is warranted here as well. Cerner's management is outstanding, capitalizing on the many advantages offered up by the transition toward digital medical records. But a pair of companies in this segment --  and  -- have stumbled badly recently due to poor execution, but also partially due to a market slowdown in the face of the Supreme Court's review of health care reform. This isn't to suggest that Cerner is primed to deliver a bad quarter, but the forward multiple looks pretty rich for a company in an industry showing signs of some growing pains. It would be nuts to short a great company like Cerner, but perhaps equally unwise to expect further major upside if you own it.[block:block=16]Risks to Consider:  In a rising market, it's often wise to \"let your winners ride.\" But in a much tougher market, winning stocks can quickly become vulnerable stocks. You may be able to re-purchase these stocks at lower prices if the market's downward pull finally affects them. But for now, the wisestoption may be to sell the stocks on this list.[  If you haven't heard about this unique opportunity, then I want to tell you about it now.

It's still a good idea to have your stocks on short leashes though. Featured stocks:  and  . Click below to watch the video!---Robin Carpenter has been analyzing the movements of the stock market since the 1970s, when he founded The Stock Market Laboratory to provide technical analysis to portfolio managers. Robin is also a pioneer of modern market analysis, having originated many statistical models such as moving beta, cross-sectional skew and dispersion, and developed investing strategies based on alpha hedging and market timing.For more than two decades, Robin has run Carpenter Analytical Services in Hanover, New Hampshire, which provides statistical and analytical services to investment professionals. He joined the Cabot team in September 2011 with the launch of  . Today, Robin's taken the time to chat with me about his interest in market analysis, the state of the current market and a little about exchange-traded funds.Matt: How and when did you first become interested in market analysis? When I was in high school, I was given a book, written by Joseph Granville, with the somewhat clumsy title \"A Strategy of  Timing for Maximum Profit.\" I read that book (and a few others) several times. And so I began collecting market data and testing ideas. Unlike today, market data had to be compiled literally by hand, and calculations were mostly by slide rule and recorded on paper.Doing all that by hand would seem unbearably tedious today, but back then it was just the way it was done. And by the way, it's not a bad way to start. There's something about actually crunching numbers the hard way--recording, computing, comparing, adjusting--that helps to internalize relationships. It's slow, and it's cumbersome, but it gets things inside your head in a way that slick software and instant computing doesn't do so well. The first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were substitutes for broad index mutual funds, with the added benefit of low fees and intra-day liquidity. They're still that, but now there are specialized ETFs that focus on sectors, industries, commodities and alternative asset classes. It was this \"slicing and dicing\" that attracted me, not for investment at first, but as proxies for the indexes they track. They provide a fast, easy and cheap way to follow the ebbs and flows of the markets. If you want to measure how micro-cap stocks are doing, or value stocks, or maybe silver, or the U.S. dollar or other currencies, there's an ETF (or several) tracking it. They give a quick, reliable read on what's up, with updates available throughout the day. And it's almost free.A huge amount of market differentiation--what's strong and what's weak--is accounted for by sectors, industries or asset classes. If Utilities are strong, they're all strong. (Well, almost all.) If regional banks are weak, they're usually all weak. And it's just a lot easier (for me, anyway) to assess prospects by type of business than to search for specific strengths or weaknesses in hundreds of individual companies.Robin: I learned of a sector selection model that has a solid record of outperforming the market, and that is based on quantitatively objective economic analyses. I did a thorough review of its selection performance--right down to daily fluctuations--and am persuaded that it's valid and successful in identifying sectors that usually outperform the S&P 500, and with less volatility.I realized that if the selection model were combined with good market timing, it could be the basis of a unique service. I had met Tim Lutts, president of Cabot, a few years earlier, and I remembered he said his subscribers have a high interest in ETFs. I knew Cabot had a timing model that is also quantitative and objective. So I met with Tim and we back-tested the selection and timing in combination. The tests were successful, so we designed  to meet that need. The selection model is really pretty complicated. Unlike most sector models, we can't say XYZ sector is Favored because of on particular factor, say, interest rates. Or because of inventories or employment data. In effect, the model generates a whole profile of economic factors and looks to see what sectors have excelled in the past when conditions were \"like that.\" As I mentioned, there's now a really full range of ETF types available. We still have the very broad index ETFs (like SPY tracking the S&P, or IWM tracking the Russell 2000). We have sectors (like the SPDR sector ETFs we use), and we have individual industries (like GDX for gold miners or IYT for transportation). The very broad indexes wouldn't give us a basis for differentiation. The narrow industries might work OK over time, but the narrower the target, the higher the chance idiosyncratic surprises will occur. So the SPDR sectors balance those issues, giving sector specificity for differentiation, while each sector includes a limited range of industries that provides partial diversification within the genre.Also, the SPDR sector ETFs are very liquid, so we always know we can get in or get out when a change is called for. Well, I don't know that there's a \"type of person,\" but there is a \"type of objective.\" Investors who find it easier to understand the economic dynamics of a whole class of securities like a sector or industry--and wish to gain or shed exposure to that class--are natural ETF users. Alternatively, an investor seeking broad exposure but who wants to manage the weightings (rather than just buy the SPDR S&P 500 (  ) with its weightings) can do it with ETFs. (And there are even individual ETFs that offer S&P sectors in proportions different from the S&P weights.) We are now in a downtrend as defined by the Cabot Tides indicator. In a downtrend, most stocks go down, and almost all sectors go down. As a result, the  is holding cash. That's how the System works. So right now we're preserving buying power for the next Buy signal. When that signal comes, most ETFs will move higher with the averages. We hope and expect that the Cabot Favored ETF sectors will be stronger than average. But the market is a constant kaleidoscope and we'll have to peer closely at that when the time comes.Matt: Thanks for taking the time to talk with me.
