{"Content": ["When it comes to biotech stocks, the recent focus has been on companies working on coronavirus treatments or prevention. While it's fine to jump on that bandwagon, there are other biotech investment opportunities that may not double in value overnight but will surely bear fruit in the long term.I'm thinking of  and  . Shares of both companies fell as the market crashed but have proved their resilience in the following weeks. Vertex and BioMarin\u00a0now are up 30% and 25%, respectively, this year. Meanwhile, the  is down 5.7%.\u00a0Here's why these two stocks are a buy right now.Image source: Getty Images.Vertex is a leader in treatments for cystic fibrosis, a progressive genetic disease\u00a0that affects various organs but is most known for its impact on the lungs. That portfolio of products may contribute more than $10 billion to revenue in 2028, according to Morningstar.Vertex also is working on investigational drugs\u00a0for pain, sickle cell disease, and beta thalassemia. Those programs are in phase 2 or earlier studies, so revenue there is years down the road. Even though Vertex's cystic fibrosis revenue is climbing, additional disease areas offer future growth potential that may compensate for any slowdown in sales of older drugs.For now, though, a cystic fibrosis drug approved\u00a0in October is proving to be key to revenue growth. Trikafta, a combination medication with the potential to treat up to 90% of people with cystic fibrosis, generated $420 million\u00a0in the fourth quarter -- its first quarter on the market -- and revenue more than doubled to $895 million\u00a0in the first quarter. Including Trikafta, Vertex has four\u00a0products on the market.Vertex's annual revenue has climbed for the past five years, and in spite of the coronavirus slowing some clinical trials, the company has faced limited headwinds from the current health crisis. Total product revenue\u00a0increased 77%, led by Trikafta, in the first quarter. And Vertex revised total product revenue higher for the year -- to a range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion from the range of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion.With Vertex, revenue is on the rise and there's potential for medicines in disease areas beyond cystic fibrosis, so now may be a good time to invest in Vertex.BioMarin has seven\u00a0products on the market, each for rare genetic diseases such as late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2)\u00a0-- a pediatric brain disorder -- and phenylketonuria (PKU) -- a metabolic disorder.Annual revenue\u00a0has been climbing at BioMarin for more than a decade, and that trend seems likely to continue. Palynziq, approved\u00a0for PKU in 2018, posted a 181% increase in first-quarter revenue due to maintenance treatments and new patients. And sales of Brineura for CLN2 rose 97% as it gained new patients worldwide. Overall, total revenue rose 25% to $502 million for the quarter.Chief executive officer Jean-Jacques Bienaime said\u00a0in the earnings report that 2020 would be \"transformational\" for BioMarin for two reasons. For the full year, the company expects to be profitable for the first time on a  basis. And the potential approval of BioMarin's valoctocogene roxaparvovec would make it the first approval of a gene therapy for any type of hemophilia.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reviewing valoctocogene roxaparvovec for severe hemophilia A and is set to issue a decision by Aug. 21. European regulatory authorities are also reviewing the treatment, and their decision is expected by early next year. In the bleeding disorder hemophilia A, patients don't have enough of clotting factor VIII. BioMarin's infusion introduces a new gene\u00a0that would enable the body to produce factor VIII. About 20,000 Americans are living with the disorder, according to the Hemophilia Federation of America.As for the coronavirus, BioMarin isn't immune to its impact. The company reduced\u00a0full-year guidance for sales of most of its products, primarily due to interruptions like missed infusion appointments or delays to start new treatments. This is temporary and doesn't change my outlook on the company.BioMarin's annual revenue history, the  (outside of coronavirus impact), and the potential approval of the company's hemophilia A drug are reasons these  are a buy right now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. It's Wednesday, June 3, Wildcard Wednesday. We'll be talking about how one company working on a COVID vaccine is providing some awesome lessons to investors this week. I'm your host Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined by 's completely undistinguished contributor, Brian Feroldi. Love that Brian writes his own title and manages to surprise me pretty much every time. Brian, how are you doing? Dylan, if I can get a smile out of you, I'm doing my job right. I'm doing great; how are you doing? [laughs] It's always a great start to the show, I think. I mean, for folks that are listening, I'm sure you can hear me smiling.A lot of news, a lot of news going on, period, Brian, but I think you know obviously one of the big stories has been COVID and coronavirus and so many companies addressing the coronavirus epidemic or pandemic with different potential vaccines. And this is going to take us into a space that you are far more familiar with, I can kind of tread lightly.And I'm so happy to have you on the show, because we're going to be talking about this company , who, a lot of people probably hadn't heard of up until maybe two months ago and that's really in large part due to COVID. Yes. This company has been on fire in 2020. And we've seen exactly that with lots of companies that have been identified as coronavirus stocks. Basically, investors and Wall Street and speculators and whoever, can't get enough of so many of these businesses.But, yeah, the company we're going to focus on today is Moderna, the ticker symbol there is MRNA. We'll get to what that means in a couple of seconds. But this company came public in December of 2018. They are a clinical stage biotechnology company, which means that they do not yet have a single product on the market, they have a pretty robust pipeline but none of their products have made it all the way through to FDA approval and are on the market yet.That's pretty typical. We see lots of companies come public at that stage because they're burning through capital and they need cash infusions regularly to fund their clinical trials. And what makes this company, kind of, special is their drug development technology is based on messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA, hence the ticker. And mRNA plays a very fundamental role in human biology. It's a single-stranded molecule that carries genetic code from DNA in a cell's nucleus to ribosomes, and ribosomes are in cells and they're the protein-making machinery. So, the theory behind this company is that, by developing mRNA-based drugs and injecting them into a patient, you can instruct the patient's own cells to create proteins that then go on to prevent, treat or even in some cases, cure diseases.And although this company, again, is in the clinical stage, it actually has a pretty impressive pipeline. 23 drugs, 23 different mRNA drugs are in development; they're at various stages. 13 of them are already in the clinic. And four of them are currently in Phase II, and they're being studied to treat a huge variety of diseases; vaccines for Zika, RSV, [Respiratory Syncytial Virus] influenza, cancer and, of course, COVID-19. Brian, I think you did a really good job there of dusting off the junior year biology Barbara McGuirk [laughs] class notes that I had somewhere in the back of my brain. You know, this stuff can get very heavy, very quickly for people that aren't familiar with the space. And the science is well beyond the scope of what I can explain, but I think for people that are not used to looking at these types of businesses, it's really worth emphasizing what clinical stage and zero products mean.And to put some numbers to it, because you can say, oh, sure they don't have any products but they are a business. As of March 31, 2020, they had $50 million in trailing 12-month sales, and even at what was a lower valuation prior to the COVID explosion that caused them to really balloon, they were around $8 billion. That puts them at a valuation of 160X sales. So, when you are looking at a company that is biotech clinical stage, and doesn't have any products, it's a very different investment style than a lot of the stuff that we tend to focus on, especially on the tech show where we're looking for easy wins, companies that have consistent, recurring revenue. The story is totally different with these kinds of businesses.And you really, in a very real way, cannot use many of the metrics that we talk about all this time on the show to attempt to value these companies. You certainly brought up the price-to-sales ratio, and listeners might be confused about how a clinical stage company has revenue in the first place, and they get those through partnership agreements, milestone payments with a few of their partners, they have a partnership in place with , for example. So, it's fairly typical that when they strike these partnerships up, as the drugs make their way through the pipeline, their partners give them milestone payments along the way. And that does bring in some revenue.But to your point, if you just looked at this company's price-to-sales ratio, you would see an absurd number that would make  look like a bargain, basically. But you can't look at it that way, because oftentimes, once a company goes and actually gets a drug from the clinic into the market, the sales growth is just obscene. I mean, it's obscene, it's not impossible for a company to go from basically $0 to $1 billion in sales in a very short period of time. So, I would just say, you have to keep that in mind when you're talking about these. Oftentimes they are valued based on what's known as peak sales potential, like, what is the peak sales of a drug in the pipeline, so. And it's a revenue multiple of that number. So, valuation is always tricky in general, it's 1000X trickier when it comes to clinical stage biotech. Yeah, we often say that the market is forward-looking, right? And we are trying to understand what a business could blossom into, and that's particularly true in this space. Because you have a pipeline of drugs, you hope, if you're a shareholder of one of these businesses, that they are able to make it through all the necessary trials in order to ultimately hit the market, all the necessary stages, to ultimately hit the market. And then there's some approximation of the likelihood of that happening and the market opportunity and that's where you get this huge multibillion dollar valuation for a company that has pretty much nothing, it's basically a rounding error in sales and it isn't due to any of their actual drug sales, like you said before, it's due to those milestones.So, it already, I think, to an outside investor would have looked \"expensive.\" And then all of the coronavirus news hit, Brian, and the story changed very dramatically. You know, there's always excitement about the biotech space, because it's a little bit more speculative, but that really ramped up when you look at March, [laughs] basically, for this business. Yeah. So, this is a company that, again, when it came public in 2018, basically traded sideways for the following 18 months, floating somewhere between a valuation of $5 billion and $8 billion, which by the way, those are big numbers, that's a pretty sizable company that's just in the clinical stage. However, at the start of this year and coronavirus really just took over everything, this company was identified as a coronavirus stock and it has just been a rocket ship. The company is currently up 200%, more than 200% since the start of the year. Just a few weeks ago that number was over 300% year-to-date. This company currently sports a market cap that is worth $22 billion. That's big, that's really big. In fact, it's actually bigger than many biotechs that have been on the market far longer periods of time and are producing revenue. Companies like , , , , , those companies are trading in the multibillion valuations, but they actually have made it through to the clinic. So, that number, more than anything, tells me that there is a lots of excitement and hype built into this company right now. A big part of that excitement and hype, Brian, is because the company put out some releases showing that there are some positive signs when it comes to some of their developed drugs possibly being a COVID vaccine. Yeah, exactly. So, they have a COVID-19 vaccine in development, the drug is called mRNA-127, it was in a Phase I study; again, the very first phase study. And the company did release some very encouraging results a few weeks ago from this study. So, they announced that this Phase I study had three cohorts of patients, each cohort had 15 patients in it each. And they were given different dosages of these drugs, so either 25 micrograms, a 100 micrograms or 250 micrograms. And the exciting thing here is the company issued a press release that said that of the first eight patients to release this, all of them were shown to have antibody levels in their body that was similar to those seen from patients who recovered from COVID-19 and the drug was also shown to be safe and well-tolerated.Moderna took that info and they have kicked off a Phase II clinical trial that is going to be a 600-patient trial, but when they release that news information this stock explodes higher. And it actually was so exciting, [laughs] it literally took the entire stock market up with it. So, this got a ton of news. Yeah, and I can understand why, I think that people are generally looking for good news. And folks that have been following the COVID story, whether they're hardcore investors or not, have been wondering, you know, who is going to be the company that comes out and really gives us some form of treatment for this thing? What we need to remind folks is this is Phase I, and we're entering Phase II, but you know what, there's more beyond that too, and there has to be that kind of probabilistic analysis to every level of all of this. The excitement was, kind of, lightning in a bottle, given everything [laughs] that's going on in the world. Yeah, completely. And you understand why the world focused on this and investors rallied, the entire market rallied because of this, because we're so desperate for treatment options and a vaccine for this disease; it's just been terrible. But the company could be in a little bit of hot water based on that results, because some people are accusing them of overhyping their results and making too big a deal out of it, the results that were released on May 18.And just to let listeners know, just within a few hours after releasing that results, this company did a secondary offering and they sold 20 million shares to the public at $76, which added $1.34 billion into their pockets. Now, that makes sense. You definitely want to take [laughs] advantage of a very high-priced stock. This company is going to be losing money for many years as it invests in its pipeline down the road, but also there was when we learned that the CEO and several other executives were also selling stock after that huge rally, and they netted themselves somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million. And then, Moderna's largest shareholder, which is a VC firm called Flagship Pioneering, also sold 1 million shares of stock. And that VC firm was actually a venture fund that was founded by the Co-Founder and Chairman of Moderna. So, there are some out there that are questioning the timing of this result and accusing the company of overhyping results far too early. Yeah. And I think that the reason I want to talk about this today, Brian, was, not only is this a company that is, kind of, squarely in the focus of the entire business world, I think, right now with really what they're working on and, kind of, being seen as this pureplay vaccine for something that has basically held the entire world in this, kind of, altered state.But also, there are so many interesting lessons for investors that come from this and it's such a great onramp into so many different parts of how companies are funded, how executives sell shares, all of these things. And so, it would be very easy to look at those executive share sales and say, \"Whoa, boy! That's pretty fishy.\" And what you learn after doing some reading is these were scheduled sales, and it's a really important thing to unpack when you are looking at insider sales, whether these are things that are part of a scheduled program or not. Because if it's part of a scheduled program, you don't have to worry nearly as much. And the SEC has actually created a specific system for insiders to do this. Yeah, it's called a 10b5-1 Plan which is just an awesome, super-intuitive name. But these are preset plans where insiders can sit up to sell their stares on a set schedule ahead of time, so that way it minimizes their ability to do exactly what this company is being blamed for, which is pumping-and-dumping. So, that mechanism is in place and we've seen tons of executives use these. I know that Bill Gates has been using this for years to steadily unload his  position, the Founders of Google [] have been doing this for years to unload their position. And the CEO of Moderna has actually been doing that prior to this recent run-up. In fact, he actually sold a big chunk of stock in January prior to the huge run-up. So, I think that is their saving grace at this point.Although, it is still a little -- you know, it does strike a chord that they seem to have rushed this press release out to market and then the very next day or within the next couple of days, that's when these 10b5-1 plans were set to a sell. So, while the transactions were made way ahead of time, the company had complete control of when that press release went out. So, the optics here still aren't perfect. Yeah. And I think that that's a really good point. Because when we're talking those 10b5-1 plans, which is as much of a mouthful as some of these drug names, Brian, [laughs] you know, it is easy to say it's the set plan, but, you know, management does control when this information comes out and that can sometimes be lost in these conversations.The other interesting part of this is the company's decision to raise money. And we talk about this all the time with IPOs, but if you're a business and you're giving away equity, we see this on  even, right, you are trying to maximize the value of the equity that you're giving away, so that you can -- if you're giving away control of your business, which is kind of what you're doing in a sense with equity, or you're diluting existing shareholders, you want to be doing that at the highest valuation that you can. And in this case, they came pretty darn close to doing it at the [laughs] highest valuation that they could. Yeah. And again, they had complete control over the release of that press release. And they also got some flak for that, because again, even in the press release that was sent out, there was just data for eight patients, and as a reminder this study had 45 in it. So, it was nowhere close to a full dataset. In the company's defense, they did say, we're trying to get this information out there, it was so exciting. And clearly, the world wants information like this to be out there as soon as possible. But there have been several people in the medical community that have pushed back and said, why would you release this so early without giving us the full data set? It was \"practically unheard of\" to do this at this time. And it's also worth pointing that this company wasn't exactly, I mean, they're burning through capital, but they weren't exactly short on cash. As of the end of March, they had about $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents on their book and zero long-term debt. Yes, they are setting fire to tons of capital at a huge pace. So, there's also that to consider. And management did say, oh, we were thinking about raising capital in March and it just got accelerated due to the share price going parabolic.So, on the one hand, if you are a shareholder, yes, you want this company to be adding cash to its balance sheet at advantageous prices, which it definitely did. On the flip side, again, the optics here are not great. Yeah. And there's, kind of, that difference between the incentives for people that are current shareholders and the incentives for people that would be shareholders, right? And we see this massive run up, we see all this great news. And perhaps, it's a little bit of an incomplete story, you know, I saw a lot of press in the medical community looking at this and saying, well, we're seeing a lot more language here than we are numbers when it comes to this stuff, and this is, to your point earlier, a little unusual. And you could argue that that was done intentionally.But current shareholders, people who owned the stock before their announcement, are probably thrilled. People who saw what was happening bought into the hype train on this are probably pretty disappointed, because shares have come back down to earth as we've started to sift through the data and really see that it's pretty limited. Yeah. And it's also worth pointing out that it's not like Moderna is the only stock that is going absolutely bonkers here because of the COVID-19, we've seen tons of companies from across the healthcare spectrum just go absolutely bonkers this year based on saying, hey, we have a COVID-19 vaccine too or, hey, we're developing a test or, hey, we have a treatment for it.Just to throw out some other companies; , which has been a biotech that has been under huge pressure for a long, long time, focused on vaccines, that stock is up over 1,100% since the start of the year. , up 334%. , up 196%. And when you get down to the small and penny cap land the percentage gains are even larger. So, that just shows me that there is an incredible amount of speculation interest in these types of businesses right now. And what's unfortunate for me is, you know, when people are beginning their investing journey, they look at stuff like what are the highest gainers year-to-date, and [laughs] that's, you know, where a lot of research will start. And we talked before about just how this is a totally different investing world than most companies. The classic valuation metrics don't really work. The product pipeline is totally different. And the news that these businesses trade on is totally different. And so, what I think is unfortunate is very novice investors might get lured into this with very little idea of what's really going on, whether it's the business fundamentals or the reality of the share price and valuation and how stable that is, because it's so news-driven. Hmm-mmm. And, Dylan, we're on Fool TV right now, this whole live thing we have going on for basically since the start of this pandemic. And one of our viewers, a couple of days ago shared with me this great Google trends map which showed the google search for the word \"stock trading\" over time and how it basically held steady, and then in March it just went straight up. So, people are sitting at home and they're deciding, \"Hey, it's a good time for me to learn about investing,\" and unfortunately, they're going right for the trading aspect of things which is something that, obviously, we rail against.But to your point, the hype cycle that we've seen over and over again in the markets; I mean, just within the last couple of years we've seen massive interest in things, like, cryptocurrencies, marijuana stocks, a few years before that there was 3D printing stocks were all the rage, a couple years before that when there was worries about hyperinflation galore, gold and silver stocks were in the middle of the hype cycle. To me, there's no doubt that so many of these coronavirus stocks are exactly in the middle of that. And typically, when you see the hype like that, it doesn't end well.Yeah. And I mean, there are very legitimate industries with cash flow producing businesses that also go through that same hype cycle. And I think that that's why, and we talk so much about the idea of dollar-cost averaging with positions, not having your cost basis tied to any one point in time. This is a big part of that, because you can own a really great business that happens to have gotten caught at a period where expectations were way out of hand, the news was just too positive. And if that's your only position in that business, you're going to be waiting a long time for that to be a positive position for you. If over time you're able to buy-in at several different points, smooth it out, you are far more likely to enjoy the long-term gains and benefits of this business, because it can take several years for businesses to wind up going back to where they peaked when expectations were really high. Yeah, exactly. And when I first got started investing and didn't know anything, I guarantee you, if I was starting today, I would be investing in coronavirus stocks. Because when you know nothing you want to go where things are hot and where you think making 10% returns per day is what you should be going for, none of that 10% per year garbage, you want 10% returns per day. And how do you do that? Well, when I first started, I thought you do that by buying unprofitable, speculative penny stocks. And right now, we're just in a time in our history when there's huge demand for those kinds of things. So, no surprise to see that there's lots of companies out there that are hyping that they are also a COVID-19 stock and they're seeing their share prices go up because of it. So, I have an unfortunate feeling that many new investors are setting themselves up to learn a lesson, all I can say is, I learned that same lesson [laughs] myself 15 years ago. Yeah. I looked at a lot of my, kind of, early investing decisions, a lot of my early stock purchases as tuition payments. And you know, if you do it right and you're long-term oriented, those tuition payments don't wind up being a cost, they actually wind up being something that grows for you. But very often if you are buying penny stocks, they wind up truly being an expense and it can be a quick and expensive lesson to learn. But the temptation is there, when you don't have a lot of money and you see low share prices, I can see why people get caught up in all of that stuff.Brian, I think to recap all of this and, kind of, just hammer home the investing lessons from this Moderna thing, when it comes to insider buys and sells don't overweight your expectations to simply seeing them, understand that some of these things are scheduled. And the more important thing with this one is, the timing of the other news [laughs] that the company is choosing to release, less so the sale itself. We saw the selling that management was already, kind of, doing throughout the year. And then I think also, the biggest thing is, for me, like, I don't know the space well enough to invest in it, even having spent a lot of time [laughs] researching this company in order to do the show with you, I feel like I'm barely holding water having this conversation with someone who knows healthcare a lot better. And while it's so tempting to hop into these megatrends, you got to know your circle of competence and you got to know how big it is and where the boundary is. Yep, that's exactly right. And biotechnology is its own special beast, and boy, is it hard, because companies can have near-flawless Phase II data and the drug could look like the next wonder drug. And then when they enter Phase III, it just crashes and burns. I've seen that so many times. So, investing in general is difficult but when you [laughs] go for biotech, the difficulty factor gets exponentially harder.And just to circle back on something you said about insider buying and selling, we get asked questions about that all the time, and so the insider is selling should I be concerned? And sometimes the media also catches on to things and really inflates them up. I remember seeing a couple weeks ago, Mark Zuckerberg sold $500 million of 's stock. And if that's the only thing you knew, you'd be like, wow! He must be willing to get out. And then you realize, oh, he also has probably $30 billion [laughs] still riding on Facebook. So, context is everything.But an insider sells for a huge number of reasons, you never know what the reason is, why they're selling. Maybe they're getting divorced, maybe they're building a house, maybe they have an enormous tax bill that they're trying to pay, maybe they want to diversify their investments into other things. So, always try and put these things in context when you see huge insider selling or insider buying. Ask yourself, was it done automatically ahead of time or was it done to take advantage of a stock price? And stay focused on whether [laughs] or not you believe in the long-term potential of the business. Because insiders, even though they're selling, they can sometimes get that wrong and the stock can continue to rally from there. For the folks that are newer to the biotech space, you're going to be able to follow Moderna and basically go through Phase I, II and III, and see exactly what that process looks like for a business in a very high-profile way. We mentioned Phase II clinical trials starting with 600 patients. If all goes well there, there might be some amendments to the process just given that there is a very large public need for this to be out there, if results are promising, but you can bet there's probably going to be a Phase III somewhere too. And if you're new, this is a great story to track because it's going to give you a very well-reported example too, of what the biotech process looks like, what the drug pipeline process looks like. And very often you, kind of, have to follow inside industry mags to really get that coverage consistently. Yep. And the other thing, I will throw out there, Dylan, is, it's not like Moderna is the only company working on a COVID-19 vaccine. At last count, I think we had 28 different companies that were working on vaccines of their own. 21 of them are publicly traded and in different size scales here. So, while this drug is certainly exciting, it's one of the leaders, we're all rooting for it, just like we're rooting for basically every COVID-19 drug to come out. Picking the winner, picking which drug is going to come to market first is incredibly hard. I mean, it is a dice roll of a dice roll, it is truly gambling at this stage of the game.So, just keep that in mind, don't focus your attention or don't make a huge bet based on one drug, just because of the results that you see now, just realize that there is so much interest in this and there is so much R&D going after this, it's impossible to say which company is going to win the race.

While most stocks have languished in 2020, the biotech's shares are up 12% so far this year.BioMarin could pick up even more momentum now. The company announced its first-quarter results after the market closed on Wednesday. Here are the highlights from BioMarin's Q1 update.Image source: Getty Images.BioMarin announced Q1 revenue of $502.1 million, a 25% jump from the $400.7 million reported in the same quarter of 2019. This result also handily beat the average analysts' revenue estimate of $468.8 million.The company reported net income in the first quarter of $81.4 million, or $0.44 per share, based on generally accepted accounting principles (). This marked a significant improvement from the prior-year period when BioMarin posted a GAAP net loss of\u00a0$56.5 million, or $0.32 per share.BioMarin's adjusted net income in the first quarter totaled $116.5 million. This translated to adjusted earnings of $0.62 per share based on the biotech's weighted average of its outstanding diluted common shares. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) trounced the consensus Wall Street estimate of $0.05 per share.BioMarin currently has six approved products on the market. All of them delivered solid sales growth in the first quarter.Naglazyme ranks as the biotech's top-selling product. Sales for the drug, which treats rare genetic enzyme disorder mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI), jumped 32% year over year in Q1 to $27.4 million, with growth driven primarily in Russia and Brazil.The company's real rising stars, though, were two other enzyme replacement therapies targeting rare genetic diseases. Sales for Palynziq skyrocketed 181% year over year to $22.3 million. Sales for Brineura soared 97% higher to $24 million.BioMarin's three other drugs also performed well in Q1. Sales for rare-disease drug Kuvan totaled $15.1 million, up 14% from the prior-year period. Vimizim, which is approved for treating rare genetic disease\u00a0Morquio A, generated sales of $11.4 million, a 9% year-over-year increase. Sales for\u00a0Aldurazyme, which treats\u00a0Hurler and Hurler-Scheie forms of rare genetic disease mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), came in at $10.4 million, up 23% year over year.This sales growth served as the primary driver of BioMarin's improving bottom line. The company also benefited from a $59.5 million gain from the sale of its Firdapse business as well as a decline in research and development costs.There was good news and bad news with BioMarin's full-year 2020 outlook. The company lowered its full-year revenue outlook due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. BioMarin now expects full-year revenue will be between $1.85 billion and $1.95 billion compared to its previous guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion.However, the drugmaker still expects GAAP net income between $20 million and $80 million, with non-GAAP earnings between $26 million and $31 million. Notably, BioMarin appears to be on track to achieve its first year of profitability on a GAAP basis -- an important milestone for any company.While the ongoing COVID-19 crisis could continue to disrupt patients being treated with BioMarin's existing drugs, the  should have several catalysts that could propel its stock higher this year.\u00a0BioMarin CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime even said that \"2020 is expected to be a transformational year\" for the company.He particularly singled out the company's anticipated FDA approval of gene therapy\u00a0valoctocogene roxaparvovec in treating severe hemophilia A. The FDA is set to make its approval decision by Aug. 21, 2020.

What's more, the social distancing measures being used to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have badly damaged the global economy and global supply chains and have put a number of industries, such as airlines, brick-and-mortar retailers, and sit-down restaurants, in a serious financial bind.\u00a0The good news is that this pandemic will eventually end. Several pharmaceutical companies are trialing a variety of novel therapeutics that could shorten the clinical course of the disease and perhaps lessen its severity in acute cases, leading to fewer fatalities. Moreover, numerous vaccine candidates are under development, some of which could be available for widespread use as soon as mid-2021.Image source: Getty Images.So from an investing perspective, this coronavirus-induced correction should ultimately play out like nearly all other bear markets throughout history. Specifically, bear markets have rarely persisted for periods longer than two years, and most fade away in about 14 months. What this means is that investors willing to buy high-quality equities and hold them for at least five years should come out of this chaotic period in outstanding shape, financially speaking.Which investing vehicles are the best buys right now? Here's a breakdown of 30 of the most attractively priced exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and individual stocks in the market today.One of the easiest and best ways to invest is by buying ETFs that sport low expense ratios. By doing so, you can gain broad exposure to specific economic sectors, without the hassle of buying dozens of individual stocks. While there are literally hundreds of ETFs to choose from, the\u00a0 , the  , and the\u00a0  are three of the most highly regarded among passive fund enthusiasts -- and for good reason.Image source: Getty Images.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF sports an expense ratio of 0.47%, which is reasonable for a top-performing fund. This fund enables investors to take advantage of the red-hot growth in the biotech industry, without the stomach-churning volatility that comes with owning individual biotech stocks. Before this downturn, the\u00a0iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was up by more than 300% over the past 10 years. That's well above the returns on capital generated by the major U.S. stock indices during the same period.\u00a0The Vanguard Consumer Staples Index Fund\u00a0comes with both an ultra-low expense ratio of 0.10% and a noteworthy dividend yield of 2.76%. This fund is composed of numerous defensively oriented blue-chip equities that track the MSCI US Investable Market Index. While the\u00a0Vanguard Consumer Staples Index Fund underperformed the broader markets during the prior decade, it has also lost significantly less of its value during the current sell-off. Thus, this fund is a great way to collect a healthy dividend and conserve capital in an uncertain market environment.The Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund is a true gem in the ETF universe. This  ETF sports an expense ratio of just 0.10% and an annualized yield of 1.4%, and it generated market-crushing returns for investors over the past 10-year period. What's more, the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund has so far held up better than every major stock index in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Blue chips are companies with sound balance sheets, proven economic moats, and healthy free cash flows. They frequently make the esteemed list of Dividend Aristocrats, a select group of companies that have increased their dividends for a minimum of . As a result, these top-shelf equities and highly coveted passive income generators tend to weather economic downturns fairly well. Here are 12 blue chips worth buying right now.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. is a medical device and molecular diagnostic company. The company has raised its dividend for 48 straight years, easily making it a Dividend Aristocrat. Although Abbott's shares are  from the perspective of a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio, the company could benefit enormously from its recently approved COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests. At a minimum, Abbott should remain an outstanding passive income vehicle, and it should continue to be generally immune to this marketwide downturn because of its top-notch portfolio of essential healthcare products.\u00a0 is one of the largest and most visible tech companies in the world today. Even so, the company's shares have been hit hard this year by the COVID-19 pandemic. That's not surprising in the least, given that Apple has already  that it will miss Wall Street's financial targets in 2020. This sizable downturn, though, should prove to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pick up some shares of the tech giant on the cheap. Apple currently offers a modest yield of 1.26%, and Wall Street has the company's average 12-month price target at $310.90 per share. That amounts to a healthy 28.7% upside potential.\u00a0 has turned into a juggernaut following its acquisition of Celgene. The company is currently trading at under 3 times forward-looking sales, it offers an above-average dividend yield of 3.26%, and it sports  such as Opdivo, Revlimid, and Eliquis. Although nothing is guaranteed in the stock market, Bristol stands a great chance of generating market-beating returns for investors over the next five to 10 years.\u00a0 is an oil and gas megagiant. Nonetheless, the company's shares have gotten pounded into the dirt this year in response to the ongoing oil war between Russia and OPEC, which has caused crude oil prices to plummet into the low $20s. On the bright side, Chevron has been \u00a0to protect its highly coveted dividend. Now, Chevron may have to rethink its dividend policy if crude oil prices don't rebound fairly soon. The company's yield, after all, currently stands at a jaw-dropping 6.78%. The bigger picture, though, is that Chevron should eventually rebound and should continue to pay a respectable dividend over the long haul.\u00a0 \u00a0 is a titan of the financial-services sector. The bank's shares, however, have lost almost 40% of their value since the start of 2020 over concerns about falling , along with the potential for a prolonged recession sparked by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While JPMorgan's stock may continue to slump in the coming weeks as the public health crisis deepens, investors should gladly catch this falling knife. JPMorgan has almost $900 billion in cash, it offers a dividend yield of 4.11%, and it's an American institution in many ways. There is no plausible scenario where this top bank stock doesn't recover within the next five years.\u00a0 is a diversified healthcare behemoth. And the company's Dividend Aristocrat status is well earned thanks to its track record of raising its dividend for nearly 58 straight years. Moreover, J&J is one of only two publicly traded companies with a Standard & Poor's AAA credit rating. J&J's dividend yield isn't exactly anything to write home about, at 2.85%. But the company has a long history of beating the broader markets in terms of total returns on capital , when including its dividend. J&J, in turn, arguably deserves a spot in any type of portfolio.\u00a0\u00a0 is the\u00a0quintessential American fast-food restaurant. While the company's top-line has been struggling of late because of the influx of numerous competitors and a shift in American eating habits in general, McDonald's was still forecast to see a nice bump in revenue next year before this pandemic took hold. The company's  in delivery services and new technologies such as self-serve kiosks was expected to be a big boon to its business in 2021 and beyond. Still, McDonald's is a Dividend Aristocrat, it offers a respectable yield of 3.1% at current levels, and it has a decent cash reserve. McDonald's stock is therefore one of the safest passive income plays in this turbulent market right now.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0started off the year on a sour note but has since found its footing as investors flocked to its top-notch dividend yield of 4.62%, strong balance sheet, and above-average near-term outlook. The big draw with this pharma titan is its portfolio of high-growth  that includes products such as\u00a0Vyndaqel, Ibrance, and Xeljanz, combined with the upcoming spinoff of its legacy products business slated for later this year. The bottom line is that Pfizer's days as being one of the worst components of the Dow Jones appear to be drawing to a close.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 had a historically bad first quarter because of the  of the coronavirus on restaurant traffic, major sporting events, and large public entertainment events in general. Even now, though,\u00a0Coca-Cola's stock is anything but cheap, for a variety of reasons. In short, Coca-Cola has been a tremendous cash cow for several generations, and its dividend is a big draw for income investors. At present, Coca-Cola's shares yield a juicy 3.73%, which is well above average for a consumer-staples play. So even though the company's first- and second-quarter earnings are probably going to be downright terrible, this is one blue-chip stock that every investor should want to scoop up on this pullback.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 has been a rare  in this dour market. Investors have piled in to Clorox this year, presumably in anticipation of a spike in demand for disinfectants such as Clorox bleach. In 2020, the company's shares have gained a healthy 15.6% because of its tie-in to the coronavirus. The bad news is that Clorox's shares are now trading at close to 28 times earnings, making it one of the most expensive blue-chip stocks on this list. That said, its dividend yield still stands at an attractive 2.36%, and it should remain a red-hot equity as long as the coronavirus maintains a virtual monopoly on the news cycle.\u00a0 is a downright steal at these levels. After a dreadful , the company's shares are now bumping up against their five-year low and sport a modest dividend yield of 1.81%. Now, the harsh truth is that Disney's theme parks are going to be costly to maintain during the lockdown, and there will be a sharp decline in box office revenue for a good chunk of 2020. That can't be helped in a global pandemic. But Disney is a proven long-term winner because of its outstanding studio entertainment properties such as the  and \u00a0franchises, among many, many others. Bottom line: Disney's stock is almost certainly going to continue to head lower in the weeks ahead, but long-term investors should take definitely advantage of this weakness. This blue-chip stock, after all, will probably post a stunning reversal once this pandemic peters out.\u00a0 is a telecom giant. The company's shares have fallen by around 11% this year, but that's not too bad considering how poorly the broader markets have performed so far in 2020. Investors seem to be sticking with Verizon in the wake of this downturn because of the company's outstanding dividend yield of 4.45%, leadership in the area of 5G technology, and partnership with Disney revolving around the Disney+ streaming service. Verizon does have one of the weaker balance sheets on this list, and it is facing an increasing amount of competition. But the big picture is that Verizon's shares are simply too cheap at 11.7 times earnings, especially for a company that offers a reliable, above-average dividend.\u00a0Megacap companies, or companies with market caps of at least $200 billion, are rarely coveted for their growth prospects. Instead, these towering figures of industry are usually viewed as top-notch passive income vehicles, or capital preservation plays. These two e-commerce titans absolutely demolish this stereotype.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. has been a big winner since its IPO in 2014. The Chinese e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media, and mobile payment megagiant, however, will probably only continue to surge higher in the months and years ahead. The core reason is that Alibaba has invested heavily in new technologies to remain at the cutting edge of its most lucrative markets. Equally as important, China's cloud computing market is expected to see  over the next decade. Alibaba is thus well positioned to deliver market-beating returns for the foreseeable future, despite its monstrous market cap of $510 billion.\u00a0\u00a0has transformed scores of its early shareholders into multimillionaires. Amazon Prime, with its free shipping and online entertainment component, has now attracted over , and the company has built out a first-class data management business known as Amazon Web Services. Amazon, in effect, has weaved its way into the heart of American life. So even though the company's market cap stands at a jaw-dropping $949 billion, its stock should still produce healthy gains over the next decade, thanks to its loyal customer base and highly profitable Web services segment.\u00a0Like their megacap counterparts, large-cap equities, defined as companies with market caps of $10 billion or more, tend to attract conservative-minded investors or those seeking a safe dividend. However, these three large-cap stocks are unique in that they are best viewed as top-notch growth stocks.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. is a rare-disease drugmaker with multiple products on the market. So far this year, BioMarin's shares have essentially traded sideways, down 0.4%. The company has been able to swim against the current during this pandemic because many of its patients simply cannot forgo treatment without dire consequences. In addition, BioMarin is closing in on two major regulatory decisions for its next set of product candidates. The main attraction here is that BioMarin's top line could realistically double within five years, and it operates within one of the few segments of the economy that should be basically immune to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 is a medical-device company that specializes in diabetes. The company's shares have gained a stately 19% in 2020, thanks to the breakout success of its\u00a0G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. Although DexCom's shares are some of the most expensive within the healthcare sector right now, the company's rich valuation shouldn't scare you away. There are close to half a million adults living with diabetes worldwide, and this number is expected to rise markedly over the next decade. DexCom's CGM franchise is poised to play a critical role in the fight against this raging pandemic, which should translate into some truly eye-catching revenue figures.\u00a0\u00a0 is the undisputed king of Latin American e-commerce. Even so, the company's shares were  last month by the COVID-19 panic. COVID-19 has only recently started to have a major impact in Latin America, and the good news is that it shouldn't have any long-term consequences on MercadoLibre's e-commerce business. Now, the company's near-term sales might take a sizable hit as Latin America enforces shelter-in-place mandates. But this barrier to economic activity won't last forever. Thus, bargain hunters may want to pounce on this beaten-down e-commerce play soon.\u00a0Investors often overlook mid-cap stocks, or companies with market caps ranging from $2 billion to $10 billion. But they shouldn't. Mid-cap stocks often offer a compelling mix of healthy growth and safety. In fact, mid-cap equities have consistently been some of the best growth vehicles in the entire market for the better part of the past decade. With this theme in mind, here are three mid-cap healthcare stocks that should be outstanding bargains at current levels.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. is a mid-cap biopharma focused on the development of drugs for non-viral liver diseases. The company's shares have lost over half their value this year because of a regulatory delay for its non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) drug candidate, Ocaliva. Specifically, Ocaliva's\u00a0advisory committee meeting was moved from  of this year as a result of COVID-19. Intercept's shares, in turn, might be one of the best bargains in the entire market right now. While Ocaliva isn't a surefire slam dunk to become the first drug ever approved for NASH, the fact is that it would easily rack up sales in the $2 billion to $3 billion range if it does cross this key regulatory hurdle. The big deal is that Intercept's market cap is currently hovering right around a mere $2 billion at the time of writing. As such, there's a real shot that Intercept's shares could double, or even triple, in value by this time next year.\u00a0\u00a0 is a rare-disease and gene therapy company with a virtual monopoly on treatments for the muscle-wasting disorder known as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The company's stock has traded in lockstep with the broader markets this year presumably because of its formerly rich valuation. What's important to understand is that Sarepta's shares are quite possibly trading at less than 0.5 times 2026 sales. There are a lot of moving parts that could drastically change this outlook, but the bottom line is that Sarepta's stock is dirt cheap at these levels. Despite multiple would-be competitors in DMD, after all, Sarepta is still the only game in town for the most part.\u00a0is another high-growth diabetes play, thanks to its outsize portion of the insulin pump market. The company's shares have been on fire over the  because of the rapid growth of its market share in the insulin pump space. And in 2020, Tandem's share have even been able to eke out a modest gain of about 3%, which arguably reflects the strong demand for its\u00a0insulin pumps for individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Wall Street's current consensus price target implies that Tandem's shares could rise by another 44.9% over the next 12 months. With the diabetes market growing by leaps and bounds, this rosy outlook doesn't seem to be unreasonable in the least.\u00a0Small-cap growth stocks are typically the first group of equities to lose favor in a crisis. These stocks are generally riskier than mid- and large-cap equities. As the market derisks, though, some small-cap stocks become outstanding bargains by default. The following three names fit that description to a T.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. is an orphan-drug maker that sells Firdpase, an FDA-approved drug for treating Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Firdapse is competing with another recently approved LEMS medication, but this drug has yet to take a meaningful share of the market. In fact, there are several  to think that this rival LEMS drug never will morph into a serious competitive threat. Nonetheless, the market has treated Catalyst's shares as if Firdapse's sales are set to collapse. Underscoring this point, Catalyst's stock is trading at an absurd 1.87 times 2021 projected sales. While this small-cap biopharma does have an elevated risk profile, the market is arguably taking it way too far with this rock-bottom valuation. Catalyst, in fact, should eventually shake off this key overhang to go on to become a top growth stock within the next 12 to 18 months.\u00a0 \u00a0 is a pre-revenue vaccine company. The biotech's shares have gained almost 300% this year because of a successful top-line readout for its experimental flu vaccine, dubbed NanoFlu, combined with its entrance into the race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Novavax is gearing up to submit NanoFlu's regulatory application to the FDA for review, meaning it might be available for next year's flu season. Estimates vary wildly, but the current consensus has NanoFlu generating around $740 million in peak sales. That's quite a potential haul for a company with a market cap of $801 million. So if NanoFlu does indeed gain the FDA's blessing, Novavax's stock should . The main risk factor associated with this biotech stock is that the FDA may request additional clinical data before approval, which certainly isn't out of the realm of possibility.\u00a0\u00a0 is a\u00a0vacation ownership and exchange company. The company's shares have lost over 63% of their value this year, thanks to the impact of COVID-19 on the leisure travel industry. Wyndham, for its part, recently pulled its financial guidance and suspended share buybacks because of the uncertain outlook for the industry as a result of this deadly respiratory ailment. The bad news is that Wyndham's stock probably hasn't hit rock bottom quite yet. In fact, it's unlikely that demand for leisurely travel lodging will rebound in 2020. But if you're willing to hold this stock for a full five years, it should pay off handsomely after these enormous declines. Wyndham's underlying business model is still a big hit, after all. We just need to get back to the point where tourism -- especially international tourism -- is a thing again.\u00a0Home-run stocks are equities that are seemingly grossly mispriced relative to their long-term value proposition. These types of high-risk, high-reward stocks should never make up an outsize portion of a portfolio, but they are sometimes worth owning in small doses. The following home-run stocks offer investors an attractive risk-to-reward profile, especially after their rough start to 2020.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. is a medical and recreational cannabis company that operates out of\u00a0Smiths Falls, Ontario. Canopy is worth checking out because it's reasonably well capitalized and a leader in terms of cannabis production, product diversity, and annual sales, and it underwent a recent managerial turnover that should lead to a more cost-conscious approach to value creation. Now, this legal marijuana company definitely won't be a big winner for shareholders anytime soon because of the various headwinds facing the industry as a whole. But Canopy's stock might produce stellar gains for investors willing to hold for at least 10 years. Eventually the  will come into its own as a highly lucrative commercial space, a fact that bodes well for leaders in the industry like Canopy.\u00a0 is among the world's best known airlines. Unfortunately, the company's shares have gotten blasted this year by the  in air travel stemming from the COVID-19 crisis. In fact, Delta's shares are down by an eye-popping 64% from their 52-week highs right now. The bad news is that Delta's stock is surely in for more pain in the weeks ahead.

The stock dropped 21% from its high of $97.10, set March 4, before quickly rebounding; year to date, the biopharma's shares are down 5%. BioMarin is trading at 59.2 times future earnings, and the company's forward price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio is 0.76. Given these valuation metrics, should investors consider buying shares?\u00a0BioMarin has a broad portfolio of commercialized drugs targeting rare genetic disorders. Marketed globally in more than 75 countries, these drugs offer steady revenue growth.Image source: Getty Images.The year 2019 produced record results for the company. It demonstrated continued operational excellence and productive research and development (R&D) that will lead to new products and top-line growth in the coming years. BioMarin ended the year strong, with all brands contributing to total revenue of $1.7 billion, a 14% increase year over year.\u00a0Net product revenue from six products marketed by BioMarin -- Vimizim, Kuvan, Naglazyme, Palynziq, Brineura, and Firdapse -- generated $1.6 billion, up 17% from 2018's total revenue. Remaining net product revenue came from products marketed by Sanofi Genzyme, generating $97.8 million, a decline of 28% year over year.\u00a0Of the commercialized products, Vimizim became the first BioMarin brand to reach and surpass $500 million in annual sales. Moreover, the performance of two newer brands, Palynziq and Brineura, was impressive, contributing to 10% of net product revenue. Management expects Palynziq to drive better growth in the coming years.Looking ahead to 2020 and beyond, investors will want to keep tabs on BioMarin's continued operational excellence and its research and development pipeline. In January, it sold its Firdapse assets to a third party, so it will no longer record revenue from Firdapse going forward.\u00a0Instead, this year and the coming years will be focused on the potential approval of ; the submission of an application for treatment of achondroplasia (a genetic disorder that results in dwarfism); and enrollment in a phase 2 study for another treatment for phenylketonuria (PKU). The success of these endeavors will contribute to top-line growth and continue to strengthen BioMarin's sales in a path toward profitability.The market may be volatile right now because of the coronavirus pandemic, but BioMarin's business seems stable. It has plenty of cash for operations ($1.2 billion, with a quarterly burn rate of just 3.5% ) and is in a healthy financial situation in which its assets exceed its liabilities.\u00a0It manages its debt effectively, currently boasting a debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) of 27.2%. A D/E ratio of less than 30% implies that a company is not using too much debt to finance its operations -- ideal for operating in economic downturns. Over the past five years, the company has managed to reduce its debt levels from a high of 41.8%.In its fourth-quarter  in February, CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime noted that executives expect the company to turn profitable under generally accepted accounting principles () in 2020. \"For the first time in the history of the company, our revenue growth and improvement in profitability is also increasing our operating cash flows as our total cash and investment grew for the second straight quarter in Q4 of last year,\" he said.\u00a0Analysts currently forecast that BioMarin will become profitable over the next three years. \u00a0BioMarin's broad portfolio of drugs and strong financials offer investors a stable long-term investment for the next three to five years. With plenty of cash and effective financial management, the company looks positioned to dominate in the current market conditions. Moreover, success with its upcoming pipeline -- particularly the approval of Valrox -- should put the company in position to reach profitability soon. Analysts project an average price target of $118.48, with a range of $77 to $164.

Hosting the conference call today from BioMarin is Traci McCarty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Traci. -- Thank you, Mae, and thank you everyone for joining us today. To remind you, this non-confidential presentation contains forward-looking statements about the business prospects of BioMarin, including expectations regarding BioMarin's financial performance, commercial products and potential future products in different areas of therapeutic research and development. Results may differ materially depending on the progress of BioMarin's product programs, actions of regulatory authorities, availability of capital, future actions in the pharmaceutical market and developments by competitors, and those factors detailed in BioMarin's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission such as 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K reports.On the call remotely from BioMarin management today are J.J. Bienaime, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Ajer, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Robert Baffi, President, Global Manufacturing and Technical Operations; Hank Fuchs, President, Worldwide Research & Development; and Brian Mueller, acting Chief Financial Officer. We hope to keep this call to one hour. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you for your understanding.I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, J.J. Bienaime. -- Thank you, Tracy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. We hope you and your families are healthy and managing through these unusual circumstances brought a bit by the COVID-19 virus. So these are unprecedented times, but the essential nature of our medicines to the patients who need them has enabled BioMarin to weather the challenge of COVID-19 quite well. Equally as important, I want to underscore the extraordinary dedication of our employees who have kept operations running smoothly in order to maintain access to our therapies around the world.Our first quarter record results of $502 million of total revenues or 25% growth over last year. The testament to the importance of our therapies and our diversified product base and commercial footprint. Due in part to the sale of Firdapse, GAAP net income in the first quarter was $81.4 million, exceeding our current full year guidance range of $20 million to $80 million. In the first quarter, we experienced minimal interruptions due to COVID-19, but we do anticipate the potential for more meaningful business disruptions for the remainder of 2020 due to the pandemic.As a result, we have chosen to reduce our full year total revenue guidance by around 5% or $100 million, while maintaining both GAAP and non-GAAP income fully estimated provided earlier this year. Despite potential near-term impacts to our commercial business, on COVID-19, our next blockbusters, BMN 270, valoctocogene roxaparvovec, or valrox hemophilia A and vosoritide for achondroplasia continuing to advance, and Jeff we'll reveal our recently approved brand name for BMN 270 in a moment. Briefly on vosoritide for achondroplasia. In the quarter, we announced that based on recent meetings, a successful meeting with health authorities in the U.S. and Europe, we plan to submit marketing applications to the FDA and EMA in the third quarter of this year. It's approved that vosoritide will be the first medicine for the treatment of achondroplasia in the U.S. and Europe. So we are delighted that this potential therapy proceeds a step closer to regulatory.In conclusion, BioMarin employees have risen to the evolving challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating a high level of commitment and dedication to the patients we serve. The underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong and our manufacturing and supply chain resilience. We have built a durable base business with essential medicines, transitioned the pipeline to address larger rare indications, diversified risk and positions ourselves for substantial success in both the near term and the long term. We are confident in our ability to manage through this ongoing global health crisis, while staying grounded in our long-term strategy for success.I'd like to say a few words about Robert Baffi, who has made tremendous contributions to the organization over the last 20 years. During his time at BioMarin he had manufactured the most complex biological products in the world and built the most advanced commercial scale gene therapy manufacturing capability. His leadership, technical expertise, foresight and dedication has played a key role in where we stand today, and we want to acknowledge historically many contributions. Thank you, Robert and we are pleased that he will remain with BioMarin through the review of BMN 270 valrox and the valve authorized marketing applications to ensure manufacturing continuity, as his successor, Greg Guyer, begins his journey with us in May coming from Bristol Myers Squibb.Thank you all for your continued support. And now I would like to turn the call over to Robert to say a few words. Robert? -- Thank you, J.J. innovation has always been at the core of BioMarin's success. During my 20 year tenure as the Head of Technical Operations, I'm still in a company of few guiding principles to foster a culture of innovation. First, let science inform and lead decision-making. Second, let compliance focus our efforts on patient safety and clinical outcomes. And third, let ingenuity create adaptivity and resiliency in our approach to drug development. These three tenants infused with the talent of the most dedicated people I've ever worked with, have consistently enabled us to take research ideas rapidly through development, navigating the complexity of the regulatory approval process in a highly effective and differentiated manner to meet the needs of patients.BioMarin's leadership team has shared and supported a vision for creating a fully integrated company with technical operations, powers, clinical studies and commercial demand and is an integral component of strategic technology development paradigms for assuring the timely delivery of an uninterrupted supply of product. Furthermore, innovative and appropriately implemented CMC strategies, linked to a faster clinical design allows for rapid development and high success rates that benefit both patients and shareholders alike. As a company, we are going through multiple transitions simultaneously, challenging in some ways, invigorating and others. Our transition to profitability this year provides the resources to develop more innovative therapies.Our transition to gene therapy products leverages our clinical, manufacturing and commercial capabilities and places squarely at the forefront of the emerging technological advancement and precision medicine. Our transition and technical operation leadership provides the opportunity to build an innovative approach to drug development to fuel our growth. When I first saw Dr. Greg Guyer CV, I could not help but be impressed with the scope of his responsibility and the experiential variety and diversity of his career. In many ways, while a different journey, it shared a lot of commonality with my own and then to not let us vote to BioMarin.I'm confident and committed that the transition and technical operations at BioMarin from me to Greg will build on the legacy of science, compliance and ingenuity. For our patients that will benefit from the products that will emerge from our efforts, for our employees and their careers and for our shareholders as we become profitable. In terms of licensure of our gene therapy manufacturing facility in the support of BMN 270 approval, I'm pleased to share that the Health Products Regulatory Authority of Ireland conducted on behalf of the European Medicines Agency, a pre-approval inspection in Q1. This inspection involves a detailed review of the facility, equipment, process and analytical studies and relevant documentation generated in support of validation, production and testing.Following this inspection, a CGMP certification was granted, allowing for commercial production and distribution of BMN 270 in the EU when the product is approved. At present, the inspection of the facility by FDA is expected to be completed during Q2, allowing full licensure in the U.S. of the facility consistent with the August 21 PDUFA action date. We have more than 400 doses of commercial BMN 270 ready for potential launch later this year, and we remain very enthusiastic about the prospects for introducing the first gene therapy product for a bleeding disorder to the hemophilia community as soon as possible. I thank you for your support throughout my time at BioMarin.And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff to discuss the commercial business update. Jeff? -- Thank you, Robert. As we begin 2020, I'm very pleased with the team's performance across all brands and all regions during the quarter. As J.J. mentioned, we achieved our highest quarterly revenue on record, with total revenues of $502 million in the first quarter with net product revenues marketed by BioMarin, up 24% to $433 million. This achievement reflects the fundamental strength and growth of our business despite near-term challenges related to COVID-19, which I will address in a moment. On to results in the quarter and starting with Palynziq, in the U.S., the trend of increasing revenue based on a steadily growing base of patients on commercial therapy, including progression from induction and titration, to daily maintenance dosing continued in Q1.In the early part of the quarter, we did experienced a seasonal slowing of new patient enrollments and patient starts, somewhat mirroring our historical experience with Kuvan in the United States. We are reporting $35 million in Palynziq revenue for the first quarter, with the majority of that revenue coming from the U.S. In Europe, in the first quarter, multiple clinics across Germany continued to actively treat patients with Palynziq and early uptake signals are encouraging. During the quarter, we made significant progress in Germany, adding clinics that now have some experience prescribing Palynziq and managing patients through the induction and titration phase to daily maintenance dosing.As the number of commercial patients in Germany steadily grows, we anticipate meaningful revenue contribution from the EU starting this year. We anticipate finalizing price and reimbursement negotiations in Germany by mid this year, an important step toward getting price and reimbursement approvals in other high priority European markets. Kuvan contributed $122 million in revenues in the quarter or 14% growth year-over-year, with most of that growth coming from the United States. Vimizim revenues grew 9% year-over-year, contributing $137 million in the first quarter, driven by an 11% increase in patient's year-over-year. This is reflective of the continued anticipated growth potential we expect for Vimizim.Turning to Naglazyme. Revenues totaled $114 million, a 32% year-over-year growth for the well-established brand. As with Vimizim, the impact from uneven, large order patterns makes a quarterly comparison difficult. The number of commercial patients on Naglazyme grew by 6% in the past year, and is indicative of the ongoing growth potential for this brand, nearly 15 years since being approved.And finally, Brineura contributed $24 million in net product revenues, which represented 97% year-over-year growth. These revenues were essentially flat over Q4, and that was driven by a modest year-end inventory build in the EMEA region in Q4. Importantly, the growth in Brineura revenues compared to prior year reflects an underlying growth of 86% in commercial patients. We are seeing a net increase in patients benefiting from Brineura treatment due to the success of our disease awareness and patient identification programs. Taken together, we are pleased with first quarter results and demand for our products.And while we experienced minimal financial impact in the first quarter due to COVID-19, we anticipate the potential for a higher degree of impact during the remainder of 2020 as disruptions of day-to-day operations of clinics and hospitals flow through our business. Our global commercial teams will continue to adjust to implement innovative approaches to engage with clinics and patients to ensure continuity of access to our medicines. Where possible, we are supporting home infusion efforts to help mitigate impact. However, some COVID-19 disruption, the new patient starts, as well as to ongoing infusion center visits from existing patients are expected to continue.As a result, we are reducing total revenue guidance by 5% at the midpoint to between $1,850 million to $1,950 million for the full year 2020. The vast majority of today's updated total revenue guidance reflects adjustments to in line brands, including Vimizim, Naglazyme and Palynziq. And assumes our business will return to normalized demand patterns in the second half of 2020. Although, we did not give BMN 270 2020 revenue guidance in February, our 2020 total revenue guidance did assume some contribution from BMN 270 in Europe.Now I'd like to end my remarks with an update on our hemophilia gene therapy program and introduce you to the intended brand name, ROCTAVIAN. In previous calls, you've heard references to valrox, which was an abbreviated form of our INN, or International Nonproprietary Name, valoctocogene roxaparvovec, or alternatively our program identifier BMN 270. Both the FDA and the EMA have accepted ROCTAVIAN as our brand name, and we look forward to adopting ROCTAVIAN as we get closer to launch. In the meantime, we will cease to use valrox. So as to not confuse it with our intended branding.Other key launch readiness activities have continued to progress, we have essentially built out the commercial team in the United States, and have added key individuals the first priority in markets in the EU. The majority of these new employees have substantial and diverse experience in hemophilia. Our brand campaigns also continue to develop as anticipated and teams have pivoted to virtual and digital platforms, allowing for ongoing engagement with the marketplace in lieu of face-to-face interactions. Obviously, certain activities are more amenable to virtual engagements than others, and where COVID-19 is challenging us most in the short-term is with gene therapy educational programs and site readiness.Fortunately, with the team already on board, we anticipate being well prepared to launch if we receive regulatory approvals. In the meantime, we have recently finished some very positive pricing research which validated payer willingness to embrace ROCTAVIAN with the current data set, and we'll look forward to providing you with updates on our pricing at launch.Thank you for your attention, and I will now turn the call over to Hank to provide an R&D update. Hank? -- Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to echo J.J.'s expression of deep and heartfelt appreciation for the time Robert has spent with us. And also to welcome Greg Guyer, to the organization where the secret sauce is bottled. The R&D organization is delighted that our next significant product opportunities continue to progress, particularly under the circumstances brought about by COVID-19. The ability to come to work mostly virtually and focus on the advancement of our innovative products to date, ROCTAVIAN and vosoritide has been especially gratifying and a welcome distraction from the ongoing pandemic. I want to acknowledge and thank our teams for their commitment and contributions during the challenging times. I have been in impressed by your flexibility and your ability to keep the story going while we are dealing with the pandemic.Starting with ROCTAVIAN and what a strong and memorable brand name, congratulations to that, the FDA is committed to meet the August PDUFA action date. In Europe, our marketing authorization application filing remains on accelerated assessment at this time. However, the review procedure is to be extended by at least three months due to COVID-19 delays. Further, as is the case with most filings that initially receive accelerated assessment, we believe there is a high possibility that our M&A will revert to a standard review procedure from accelerated assessment. Based on these assumptions, we expect the CHMP opinion by late 2020 or early 2021. We continue to plan to share our three, four year update of the 6e13 vector genome per kilo dose as well as the three-year update on the 4e13 vector genome per kilo dose in the middle of the year, but the form is as yet to be defined, given the changing environment for medical meetings.We have a data analysis plan in place. We'll move forward with business as usual, but the venue and method for providing the update is still fluid at this point. So thanks for bearing with us. Importantly, we do not expect COVID-19 to impact the time lines for completion of the ROCTAVIAN Phase III trial. Enrollment was completed in November of last year, and one of the benefits of being onetime treatment is that patients do not need to receive therapy on a chronic basis. We're also confident that the integrity of the ongoing data collection for the study for this pivotal study is being sufficiently maintained as home healthcare solutions align nicely with the collection of the primary endpoint annualized bleed rate data.Turning now to vosoritide for the treatment of achondroplasia, as J.J. mentioned, we plan to submit a global marketing applications in the third quarter of this year, our multi-pronged development program, including a long-term Phase II clinical results in five to 18-year-old children, comprehensive natural history data, the ongoing study of newborns through five years and the highly statistically significant placebo-controlled Phase III trial makes for a very comprehensive data package spanning more than five years of treatment with children with achondroplasia.Again, we're the beneficiary of fortunate timing and that our pivotal submission data read out prior to the pandemic, and now much of the work can be concluded remotely. If approved, vosoritide would be the first and only medicine designated for the treatment of achondroplasia in the U.S. and in European Union. We continue to look forward to publishing the full data from the Phase III study later this year, and we're pleased to let you know that our late-breaker has been accepted in an upcoming medical Congress. The presentation will include one year growth velocity, height Z-scores, body proportionality, safety and subgroup analyses. So stay tuned for more specifics as to when and where those data will appear.The Phase II study of a soar tide in zero to five year old referred to as study 206 is proceeding well, and we are very pleased that safety data from children ages six months to five years participating in that study. Will be available as part of our registration package. We're grateful that the timing of key studies has aligned well with our free COVID-19 plans. Moving to BMN 307, our investigational gene therapy for Phenylketonuria, we're continuing to prepare new sites to open in order to enroll patients when it to safely do so given the COVID-19 circumstances. We're excited about the prospect of BMN 307 as it represents a third treatment for phenylketonuria in our PKU franchise and a second gene therapy development program, leveraging our learnings and capabilities from ROCTAVIAN.Currently, we expect the study to start later -- we expect to start the study later in 2020. The R&D organization is energized by the opportunities before us in 2020, with both ROCTAVIAN for severe hemophilia A and vosoritide for children with a [Indecipherable] advancing toward potential approvals, we are hopeful that these innovative treatments will be available in the very near future. We look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming quarters, and thank you for your continued support.And I'll now turn the call over to Brian to review the financials. -- Thank you, Hank. Please refer to today's press release summarizing our financial results for full details on the first quarter of 2020. And as usual, our comprehensive report on the quarter will be available in our upcoming Form 10-Q, which we are on track to file over the next couple of days. As Jeff mentioned, we are experiencing some modest impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result we have updated full year total revenue guidance to between $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. As Jeff, noted, our updated revenue guidance is based on the assumption that our business will return to normalize demand pattern in the second half of the year.Importantly, while we lowered our revenue guidance due to the impact of COVID-19 on our commercial business, we were able to analyze our 2020 spend projection and make adjustments that allowed us to maintain our prior GAAP and non-GAAP income guidance Despite the lower revenue. Moving to operating expenses, R&D expense for the first quarter of 2020 was $142 million and lower compared to R&D expense for the first quarter of 2019 of $184 million, mostly due to less R&D activity for valoctocogene, given its late stage of development, as well as Palynziq, following its approvals in the U.S. and Europe.SG&A expense for the first quarter of 2020 was $187 million, which was higher than SG&A expense for the first quarter of 2019 of $162 million. The year-over-year increase was expected with the single largest driver in the commercial preparation for the launch of valoctocogene, and the continued global launch of Palynziq. We also incurred some unpredicted foreign currency exchange losses during month of March as COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected summer assets denominated in some of the more volatile global currencies.Turning to bottom line results, we reported GAAP net income of $81 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a GAAP net loss of $56.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. The improvement in GAAP income was primarily due to higher revenue, lower R&D expenses and the gain on the sale of the deferred assets. With higher revenues and lower R&D expenses, non-GAAP income of $117 million in the first quarter of 2020 grew substantially as compared to Q1 2019 non-GAAP income of $25 million. Both of these first quarter 2020 bottom line results gives us a great start toward achieving our 2020 goal of GAAP net income on an annual basis for the first time in company's history, and considerable growth in non-GAAP income.I'd also like to touch on a potential tax benefit that we mentioned last quarter that may be recognized in the second half of this year. Our current 2020 GAAP net income guidance of between $20 million to $80 million, excludes the potential impact of intra-entity intangible asset transfers between BioMarin entities. If these intangible asset transfers occur, we estimate that the tax effect could result in a one-time non-cash income tax benefit of greater than $500 million. As I mentioned previously, you may have seen similar transactions completed by some of our larger peers in recent quarters.Speaking of total cash and investments, we ended the first quarter of 2020 with $1.15 billion compared to $1.17 million at the end of December 2019. The modest decrease in total cash and investments during Q1, 2020 was largely due to some timing of operating cash flows. However, the significant improvement over the first quarter of 2019 were total cash and investments decreased by $105 million. This dollar cash position, coupled with vibrant business fundamentals, put us in good standing to manage through the continued uncertainty related to COVID-19.In closing, the strong performance of the business during the first quarter of 2020, plus our positive financial outlook for the rest of the year indicate that 2020 should be a transformational year for the company. And the prospects of value to come from valoctocogene and vosoritide if they are approved commercially, give us enthusiasm about our future.Thank you for your support. And we will now open the call to your questions. Operator?Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from SunTrust. Your line is now open. -- >: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. And just first off, congratulations to Greg, but Rob, lovely working with you. I think you brought a block of fresh air to working with management teams in all of my buyer's universe. So thank you so much. I learned a lot. I guess, I still have some questions on ROCTAVIAN, and I hope I get that correctly. So, first of all, what gives you confidence that in the United States, that there won't be any more delays, people ask this non-stop? And then, when you talk about assuming normal operations go -- resume in the second half, is that in the beginning of the second half?Do you have a time line for that? If it goes into fourth quarter could we see further delays? And the third question is, what are you hearing as far as, like, people willing to have gene therapy procedures done in the COVID environment as early as fourth quarter? Are people open to it? Is it separate from the hospitals? And what are you hearing from the ground? Thank you. -- Okay. Hank, you want to answer the question on the no delays with the FDA? Hank? -- So, thanks Robyn for the questions. The confidence from the FDA is that we're tracking to our milestones. And in some cases, they are accelerating their work. So having been through a bunch of these recently, all the signs are pointing favorably. As far as willingness to dose, as you know, we completed our dosing in our valrox clinical trials, and we're experiencing a bit of a delay in the PKU program. So, I do expect that there is some hesitance in the gene therapy clinical trial world. I don't know if Jeff Ajer, wants to make any comments about anything he's heard about what might happen in the fourth quarter when we're approved. -- Yeah. Jeff, do you want to give your perspective on how we launch the product? I mean, obviously, if we had to launch today, it would be a little bit challenging, but we're seeing news every few minutes that the businesses are starting to reopen in the U.S. So -- and around the world, Germany, France. France is reopening their schools in a couple of weeks. So things are changing now.It's very hard to predict when things are really going to go back to normal, or close normal, as possible. We cannot anticipate it to happen at the beginning of the third quarter, but it's hard to tell today. But, Jeff, do you want to give your perspective on the willingness for patients to be treated and how our commercial team is going to go about addressing this? -- Yeah. It's a great question. And of course, nobody can predict the future. So our team has been focused and maybe I'd start with saying, fortunately, we have a team in the United States that is comprised largely of people with existing relationships in the hemophilia community.So those people are busy making connections with clinicians, with hemophilia treatment centers and with patient advocacy organizations, all with the objective of continuing to introduce BioMarin as an organization to those audiences and provide opportunities for gene therapy education, very important and highly in demand in the community and also working on-site readiness.I think one of the most decisive variables will be the ability and willingness or not of certain hospitals to do infusions, if we are so fortunate to have an approved ROCTAVIAN product in Q4. That will probably be somewhat dependent on the course of the COVID-19 situation. But we would also note that while we've seen a lot of disruption to our infusions of the enzyme products, the disruption hasn't been anything close to total.And in fact, we've seen less disruption with Brineura infusions, which are indicative of the situation where hospitals and physicians can prioritize infusions if they're motivated and they find them to be particularly important.So that's our approach for ROCTAVIAN pursuing education, site readiness, and we'll see where we can do infusions when we get that far. I personally haven't gotten a signal that patients are going to be reluctant to take infusions when we get that far, and that may be reflective of the fact that our patient engagement is pretty limited in the pre-approval setting. I'll turn that back over to you, JJ, if you want to direct on the resume the normal question. -- No, I mean, I think I kind of tried to answer that. Maybe do you want to give you a perspective on the regime normal? Jeff? -- Yes. So Robin, I don't think that we're saying that our business will be back to 100% in normal starting the second half. I think we're using the second half to give some flexibility in terms of the timing of that. My own sense is that we're expecting to see the biggest impact to our business in Q2, we would be rebounding in Q3 and with some luck, we would be back to normal pre-COVID levels of demand in Q4. -- Thank you.We have our next question from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions and Robert good luck for everything. So as you look toward the valrox launch, can you comment on patient screening, such as a website that stood at about 400 individuals, I believe, back in February and an update on the companion diagnostic? And then secondly, how should we think about the full year Phase I/II upcoming data? And do you anticipate it will impact payer discussions? -- Hank, do you want to answer the companion diagnostic for things were moving along here and then the other question on the Phase II update? -- So question? Yes. In the often. I can start with the companion diagnostic and a full year update and then turn it back to you guys for the impact on payers or the optums. Companion diagnostic, Salveen, doing great. Everything's on track, fully expect to have an approvable companion diagnostic at time valrox approval in the United States.Fully expect to have a CE Mark for Europe for use in Europe when ROCTAVIAN, excuse me, is approved. For your update ROCTAVIAN, the expectation is the main focus is going to be obviously on bleed control. And secondary emphasis is going to be on the evolving pattern of factor expression and whether there are anything in individual patients that mark who is more vulnerable to losing factor expression if that's occurring or not. So as you know, the state has been overseen by a data monitoring committee, and they have not reported anything particularly one way or the other to ask about Study 201. So we continue to follow the patients as the protocol described and look forward to presenting the data in the middle of the year. -- So Jeff, do you want to talk about the payers and impact, I mean, the Phase two update impact or like, thereof, on the payers? -- Yes. Thank you, J.J. and thanks, Salveen, for the question. The four-year data point is an important part of the emerging clinical data picture. But I think I'd mentioned on the previous call that our payer launch was begun in Q4 of 2019. So we've got a full payer management team on the ground. They've been conducting calls for the last four months.And we've been using the data that we have. We've been using the three-year data from last spring, and we've been using the data from the January 1 interim data cut that's the data that we have. Payers are interested in the question of durability, that's a key question for them.I haven't gotten any signals from payers that they think that the answer to that question is a binary one based on what we see midyear from the four-year data cut. But, obviously, that will be an important part of the picture. And payers care about the question of your ability.We have our next question from the line of Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking the questions. Have you started to see any change in day's receivable in the start of the second quarter? And how do you expect that to evolve over the course of the year? And can you comment a little bit on the insurance coverage shifts you may be seeing in the U.S. And how do you think that may impact the business, if at all? Thanks. -- Hey, Brian, do you want to answer the day receivable questions? And then Jeff, the insurance mix? -- Of course, yeah. Thanks, Josh. We're watching that closely, including throughout March and April here. We've not yet seen actual disruption into our payments. We've got a stable base of customers, stable supply chain and relationship from a cash flow standpoint with those customers. So we're hopeful that that will continue, but recognize that there's going to be some uncertainty with the pandemic and its impact on healthcare systems. So we're watching it, but no impact to date. -- Jeff, you want to talk about the insurance mix? -- Yes. Like other companies, we're very watchful for signals, look like patients are losing access to private insurance, because of being laid off and what happens to those families and patients. I would say, we don't have anything that constitutes a signal on that to this point. There have been a couple of anecdotal reports that we've collected, and we are deliberately collecting any signals that we can from our rare connections hub program.So we've gotten anecdotes so patients calling and saying that they're anxious about the potential loss of insurance. We've seen one patient family shift from a private to a government plan due to loss of a job. And so I would call those anecdotes and not a signal. But we'll keep watching and keep you posted. A good question, thank you.We have our next question from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats to Robert on your retirement. So my question is for Hank. I'm just curious, is there a reason other than COVID why the EMA may revert the ROCTAVIAN MAA to standard review from accelerated assessment, especially since you already successfully completed the pre-approval inspection? And was there any new data or new analyses that were requested by the agency? Anything else you can say there? -- I think the key thing about accelerated assessment is that most products fall off accelerated assessment. And I think that, this is also further compounded by the fact that this is an advanced medicinal agent. So I don't think today's comment about accelerated assessment should be interpreted meaningfully differently than when we initially filed the application. -- Okay. Thank you.Your next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham from BofA. Your line is now open. -- Okay. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the dynamics in the base business. I guess when you think about the diagnostic path for new patients on a number of different products, be it Vimizin, Venaria, Palynziq, etc. Obviously, it's a pretty long cycle. I just wanted to ask you, if you've seen any of these physician interactions coming to -- converting to virtual, I'm just trying to assess the -- maybe the long-term disruption to new starts beyond say, three quarter -- third quarter of this year. Thank you. -- Jeff, do you want to take that one? -- Yeah, I'd be happy to. So relative to the base business and the dynamics, I would say, we anticipate the near-term impact from missed infusions to be higher than the impact from delayed patient identification and patient starts. Probably the disruption to patient starts would be larger for Palynziq at this point because Vimizim, all of them; Vimizim, Naglazyme and Brineura have a larger starting base of patients. So the incremental new patients coming on will have a smaller impact.And there are anecdotal reports, but clinics are shifting their interactions with patients to virtual visits. That's something that is obviously outside of BioMarin's purview. So we only have incidental reports on that, and that's not something that we would seek to get involved in. However, I think for certain aspects, of the identification and patient start pathway. We do see patients moving forward. So that process has not ground to a halt exactly, but it has been disrupted. And thanks, Jeff, for that question. I hope I've addressed your concerns.Next question is from the line of Akash Tewari from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks so much. Can you give some color on how the FDA may use that new prophy trial on valrox, you recently announced? Would it be possible to have that data pooled with your Phase I/II data as a part of a separate efficacy analysis in your label? And how long will that take to happen? And I just wanted to clarify something. Your 2020 guidance included the impact of valrox sales only in Europe. I just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly. Thanks. -- So kind of FDA. -- Yes. Hi, Akash, that study start is going to be delayed because of pandemic. And in any case, it was ancillary to the initial application and registration. The way I think about it is in the initial reviews that the agencies are looking at. They have some data in patients treated with on-demand steroids. They have some patients that are treated with prophylactic steroids, doctors are kind of split, some light prophy, some like on demand.We've just dosed 130 patient clinical trial with on-demand steroid use. And so therefore, we were thinking about increasing the sample size of the experience that we have with prophy steroids use.When those study data are available, we'd certainly make them available medically in medical communications. And then we think about also how that might be tied together with the Phase I/II prophy study to support a label supplement. That's pretty far down the road from where we are. And I think we have a really strong data package at launch in regard to steroids and how to use them. -- So getting the guidance to cash, so to make it clear, our original 2020 guidance, which we gave when we reported Q4, included some anticipated revenues in valrox, in Europe. The revised guidance, which is giving today, assumes no valrox revenues in Europe because now we anticipate that actually, the approval in Europe, we very -- at the very end of this year, early next year. So that's supply. Although we haven't given where the valrox number was, I just want you know that the new guidance assumes no revenues for valrox in Europe, sorry, ROCTAVIAN, right.We have our next question from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. I just wanted to drill down a little bit on Palynziq. So Jeff, I think I heard your commentary on the slowdown in new starts happening at the beginning of the quarter. As memory serves, I think there was a bit of a slowdown that started also in Q4. And just noting that when you look at the product-specific guidance changes, this kind of stands out as I think by my math, it's midpoint to midpoint is down 10%, whereas the others that you changed were down less. Just -- I wonder if you could just maybe give a little bit more color. Is this -- is there something more endemic, I guess, going on with Palynziq? Thanks. -- Thanks for the question, Chris. So in the Q1 earnings call, would point to a little bit of a seasonal slowdown in Q4 for Palynziq in terms of patient starts and patient enrollments, and we have historically seen that also with Kuvan. That's basically a seasonal the holiday. So from Thanksgiving in late November, through Christmas and New Year, we see disruption to clinic activity and flow patient enrollments. So we saw a little bit of that in Q4 for both Kuvan and Palynziq. And obviously, our focus now is on promoting Palynziq is why we addressed it. And similarly, in Q1, recall, we've historically seen slowdowns in our business for Kuvan. And we're seeing kind of a similar pattern in the early part of Q1. That's not related to the holidays in Q4. That's related to the reset of insurance policies of co-pays, accumulators, and in some cases, patients switching to new policies and in a lot of cases, the need for a new prior authorization for patients.That was really an early Q1 phenomenon. By February, we were seeing new patient enrollments and starts picking up that was really an encouraging sign for Palynziq in February and March. And then as the clinics in the United States and Germany began to be shutdown in March from the COVID-situation, we're experiencing now a real slowdown in patient enrollments and patient starts. And I expect that will continue largely until the clinics are back up and able to continue their operations. Again, recalling that with Palynziq, patient starts are directed to be under the supervision of a healthcare professional that can manage potential adverse events, at least for the first injection. I hope that answers your question, first. -- Yeah, and also for Palynziq, both the patients and the clinicians have to be certified that they can -- that the patient can receive the product and know-how to start and check and that the physician can know about how managing the potential side effect. That's why there is definitely has been in late March and in April, a slowdown in the new patients. But we believe it's temporary. And when the PKU clinic reopened, you hopefully will see an acceleration of new patients here.We have our next question from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the progress. I also want to ask a question on the guidance. It looks like the Vimizin guidance was cut by about $30 million and Naglazyme by $20 million. I'm just curious, one, what have you been seeing in April? How far apart can those infusions be pushed before patients see some impact on their symptoms? And two, like what proportion of patients worldwide are able to get these infusions at home? And so therefore, maybe won't have much of a disruption to use. -- Jeff? -- Phil, thank you for the question. So -- and the reduction in guidance on Vimizim and Naglazyme is proportional to the base of sales that we're talking about. So what we're seeing is a relatively uniform impact so far relative to the size of the business for each of Naglazyme and Vimizim. We're seeing more disruption in loss infusions in markets where home infusion is not a well-established practice. So we know normally that home infusion, where home infusion is an established practice that compliance rates are higher. And we've seen less disruption in those markets where patients are home infused.Now we've got a very diverse global business for both Naglazyme and Vimizim. So, I don't want to try to report high-level numbers of what percent of patients are home infused or not. But our tactics have been in markets where tactics to intervene and try to keep our business on track. In markets where we've got home infusion as an established practice, we're trying to push more patients into that channel, and that channel is relatively open in markets where home infusion is not an established practice. We see this as an opportunity in some places to try to get it established.And so, we've had some success in places like Brazil and Argentina, in Colombia and Spain, for example, in pushing patients into home infusion, where it's not an established practice or alternate infusion sites, those being maybe a smaller hospital that's closer to home, less impacted by COVID-19 situation or in some cases, something like a retail infusion clinic where patients can go. And we're seeing some positive effect of that already on our business.Naglazyme and Vimizim are products where we know patients have not always been completely compliant. So, probably missing one or several infusions is -- may not be noticeable to the patient or the physician. For Brineura, on the other hand, every infusion can be critical, and we're fortunately seeing a much higher level of compliance and less disruption with that part of the business. I hope I've addressed your question there, Tim. Thank you. -- And, actually, if I may add -- actually, the virus situation is probably -- you've mentioned it's going to be helpful to actually move a lot of the treatments from the -- in those countries that are behind U.S. and Western Europe, move the treatment and infusions from the hospitals into either the homes or places that are closer to the patients, which actually overall is good news and might actually improve compliance in the long term.We have our next question from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quickly from me, I guess, for Hank. Hank, I didn't see a comment on the press release, and I'm sorry if I missed it, maybe you commented during your remarks. But any impact to enrollment in the last group of patients that you need for the full pivotal study for valrox? And then on PKU gene therapy, is there anything you can do by adding some more sites or anything to maybe speed up or reduce the delay that you're going to face here before you're start? Or is this basically just a delay until you're able to start? Thanks. -- Hi, Matt. 270 -- I'm sorry, ROCTAVIAN Phase III enrollment, I think you were asking about. We completed in November, and so we're not presently enrolling anyone further as regards our initial approval. So, good news on ROCTAVIAN, the confirmatory trial fully enrolled. And as far as the -- sort of, the generalized restart, we have a lot of conversations with investigators and there's reopening happening at different -- in different ways and in different places at different times, and we're really trying to get a handle on where a site is going to be able to dose the first patient on the resumption of clinical trials. I don't exactly have a clarity on when that's going to be or where that's going to be.Next question is from the line of Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. This is Alex [Phonetic] on for Paul. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to see how your thinking has evolved on pay-for-performance for gene therapy as a model in the U.S.? Thanks. -- Jeff, do you want to address that one? -- Yes. Thanks, Alex. It's a great question. We're really going into a new model for reimbursement with ROCTAVIAN. And the payers are very interested in keeping up with gene therapies that are coming to the market, ROCTAVIAN being perhaps one of the first meaningful gene therapy brands to hit.They want to make sure that they're not falling behind. And it's really the shift from how do you create a reimbursement environment that for a onetime durable treatment in a model that is accustomed to paying for chronic therapies over time. And what the payers have told us is that, one, they understand that there's limitations so far in company's abilities to create pay per performance agreements that don't create problems with government price reporting, and I'm sure you understand the issue there.Medicaid best prices and amps that would trigger a cascade of lowering price to government paid patients that's a problem. They understand that. They've also advised us BioMarin that outcomes-based agreements are important to them it's a way of shifting the risk from their shoulders back to the manufacturer for both response and durability over the time. They've told us that it's important, and they've told us that agreements that are limited to 23% or less of the purchase price, don't particularly excite them. They don't consider that to be a solution so we've been working on strategies for outcomes-based agreements for ROCTAVIAN. We think that we've potentially got some things that will work for payers. We're out there talking to payers right now. And probably for competitive purposes, I won't go into the details of what that all looks like. But I think we have a potential path forward that would address outcomes-based agreements, desires from payers. Thank you.Next question is from the line of Mohit Bansal from Citigroup. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats and thank you very much for Rob as well from my side. Good luck to your next part of your adventures. Now I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the shape of recovery you are thinking in your base case. If I heard correctly, you are assuming normalcy in fourth quarter, your assumptions, is that fair? Or you are assuming that it could be like -- second quarter will be down, third quarter starting to recover and fourth quarter could be completely normal? Or how you're thinking about that would be very helpful. Thank you. -- Jeff, you want to -- I'll -- I'll say a few words on that too earlier, but why don't you get started? -- Yes. So thank you, Mohit. Everybody is busy predicting the future here, which is difficult to do in normal circumstances and probably fraught with even more difficult -- difficulties to do precisely, given the current situation, but we started seeing disruptions to our business at the end of the first quarter, which did not impact our financial performance in the first quarter. But as we began the second quarter, we knew the disruptions that we're seeing would flow through to our business as described. We quickly got in gear to start taking mitigating actions, mainly on miss infusions as I've described, and we think that those mitigating actions are having an impact.So yes, we're anticipating that we'll see the biggest impact to our business in the second quarter. And that the conditions relative to our business would be improving as we go through the end of second quarter, through the third quarter. And our target is to have something that looks like pre-COVID-19 levels of demand that we're able to address and facilitate in the fourth quarter. You can tell from the level of our guidance reductions, the magnitude of the anticipated impact to each of our different brands. So that's a way of kind of quantifying our expectations for each of the different brands relative to the dynamics that I've been describing. So hopefully, it's possible for you to connect the dots a little bit between the qualitative and the quantitative piece.Maybe I'd pause there and see if J.J. has other thoughts. -- No, I mean, I just want to highlight that, again, it is very difficult for us to forecast where things are going to go. It looks like things are getting better, in most parts of the world, but we're not out of this complex situation that the virus has created.So again, we assume here the main impact being in Q2, some recovery in Q3 and hopefully, Q4 potentially back to normal. But it will depend a lot on how quickly the economies are reopening in different parts of the world. And also, as some of you know, there are talks that there could be a second wave of the virus, like there was in for the -- to 1918 Spanish Flu. Hopefully, if there is what it will be minor, and there will be more therapies available by them, but all this is very hard to predict. So we don't assume a significant set of second wave of the coronavirus seeding the world in Q4. So if that doesn't happen, then we're creatively confident in our guidance here.We have our next question from the line of Tim Lugo from William Blair. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking the question. We're almost two years into the approval of Palynziq here in the U.S., and we obviously have generic Kuvan approaching. Can you give us your updated thoughts of how many of the Kuvan patients will be transitional on the Palynziq by the time generic comes to market here in the U.S. given that we, obviously, have larger healthcare disruptions, even COVID? -- Jeff? -- Yeah. So great question. We have seen so far with the uptake of Palynziq in adult patients, we've seen almost 40% of Palynziq patients coming from patients that are on commercial therapy with Kuvan. And essentially, what that is indicating are PKU patients that were being treated with Kuvan that we're having a response, but not seeing the magnitude of a response that they've desired and seeking Palynziq is a more powerful alternative. So 40% is a pretty large proportion of our new Palynziq patients coming over from KUVAN. Obviously, in the United States, we're starting with a pretty big pool of adult patients on KUVAN.So while we're seeing a material shift of that adult patient base over to Palynziq, for reasons that I've described. I wouldn't say that, that represents anything near a majority of those patients. As we go into a loss of exclusivity period later this year, one of the things that we're encouraged by is, even if we have a KUVAN patient that goes on to a generic form of the product, we really haven't lost them forever.We're connected to them through the clinics. We're connected to them from our hub services, with their opt-ins and information, our clinical coordinators are connected with them. And Palynziq remains a viable option going forward for any patient -- any adult patient that is not seeing the kind of response they're looking for on KUVAN or a generic version of KUVAN. So, I think, we're optimistic about our market potential and opportunity in the U.S. for Palynziq, kind of in the medium and longer term. Thank you.Next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hey. Thanks for taking the question and I want to say congrats to the entire team for these Q1 results that really show that BioMarin is operationally and clinically and commercially navigating in these really unprecedented times ahead of really any of our expectations. -- Thank you. -- So, I also had another housekeeping question on guidance here. The full year 2020 guidance for a negative 5% headwind sort of imply $100 million here at midpoint. And again, it sounds like expectations of the vast majority of that is going to come in Q2 with the exception of maybe a little bit sort of dragging on through the rest of the year and pertaining to the sort of early removal of ROCTAVIAN, in Q4, in Germany.I'm just trying to sort of manage my Q2 expectations. Should I really be thinking about the vast majority of that $100 million hit coming in Q2. And then lastly, I just feel compelled to give a final congrats to Jeff and anyone else on the team who help come up with the ROCTAVIAN name. I think that's an awesome brand name, and it sounds like a metal song, really, really like it. -- Thanks. So, I think -- yeah, I think, Jeff kind of addressed the, again, that we do think indeed, the majority of the hit on our revenues is Q2. There will be a hit in Q3 as compared to what we were expecting because, for instance, of some Palynziq patients that were supposed to be started and are -- have been delayed. And then everything gets delayed with that, some miss-infusion that will still be probably happening in late Q2 and maybe early Q3. Although, it's always hard to put it. But -- and maybe Brian can give his own perspective on this, if you want to chip in Brian on this? Do you have some comment to make? -- Yeah, of course, J.J. Thanks. And, I think -- so, what we've commented on, Kennen, is that the disruption will be worse in Q2. I don't think we can predict with certainty what -- how that will actually translate into ordering patterns. We already point to our annual revenue guidance as the primary indicator for the commercial brand and less so quarter-to-quarter because we know that country-by-country specific ordering patterns shift greatly due to timing.So depending on whatever level of supply was on hand, in these certain territories where we're experiencing some disruption in infusion and whether and when they will order next as well as how that spills into Q3, I don't think we can put our finger on the exact ordering pattern. So we would point you to the annual guidance.We have our next question from the line of Gena Wang from Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Hi. This is Peter Kim for Gena Wang. Thanks for taking my question. I guess on question on valrox, it switches to a standard review, CMA want to see the full --the Phase III data to make their decision? Thank you very much. -- Yes. I'm not sure I heard the full question. Is it possible to repeat it? -- Sure. The question was, in a case where CMA review switches to standardized process, standardized review. I would like to see the full Phase III data to make our decision? -- Certainly an imaginable possibility. I think it's a little premature to talk about what sort of turns might happen in a review. As you know, we well, historically, we don't give very detailed comments about where we are in review because it's very difficult. It can be very difficult to interpret and matters can get settled.So I think the message of today is because of COVID, while we're on accelerate assessment to review is been delayed and because accelerated assessment is complicated to stay on, complicated also by the advanced nature of the therapeutic. There may be a further delay. We feel comfortable guiding you to an expectation of opinions in Q4 -- Q4 this year, Q1 of next year. But review is certainly not complete, and things may change further. -- Thank you very much. -- The good news, I would say -- I mean, and then I only flip that around. So the good news is we're that to happen, if we're fully enrolled with a pivotal trial. So it's not like we're not like a company that put the accelerated approval study into the regulators and then have not even started the confirmatory study. We finished the enrollment in the confirmatory study.Next question is from the line of Eliana Merle from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks so much for squeezing me in and congrats on all the progress. Just a question on vosoritide. Some of your recent discussions with the regulators around the filing, I guess, what was their latest perspective on how much efficacy data you need to have a label that covers ages under five? Or whether sort of the safety data from the ongoing studies, coupled with the Phase III in ages oversight and be enough for a broad label? Thanks. -- These conver -- hi, Eliana, thanks for the question. These conversations are at a much earlier stage than where those kinds of questions get answered. The negotiation is going to be what is -- what's in the package. And what will be in the package will be the safety data on patients who are older than six months of age, and up to five years of age, in addition to the pivotal study. They're very well aware of that, and they're also very well aware that their advisor committee advised them that they should anticipate that use will commence in very young children at the time of the initial licensure. But beyond that, we haven't had concrete conversations about labeling. -- And let me, by the way, the first two cohorts of the under five studies are fully enrolled. The enrollment of the third cohort, which is issuance from Asia -- from birth to six months of age, couple of patients have been enrolled. It's been slowed down a little bit, of course, by the virus, but the first two cohorts are fully enrolled.Next question is from the line of Vincent Chen from Bernstein. Your line is now open. -- Thank you very much for squeezing me in, and congrats on the progress. To follow-up on Josh's earlier question on insurance coverage shifts, if patients were to shift from commercial to government insurance, roughly what net price impact do you expect to see to your portfolio? And which products might be more effective, if any? Are there reasons to things that your portfolio might actually be somewhat more insulated than the, I guess, the biopharma sector as a whole? -- Jeff, do you want to try that one? -- Yeah, that's a great question, Vincent. We have government prices, we have 340B discounts depending on where patients are getting their care and we've got commercial patients. And for our portfolio in the United States, we don't contract for or discount our commercial portfolio. So if we had a substantial shift in patients moving from commercial plans to like Medicaid, for example, you could see an individual patient generating less net revenue based on the number of patients that we've got in the United States, we'd have to see a pretty big shift in patients over to the government brands before we'd see a material impact on our gross to net for revenues in the United States.And then thinking about the United States as a part of the diversified global business, probably the bigger part of our business in the U.S., while undoubtedly, the bigger part, is our PKU franchise relative to our enzyme patients. So I'm sorry for using while I'm answering, I think it's a great question. We haven't seen anything that even comes close to a signal of more than anecdotal reports of a patient here or there losing their private insurance and moving over to a safety net insurance. So, I think it's a theoretical thing, but we haven't seen anything close to that yet happening. Thank you.There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to our Chairman and CEO, J.J. Bienaime, for closing statements. -- All right. Thank you, operator. And it's just wonderful conclusion to say that in those unprecedented times and the necessity of innovative treatments that have been developed by BioMarin. And others have never been more relevant to the people who need them. It is the healthcare industry that will change the course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. One of the nice side effect of the virus is that the pricing of drugs is not making the headlines anymore, for obvious reasons, which is a good news for us. And -- but in the face of this very real near-term crisis, I remain very confident that in BioMarin's ability to deliver on the tremendous opportunity for value creation that we have before us.So our underlying fundamentals remain strong, and we are well positioned to successfully manage through this uncertain economic environment. The critical growth drivers are in place. Having built a successful base business, transition our pipeline to address larger rare indications and lay the foundation for significant profitability with ROCTAVIAN and vosoritide approvals. All of those positions BioMarin for substantial success in both the near-term and the long term. So, thank you, again, for your continued support, and stay safe.

All industries have been hit as investors dump risky assets.It isn't too surprising that shares of biotechnology companies have fallen along with the rest, since they typically involve significant risk. On the other hand, the pandemic is drawing attention to the enormous strides the industry has made in developing new platforms for vaccines and therapeutics. We may be seeing the political threat that worried investors so much in 2019 dissolve before our very eyes as the world looks to some of these companies for help in the global crisis.It isn't necessary to make risky and speculative bets to profit from biotech stocks in today's environment.  ,  , and \u00a0 all have healthy and profitable growth, and are reasonably priced.Image source: Getty Images.Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a biotech that dominates its key market in cystic fibrosis (CF), is growing rapidly, and is highly profitable. If that weren't enough to , the company has promising drugs in its pipeline that could allow it to enter new markets in blood diseases and diabetes, and it is loaded with cash that it intends to use for business development deals.The three medicines that have enabled Vertex to be the leader in treatments for CF are collectively approved to treat about half of the 75,000 CF patients in North America, Europe, and Australia. But it was an early approval\u00a0of a fourth medicine with the potential to treat 90% of CF patients that boosted the stock last October. Trikafta, cited last year by market research firm EvaluatePharma as the most valuable research and development program in the entire pharmaceutical industry, is off to a fast start with $420 million in sales in the fourth quarter.Even without Trikafta, Vertex's CF franchise was delivering red-hot growth. Product revenue for the full year 2019 grew by $1.12 billion, or 37%, to $4.16 billion, and the company's adjusted earnings per share rose 31% to $5.33.Vertex is building a foundation that should allow it to expand into new and lucrative disease areas. The company partnered with \u00a0on a gene-editing therapy for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease, and reported positive safety and efficacy results in the first two patients treated for the indications. The company is also excited about its  of Semma Therapeutics, which is working on a cell-based treatment for type 1 diabetes that it thinks has the potential to be a cure for the disease.Vertex has $3.8 billion in cash to help it buy its way into new markets, and has said it will be active in business development in 2020.Despite the momentum Vertex's business has, the stock is reasonably priced. Shares sell for 31 times analyst estimates\u00a0of 2020 earnings per share, which are expected to grow 44% over last year.Emergent BioSolutions could be the best  for investors who wouldn't ordinarily want to invest in biotechnology stocks. The company is arguably  among smaller companies in this space, with predictable revenue, steady profits, and a growing business.Emergent sells vaccines and therapeutics to address public health threats and provides contract and manufacturing services to other companies in the industry. With the U.S. government being its largest customer, much of the company's business is from long-term contracts that produce a consistent and predictable flow of revenue. Emergent's products include vaccines for anthrax, smallpox, cholera, and typhoid; countermeasures for chemical terrorism threats such as nerve toxins; and Narcan, the nasal spray first responders use to treat opioid overdose.Products to address public health threats are a growth business, as the current pandemic vividly illustrates. Revenue\u00a0for 2019 was up 41% to $1.11 billion, with 7% coming from organic growth\u00a0and the rest coming from acquisitions, which is a key strategy for the company. Emergent has added $600 million in annual revenue from its dealmaking since 2017\u00a0and intends to make more purchases soon. Organic growth should continue, thanks in part to a development pipeline of new vaccines and antitoxins. Emergent is also consistently profitable, with adjusted EPS growing 22% to $2.91 in 2019.It is also among the companies trying to solve the COVID-19 crisis. It's working on a plasma-derived drug\u00a0for the treatment and prevention of the disease and has announced agreements to supply development and manufacturing services to \u00a0and \u00a0for COVID-19 vaccines.Emergent's shares are about as cheap as it gets for biotechs. The stock sells for 17 times the consensus analyst estimate\u00a0for 2020 earnings.BioMarin specializes in drugs to treat rare genetic diseases, mostly in children, and the company's diversified portfolio of approved drugs has the company on the verge of profitability. For the full year of 2019, revenue\u00a0grew 14% to $1.7 billion, with five out of six of its drugs growing sales. And its  net loss fell to $23.8 million from $77.2 million in 2018. The fourth-quarter results show the momentum the company has, with revenue growing 29% and the company earning $0.08 per share, compared with a loss of $0.03 in the period a year ago.BioMarin's accelerating growth should make 2020 its first full year of profitability. The company has guided to full-year revenue between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion, or growth of 18% at the midpoint. Analysts\u00a0expect adjusted EPS of $0.30 this year and $1.15 in 2021.The company also has two potential blockbuster drugs in its pipeline that could keep its win streak going for years ahead. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec, mercifully nicknamed valrox, is the front-runner to be the first gene therapy for treating patients with hemophilia A. BioMarin's application for the drug  by the Food and Drug Administration, with a decision expected on Aug. 21.A phase 3 trial for vosoritide, a drug for achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that causes dwarfism, reported positive results in December, and the company expects to file applications for it later this year.Despite growing sales, a crossover to profitability, and a very promising late-stage pipeline, BioMarin's share price has gone nowhere for four years.

Companies like BioMarin, Bristol, and bluebird, after all, probably won't even experience a dramatic impact to their top or bottom lines from this global pandemic. This is panic selling, plain and simple.Are any of these biopharma stocks worth buying on the heels of this panic-induced downturn? BioMarin sports a solid portfolio of rare disease medications that are currently racking up sales at breakneck pace. What's more, the company should bring two more high-value drugs to market in the near future. So, in a word, it might be a good idea to add this name to your portfolio in the wake of this largely unwarranted sell-off.The same arguably goes for Bristol's stock. Bristol's oncology portfolio and pipeline are among the very best in the industry. Moreover, there's no reason to believe that cancer patients are going to stop receiving treatment because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bristol may experience a modest drop-off in international sales, but not to the degree the market is forecasting via this pullback.\u00a0Bluebird may be a different story altogether. The company has been locked in a prolonged downward trend due to concerns about potential competitors in the\u00a0.

Emergent hasn't said it's working on a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 directly, but the company does have a contract manufacturing facility that the U.S. government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority helped establish in 2012, which was expanded in 2017. Beyond the government, there's potential for Emergent to benefit from through developing drugs and vaccines with non-government organizations (NGOs) or other drugmakers that need manufacturing capabilities.\"The rise of COVID-19 and the push to develop response capabilities against this emerging infectious disease is squarely in our wheelhouse,\" Robert Kramer, president and CEO of Emergent, said on the company's 2019 fourth-quarter  last month. \"Currently we're working with several organizations, including the U.S. government, NGOs, and commercial parties as to how to best marshal our resources and capabilities, whether it's for the vaccine, a therapeutic, diagnostic, or utilizing our extensive contract development and manufacturing capability.\"Image source: Getty Images.BioMarin sells drugs for orphan diseases, which will still need treatment even in the face of a larger COVID-19 outbreak that might slow economic growth.

Please go ahead, Tracy. -- Thank you, Sarah, and welcome, everyone.To remind you today this non-confidential presentation contains forward-looking statements about the business prospects of BioMarin pharmaceutical Inc. including expectations regarding BioMarin's financial performance, commercial products and potential future products in different areas of therapeutic research and development. Results may differ materially depending on the progress of BioMarin's product programs, actions of regulatory authorities, availability of capital, future actions in the pharmaceutical market and developments by competitors and those factors detailed in BioMarin's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K report.On the call from BioMarin management today are J. J. Bienaime, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Ajer, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Robert Baffi, President, Global Manufacturing and Technical Operations; Hank Fuchs, President, Worldwide Research and Development; and Brian Mueller, Acting Chief Financial Officer. We intend to keep this call to one hour, so please reach out to me if we don't get to your questions.Now I'd like to turn the call over to BioMarin's Chairman and CEO, J. J. Bienaime. -- Thank you, Traci. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered record results for the full year 2019, demonstrating our continued operational excellence. In parallel, our productive R&D and gene advanced to the next wave of products expected to contribute significantly to top line growth in the coming years. We begin the new decade with an established base business that is foundational to our financial strength. We expect to turn profitable on a GAAP basis in 2020. For the first time in the history of the company, our revenue growth and improvement in profitability is also increasing our operating cash flows as our total cash and investment grew for the second straight quarter in Q4 of last year.On the development and commercialization side of the business and investing pipeline focused on larger rare indications, three potential blockbusters on the horizons are launched. Palynziq is already delivering strong results, and these results are expected to drive better growth for our stakeholders in the next few years.Starting with valrox for severe hemophilia A as reported last week, we received a prior review of our BLA from the FDA with a PDUFA action date of August 21 of this year, and no advisory committee being scheduled by the FDA at this time. For a little perspective, in the last 12 months, we've made the criteria necessary to similar applications for expedited review in the US and Europe, we submitted and were granted acceptance of both applications. We completed an enrollment in our pivotal Phase III study, and we produced material from our GMP facility to prepare for the commercial launch later this year. We actually already have inventory to treat about 500 patients with valrox this year. This exceptional execution across the organization underscores BioMarin's commitment to our key strategic priority, significant and sustainable long-term top and bottom line growth. We expect valrox will be an important contributor, and in a moment, Jeff will expand on some of our assumptions as we prepare for a potential launch later this year. Also in 2019, with vosoritide for achondroplasia, we were pleased to have shared the highly statistical significance one year results from our pivotal Phase III trial, demonstrating a strong increase in gross velocity across the 121 children age five through 14, who participated in the trial.As with valrox, we anticipate a highly innovative attributes of vosoritide will drive uptake from patients and meaningful contributions to the business above potential [Indecipherable]. There is a tremendous unmet medical need in this patient population and timing's of the essence for approval and applications treatment option as every year growth loss is [Indecipherable] case. In a moment, Hank will outline the next steps along the path to approval with vosoritide. The next few years represent a tremendous opportunity for value creation based on the following; two potential blockbuster launches in valrox and vosoritide, continued expansion of our PKU franchise with global Palynziq penetration and PKU therapy in the future gene therapy for HEE and vosoritide now exploring a second indication for dominantly inherited short stature beyond achondroplasia. The balance cash reserves [Indecipherable] manufacturing and global footprint, so we are very well positioned for dramatic and sustainable growth and profitability in the future. Critical growth drivers for long-term are in place, and we believe we will deliver unprecedented results for all our stakeholders.So in conclusion for this introductory remarks, we are pleased with our achievements in 2019 and full of anticipation for what lies ahead in 2020 and beyond. As we begin a new decade, having the strong base business, transition our pipeline to address larger rare indications, laid the foundation for significant profitability with valrox and vosoritide approvals. We have a diversified risk and positioned ourselves for substantial success in both the near-term and the long-term.So thank you for your continued support and I will now turn the call over to Jeff for a discussion of our commercial business. Jeff? -- Thank you, J. J. Of course, the acceptance of the BLA is a significant milestone for the commercial organization as we prepare for a potential launch later this year. So I will quickly review the results before sharing our thinking on the valrox value proposition. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a year where all brands contributed to total BioMarin revenues of $1.7 billion, a 14% increase over 2018 total revenues. A notable milestone was achieved with Vimizim becoming the first BioMarin brand to reach and surpass $500 million in annual sales. Combined growth from our two newest brands Palynziq and Brineura was a material factor in this solid performance. Ongoing instability in certain markets, including Turkey, Iran and Argentina presented challenges throughout the year, but I'm very pleased with the overall results delivered by my team in the quarter and full year.Looking more specifically at the quarterly results, revenues in Q4 totaled $454 million, representing 29% increase year-over-year. Recall that in Q3 2019, we detailed for you the first installment of a new 12-month supply agreement with the Brazil Ministry of Health and recorded $45 million in sales for Naglazyme and Vimizim combined. As expected, corresponding revenues in the fourth quarter of last year were lower that effect was offset by higher revenues from Palynziq and Brineura, resulting in flat quarter-over-quarter revenues. Focusing specifically on Palynziq, we are recording $32 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, a 32% increase over the third quarter of last year. The majority of that revenue came from the US, where the launch continues on a successful trajectory. Revenue met our expectations despite an anticipated seasonal slowdown in enrollments and patient starts late in the year.At the end of Q4, there were over 900 adult PKU patients that either already were being treated with commercial Palynziq or preparing for their first treatment. Specifically, 762 patients were on Palynziq commercial therapy, including 625 formerly naive to Palynziq and 137 from clinical studies with an additional 143 enrolled naive patients who had not yet received their first dispense. Another marker of the continued growth we are seeing, 18 months post-launch, is the continued increase in active treatment sites, which grew to 97 clinics in Q4 versus 93 in the previous quarter.Finally, our teams have been focused in the US on transitioning patients currently on Kuvan, but who do not achieve optimal fee control Palynziq. These efforts are going quite well, and since launched 40% of nonclinical enrollments were previously active Kuvan patients. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter where we have shared these metrics consistent with the commitments we made on the call following FDA approval. Since Palynziq now is moving from launch phase in the US to a steady growth phase over-time, we will focus our attention and yours on revenue growth moving forward.In Europe, multiple clinics across Germany are now actively treating patients with Palynziq and early uptake signals are encouraging. Similar to our experience in the US meaningful revenues will be driven by patients reaching maintenance dosing, which follows the patient-specific and variable induction and titration period. We continue to expect material sales in Europe in 2020. As many of you know, finalizing the German price is first step before negotiating reimbursement approvals in most other European markets. Without the benefit of clinical trial patients and named patient sales channels in Europe, we progress on a more traditional pharmaceutical launch trajectory, where we will pursue opportunities market by market. In summary, there is a lot of interest and enthusiasm for Palynziq. The positive experience in Germany has created a helpful precedent as we look to expand Palynziq into other countries.Turning to valrox, having recently received priority review of the DLA from FDA as well as validation of the MAA from Europe in December, interest is building ahead of the potential launch of the first gene therapy product to treat severe hemophilia A. In contemplating the commercial value of valrox. It is necessary to understand and acknowledge the significant burden and cost of severe hemophilia A, given the current standard of care, chronic prophylactic factor VIII replacement therapy. As a single infusion with ongoing effects, valrox has the potential to dramatically change the treatment paradigm and how we think about managing severe hemophilia A. The growing body of data from our clinical trials suggest that the potential benefits of treating patients with valrox over product prophylactic factor VIII therapy could be transformational.A recent publication has estimated the average annual cost of prophylactic factor VIII to be between $700,000 and $750,000 per year. Modeling these annual costs forward for an adult male, an 18-year-old with life expectancy to 71 years, could utilize $38 million of factor replacement at today's costs. In the context of these high costs and at a presumed price in line with other recently approved gene therapy products, cost-effectiveness of valrox could be expected in a relatively short period of time. As an element of commercial readiness, we have done extensive work to understand the payer perspective in the US and key international markets. The first thing to note is that hemophilia is a large line item in these payers budgets and has their attention. Payers are interested in the potential of improved clinical outcomes and quality of life benefits, and they expect savings over time.Additionally, payers are interested in managing the risk of patients achieving a full response and the durability of that response. Those variables could possibly be addressed by outcomes-based agreements, and some payers have also expressed an interest in payment over time models. We are working to develop payment models that fit the needs and desires of payers noting there are currently limitations to the agreements that can be implemented in the United States, and there are varying preferences of payers in international markets. A key element of commercial readiness is to be prepared with payment models that will facilitate patients gaining access to valrox if approved.As J. J. said, we expect to hear about the potential approval of valrox in the second half of this year. And as usual, we would expect to have more information on pricing at that time. In the meantime, we continue to prepare for a potential launch in the latter half of this year with great anticipation and excitement.Thank you. And now I would like to turn the call over to Hank. -- Thanks, Jeff. I'd like to start by echoing Jeff sentiment about the sense of excitement at BioMarin as we start this new decade. With the potential approval of valrox on the horizon later this year. From pre-clinical assets through applications under review, the breadth of our development pipeline has never been as diverse or de-risked. With valrox in roughly four years, we have gone from the first administration in humans to having a marketing applications under review on an expedited basis in both the United States and Europe. The efficiency of the valrox development programs is an achievement in and of itself. The potential for valrox to completely change the treatment paradigm for hemophilia is an even greater feat. We want to thank the hemophilia community for providing BioMarin the opportunity and support to successfully develop valrox, a major part of the support comes from the dedication and commitment of key opinion leaders in the field.Earlier in the year, we are honored to see valrox recognized for the second time in the New England Journal of Medicine with the publication of a multiyear follow-up of our Phase II program. To remind you of the data, three years after infusion, the median number of annualized treated bleeding events was reduced from 16 while patients were on 2 times to 3 times weekly prophylaxis to 0. And accordingly, the median use of exogenous factor VIII was reduced from 138.5 infusions to 0 infusions. Leading an all target joints in this cohort resolved. Given these data and in reference to Jeff's previous remarks on experiencing cost effectiveness and a reasonably short period of time, we now have supportive evidence of such a possibility. These impressive data were not only the basis of the publication of New England Journal of Medicine but also were the basis of a recent independent academic research paper modeling the benefit that gene therapy may offer as an alternative to prophylactic exogenous factor VIII infusions. The findings projected that valrox would be the dominant treatment choice, being both cost-saving and producing superior patient health outcomes with at least 2.4 years of durable response. This is based on potential reduction in factor VIII use, direct medical costs, lifetime bleeds and accumulated joint damage.Needless to say, the increasing value of data supporting durability of response with valrox as outlined in New England Journal of Medicine and potentially at the upcoming four-year durability mark gives us increasing confidence in the benefits of valrox to patients and to healthcare systems. The next steps toward the valrox approval this year are the CHMP and Committee in Advanced Therapeutics opinions coming due in the second half of the year, and the PDUFA action goal date of August 21, 2020, following priority review designation. During this time, we'll be working closely with health authorities to facilitate this expeditious review so we can make valrox available as quickly as possible for patients. As for the ongoing Phase II study, we intend to share a four-year update with the 60 13 dose as well as a three-year update with the 40 13 dose at available conference in June or July. The importance of the valrox four-year update and continued durability of bleed control is a key focus, and we hope to see results consistent with what has been observed through year three, stay tuned.Turning now to Vosoritide for the treatment of achondroplasia, we are now nearing the finish line. We are very pleased to share the highly statistically significant results from our Phase III program last December. A p-value of less than 0.0001 and annualized growth velocity of 1.6 centimeter gain over one year of observation. On top of that, R&D day, we shared Phase II 54-month results demonstrating 9 centimeter of cumulative growth improvement compared to untreated patients in natural history because our global multi-pronged program has been designed to demonstrate clinical benefit for infants and children with achondroplasia. Another key component is the Phase II study in zero-to-five-year olds. We've nearly completed enrollment of the first two cohorts of the study, which includes children from six months of age to five years old; and the last cohort, which includes newborns through six months of old is expected to complete enrollment thereafter. Needless to say, the level of interest from family seeking treatment for their very young children is consistent with our belief and starting treatment as early as possible. We're thrilled with the clinical results to date with vosoritide and have plans to conduct pre-submission meetings with health authorities to determine the scope and therefore, the timing of the marketing application authorization in Europe and the new drug application in the United States, which we anticipate later in the year.Turning now to BMN 307, our investigational gene therapy for phenylketonuria. We expect to start enrolling patients in the peerless Phase II study, which is a dose-escalation, dose-selection study later this quarter, with an expansion arm expected in the second half of the year. This study could potentially be registration enabling past that expansion as we're conducting it with material manufactured using a commercial-ready process to de-risk this program and facilitate rapid clinical development and registration. We are excited about the prospect of BMN 307 as it represents a potential third treatment for phenylketonuria in our franchise; and a second gene therapy development program, leveraging our learnings and capabilities from valrox.As for data updates, we'll provide a data update on this study once we have chosen a dose and have started the registration-enabling part of the study. Finally, our earlier-stage pipeline includes BMN 331, gene therapy for hereditary angioedema and vosoritide for dominantly inherited short stature and both of these programs are moving forward nicely. We're completing pre-clinical work with BMN 331 and expect Phase I/II with vosoritide with dominantly inherited short stature to start later this year as part of a research collaboration with Children's hospital. The R&D organization is energized as we look toward 2020 unfolding as we prepare for valrox approval, application submissions for vosoritide and enrollment of our Phase II study with BMN 307, PKU gene therapy, with 331 gene therapy for HAE and indication expansion under way for vosoritide.We look forward to speaking with you soon as these events progress, and thank you for your continued support. And I'll now turn the call over to Brian to review the financials in the quarter. Brian? -- Thank you, Hank. Please refer to today's press release summarizing our financial results for full details on the fourth quarter and full year 2019. Since Jeff touched on many of the top line results from the commercial business, I will focus on the bottom line result, operating expenses and our 2020 guidance. As usual, all results will be available in our upcoming Form 10-K, which we are on track to file over the next couple of days. The endpoint just comments about our revenue momentum, we're pleased to announce total revenue guidance for 2020 of between $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion. If we are able to achieve $2 billion in revenue in 2020 that would represent 17% growth over 2019.In terms of the bottom line, for the full year 2019, we provided guidance of a GAAP net loss between $45 million to $65 million. And have reported a better than guidance, GAAP net loss of $24 million for the year. This improvement in GAAP net loss in 2019 over 2018, particularly in the second half of the year, driven by our growing revenues and operating leverage gives us comfort to guiding to GAAP net income on a full year basis for the first time in company history. For the full year 2020, we expect GAAP net income of between $20 million to $80 million, depending on the contribution from valrox. In our press release, we also noted that our guidance does not reflect a potential tax benefit that we may recognize in 2020. I will elaborate on that in a moment.Turning to non-GAAP income. We delivered $167 million for the full year 2019 and $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by strong top line results across the commercial portfolio. Non-GAAP income for the full year 2019 was over 80% higher than non-GAAP income for the full year 2018 and sets us up for further non-GAAP profitability growth in 2020. For the full year 2020, we anticipate non-GAAP income of between $260 million and $310 million. The midpoint of which is growth of more than $100 million and over 70% increase over 2019. This anticipated growth in non-GAAP income is substantial, with the midpoint of our 2020 guidance being 3 times our GAAP net income from two years ago in 2018.Moving to operating expenses both R&D and SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of '19, roughly tracked with recent trends and within our 2019 guidance ranges. R&D expenses were flat year-over-year at $173 million and for the full year 2019, were $715 million. In the fourth quarter, R&D expenses reflected continued enrollment of additional patients in the valrox global Phase III GENEr8-1 study, manufacturing of BMN 307, our PKU gene therapy product ahead of clinical trials this year and the zero to five-year-old study with vosoritide for achondroplasia. For the full year 2020, we expect R&D expenses of between $675 million to $725 million, representing steady-state R&D spending and balancing the completion of the valrox and vosoritide, large-scale Phase III studies with the start of the BMN 307 PKU gene therapy clinical program, pre-clinical studies of BMN 331 for HAE and the completion of the vosoritide Phase II study in zero-to-five-year old.SG&A expenses for the quarter and full year 2019 were $188 million and $681 million, respectively. And were higher than 2018, reflecting the continued expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities for the launch of Palynziq in Europe and ongoing preparations for valrox and vosoritide approvals in March. For the full year 2020, we expect SG&A expenses of between $780 million and $830 million in preparation for the global launch of valrox and ongoing commercialization of Palynziq in Europe.In terms of cash and cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2019, we have $1.17 billion as compared to $1.32 billion on December 31, 2018. Our revenue growth and improvement in profitability is also translating to our operating cash flows as our cash and investments have increased at the end of 2019 for the second straight quarter.Now back to the potential tax transaction that I mentioned earlier. As noted in our press release, full year 2020 GAAP net income guidance of $20 million to $80 million does not reflect the potential impact associated with intra-entity intangible asset transfers between BioMarin entities that may occur in the second half of 2020. If these transactions occur, we estimate that the tax effect could be a onetime non-cash income tax benefit of greater than $500 million. You may have seen similar tax gains recognized by some of our peers in the fourth quarter of 2019, and we wanted to make sure you are both aware of the potential transaction and the financial reporting, which, again, is non-cash GAAP income tax benefit with no anticipated impact on our operations or cash flows in 2020.In closing, 2020 is the year that we expect BioMarin to become GAAP profitable based on the expectation that total revenues will be $2 billion roughly for the year. Over the next 18 months, we also expect to accelerate in the next phase of higher revenue and profitability growth through the potential approval and launches of valrox and vosoritide.Thank you for your support, and we will now open-up the call to your questions.[Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the progress. Just a two part question on valrox. First, we've heard from some physicians that there's a pool of early adopters out there who want to try gene therapy close to the time of the launch, but it's hard to quantify how many of those patients are out there. Do you have any data, either from your own market research or your clinical studies as to how big that population could be?And then the second part of the question is just valrox isn't called out in your 2020 revenue guidance, does your guidance include any contribution from it? Thanks. -- Yes. I'll start with it. Hi Phil, it's J. J. So in terms of two of early adopters, I mean, there is definitely very significant interest in the drug -- I mean, maybe the best way to characterize it in the US, we do a lot of educational programs on gene therapy, in general. Gene therapy for hemophilia A. So we have some educational programs website, whereby the patients can opt-in to receive so they can provide us with some personal information to opt in to receive information on valrox. And as of couple of days ago, I think we had already 400 patients in the US alone, that show interest in receiving information on valrox. I presume these patient are -- I mean, it's unlikely that all of them will actually want to move forward. But I think a large number of them will. And then all of them. It's unlikely that all of them will be eligible for therapy, but they're definitely interest in it. And also, there's a market research as we have communicated in the past that show that hemophilia patients are very interested in the drug.Second question is valrox, yes, including in the guidance. Valrox is included in the guidance in terms of top line and, of course, bottom line. The issue with valrox this year in terms of -- that's why we don't want to give you valrox guidance this year. Actually, we really do it when we were in the launch year for any product because it's highly dependent upon the timing of the approval, PDUFA date is late August. But you never know, it happen And if it happens in late August, then it must be much easier to generate some significant revenues, than if it happens in October or November. And this is as of today, a bit beyond our control. Same for Europe. If we stay on the accelerated assessment pathway, we should get approval in the summer. But it could be later presented. Even after approval, we could ship the product pretty quickly, but then the release of the paperwork just even in the US to get the patients started on therapy, reimbursed. And then remember, we're going to need to get the patients to do the AAV5 antibody test. Actually, some of them we align them up to do it as soon as possible after launch. So this seems like a little difficult to give you a tight valrox-only guidance for this year, but we'll do it for next year.So Jeff, anything to add? -- Well stated, J. J. Nothing to add on that. -- Okay. Next question?Your next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks for taking the questions. This is Andrea on for Salveen. Maybe just one question for Jeff. Can you also provide additional color on the registry that's been formed to promote your patient outreach? And help us understand how eligible patients are being identified to potentially come on to valrox upon the launch later this year? Thank you. -- So J. J. mentioned an opt-in mechanism. So this is not a formal registry per se, these are non-branded promotional efforts that we conduct relative to gene therapy education in general. To introduce BioMarin to the community, and there is a mechanism for patients to opt-in for further contact from BioMarin and other information as it becomes available. So that's really an unofficial mechanism, and we don't really have anything Hank to note at this point about expectations of a more formal registry. -- Other than we'll do a post-approval registry if that's required from a regulatory perspective, although obviously, documenting the long-term outcomes for patients treated with valrox is going to be a prime interest in the medical community over time. Look like that data. -- But I guess, as I said earlier, we're going to gear up for these decisions that have shown interest opted in our program, where you have to get these patients tested with the AAV5 antibody test as soon as possible after approval to generate the first revenues. -- Got it. Thanks so much.Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I've got two as well. I guess, the first one on vosoritide. I'm just curious what the gating factors would be to submitting the BLA outside of your meeting with regulators? Is there anything left to do on the CMC front or things like that? And then secondly, on valrox, when you're having those reimbursement discussions on the product, it sounds like you've been having a lot of them, how much are payers waiting on that data from your four-year update to further inform the potential durability of the product? Thanks. -- Thanks, Cory. I'll start with the first one on gating factors of vosoritide. -- Well, why don't you start and maybe Robert can also -- -- Yeah. So gating factors of vosoritide, including consideration of CMC. So as we've said before, that and it was nicely demonstrated by the 2018 advisory committee that the FDA held. There really are four principal components to the vosoritide development program, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trial, p-value of 10 to the minus 13, check, check, check. 205 study, long-term data, treating patients with vosoritide for 4.5 years, demonstrating growth velocity that is sustainably increased over pretreatment baseline levels in spite of declining growth velocity in untreated patients.A contemporary natural history study that we showed you 4.5 years of comparison at R&D day, demonstrating that compared to patients who were not treated with vosoritide age and gender-matched patients gained at least 9 centimeter more, while being treated with vosoritide than they would have gained if they were not treated, and an ongoing study in patients under 5. So we're check, check, check as you say, the next gating step is to have the meeting. As you may know from the advisory committee, there were some question about the length of the placebo-controlled study. We believe we have strong arguments to make about why this package checks all the boxes.And Robert, do you want to comment on any CMC issues we need to address between now and the submission? -- Yeah. So thank you for the question, Cory. Certainly, we have been tracking to the clinical development time line. And in fact, we did complete the process qualification campaigns in 2019, collected the data from those campaigns. Well into the process of writing up the documentation for the BLA, and are tracking along with Hank and his team to a filing date later on this year, and all systems go in terms of the CMC activities. Currently, anticipated from a regulatory review perspective, having met with the agency several times during the program that outline our CMC strategy. -- Then you had a question on payers -- want to talk about that? -- Happy to do that. So great point. Great question, Cory. The commercial audiences, including payers, in general, I would characterize the sentiment of durability looking something like this, an expectation of continued durability based on the data demonstrated so far and based on kind of the biologic mechanism of action here, with a healthy respect of the risk of loss of durability at some point in a future window. And as I mentioned in my remarks, I think that translates into a desire to try to manage that risk, which is something that we can potentially do with outcomes-based agreements. And I might characterize, that's a very different sentiment than not believing in durability until we see that data reported on. Of course, having four-year data mid this year will be a very helpful data point, and we look forward to having that. -- Let me tell you. So just people, Jeff and myself, actually, we mentioned a lot of payers already here. They ever heard a payer say, well, if it works at three, but let's say, we don't have anything at four. There is no threshold. That's not the way they function. A minimum efficacy that they need to have to pay for the product. What we're really looking at very closely, it's factory usage. And I think Hank mentioned, with the most recent New England Journal of Medicine application. So we basically almost eliminated entirely, factor VIII usage three after treatment, and we're looking forward to showing some big control at the four-year update. -- Okay. Very helpful. Thank you guys.Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. -- Hey, thanks. I've got just a couple of questions, too. So I guess, guys, I know you kind of answered the question a little bit when Phil asked it, but if I can pull maybe a little deeper. Just on valrox's role in the guidance. Just by my math, if you add up all the components and even take into account Aldurazyme royalties. There's about $125 million or so gap midpoint to midpoint. So I'm not sure if you're going to answer this, but I think -- -- Chris, it's in the guidance. And obviously, if we have it -- if we have some It'll be easier to meet the guidance, then maybe not. -- Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a broader question on the pricing, J. J. specifically. So I think we all appreciate the cost avoidance, some sure payers as well and not just in factor, but other stuff that it offers. And just kind of talk a little bit about this is a relatively politically charged time with respect to drug prices. I think you've already attracted the attention of at least one presidential candidate on this. Just talk J. J. a little bit about how this is factoring into your pricing calculus, if at all? Thanks. -- So the political factors, of course, we'll enter into our final decision. So that we have a little time before deciding, we'll see where we stand on whether we have to press the drug sometime around December. But I think already the cost offset still is a pretty significant story for the payers. They know how much these patients cost them, Jeff gave you some metrics. We have a study from general equi economics that was recently published, that does show the dramatic potential reduction in savings, thanks to valrox. Whatever price, I mean, of course, there is a limit to how much you can price it. But regarding what's anticipated, the savings, apparent to the healthcare system in the US are going to be pretty high.So I think the top prices might need to be indicated about the market that we are entering into and the cost of treating hemophilia, in general. Also I started doing an analysis, we should be available sometime this summer, which would be another variable as to what we can do here. And I think, of course, the headlines are the headlines, but at the same time, we'll see how we communicate our price. We will try to highlight the price per year of documented efficacy, which whatever price we decide, I'm going to tell you it's going to be much lower than many other therapies that are approved today. So that's definitely the variable. And also, I just want to highlight, so we don't sell a service.So we're not going to sell service and what's the price. Remember, we're going to sell vials at the end of the day. And actually, the product is going to be dosed based on weight. So price will be variable from patient to patient, depending on their weight for one. And also, is that related to the fact that a lot or probably the majority of the patients that needs in the US will be treated in 340B hospitals, whereby there will be a mandatory discount that will be applied. It remains to be seen whether it's going to be 17% to 23%, between 17% and 23%. The general mandatory discounts is 23%. But factor we placed on actually recently HEMLIBRA got some kind of exemptions, and it's actually only 17% for hemophilia A. We hope to get the same exemption and have a 17% discount. So let me tell you fact that we're still going to need different number of vials, different weights, different discounts, we'll provide a list this. And you've shown that you are very good in math. I'm sure you'll figure out, Chris. -- That's cool. Thank you so much.And your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open. -- Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I have another valrox question, of course. So when you're thinking -- I guess, two quick ones. Just to be clear, so the four-year data, if you continue to show reduction in bleeds, will that affect the price point? Is the price roughly been decided already? Or is there any more moving parts?And then second question, so you noted, there's 400 people you've identified so far that really want it right out of the gate. What are you identifying in your market research that points to what people want to see or what other patients want to see before getting the gene therapy? What trends should we be looking for just want to get it right out of the gate? Thanks. -- I'll start with the first question and let Jeff answer, I mean, the second one and maybe also part of the third. So we have three years, we have already documented three years of efficacy, of course, four years will be additional data that will enter into the picture, maybe to actually calculate the cost offset more than anything else or documented cost offset. This is going to be another variable, as I say, it's a variable in the continuum of the reimbursement discussion. It's not we have to pass a certain hurdle. But it will be there. And also, the cost of that just calculated based on the cost of HEMLIBRA. HEMLIBRA and the governing factor VIII prophylactic in the US is about the same price right now, but at WAC it's about $700,000 to $750,000 a year. But there are many other offsets and values in valrox, patients are going to save the need to go to get intravenous infusions or the equipment that the supply that they need for that. This is based on our own data, I know, they still have significant bleeding episodes. This is for the emergency rooms, need for surgery. Actually, it's being estimated, I think, in some papers that were recently published that the cost of treating of bleeding episodes in the US is $50,000 per bleeding episodes. So it always centers into the pictures, and these are metrics that the payers know about, and we'll take into account in negotiating a price with with us.Jeff, you go perspective on the four years and then talk about what kind of people, patients want to see whatever. -- Thanks, J. J. I think you've stated it for the 4-year data and price. Maybe in terms of kind of early adopters. We've noted this kind of opt-in mechanism, which is a really, really helpful way of connecting early with patients and caregivers that want to receive more information. And as J. J. said, we'll have an opportunity, we hope, right after launch to help facilitate, for example, AAV5 sort of positivity testing, which would be one dimension of eligibility criteria. So our expectation of valrox at launch, is that a minority of hemophilia A patients would be eligible for treatment with valrox based on dimensions or variables such as age, whether or not they're an adult, degree of severity of hemophilia A and others. So it's not exactly -- I wouldn't want to set the expectation that all of those patients are going to be jumping in the first month and be treated. In terms of identifying early patients that target at launch, you won't be surprised to hear that we've been conducting market research to identify both with patients that are identifying as early adopters and what their profiles look like, and also physicians that are eager to treat and what they view as an ideal early candidate for treatment. And because we're operating in a highly competitive environment, I probably wouldn't have anything more specific to say on that subject for now, except to say that we're obviously doing the work. -- Okay, thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys, It's Aspen on for Jeff. Just a couple of quick ones on valrox and then one on guidance. So first on the AdCom decision, is this more of the FDA just not having schedule one yet or have they explicitly kind of expressed that they don't think it'll be necessary?And then beyond the companion diagnostic, any other plans to help make diagnosis and treatment as smooth as possible?And sorry, one last one. On Vimizim guidance, it looks like the midpoint is implying a bit of a slowdown in growth than what we've seen over the past couple of years. Can you help us understand the dynamics going into the guidance there? Thanks. -- So AdCom, not necessary, not schedule later. And the reason we're saying it's not necessary is because what they wrote to us is that this time, we don't believe that an AdCom would be necessary. That's pretty definitive for them. And all the discussions that we've had with them, they've never signaled any interest in AdCom. And there really are as we've talked about before, at our pre-BLA meeting where they had a lot of opportunity to ask questions about the clinical efficacy, which would be typically the place that an AdCom would come in. They said, we don't have any issues to discuss with you on the clinical efficacy because we had agreed on the efficacy criteria before the study was completed and reported on, and you've met all those criteria. So we have nothing to ask an advisory committee since you jumped over our high bar.And as far as identifying patients, the Canadian diagnostic is unique in the sense that it identifies patients who are AAV5 positive. Now maybe later, we'll be able to demonstrate how to treat AAV5 positive patients. But in the first instance, we think pre-existing immunity to the capsid could inform clinical outcome. So that's why we're launching the companion diagnostic. As far as other diagnostics to identify potentially eligible patients, it's really not necessary because hemophilia A is such a severe condition. And the easy way to tell if you have severe hemophilia A is to measure your blood clotting factor in your plasma very routine lab test done diagnostically all of our adult patients already know that they have severe hemophilia. This is not one of these diagnoses that sneaks up on you or requires any kind of specialization to make. Now severe hemophilia A is one of the most devastating medical conditions there are. -- Yeah. This is Brian, Aspen. Thanks for the question. Regarding your dividend guidance question, you're right. So the midpoint of the range, it represents about 7.5% growth in Vimizim revenues. We view that as still pretty strong. This brand is in its seventh year of launch, so it is a mature product. But with that being said, and I can let Jeff color in with any details. We are still finding patients around the world. So still growing. -- Yeah. Thanks, Brian. Maybe just a little bit of color from the kind of sales tranches here. So the dynamics on Vimizim is we're essentially in market now in all of the primary and secondary and most of the tertiary markets we're going to get into. So opening up new markets with substantial pools of patients, probably not the source of growth going forward. We continue to identify patients and get them on to therapy at a pretty good pace, as Bryan just noted. So that's kind of a built-in growth driver. And like with all of our enzymes the patients that get started early on treatment, they tend to perform really well on treatment and stay compliant and durable as patients over time. We are at that point in the life cycle, where we're hitting some price renegotiations in certain markets and so that's another one of the little headwinds. But our expectation is that Vimizim will continue to grow in 2020 and into the future as well.Your next question comes from the line of Martin Auster from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Hi everyone, this is Mark on for Marty. Thanks for taking my question. It's on valrox again. So J. J., I know you had previously mentioned that 300 patients had lined to be in the valrox Phase III trial. But unfortunately, the trial was enrolling about 130 patients. So I was hoping to better understand this 300 number? Was this based on reported interest that was communicated to you? Or was it based on patients actually filling out preliminary paperwork to join the trial?And then secondly -- -- Sorry, signed informed consent. This was real. -- And then in addition, I guess, how much of this excess demand was from patients in the US versus Europe or rest of the world? -- Global, wouldn't be able to break it out for you sitting here. But from the trial that we put in the field, there's no evidence of geographic preference in terms of update. Our strategy on site selection, Jeff and I have been talking about this for a lot of years, and we knew that as novel is gene therapy is going to be, we're going to have to cultivate centers of excellence for dose administration for monitoring of ALTs for steroid management. And so we wanted to create a cadre of physicians who have a lot of experience, and we also wanted to do that on a global basis because the condition is itself global and the commercial opportunity is global. So we didn't overpopulate in any particularly key region. And I think therefore, the representation that we're getting back from this really is a global representation. It's not heavily informed by a particular market or its particular uncertainties.Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. My apologies. Your next question will now come from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Hi everyone, this is Kostas on for Matthew. I have two questions. My first is, how should we think about potential challenges to valrox revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020? -- Sorry. a potential what, sorry? -- Challenges. -- I mean, the main challenge is the timing of the approval. -- And not that, that's particularly a challenge. It's just that uncertainty that the -- -- Main variable. The timing of the approval. -- Maybe just a little bit of color on that. So revenues are going to be sensitive to timing of approval because the approval sets in motion, these other things that need to be done before a patient can be treated and revenue recognized, for example, we're going to have to have labeled product released in a warehouse ready to ship, and that could take a short period of time. We're going to have to get reimbursement approvals for patients that want to start therapy. Patients who want to start therapy are going to have to do a zero positivity test that could take a couple of weeks from start to finish. So there's a number of mechanical things going on that will take a little bit of time. And that tied with the timing of an approval makes the revenues in Q4 kind of a sensitive or challenging thing to forecast.And your next question comes from -- -- We have one more comment here. -- The timing of approval thing is coming. We've got now, I just want to make sure that people are not hearing that we have concerns about the approval of this. When Palynziq was submitted, the FDA told us, expect a major amendment. So we were communicating that the PDUFA date was likely to be expected to be longer. We're not conveying that here. We have a PDUFA date of August 21, and my theme is working toward an August 21, US action date. And we're reasonably confident that, that's what's going to -- -- That's a good point. And also, and the commercial team in US and Europe is getting ready for it earlier. We are going to early August launch, basically.And your next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Citi. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. Maybe a couple from my side. How should we expect the use of steroids to bed incorporate in the label? Do you think the FDA guidance would be necessary here for the practicing physicians? And the next one is basically, do you have any plans to make valrox available in younger patients like 12 to 18 years old. Why? Thank you. -- I didn't hear the second question. -- What do we think about steroids on the -- -- Can you repeat your second question, please? -- Can you repeat the second part? -- Yes. So do you have any plans to make valrox available for younger boys, 12 to 18-year old? And what steps will you take? Thank you. -- Okay. So on steroids, very early to talk about the label. It's pretty premature. But what I can tell you is we've got two experiences with steroids that have been now well described, the Phase I/II study with prophylactic steroids and a total of seven patients treated the high dose. And on-demand steroid use in the interim analysis that's coming to the FDA for review for approval. So we have some of each. And if it's not in the label, we hope that medical information can be provided for prescribers. I think what you're going to find out there are -- first of all, it's going to take a really long time to establish if there is such a thing as a better steroid regimen because the thing that we obviously care about is duration of effect. And now that we're out past three years, it's going to take longer than three years to establish durability and comparisons of one regimen to another regimen. So it's going to take a long time before optimal steroid regimen is actually known. Therefore, in the meantime, giving physicians a choice, I think, is a very prudent option for us.And we have some of each. We have some prophylactic steroid use and we have some on-demand steroid use. So we think we're well positioned with our steroid experience. And as far as our plans for pediatric investigation, the process is that we've agreed with the pediatric committee of the CHMP of the European Medicines Agency that will get to an action decision before defining the next steps of our pediatric development program. So we're obviously very interested in getting any younger and younger patients. Obviously, you also know there's a little bit of headwind around gene dilution at what age, can you actually start toning on valrox and count on reliable, durability. So we're still doing some pre-clinical work that we want to finish up, have follow-up conversations after approval with health authorities and then delineate more concretely our plan for children.Your next question comes from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hi, thank you for squeezing me in. First off, congrats to the whole team on the FDA acceptance of the valrox BLA and this hopefully landmark approval. Maybe in relation to that, the SG&A guide came in a little bit above our thinking. I'm guessing that's probably due to the team's plans for the valrox launch, but maybe for J. J. or Brian or Jeff, maybe you could talk about some of the additions that are behind that annual year-over-year growth?And then specific for Jeff, can you maybe talk about the commercial network that you're building out for valrox? And give us a sense of how many MSLs and sales reps are going to be behind this hematology sales force? Thanks so much. -- So Brian is going to start on the financials, and then Jeff will comment on the commercial preparation. -- Yes. Thanks, J. J. This is Brian. So regarding the SG&A guidance, again, $780 million to $830 million for full year 2020. We are keeping SG&A flat as a percentage of sales, consistent with 2019, which we thought was a good outcome given we are funding -- or starting to fund the three potential launches. Still launching Palynziq in Europe, preparing for a robust valrox launch globally and then early market preparations for vosoritide as well. Although it is growing year-over-year, a lot going on. And of course, we're not realizing all the sales on those products yet. So over-time, we'll expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to decrease, and our margins will improve. But it's just hard in these launch years. -- Commercial? -- Yeah. So with that as a backdrop, the commercial preparation for launch-readiness for valrox are well under way. We've been building out the framework of the commercial team starting over the last couple of years in both the United States and Europe, including with some really great work that has been done early on. And we'll continue through launch from our medical affairs organization inside of Hank's R&D organization.In terms of the build-out of the team, we're in 90-plus percent put together right now for the US launch. The European launch, we're handling a little bit different because of the sequencing of markets and the necessity to go through formal price and reimbursement processes in Europe, which can take plus or minus a year. So the layering of the country teams in Europe, we're starting out right now with brand marketing teams and market access teams in Europe as well as MSLs and medical affairs. We have sales managers in place in the major European markets. We'll delve out the actual sales teams a little bit slower as we get closer to reimbursement approvals there. And you'll understand, Kennen, that as we are operating in a highly competitive environment here. I probably wouldn't want to comment specifically on the size of our teams except to note that in the hemophilia world, based largely on the concentration of care in the United States and Europe in hemophilia treatment centers. We don't need a huge commercial team and that is not what we've constructed. It is certainly adequately sized to address the market and where patients are treated in both the United States and as we go forward in Europe. -- I mean, it's going to be a dedicated sales force, different from our -- unless someone started to use sales force to use sales force and 90%-plus of them have significant experience in the hemophilia market selling products that are currently on the market.Your next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your line is open. -- Hey, thanks for taking the question guys. This is Nate on for Paul. Maybe just one on the valrox filing. Is the FDA going to see the entire data set of patients who have received valrox or will it just be that interim cohort? -- We talked about a data cut off with them. That's actually the same data call off as the data that you've seen. So it will include safety data on a few more patients that have been dosed at the interim analysis dose cohort. But for the most part, the applications benefit risk will be based on the 22 patients that are part of the interim analysis with full efficacy data for 26 weeks, the protocol-based interim efficacy analysis with full day out in 26 weeks. And the three-year data that was updated from the Phase I/II study, and just a little bit of safety data from a few extra patients that were dosed as part of the full 301 study. -- Got it. That's helpful. And then one more. I think I might have missed this in Cory's question, but can you talk about how you might incorporate this zero to five-year-old data for the vosoritide filing? I think you had mentioned that the conversation with the regulators might focus on the scope of the application. So I was just wondering if you're planning on explicitly including those data? -- Yeah. Well, obviously, we have the pre-NDA submission meeting of the MAA pre-submission meetings for the rector and the co-rector to get really a little bit more concrete about this. But our thinking is that and in fact, our thinking was heavily informed by the FDA's advisory committee during the open public session, basically, the advisory committee said because of safety considerations in children under five years of age, it will be more fast out to get the drug through registration-enabling work in children over five years of age before you have data under five years of age. And therefore, FDA, you shouldn't hold up the application waiting for data on children under five years of age. But you should also expect sponsors to have some measure of safety data on children under five years of age before you take in the application, and that's exactly where we are. We have an ongoing study, it's enrolling. We have safety data on a number of children who are under five years of age. We don't intend to hold up the application waiting for that trial. That will be another probably two years before those data are available for an application. And the feedback from the community is get this to us sooner than later. We don't want to wait for the zero to five-year-old data. Safety data is good enough at this point.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached our time limit for today. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our Chairman and CEO, J. J. Biename. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. So in conclusion, we have developed a clear and achievable strategy that positions powering for the long-term success. We have two potential blockbuster products on valrox and vosoritide. And our continued expansion of our PKU franchise with global positive penetration and PKU gene therapy on the horizon along with gene therapy for HAE, vosoritide for dominantly inherited short stature, above cash reserves, wholly owned manufacturing facilities around the world, global commercial footprint. We believe that all of this positions well for dramatic and sustainable growth and profitability. And the critical growth drivers for long terms are in place that we believe will deliver significant results for our stakeholders.So in conclusion, we are pleased with our achievements in 2019, and we are full of anticipation for what lies ahead this year and beyond. So thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to seeing you or talking to you soon.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A recent update on BioMarin's manufacturing plans indicates that the company plans to leave no room for its competitors to grow.\u00a0IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESValoctocogene roxaparvovec (Valrox), BioMarin's novel gene therapy for hemophilia, will enjoy a first-mover advantage when it reaches the market. Hemophilia is a rare, genetic bleeding disorder that affects a small population of patients around the world. There are two forms of the disease, A (which is more common) and B; approximately 20,000 individuals are affected in the United States and 400,000 worldwide. Both forms of hemophilia result in a missing or deficient protein required for blood clotting.Market researchers at iHealthcareAnalyst project the hemophilia market to be valued at $16.5 billion by 2027, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% from today, thanks to the arrival of some novel treatments. Because it affects more people, hemophilia A accounts for the largest share of revenue in the market, and current treatments have not changed significantly in recent years.The potential for a novel drug can reshape the landscape, especially if it offers significant new benefits. iHealthcareAnalyst noted a strong desire for hemophilia\u00a0therapies that can be taken less often. Currently, patients on prophylaxis are advised to receive three treatments per week, which becomes a financial burden on patients and other payers.\u00a0BioMarin's gene therapy can change the game by offering long-lasting effects after one use. Current, traditional hemophilia A (hem A) treatments such as Roche's Hemlibra and blood clotting factor replacement therapy require multiple doses to reduce bleeding episodes.\u00a0In a manufacturing update, BioMarin noted that its facility, which formerly produced about 4,000 treatments a year, has undergone improvements that now make it able to produce 10,000. That gives it the potential to treat roughly the entire existing U.S. population of hem A patients within two years. This would thwart competitors with novel drugs slated to arrive after 2021, leaving them with limited growth opportunities.\u00a0Valrox is unique thanks to two designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA); it is both a \"breakthrough\" therapy and an \"orphan\" drug, allowing for an expedited approval process and a longer patent protection (and thus continued revenue) stream. The EMA also validated the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for the drug, meaning it will undergo accelerated assessment and reach the market more quickly.\u00a0On Feb. 20, Valrox was accepted for priority review by the FDA. If approved, it would become the first gene therapy to treat any form of hemophilia. The FDA also gave premarket approval (PMA) to a diagnostic test that complements the treatment. BioMarin's gene therapy shows lots of promise, so what competitive advantages does it have over rivals such as Roche and Sangamo Therapeutics?\u00a0The gene therapy market is highly competitive, and the FDA's priority review will allow Valrox to be the first medication of its type to reach the market. This offers a first-mover advantage over Roche and Sangamo, especially because if it's approved, Valrox could treat a broader hemophilia market -- including both hem A and hem B.\u00a0Enrollment for the Valrox clinical trial was much larger than for competitors' trials, which may imply that this therapy could prove superior. Roche's gene therapy studies are moving more slowly; this is also true at Sangamo, which recently reported positive results from the first two patients in its phase 1/2 clinical trial.\u00a0BioMarin CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime noted in an interview at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference earlier this year that healthcare payers in the United States would be comfortable paying between $2 million and $3 million for each treatment. He also noted that the average cost for each current hem A treatment is roughly $700,000, which after four years adds up to $2.8 million. Therefore, Valrox could provide benefits to both patients, by reducing the amount of therapy needed, and healthcare payers.BioMarin's novel drug therapy to treat any form of hemophilia,\u00a0and its capacity for long-lasting effects with one administration, shows how\u00a0economical and valuable this therapy can be across the healthcare system.\u00a0It's poised to take market share after its approval and could be a game-changer for the company and its investors.BioMarin looks strong against larger and smaller players alike, thanks to its first-mover advantages and plans for an expansive production facility that should help it take over the hemophilia market. Management has some optimistic forecasts for 2020 revenue -- they're hoping to hit\u00a0$2 billion with the launch of Volrax, with a revenue target of $8 billion to $10 billion over 10 years.\u00a0As Volrax continues to gain traction, investors  will want to pay attention.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: BMRN) saw new options begin trading this week, for the October 16th expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the BMRN options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $90.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $80.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of BMRN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $91.08/share today.\n\nBecause the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of BMRN stock at the current price level of $91.08/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $95.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 14.30% if the stock gets called away at the October 16th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BMRN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing BMRN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $95.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.99% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.65% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 40%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $91.08) to be 29%.

The stock soared 46% last year and is up more than 60% so far in 2020.But Invitae's sizzle fizzled at least somewhat after the medical genetics company announced its fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter and full-year results following the market close on Wednesday. Here are the highlights from Invitae's Q4 update.Image source: Getty Images.Invitae's revenue jumped 46% year over year in the fourth quarter to $66.3 million. That's the good news. The bad news is that this result fell short of the average analyst Q4 revenue estimate of $68.14 million.The company reported a net loss of $76.9 million, or $0.79 per share, based on\u00a0generally accepted accounting principles (). This trended in the wrong direction from the net loss of $29.8 million, or $0.40 per share, posted in the prior-year period.Invitae announced an adjusted net loss in Q4 of $61.3 million, or $0.63 per share. While this loss was much wider than the adjusted net loss of $31.4 million, or $0.42 per share, recorded in the same quarter of 2018, it was a little better than the consensus Wall Street estimate of a Q4 net loss of $0.65 per share.CEO Sean George attributed his company's strong revenue growth to several factors. He noted that Invitae expanded its customer base and saw strong reorder rates among new accounts. George also said that the company \"made it easier to access our testing, both through traditional payers and via unique partnership programs.\"George had predicted over 500,000\u00a0accessioned samples for full-year 2019 in his comments  in November. But Invitae reported only 482,000 accessioned samples for the year, with the Q4 total sample count of 148,000 coming in lower than expected.Accessioned samples are the key metric the company uses. The term refers to DNA samples that have been accepted into Invitae's labs and tracked in its system (as opposed to a sample that is collected at a physician's office but not sent to the lab).\u00a0Other key developments in the fourth quarter included Invitae's announcement in November that it plans to acquire\u00a0Clear Genetics, a leading developer of software for providing genetic services. The company also announced an initiative with \u00a0to provide genetic testing at no cost to patients with signs or symptoms of skeletal dysplasias, a group of rare bone and joint disorders.\u00a0\u00a0Invitae expects that more than 725,000 samples will be accessioned in full-year 2020. The company projects revenue of over $330 million for the year, up more than 50% from 2019.Sean George said: \"We enter 2020 with momentum and a unique business model that we believe is well positioned to deliver genetics-informed healthcare to patients. As we continue to scale our business, we are confident our approach and the investments we are making will further strengthen our ability to bring affordable, accessible genetic information to billions of people worldwide.\"But Invitae is a  with a market cap that can't be justified on its current revenue.

Nonetheless, it's important for investors to remember that \"simpler\" treatment options won't become obsolete just because gene therapy, gene editing, and immunotherapy approaches are becoming feasible.Investors are hoping that the 'simple is better' approach proves true for  .\u00a0The company's first drug candidate, the enzyme-based CDX-6114, is being developed to treat a rare disease called phenylketonuria (PKU). Can the simpler approach of Codexis compete with a growing list of gene therapies that are also targeting the disease?Image source: Getty Images.Codexis isn't a biopharmaceutical company. It has developed a platform for engineering enzymes, which are complex molecules that power virtually all biological processes in living cells. Enzymes can also be added to industrial processes, health diagnostics, and consumer products to reduce energy consumption, lower input requirements, improve functionality, and eliminate toxic wastes.\u00a0Today, the company generates most of its revenue from three sources: selling enzymes that improve drug manufacturing processes, selling enzymes that improve the manufacturing process for a zero-calorie sweetener ingredient from Tate & Lyle, and selling licenses to its enzyme engineering software platform. But Codexis is also eyeing a large opportunity in developing novel therapeutics.\u00a0In late 2017, Codexis and Nestle Health Science, owned by , entered into an agreement to develop rare-disease drug candidates. The goal is to engineer enzymes that can be administered orally, rather than injected or given intravenously, which would provide a significant advantage in cost and convenience relative to treatments for many rare diseases.Designing medicines that can be taken orally may not sound very novel, but enzyme-based treatments are typically degraded as they journey through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. That requires enzymatic medicines to be administered subcutaneously, which can trigger severe allergic reactions and doesn't efficiently deliver them to the liver, where they're most effective. Therefore, Codexis must engineer enzymes that are stable enough to make it through the GI tract so they can be transported into the liver -- a capability uniquely accessible to Codexis.The first asset to advance into clinical trials was the experimental PKU treatment called CDX-6114. Individuals born with PKU have a nonfunctioning copy of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) that metabolizes the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe). When Phe accumulates to dangerous levels, it can cause significant intellectual disabilities in newborns and mental impairments in adults. Individuals must follow a strict (and expensive) diet that limits daily protein intake to just five grams and avoids the artificial sweetener aspartame, which breaks down into Phe. CDX-6114 was designed to help individuals metabolize Phe and live a normal lifestyle.In early 2019, Nestle Health Science, which sells many nutritional products for PKU patients, exercised an option granting it exclusive rights to develop and commercialize CDX-6114. Codexis is eligible to receive up to $85 million in remaining development and approval milestones, up to $250 million in revenue milestones, and royalties on sales.\u00a0For comparison, Codexis generated $44 million in the first nine months of 2019. While the industrial business is growing, achieving success with the therapeutic pipeline could provide a significant boost. Will gene therapies stand in the way?\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.The hypothesis supporting the collaboration between Codexis and Nestle Health Science is pretty simple to understand: Many rare diseases are caused when individuals fail to make a specific functioning enzyme, so treatments that provide a working copy could prove valuable. Of course, that's the exact hypothesis supporting the industry's pursuit of genetic medicines.\u00a0Whereas Codexis wants to provide an enzyme substitute through an orally available drug, a gene therapy aims to provide direct replacement of an enzyme by potentially fixing the genetic error at the root of a disease.It might be tempting to think that gene therapy is the ideal solution for PKU, but not every gene therapy will succeed in providing a cure. If a gene therapy only partially succeeds in replacing adequate levels of the gene responsible for producing the PAH enzyme, then individuals might still be dependent on strict diets and imperfect treatment options. Simply put, barring the successful development of a curative gene therapy, the enzyme-based approach of Codexis and Nestle Health Science could be a competitive option.\u00a0It's not much of a competition at the moment, as there's not much to compare. CDX-6114 is being studied in a phase 1b study, while early-stage results for gene therapies have been unimpressive or non-existent.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CompanyPKU Drug CandidateResultsCodexis\u00a0and Nestle Health ScienceCDX-6114 (enzymatic)Phase 1a trial: well tolerated at all four dose levels in 32 healthy volunteers, but not tested in PKU patients HMI-102 (gene therapy)Phase 1/2 trial (ongoing): two individuals with PKU receiving low-dose showed no reduction in Phe at three months, one individual receiving high-dose achieved a reduction in Phe BMN 307 (gene therapy)Expects to initiate phase 1/2 trial in the United Kingdom in early 2020\u00a0Data sources: Codexis, Homology Medicines, and BioMarin.Despite the early-stage nature of the industry's pipeline, the opportunity is large and the bar is relatively low.\u00a0Individuals with PKU currently have two main drug options: Kuvan and Palynziq. The two drugs, both sold by BioMarin, generated combined revenue of $396 million in the first nine months of 2019. But they're only partial solutions.\u00a0Kuvan is a coenzyme that can help to break down Phe, but it only works for individuals with milder PKU and comes with a relatively long list of side effects. It still generated $341 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2019.\u00a0Palynziq is a newer therapy. It's a substitute to working PAH enzymes required to metabolize Phe, but the drug can take up to 12 months to begin working and triggers significant side effects in most people. It comes with a black-box warning for severe allergic reactions (observed in 9% of individuals in clinical trials), requires daily injections, and costs $192,000 per year. While doctors have been generally impressed with results for patients that stick with treatment, there's much room for improvement.\u00a0\u00a0Codexis is hoping that CDX-6114 can provide a convenient and safe enzyme-based treatment option for individuals with PKU. If the asset demonstrates promising clinical results in an ongoing phase 1b trial, then it could begin to factor into the 's price and the company's market valuation. After all, analysts expect Palynziq to generate over $1 billion in peak annual sales despite the drug's inconveniences and safety issues, and Codexis is valued at just $1 billion today.However, investors do need to keep track of genetic medicines in development at Homology Medicines, BioMarin, and any other companies that throw their hats into the ring (RNA interference seems uniquely suited for a PKU treatment, but no such drugs are in development yet). If genetic medicines demonstrate a consistent safety profile and provide a cure for most individuals with PKU in early clinical trials, then CDX-6114 might have its market potential severely reduced before it even leaves the clinic. If genetic medicines only provide partial solutions, then the details and nuance might determine which approach, if any, will dominate the market.The next batch of results from each company is likely to be available before the end of 2020, which means investors will learn quite a bit about the shape of the competitive landscape soon.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The priority review will shave four months off of the review time for the marketing application, compared to a standard review. The agency expects to make a decision by Aug. 21, 2020.If approved, valrox would be the first gene therapy approved to treat hemophilia A. Currently, patients are treated with a protein called Factor VIII, which has to be infused two to three times per week and still doesn't prevent patients from all bleeding events. Valrox restores expression of Factor VIII in a patient's cells, eliminating the need for the replacement therapy.Image source: Getty Images.The marketing application is based on results from a phase 3 clinical trial that showed 7 out of 16 patients reached or exceeded the level of Factor VIII that regulators in the U.S. and Europe wanted to see. After the data cutoff date, an additional patient also met the goal.The study is continuing to enroll patients, so the\u00a0 can hopefully show that valrox is superior to Factor VIII replacement therapy. Early data suggests it should meet the goal, with the 16 patients having an average annual bleed rate (ABR) of 1.5, which was 85% lower than the ABR before the study when the patients were on replacement therapy.BioMarin and its partner ARUP Laboratories are also trying to gain approval of a companion diagnostic test for the gene therapy that will test patients for the presence of antibodies to AAV5, a virus used to deliver the gene therapy. BioMarin estimates that 20% of patients with hemophilia A in the U.S. have preexisting immunity to AAV5 that would make them ineligible for valrox.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the prior decade, for instance, the   nearly doubled the performance of the . What's more, biotech equities may perform even better over the coming decade, thanks to the steady progress in key fields such as gene editing, gene therapy, and precision medicine. The biopharmaceutical industry, in fact, could make major strides over the next 10 years toward treating a range of diseases that currently have no standard of care.\u00a0Which biotech companies are set to lead the way in 2020?  ,\u00a0 , and   are three top biotech stocks that might be worth owning this year. Here's a brief overview for each company.\u00a0Image Source: Getty Images.BioMarin has been in Wall Street's doghouse for a . This year, however, promises to be the start of the company's official return to biotech stardom. BioMarin's turnaround story centers around two high-value clinical assets: the\u00a0hemophilia treatment\u00a0 and the dwarfism therapy known as vosoritide.Based on the company's latest update at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference last week, BioMarin's internal forecast calls for Valrox's commercial launch to get underway by no later than the fourth quarter of this year, and for vosoritide to make its commercial debut sometime in 2021. Both drugs still need to get a green light from regulators. But the chances are that each therapy will indeed pass muster during a formal review cycle.What's the big deal? Valrox and vosoritide together have the potential to more than double the biotech's annual sales as soon as 2024. Valrox alone is forecast to generate peak sales in excess of $1.4 billion, and vosoritide should achieve blockbuster status as well, due to the simple fact that it would be the only approved treatment on the market for this particular form of dwarfism.So, even though BioMarin's shares aren't exactly cheap at an estimated forward-looking price-to-sales ratio of 7.94, this rare-disease stock should still post some hefty gains in 2020. Most rare-disease plays, after all, sport far richer valuations than BioMarin -- implying that this mid-cap  is, in fact, undervalued relative to both its immediate peer group and near-term growth prospects.\u00a0CRISPR Therapeutics is a potential gene-editing behemoth. Toward the back end of 2019, CRISPR and partner  unveiled the first proof-of-concept data for their CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy dubbed CTX001. Although the dynamic duo only released data for one beta thalassemia and one sickle-cell disease patient, the \u00a0for these rare blood disorders were so impressive that CRISPR's shares exploded higher in the wake of this news. The company stands to be the preeminent player in a rapidly emerging field that could one day revolutionize medicine.On the commercial side of the ledger, CRISPR's lead product candidate, CTX001, would easily achieve blockbuster status as bona fide \"one and done treatment\" for both beta thalassemia and sickle-cell disease. Nonetheless, the company is also on the verge of trials for additional CRISPR/Cas9 therapies for various cancers, diabetes, and a range of inherited diseases. Conservatively speaking, CRISPR Therapeutics is presently targeting disease markets expected to be worth upward of $80 billion by 2025. That's an enormous commercial opportunity for a company with a market cap of a mere $3.27 billion right now.\u00a0 \u00a0What's the risk? Like all cutting-edge platforms in early stage development, CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing may turn out to have some troubling safety and/or efficacy issues. Biopharma, after all, is littered with once-promising therapies that ultimately flopped in mid- to late-stage trials. Thus, investors probably shouldn't go hog wild with this promising biotech play right now, despite the company's potential to be a once-in-a-lifetime investing opportunity. That being said, CRISPR's risk-to-reward ratio is arguably compelling enough to warrant a small to medium position among investors comfortable with risk.\u00a0Novavax had an awful 2019. The company's highly anticipated respiratory infection vaccine, ResVax, failed for a second time in late-stage testing, causing investors to run for the exits. As a direct result, Novavax was subsequently forced to execute a reverse split simply to meet the Nasdaq minimum bid requirement of $1 per share. In all, the company's shares lost a staggering amount of their value .\u00a0But Novavax may finally be on the comeback trail. The company recently won fast-track status for its experimental flu vaccine, NanoFlu, from the Food and Drug Administration. Even more importantly, Novavax also said that it expects to announce top-line results for NanoFlu's ongoing late-stage trial before the end of the first quarter. If positive, the data would pave the way for the biotech's first-ever regulatory filing.What's the big picture? Novavax is staring down a $4 billion global opportunity with NanoFlu. That's not to say that the company would gobble up the lion's share of this highly competitive marketplace, but even a small slice would be a huge win for shareholders. Novavax, after all, currently has a market cap of approximately $184 million. So it wouldn't take much for NanoFlu to be a major value driver for the company.In fact, it wouldn't be surprising in the least if the biotech's shares doubled in value on positive trial results for NanoFlu. On the flip side of the coin, Novavax is an inherently risky developmental biotech play. If NanoFlu fails to hit the mark in this pivotal trial, the company's shares are sure to take a sizable leg downward yet again.

Although  CEO said that payers in the U.S. seem to be comfortable around the $2 million to $3 million price point based on other similar drugs, the company will also be open to alternative payment structures as well.Hemophilia, a condition where a patient's blood fails to clot and can't stop bleeding, is one of the more expensive conditions to treat. Current medications to treat the disease cost on average $270,000 annually per patient.

While falling share prices could be a sign that a company is under duress, it doesn\u2019t always mean that its growth story has come to an end. After all, a tried and true strategy to turn a profit in the market is to buy low and sell high.Wall Street pros remind investors to take this into consideration when gauging the strength of investments in the healthcare space. As these names rely on only a few key catalysts, all it takes is a single piece of bad news to send shares spiraling downwards. However, the opposite is also true, so one favorable outcome can put a stock right back on track.With this in mind, we used TipRanks\u2019  to pinpoint 3 Buy-rated healthcare names that the analysts believe are on the mend after recent nose dives. Here\u2019s the scoop straight from the analysts.BioMarin has established itself as a key player in the biopharma space, with seven therapies already on the market and several other candidates in development. Despite falling 21% in the first nine months of 2019, SunTrust Robinson analyst  believes that important upcoming catalysts could drive a rebound.The four-star analyst points out that the drop came largely as a result of declining investor confidence in the market potential of its Hemophilia therapy. ValRox, its Hemophilia A candidate progressing through Phase 2, has seen factor levels drop since the first year. However, Karnauskas remains convinced that BMRN can deliver.After conducting a survey to determine if the concerns related to commercialization were valid, the analyst concluded that ValRox could drive significant growth. \u201cOur survey indicates high level of confidence in approval of ValRox, with 100% of doctors expecting approval and steady uptake in severe Hemophilia A patients\u2026 Our survey also indicated that doctors are likely to prescribe based on label and do not expect all severe patients to qualify,\u201d she commented.As a result, the analyst believes, \u201cAt current values, the stock is trading with little credit to late stage pipeline assets with potential launches in late 2020/2021.\u201d At the peak, Karnauskas estimates the Hemophilia A opportunity to be $1.48 billion.On top of this, its vosoritide therapy for achondroplasia could be a major component of the company\u2019s next leg of growth, with it reporting positive Phase 3 data in December.Based on all of the above, Karnauskas tells investors that she\u2019s siding with the bulls, reiterating a Buy rating on BMRN alongside a $110 price target. Should the target be met, shares will be in for a 24% twelve-month gain. (To watch Karnauskas\u2019 track record, )Turning now to the rest of the Street, it appears that other analysts are generally on the same page. With 13 Buys and 3 Holds assigned in the last three months, the consensus rating comes in as a Strong Buy. In addition, the $111.71 average price target puts the upside potential just above Karnauskas\u2019 forecast at 25%. ()Fighting rare diseases like generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and ALS, Alexion Pharmaceuticals wants to meet the large unmet medical needs of patients globally. Even though the company took a beating in 2019, the Street isn\u2019t giving up on ALXN just yet.While recent data for its candidate to treat PNH, a severe and ultra-rare blood disorder, raised some questions, Wedbush analyst  believes its growth prospects are still strong. According to its most recent 8-K filing, total revenue growth is expected to beat the consensus estimate, and Ultomiris is poised to meet its conversion goals. As a result, Chico commented, \u201cwe continue to see ALXN as holding a strong competitive position in the complement markets.\u201dIt also doesn\u2019t hurt that its neurology franchise is continuing to grow at a steady rate. Over the previous quarter, neurology patients on treatment (gMG/NMOSD) increased 23% to 1,885 patients. Despite the fact that growth slowed by about 5% compared to September/June, management told investors that they are hoping to quadruple their US neurology patient volume by FY25.All of this prompted Chico to conclude, \u201cOverall, we see multiple encouraging updates from ALXN in their upcoming presentation not only on the commercial front, but with several pipeline updates as well. We continue to hold a positive bias on ALXN shares.\u201dTo this end, Chico decided to leave the Outperform rating and $149 price target unchanged. At this target, a 32% gain could be in the cards for ALXN over the next twelve months. (To watch Chico\u2019s track record, )Like Chico, a majority of the analysts covering ALXN take a bullish approach. With 12 Buys and 3 Holds, the word on the Street is that ALXN is a Strong Buy. The healthcare stock boasts 29% upside potential based on the $145 average price target. ()Mylan, one of the largest generic drug makers, has had a rough going, to say the least. Back in May, shares shed 24% of their value in a single day after the company failed to provide an update on the strategic review that had already lasted ten months. More recently, the stock has been range-bound thanks to investor concern regarding a possible cut to Viatris, the combination of Mylan and Pfizer\u2019s Upjohn, as well as its proforma numbers. That being said, some members of the Street still have high hopes for MYL.RBC Capital\u2019s  thinks that several key factors suggest that MYL has more fuel left in the tank. \u201cWe believe buyside expectations are already low with Street proforma models stale while synergies provide support into 2022 stabilization; even on our lowered EBITDA, Newco trades at only 6.6x 2021E EBITDA (<7x even if further cutting EBITDA to $7 billion) while able to support a new dividend yielding about 4%,\u201d he explained.Additionally, the analyst highlights improving corporate governance as well as argues that Viatris\u2019 U.S. generic revenue and limited opioid exposure could help the company \u201cde-couple from generic peers.\u201d He added, \u201cThe announced combination of MYL and PFE\u2019s Upjohn off-patent business will further grow and diversify MYL\u2019s revenue base beyond US generics.\u201dGiven that it still boasts \u201cone of the best generic/ biosimilar pipelines in the industry\u201d, Stanicky\u2019s bullish thesis remains firmly intact. With this in mind, the analyst maintained an Outperform call. Not to mention, he bumped up the price target from $25 to $27. The price target conveys the analyst\u2019s confidence in MYL\u2019s ability to surge 27% in the next twelve months. (To watch Stanicky\u2019s track record, )Looking at the consensus breakdown, we have an almost even split. 4 Buys and 5 Holds received in the last three months add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. With a $24.50 average price target, the upside potential is 16%.

The \u00a0has outperformed the S&P 500 in eight of the past 10 years, so the industry has been a great source of market-beating ideas.Biotech investing isn't easy, though.

Nevertheless, the potential rewards associated with investing in the industry could make owning stocks with upcoming catalysts a great idea. For example,\u00a0 ,  , and  \u00a0have events coming up that could make buying shares this year smart.BioMarin could be about to  how doctors treat hemophilia with a mega-blockbuster indication worth $10 billion in revenue annually.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Currently, hemophilia treatment involves regular infusions of missing proteins necessary for clotting blood to prevent or stop bleeding. These infusions cost payers hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, and despite widespread use, patients are still at risk of life-threatening bleeds, joint and organ damage, and a shortened life expectancy.If BioMarin has its way, European Union (EU) and U.S. regulators will soon approve its gene therapy for hemophilia A, a treatment that could do away with infusions and significantly reduce the risk of uncontrolled bleeding by inserting a gene that produces the missing protein (Factor VIII) in a patient's liver.\u00a0The EU is expected to begin its review of BioMarin's gene therapy this month, while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should begin reviewing the therapy as soon as February. In both cases, a successful review could lead to approvals that allow BioMarin to begin selling the therapy before the end of 2020.Although regulators could balk at approval, clinical-trial results for the therapy were solid. BioMarin recently released long-term follow-up data from its phase 1/2 trial showing average annualized bleeding rates and the need for factor VIII infusions fell 96% from baseline in the third year following administration of the therapy in the highest dose cohort. Given the significant costs associated with factor VIII infusions and the fact that BioMarin's therapy could be the first of its kind to win a regulatory OK, BioMarin could be on the cusp of launching a blockbuster.There's a big need for new, late-line treatment options in patients with melanoma. Currently, just 4% to 10% of patients whose disease has progressed following administration of a PD-1, BRAF, and MEK-targeting treatment respond to re-treatment.In 2020, Iovance expects to report data from pivotal studies of lifileucel, an autologous adoptive cell-transfer therapy utilizing a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte manufacturing process, which may improve response rates.A unique approach, TIL manufacturing involves identifying immune cells that have successfully infiltrated a tumor, multiplying those cells into an army of billions in a lab, and infusing them back into the patient. This process takes about 23 days, but the wait could be worth it.\u00a0In phase 2, 35% of metastatic melanoma patients had at least some response to lifileucel, despite the average person having failed on a median 3.3 prior treatments, including PD-1 inhibitors -- a common immunotherapy.Similarly, data from one cohort in an ongoing phase 2 study evaluating a second TIL, LN-145, in cervical cancer showed a  rate, including an 11% complete response rate in heavily pretreated patients. If final data from that study is positive, then Iovance expects to file for approval in that indication this year, too.\u00a0IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Last year, investors may have been questioning a decision by\u00a0activist investors in 2017 to scuttle a plan for\u00a0  to license Immunomedics' lead drug, sacituzumab govitecan, for $2 billion in upfront money and potential milestones, plus double-digit royalties on future sales.\u00a0Instead of granting a review and potentially approving\u00a0sacituzumab govitecan, the FDA issued Immunomedics a complete response letter (CRL) for its use in third-line or higher metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) last January, dashing hopes for a regulatory green light in 2019.Fortunately, the CRL may prove to have been a temporary hiccup. Since the FDA's concerns weren't related to clinical trials but instead to \"chemistry, manufacturing, and control\" issues, Immunomedics was able to address the FDA's concerns and  for approval last month.In clinical trials, the overall response rate to sacituzumab govitecan was 33% in the third-line setting. Progression-free survival observed in the study was 5.5 months.\u00a0In both cases, the results were better than the mid-teens rates historically observed for chemotherapy regimens in the second-line setting.The potential to reshape late-line TNBC treatment shouldn't be ignored. About 8,000 people in the U.S. alone pass away annually from TNBC, an aggressive, tough-to-treat disease accounting for roughly 20% of all breast cancers.Sacituzumab govitecan's potential isn't limited to late-line TNBC, though. Management expects data from its late-line use in metastatic urothelial cancer soon. If results are positive in that indication, it plans to file for FDA approval, as well.The company's studying sacituzumab govitecan in combination with immunotherapies as a potential early line alternative, too. The flurry of activity suggests this could be a multi-indication drug with blockbuster potential, so an approval this year\u00a0could make it one of biotech's big winners in 2020.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: BMRN) saw new options become available this week, for the March 20th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the BMRN options chain for the new March 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.95.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $82.05 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of BMRN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $88.38/share today.\n\nBecause the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 66%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.47% return on the cash commitment, or 21.86% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., and highlighting in green where the $85.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.10.  If an investor was to purchase shares of BMRN stock at the current price level of $88.38/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $90.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.47% if the stock gets called away at the March 20th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BMRN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing BMRN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $90.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) acquiring Celgene for $74 billion in January remains the most expensive acquisition of this year.In the wake of generic drugs eating into the sales of off-patent branded drugs,  growing pressure from regulators to reduce the prices of drugs, drying pipelines, and ever-increasing R&D costs, there has been an increasing consolidation within the drug industry. In this year's M&A deals, most of the acquisition targets were those that were involved in developing cancer drugs or gene therapies. Let's take a look at some of the biotech companies that have been in the acquisition crosshairs for quite some time.1. Amarin Corporation plc (AMRN)In January of this year, rumors began to circulate that Pfizer (PFE) might be interested in acquiring Amarin. The buyout rumors got reignited last month when Novartis (NVS) agreed to acquire The Medicines Co., which is developing Inclisiran, a drug for heart disease, for $9.7 billion.Like the Medicines Co., Amarin also has a heart drug by the name Vascepa in its kitty. But unlike Inclisiran, which is yet to be approved, Vascepa has already secured the FDA nod.Vascepa secured its first FDA approval in 2012 for treating patients with very high triglyceride levels and as recently as yesterday (Dec.14) was approved for wider use, i.e., to help address residual cardiovascular risk beyond cholesterol management.Sales of Vascepa have been growing, and in October of this year, an independent drug price watchdog group, Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), released a report that shows Vascepa as cost-effective for CV risk reduction.AMRN closed Friday's trading at $24.12, up 4.92%.2. Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ALXN)Alexion Pharma is no stranger to takeover rumors. This developer of rare disease drug Soliris has been in acquisition crosshairs since 2016 - with Roche, Pfizer, Novartis and Amgen been reported as potential buyers.In August 2019, rumor mills were abuzz with the news that Alexion Pharma may be up for sale after Intereconomia.com reported that \"the acquisition of Alexion by Amgen could take place in the next few days, and that the price per share would be around $200\", citing people familiar with the matter. But that deadline has long passed.Meanwhile, earlier this month, U.K.-based Elliott Advisors, one of the largest stakeholders in Alexion, urged the company to take a proactive approach and put itself up for sale to maximize the chance of an optimal outcome. However, the Company has turned down Elliott's recommendation.ALXN is down 22% from its all-time high of $141.86, recorded on April 10, 2019, and trades around $110.3. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN)BioMarin is almost every analyst's favorite takeover candidate. This biotechnology company, which operates in hemophilia and ultra-orphan disease drug space, has seven approved treatments, a strong pipeline, and steadily growing revenue.In 2013, there were reports that Roche was eyeing BioMarin for a possible acquisition. Rumors again surfaced in 2016 that Roche would acquire BioMarin in a deal that could be in the range of $130 to $150 per share.The Company submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for its investigational gene therapy, Valoctocogene roxaparvovec, for adults with severe hemophilia A, as recently as last month. This submission marks the first marketing application submission for a gene therapy product for any type of hemophilia. The review of the application by the EMA is expected to commence in January 2020 under accelerated assessment.BioMarin remains on track to submit a Biologics License Application for Valoctocogene roxaparvovec to the FDA by the end of this year. BMRN briefly touched $100.13 on February 5, 2019. The stock has lost 14% of its value since February and trades around $80.4. Clovis Oncology (CLVS)Clovis Oncology is a commercial-stage biotechnology company whose lead drug is Rubraca, indicated for ovarian cancer.Takeover rumors initially swirled around Clovis Oncology in 2013 when Rubraca, was in clinical trial stage. Now, it is three years since the PARP inhibitor has been approved.Rubraca competes with other PARP inhibitors like Lynparza and  Zejula. Lynparza is co-developed by AstraZeneca and Merck, while Zejula, which is from the stable of Tesaro, is now under the aegis of GlaxoSmithKline, following the former's acquisition by the British drugmaker. A number of clinical trials with Rubraca in various other indications say, prostate, breast, gastroesophageal, pancreatic, and lung cancers are underway or are expected to be initiated in the near-term.Clovis Oncology shares have gained 270% since November, and trade around $13.5. Incyte Corporation (INCY)Incyte has an attractive pharmaceutical portfolio comprising of Jakafi, a blockbuster drug for rare blood cancer indications, and 3 other marketed drugs, and a well-stocked pipeline.In early 2017, the rumor mill was spinning with whispers of Gilead (GILD) close to acquiring Incyte. But following Gilead's decision to acquire Kite Pharma in August of that year, the rumors died down.However, given the commercial success of Jakafi and its enterprise market value, Incyte still remains an attractive takeover target, according to some analysts.Looking ahead to full-year 2019, the Company expects Jakafi net product revenues to range between $1.65 billion and $1.68 billion, reflecting 20% to 22% growth over the prior year.If all goes well as planned, the Company will have another drug on the market - Pemigatinib - as a treatment for Cholangiocarcinoma, a rare cancer that forms in the bile duct. The FDA decision on Pemigatinib is expected by May 30, 2020.INCY has gained 43% year-to-date and trades around $91.Closing ThoughtsThe above-mentioned companies are just very few of the rumored takeover targets. It remains to be seen if the takeover rumors are just wishful thinking or will turn into reality.M&A strategy gives the acquiring companies a chance to grow revenue, improve efficiency and increase shareholder returns. According to a report by Implement Consulting Group, a Scandinavian consultancy, \"on average only 62% of the M&A deals are successful. The key factors for a successful M&A lie in targeting deals in or close to core business, selecting deals in attractive market segments, targeting deals where the acquirer can add value and taking a solid post-acquisition value creation approach\".Oncology and gene therapy were the subjects of acquisitions this year. A report from industry analyst IQVIA suggests that \"significant deal activity, both in terms of volume and value, will continue to be seen in oncology, with next-generation biological therapies such as neoantigen-directed approaches likely to attract considerable big pharma interest\".

Rolling up their sleeves and getting straight down to business, they know the race is on to find the stocks ready to speed past the rest in the year ahead. To spot these investment opportunities, Wall Street pros recommend taking a step back and focusing on the bigger picture, telling investors to pay close attention to both upside potential and what the analyst community has to say.With this strategy in mind, what\u2019s the next step? For us, it was to take advantage of TipRanks\u2019 investing tools. The platform\u2019s  let us filter our search results by analyst consensus, price target upside and Smart Score (TipRanks\u2019 numerical score made up of 8 metrics to measure the strength of an investment).As a result, we were able to pinpoint 3 stocks flagged by the Street\u2019s analysts as potential winners, with each boasting a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating. Not to mention each has a top Smart Score, at least an 8 out of 10. Here\u2019s the scoop.With seven products currently on the market as well as an impressive development pipeline, BioMarin has cemented its status as a biopharma heavyweight. While 2019 saw the company falter, this could be BMRN\u2019s year according to some members of the Street.Part of the excitement surrounding the company is based on the recent positive Phase 3 study data for its vosoritide therapy in achondroplasia, a disorder characterized by dwarfism, which was announced on December 16. During the study, the drug was able to meet the primary endpoint for growth velocity after one year, with it demonstrating an increase of 1.6 cm/year compared to the placebo. On top of this, vosoritide was generally well tolerated and the results were consistent across the study.According to Cantor analyst , the news puts BMRN in a solid position going into 2020, noting, \u201cWe think this sets up for 2020-2021 to be a key inflection for BMRN with two regulatory submissions/potential product launches between vosoritide and valrox (hemophilia A gene therapy).\u201dShould the drug receive approval, Merle estimates about $700 million in peak unadjusted sales. While pointing out that the question of reimbursement has been raised, she argues that the \u201cclean data, coupled with the building body of evidence from long-term Ph2 data and younger patient studies will help support reimbursement discussions.\u201d Bearing this in mind, the analyst left the Overweight rating and $129 price target unchanged. (To watch Merle\u2019s track record, )Like Merle, Wedbush\u2019s  sees vosoritide approval as very likely. However, she attached a more aggressive price target along with her Outperform rating. Lifting the target by $1 to $158, the analyst thinks an 88% twelve-month gain could be in the cards. (To watch Moussatos\u2019 track record, )In general, the rest of the Street appears to echo the analysts\u2019 sentiment. With 13 Buys and 3 Holds assigned in the last three months, the verdict is that BMRN is a Strong Buy. Based on the $111.71 average price target, the upside potential lands at 33%, with the stock also sporting an 8 Smart Score. ()GoDaddy provides an all-in-one solution with everything customers need to design the perfect website, from domains to hosting and online marketing. On the heels of its solid Q3 performance, some analysts are placing their bets on GDDY.During the quarter, the company impressed with its $851 million in gross bookings, surpassing the $828.7 million consensus estimate. Not only did the figure beat the estimate, but growth accelerated 180 basis points from the second quarter. Adding to the good news, its customer count increased by 140,000 sequentially and 4.6% year-over-year to reach 19.1 million. While uFCF came in below the estimate, one analyst tells investors that he remains fully onboard.Piper Jaffray\u2019s  cites GDDY\u2019s \u201clong-term growth and sticky revenue, along with opportunities for up/cross-selling and M&A\u201d as putting it on the path to success. To this end, the five-star analyst decided to stay with the bulls, keeping the rating as Overweight along with a $91 price target, which leaves room for possible upside of 32%. (To watch Olson\u2019s track record, )Meanwhile,  of Jeffries cites his meeting with new CEO Aman Bhutani as the reason for his optimism. Calling the company one of his favorite mid-cap names, the analyst believes Bhutani\u2019s \u201cstrong product background should help GDDY become a more comprehensive software provider with higher ARPU.\u201d Additionally, he notes that the CEO won\u2019t sacrifice margins even as the speed of product innovations accelerates. Following the meeting, Thill reiterated the Buy recommendation and $95 price target, implying 38% upside potential. (To watch Thill\u2019s track record, )Looking at the consensus breakdown, it\u2019s clear that the broader analyst community is on the same page. Out of 8 total analysts covering the stock, 100% were bullish, making the consensus a unanimous Strong Buy. If that wasn\u2019t enough, GDDY boasts an 8 Smart Score and upside potential of 31% thanks to the $89.86 average price target. ()In an age in which cyberattacks have become a very real and prevalent threat, Mimecast wants to protect customers by offering email security and compliance solutions through its integrated cloud-based platform. Following a strong 2019 performance, one analyst believes an encore could be in store.Berenberg Bank\u2019s  is singing MIME\u2019s praises because of its \u201cconsistent execution and best-in-class product.\u201d He argues that the company has been able to produce consistent results as its customer count grew by 800 new logos and its net retention rate stayed at 110%. In addition, he sees its new strategy as a key point of strength.\u201cWe believe the new security 3.0 strategy, with its zone-based approach, will help new mid-to-large organizations adopt more products faster. Current ARPU stands at $37. If this new approach can drive increased adoption of IEP, Awareness Training, and Web Security, we estimate the TAM will double for each of these new customers,\u201d Tilton noted.MIME\u2019s progress with regards to its enterprise segment also plays into the analyst\u2019s bullish thesis. During its most recent quarter, 30 transactions were above six figures and average order value rose to 11,700, up 14% year-over-year. Tilton added, \u201cSupported by a technologically superior offering, we expect MIME to continue its penetration of the enterprise base as management reallocates resources from the lower end of the market.\u201dIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that Tilton reiterated the Buy rating and $59 price target. At this target, shares could climb 32% higher in the coming twelve months. (To watch Tilton\u2019s track record, )What does the rest of the Street have to say? As it turns out, other analysts are in agreement. 7 Buys and a single Hold add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The $56.43 average price target puts the upside potential just below Tilton\u2019s forecast at 26%. However, it should be noted that MIME earns a perfect 10 Smart Score.

The rare-disease specialist reported promising results from an ongoing phase 2 trial of an important drug candidate, held its annual research and development (R&D) day for investors, and submitted a marketing application for a gene therapy in the European Union.\u00a0Despite the monthly gains, shares of BioMarin Pharmaceutical have lost nearly 6% of their value since the beginning of 2019. It was much worse -- the  was down 24% on the same basis at the end of September -- but shares have rallied in recent months. Can it finish the year strong?Image source: Getty Images.It was a busy month for BioMarin Pharmaceutical. The company reported that children with achondroplasia, the rare disease more commonly referred to as dwarfism, achieved statistically significant gains in height versus what might be expected when treated with vosoritide. The treated individuals gained an additional 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) in height compared with untreated individuals, using a database of achondroplasia patients, in 54 months spanning a phase 2 and phase 3 trial.\u00a0That was the highlight of the R&D Day, but investors have additional developments to look forward to. The business expects to complete regulatory submissions in the United States and Europe before the end of 2019 for its gene therapy (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) targeting hemophilia A. In fact, it submitted the marketing application in the European Union on Nov. 21.BioMarin Pharmaceutical also announced that it has selected its next two pipeline candidates, including a third gene therapy drug candidate, and that it's exploring the potential to develop vosoritide in dominantly inherited short stature applications. The business told investors it can achieve breakeven or better net income in 2020 -- if the gene therapy in hemophilia A launches in the second half of next year.The rare-disease specialist is now valued at over $14 billion. While the business won't be profitable in 2019, it did achieve operating income in the third quarter of 2019. Depending on the growth trajectory of currently approved products and regulatory outcomes in the next six months or so, BioMarin Pharmaceutical could finally become a profitable biotech stock in 2020 or shortly thereafter. Achieving that milestone will greatly de-risk future development and expansion activities, especially in the ultra-expensive gene therapy space.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While extreme volatility can be hard to stomach, the wild price swings associated with small- to mid-cap biotech stocks can also create stellar buying opportunities for investors with a long-term outlook.\u00a0\u00a0The rare-disease drugmakers \u00a0 and   are two prime examples. Both of these mid caps have seen their share prices take a big hit over the last 52 weeks. But there's good reason to believe that these two beaten-down equities could be gearing up for a sharp rebound next year.Image source: Getty Images.In fact, BioMarin and Sarepta may even have what it takes to transform a relatively modest investment into a small fortune over the next ten to twenty years. Here's why bargain hunters might want to add these two top biotech stocks to their portfolio soon.\u00a0BioMarin's shares have been trending downward for nearly three long years at this point -- all thanks to a single misstep. The brief rundown is that the biotech paid a hefty sum to acquire the rights to the experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) treatment, Kydrisa, back in 2014. As the drug had actually failed its phase 3 trial, Wall Street and industry insiders alike widely viewed this pricey acquisition as a flat-out boondoggle. Unfortunately, the skeptics were proven correct in their initial assessment, with the Food and Drug Administration rejecting Kydrisa in 2016.\u00a0This ill-advised business development move has been a major overhang on BioMarin's stock price ever since. Underscoring this point, the biotech's shares have lost almost 11% of their value in 2019, despite the recent approval of its phenylketonuria treatment Palynziq in both the U.S. and EU, and an overall strong year for biotech stocks in general. In short, Wall Street clearly hasn't forgiven BioMarin's brain trust for the Kydrisa misadventure.BioMarin, though, does have an exceptionally strong shot at redemption in 2020. The nuts and bolts of the situation is that the biotech could soon sport two franchise-level rare-disease products. Specifically, BioMarin expects to file regulatory applications in the U.S. and EU for the severe hemophilia A treatment\u00a0\u00a0soon, and it's rapidly marching toward a top-line data readout for the dwarfism treatment  as well.Taken together, these high-value product candidates have the potential to transform BioMarin into one of the fastest-growing biotechs in the world over the next decade. BioMarin's stock, in turn, might become a red-hot commodity in the not-so-distant future.\u00a0Sarepta's shares have taken a big step backwards this year in response to the FDA's complete response letter for the experimental DMD therapy\u00a0Vyondys 53 issued . This unexpected turn of events not only delayed\u00a0Vyondys 53's regulatory pathway (if not halted it altogether), but it forced the company to put off a planned regulatory filing for its third DMD candidate known as casimersen as well.Pouring salt into the wound, Sarepta's management didn't provide much insight into the future of these two high-value DMD therapies during the company's  last week, either. So, the long-term fate of the biotech's first-generation of DMD therapies is arguably now in question, especially with Japan's  potentially set to enter the field in 2020 with viltolarsen.\u00a0All this bad news, however, masks a deeper truth about Sarepta's underlying value proposition. The fact of the matter is that the biotech's broader pipeline of DMD therapies -- such as the micro-dystrophin gene therapy platform -- makes it the company to beat in the DMD space. Stated simply, Sarepta will almost certainly retain its virtual monopoly over DMD in perpetuity, despite these competitive challenges.\u00a0What does Sarepta's dominance in DMD mean in terms of dollars and sense? Even with just a 50% market share, the company's DMD revenue should easily top $4 billion in the next decade, and there's a realistic chance that this peak revenue figure could exceed $5 billion.So, while investors might be disappointed that Sarepta may no longer be in line to gobble up 75% to 80% of the entire DMD market following this regulatory setback, the company's market cap arguably comes across as a misprint at a paltry $7.1 billion. After all, Sarepta is also pursuing other high-value rare-disease indications outside of DMD that could push its annual revenue haul to well over $10 billion by 2030.\u00a0Bottom line: Sarepta has the pieces in place to possibly be the next , an orphan-drug specialist whose stock has appreciated by a whopping 395% over the last decade.\u00a0\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

According to the United Nations, the fastest-growing age group across the world is adults aged 65 and older, with it predicting one out of every six people will be 65 or older by 2050. This means that the age group will make up 16% of the world\u2019s total population, 9% higher than it was in 2011, with this figure expected to be larger in North Africa and Europe.To this end, investors are looking for ways to capitalize on the growing opportunity within the healthcare space. In order to pinpoint the most compelling opportunities capable of delivering handsome returns through 2020 and beyond, we turned to the seasoned pros from investing firm Cowen & Co.Using , we were able to get the full scoop on 3 healthcare stocks that the firm\u2019s top rated analysts are picking. If it wasn\u2019t enough that each has received enough Street Support over the last three months to achieve a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating, all of the names boast impressive upside potential. We\u2019re talking more than 45% here.BioMarin is best known for developing innovative therapies to meet the needs of patients with orphan disease, a group of diseases that affects less than 200,000 people in the U.S. The group includes cystic fibrosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, Tourette's syndrome as well as several others.Even though shares have experienced some rockiness year-to-date, 5-star Cowen analyst  reminds investors that BMRN has demonstrated portfolio-wide progress. Its Naglazyme drug remains the only treatment option for the 1,000 people with MPS-VI, an inherited life-threatening disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme normally required for the breakdown of certain complex carbohydrates known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). According to the analyst\u2019s forecasts, the drug could generate revenue of $470 million in 2024, up from $346 million in 2018.The biotech isn\u2019t stopping there. During BMRN\u2019s recent investor R&D day, the company announced that data from its extended Phase 2 trial of Vosoritide, its drug designed to treat Achondroplasia, a bone growth disorder, suggested positive results in terms of efficacy. As management pointed out that the results can most likely be replicated, it\u2019s no wonder Nadeau is excited. \u201cWe are optimistic for success in the Phase 3 study and we think that should the Phase 2 profile be replicated, this would drive wide and rapid adoption,\u201d he commented.With substantial steps forward for its hemophilia A treatment and its gene therapies for PKU and HAE, Nadeau concludes that BMRN is a Buy. Not to mention the analyst\u2019s $150 price target indicates that shares could double in the next twelve months. (To watch Nadeau\u2019s track record, )In general, the rest of the Street also likes what it\u2019s seeing. 11 Buy ratings and 3 Holds assigned in the last three months amount to a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 ranking. Additionally, the $109 average price target brings the upside potential to 40%. ()SAGE wants to offer better treatment options for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as postpartum depression (PPD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). While results from its most recent quarter failed to impress, Cowen thinks that there\u2019s plenty of room for growth here.Analyst  notes that during the third quarter, its Zulresso drug, which launched in Q2 with small revenues, demonstrated lackluster sales growth. The analyst believes that as sales are likely to maintain slow growth until the second half of 2020, investors should instead focus on the upcoming SAGE-217 Phase 3 readout for MDD in the fourth quarter.The results from its Phase 2 study were resoundingly positive, as they demonstrated significant levels of efficacy. This lends itself to Baral\u2019s argument that SAGE-217 \u201cprovides significant blockbuster market potential\u201d. \u201cTopline data from the Ph3 MOUNTAIN trial evaluating SAGE-217 in MDD is expected to be a major catalyst for SAGE shares. Therefore, in our view, this could lead to about 30-40% upside for shares,\u201d the Cowen analyst explained.Baral adds, \u201cWe believe SAGE has a strong CNS pipeline with several potentially value-creating shots on goal over the next few years.\u201d Bearing this in mind, the five-star analyst reiterated the bullish call and $207 price target. This target conveys her confidence in SAGE\u2019s ability to surge about 40% over the next twelve months. (To watch Baral\u2019s track record, )Similarly, Wall Street takes a bullish approach when it comes to SAGE. With 7 Buys and 1 Hold, the consensus among analysts is that the biotech name is a \u2018Strong Buy.\u2019 Its $204 average  implies 35% upside potential from today's closing price. ()Using its unique \u201cin vivo\u201d discovery approach to characterize relevant biological processes, NGM has been able to create novel compounds to fight diseases like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is an inflammatory liver disease that can cause too much fat to accumulate in the liver.While the company posted a $10.9 million net loss in Q3, the outcome of its Phase 2a Cohort 4 study for lead candidate Aldafermin could drive a turnaround. Top-line data for the PBO-controlled biopsy to evaluate its ability to treat NASH are expected to be released in the first quarter of 2020., who also covers NGM, highlights the fact that \u201cthe compound has previously shown robust decreases in MRI-PDFF and demonstrated regression of fibrosis (the thickening and scarring of connective tissue) by 1 stage in 25% and 42% of patients treated with aldafermin 1mg and 3mg respectively at 12-weeks.\u201dIt also doesn\u2019t hurt that the company\u2019s pipeline includes candidates for oncology and ophthalmic conditions that are in earlier development, as well as its NGM313 humanized antibody in development for NASH and type 2 diabetes.All of this contributed to Baral\u2019s decision to maintain her bullish thesis. \u201cWe believe NGM Bio\u2019s precision biology pipeline has significant promise in multiple diseases with high unmet need,\u201d she noted. Along with the Buy recommendation, the $25 price target puts the potential twelve-month gain at a whopping 70%.The rest of the Street appears to mirror Baral\u2019s sentiment. With 4 Buys received in the last three months compared to no Holds or Sells, the message is clear: NGM is a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019. On top of this, shares could soar 61% in the next twelve months based on the $23.67 average price target.

Both approaches allow for precise gene editing by breaking the DNA strand and either inserting new DNA sequences or deleting sections of damaged or mutated DNA.Image source: Getty Images.CRISPR has quickly been adopted as a research tool in labs across the globe. However, translating a powerful tool in the lab into a viable medicine remains an uphill challenge. RNAi, a gene-silencing technology, took close to 16 years before \u00a0received the first approval of an RNAi therapy last year. Editas faces  in this field from \u00a0and , not to mention companies such as Sangamo, developing different technologies seeking to achieve the same outcome. So which of these two promising biotechs is the better buy today?None of Editas' programs have advanced to human trials. However, Editas plans to start enrollment in 2020 for its first clinical trial with EDIT-301, a potential treatment for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Positive efficacy and safety results of EDIT-301 were presented at the 24th\u00a0Congress of European Hematology Association in June. Sangamo proponents tout encouraging, yet early, data of SB-525, a gene therapy for hemophilia A, a genetic disease that causes increased bleeding. Initial results in April revealed that a small cohort of patients receiving the treatment achieved normal Factor VIII levels after six weeks of treatment. Factor VIII is essential for normal blood clotting.  demonstrated that patients maintained the normal Factor VIII levels.\u00a0Sangamo and\u00a0, its partner for SB-525, need to move quickly. \u00a0just announced that it filed\u00a0with European regulators for the approval of its competing gene therapy to treat severe hemophilia A, with the intent to complete a submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before the end of this year.\u00a0Image Source: Getty Images.With new technologies, partnerships provide early validation, much-needed nondilutive capital, and gives research and development programs extra resources to help skew the odds for success.Editas entered an exclusive collaboration in 2015 with  focused on three cancer immunotherapy programs. The companies sought to combine Editas' gene-editing platform with Juno's chimeric antigen receptors (CAR T) and T cell receptors (TCR). Juno was subsequently bought by , which itself \u00a0this month.\u00a0In 2017, Editas forged a partnership with to develop up to five treatments for various eye diseases. Allergan exercised an option to one of the programs and paid Editas $15 million.\u00a0An Investigational New Drug (IND) application was submitted to the FDA at the end of 2018, triggering another $25 million payment.\u00a0Pfizer saw promise in Sangamo early on and paid $70 million up front to partner on SB-525 and other products. Pfizer will take over responsibility for the phase 3 clinical trial, manufacturing, and commercialization. The deal includes up to $475 million in milestone payments with $300 million related to SB-525. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla commented on the most recent conference call that manufacturing has been transferred from Sangamo and patient enrollment is underway for the lead-in portion of the phase 3 clinical trial with SB-525. Sangamo entered a strategic alliance with Kite Pharma, now part of ,\u00a0to develop engineered cell therapies. In April 2018, Kite paid Sangamo $150 million up front with an eye-popping $3.01 billion in contingent payments for achieving specific development, regulatory, and commercial milestones.\u00a0\u00a0forged Sangamo's first major deal back in 2014. The companies embarked on a plan to develop novel therapies for beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Sanofi paid $20 million at the onset and will pay contingent milestones of up to $276.3 million. As of Sept. 30, Sangamo earned $6 million of the milestone payments.\u00a0Investors should keep a lookout for additional data announcements from both Editas and Sangamo during the American Society of Hematology annual meeting, which will be held Dec. 7 to 10. Editas announced its preclinical proof-of-concept data for EDIT-301 will be presented. Sangamo will provide an update of the ongoing SB-525 clinical trial, which laid the foundation for next year's phase 3 trial. Investing in nascent technologies requires  to understand the high-stakes game ahead of them. Any, all, or none of these pioneering gene-editing treatments may succeed in the end. Both companies attracted sizable partnership deals to help expand the number of programs in development while also providing nondilutive financing for each. In the end, I choose Sangamo as the better buy today. Its lead program is advancing into phase 3 under Pfizer's lead while Editas' pipeline is just a bit too early for my liking.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Opening the conference call today from BioMarin is Traci McCarty, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tracy. -- Thank you, Grace. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. To remind you, this non-confidential presentation contains forward-looking statements about the business prospects of BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., including expectations regarding BioMarin's financial performance, commercial products, and potential future products in different areas of therapeutic research and development. Results may differ materially depending on the progress of BioMarin's product program, actions of regulatory authorities, availability of capital, future actions in the pharmaceutical market, and developments by competitors, and those factors detailed in BioMarin's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as 10-Q, 10-K, and 8-K reports.On the call today from BioMarin's management team are J.J. Bienaime, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Henry Fuchs, President, Worldwide Research & Development; Dan Spiegelman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Robert Baffi, President of Global Manufacturing and Technical Operations; and Jeff Ajer, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer.Consistent with the last two quarterly calls, we intend to keep this call to one hour in length. If we do not get to your question, please send me an email or give me a call and we'll get right back to you. Thank you for your understanding.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, J.J. Bienaime. -- Thank you, Tracy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's call. We are proud to share our highest quarterly revenue results to date at BioMarin, a record $461 million in revenues in the third quarter, which represents an 18% growth over the third quarter of last year and demonstrates the increasing strength of our base business. And while we are excited about our next-generation products, ValRox and vosoritide, we never lose sight of the importance of our existing products to both the people who rely on them to improve their health and to the financial health of our business. In these unpredictable times, it is reassuring that between our strong balance sheet and excellent commercial business, we are not reliant on the financial markets.As we round out 2019, confidence in our base business, combined with R&D expenses management, resulted in tightening of both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance to the top of the range for the full year. Our continued commitment to growth and profitability was demonstrated by cash generated in the third quarter, which was just over [Indecipherable]. In addition to our strong base business, the potential returns from our investments in ValRox and vosoritide are on the horizon. Approximately, three years ago we laid out a five-year plan for financial success of the business, and we remain on track.We said that R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues will peak and then come down. Over the last three years, it has come down from 60% to 43% of revenues and on its way to our long-term goal of 25%, all the while preserving a high level of productivity from R&D engine. Our top line has grown 15% or more year-over-year with a $2 billion revenue target for 2020. I have a. it was already to push the revenue growth well beyond that after 2020. Either ValRox or vosoritide could push revenue growth well beyond that up to 2020.And of course, we have been focusing on the bottom line as well. In 2016, we said that we would be non-GAAP positive starting in 2017. We were non-GAAP positive in 2017 and we have continued to grow each year. Our next target is GAAP profitability and from here with the success we anticipate from ValRox and vosoritide [Indecipherable] (00:04:04), and significantly profitable growth is on the horizon. We are all aware of recent market volatility and the negative impact it can have on our shareholders in the short term. However, with the potential business payoff of our strategies in full view, we remain steadfast in our focus to get ValRox and vosoritide approved and launched. And with over $1 million in cash and investments, our two potential blockbusters on the horizon and a third already on the market, Palynziq, we are poised to leverage the R&D, commercial, and manufacturing expertise and capabilities established over the last several years.At the heart of our business and what creates our growth opportunities is our R&D engine. And with that in mind, we look forward to hosting you at our annual R&D Day in New York on November 14 where we will provide updates on our late-stage program as well as shine a light on the next potential growth drivers, [Indecipherable] (00:05:11) ValRox and vosoritide. We will also have an interesting lineup of pre-clinical candidates to share with you as we consider which programs will be added next to our development pipeline. Please email the IR team for further details, and we hope you will be able to join us.Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff who will provide more details on the commercial business in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Jeff? -- Thank you, J.J. As J.J. mentioned, the third quarter was record breaking in terms of revenue for BioMarin driven by a strong revenue quarter for Vimizim and $30 million in revenue growth from our newest brands Palynziq and Brineura. Globally, BioMarin commercial brands contributed $428 million, a 19% increase quarter-over-quarter and $1.2 billion year-to-date, or 14% year-over-year growth. I will detail the breakdown of individual product contributions, but we'll start with a positive development in Brazil, a major market for MBS [Phonetic] (00:06:22) brands.In the third quarter, we recognized the first instalment of a 12-month supply agreement with the Brazilian Ministry of Health for both the Vimizim and Naglazyme, which combined for a total contribution of $45 million. This new one-year supply agreement should result in more revenue predictability through Q2 of 2020, although there will still be uneven order patterns quarter to quarter. Importantly under this new arrangement with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, we would expect the majority of the roughly $90 million contract to be applied in 2019.And now a little more detail on Vimizim globally. Quarterly revenue of $164 million represented a year-over-year increase of 33%. While a large Brazil order was a major factor in the quarter, patient growth of 11% globally also contributed to the increase and will support long-term additional revenue growth. For the full year we are tightening our guidance to between $540 and $570 million. For Naglazyme, the revenues driven from Brazil were offset by decreases due to ordering patterns in the EUMEA region and thus Q3 revenue totaling $94 million was down 4% versus Q2. Despite the neutralizing effect of both the favorable and unfavorable ordering in this quarter, overall patient growth remained steady, and we expect consistent annual revenue growth will continue. For the full year, we see revenues tightening to between $360 million and $380 million tightening the range.Turning now to the PKU brands and starting with Palynziq. In the US, July marked the one-year milestone of drug availability post FDA approval and the trajectory of patient referrals and correlating revenues are meeting expectations across all metrics. Q3 revenues of $24 million, essentially all of which came from US sales, were driven by a combination of the growing number of patients who have now achieved once daily dosing and new patients initiating therapy. A reminder that it takes on average five months for a patient referral to get to commercial therapy and then to daily dosing at which point that patient is a material revenue driver.At the end of Q3 in the United States, there were 670 patients on Palynziq commercial therapy, 142 of those patients from clinical studies and 528 patients formerly naive to Palynziq. There were an additional 153 enrolled naive patients who have not yet received their first commercial dispense. Total of 823 adult PKU patients, therefore, either already being treated with commercial Palynziq or well on their way to their first [Indecipherable] (00:09:32).Turning our attention now to the EU launch. In May 2019, we announced approval for Palynziq by the EMA, and since that time have engaged in very active education efforts, preparation of reimbursement dossiers, and promotional activities in first priority markets. I'm happy to share that physicians are treating patients now in Germany, the first EU country to market. Without the benefit of patients transitioning from clinical trial in combination with the timing required to achieve reimbursement approvals, we expect that it will take time to realize material revenue contributions from Europe. We're very happy with the progress that we've made to-date and we reaffirm revenue guidance for Palynziq tightening the range.Shifting now to Kuvan. Global revenues in the third quarter totaled $121 million, representing a 6% increase year-over-year. The majority of this was due to patient growth in the United States, and achieved in parallel to changing patient demographics as more adult PKU patients now have the option to treat with Palynziq. We are adjusting up our full-year guidance for Kuvan.Finally, an update on Brineura. Net product revenues were $20 million in Q3 driven by patient uptake in diverse global markets across all four regions. Our teams continue to focus their efforts on driving early diagnosis and identifying new patients who will benefit from therapy coupled with unlocking reimbursement in countries around the world. As a result of these efforts, Brineura has exhibited steady growth over time and now is reaching the level of material revenue contributions on a quarterly basis. We expect continued growth going forward and reaffirm our guidance for Brineura.In conclusion, I'm very pleased with the commercial team's execution and performance in the third quarter of 2019 in all four regions and excited to track and report the progress of the launch of Palynziq in EU. For the remainder of the year, with our established commercial base business, we are confident in our ability to achieve full-year revenue guidance of approximately $1.7 billion.So, thank you. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Hank. -- Thanks, Jeff, and congratulations to you and your team. Starting with ValRox for adults with severe hemophilia A, an exciting regulatory development has been announced today. We're pleased to share that the European Medicines Agency has recently granted our request for accelerated assessment of ValRox.In their assessment report, the European Medicines Agency acknowledged ValRox's potential to address the existing unmet need by providing patients with a treatment option that only requires a single intravenous administration and subsequently is expected to provide steady levels of endogenously produced coagulation factor VIII for a substantial amount of time.This decision is particularly important because it shows that based on the data the EMA has already received, the EMA recognizes ValRox's potential as a product of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation. This decision is also important as the accelerated assessment procedure reduces the timeframe for the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the CHMP, to review our planned marketing authorization application for ValRox on track for later this year. Needless to say, we are gratified to accept this recognition of ValRox given the impact it could have for patients with severe hemophilia A.Another positive development we want to share is news that our Shanbally facility has been successfully inspected by the Irish HPRA for testing and release of gene therapy products. These newly constructed laboratories are part of our overall strategy for meeting worldwide regulatory requirements for product distribution. This added capability prepares us to meet in-country testing requirements of the release of commercial product in the EU region.We continue to expect to submit marketing applications in both the United States and Europe in this quarter, based on recent meetings with the FDA and the EMA as we announced earlier this quarter. These submissions will be based on the recently completed Phase 3 interim analysis and the updated three-year Phase 1/2 data of patients treated with Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec. Enrollment in the GENEr8-1 Phase 3 open label study is expected to complete mid-November with the 52-week results anticipated in that study at the end of 2020.As we had said previously, although the trial is open label, we have a data access plan in place, which is designed to significantly mirror a blinded trial. This precludes anyone not directly monitoring the trial to access any emerging data from this study, and we are not updating any of our prior analyses. As for the ongoing Phase 2 study, we intend to share a four-year update with a 6e13 dose as well as a three-year update on a 4e13 dose at the middle of next year at an appropriate medical conference.Turning to our next late-stage program, vosoritide for the treatment of achondroplasia is nearing the finish line. Our global multipronged program has been designed to achieve maximum clinical benefit for infants and children with achondroplasia from newborns through growth plate closure. Beginning with the Phase 3 program, results from the large global study that includes children for ages 5 to 18, the data are expected by the end of the year. Needless to say, we look forward to sharing all these top line results with you at that time.Another key component of our global program in achondroplasia is the Phase 2 zero- to 5-year-old study. Given our conviction and the opinion stated at the [Indecipherable] (00:15:28) AdCom meeting with the FDA held earlier in the year and last year, treatment with vosoritide started as early as possible may translate into the best results for children with achondroplasia. We are thrilled with the progress of this ongoing study. We've completed enrollment in the first cohort of the study, which includes children from 2 to 5 years of age. The second cohort, which includes children from six months of age through two years of age is expected to complete by the year end. And the last cohort of the study, which includes newborns through six months of age begin earlier enrolling this month. Needless to say the level of interest from families seeking treatment for their very young children is very consistent with our belief in starting treatment as early as possible. We hope to provide more insight and detail on this program at R&D Day.Turning to BMN 307, our investigational gene therapy for PKU. We are pleased to have received Orphan designation for the BMN 307 this past Monday from the FDA. As you likely saw in our recent press release, we submitted a clinical trial application or CTA with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom, or the HPRA -- sorry, the MHRA for BMN 307. We expect to start enrolling patients with material manufacturer with a commercial-ready process to derisk the program to facilitate rapid clinical development in a Phase 1/2 trial in early 2020, and we are actively preparing regulatory submissions for other countries. We're excited about the prospect of BMN 307 as it represents a potential third PKU treatment option in our PKU franchise and a second gene therapy development program leveraging our learnings and capabilities from ValRox.One final note on pipeline changes. We announced today that we've entered into a licensing agreement with Allievex for Tralesinidase Alfa, formerly BMN 250, an investigational enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B. As we have stated previously, our focus is shifting to larger indications where we can have an impact with our highly innovative products. So we are thrilled to have Allievex now shepherding the continued development of Tralesinidase Alfa. We couldn't be happier for patients and their families as we expect they will benefit tremendously from Allievex's focus on treatments for rare neurodegenerative diseases.We look forward to hosting you at our upcoming R&D Day on November 14th in New York where we will showcase our next potential commercial products, namely ValRox and vosoritide, including some baseline data never shared before. Another highlight, we'll include an updated look at the natural history information including trends of vosoritide treatment through 54 months as well as evaluation of untreated patients with achondroplasia.With our earlier stage pipeline, we look forward to sharing a preview of the next potential INDs we are considering for development. We hope you will attend. So please reach out to our IR department should you need more information.Thank you for continued support, and I'll now turn the call over to Dan to review the financial quarters. Dan? -- Thank you, Hank. Please refer to today's press release summarizing our financial results for full details on the third quarter.First, with respect to revenues, we reported total revenues in the quarter of $461 million and are on track for full-year 2019 revenues of approximately $1.7 billion being in the expected range of $1.69 billion to $1.72 billion. In addition to tracking toward the middle of the range for full-year total product revenues, as J.J. mentioned, we expect both GAAP and non-GAAP results to be at the top end of the ranges due to continued R&D expense management as we continue to improve overall margins.An important item of note for the quarter is the impact of foreign exchange on our financial results. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened materially against the euro and the British pound and even more significantly against several of the Latin American currencies. Overall, net of our hedging, full-year revenue is projected to be negatively affected by approximately $20 million to $25 million such that our full-year revenue would have been at the high end of our guidance instead of the mid-range without these negative FX impacts.Thanks to our hedging contracts, which offset more than half of the potential revenue impact from a strengthening dollar and natural expense hedge offsets, full-year bottom line forecasted results are not materially impacted this year by exchange rates. One specific revenue item that Jeff did not discuss was Aldurazyme revenue in the quarter. It increased by $17 million versus 2Q due to delays in that quarter with Sanofi's QA release that has since been resolved. Year-to-date, Aldurazyme is down $44 million due to a one-time bolus of revenue in Q1 2018. Though patients on therapy, as reported by Genzyme, continue to grow in 2019 versus 2018.Moving to operating expenses. Both R&D and SG&A expenses in the third quarter roughly tracked to previously provided full-year guidance. SG&A is expected to come in at the upper end of the range between $670 million and $690 million. SG&A expenses in the third quarter were impacted by the expansion of sales and marketing capabilities as we lost Palynziq in Europe and continue to prepare for ValRox and vosoritide approvals and launch.In the third quarter, R&D expenses reflect the continued enrollment of additional patients in the global Phase 3 GENEr8-1 study, the manufacturing of BMN-307, our PKU gene therapy product ahead of clinical trials early next year, and the children in the zero to five-year-old study with vosoritide. However, despite the progress of these later-stage development programs with the decision not to pursue development of both BMN-270 -- 290, I'm sorry, for Friedreich's Ataxia and BMN-215, we now expect R&D expense for the full year to be lower than previously guided. For the full year we now expect R&D expenses of between $710 million and 740 million.Turning to bottom line results. GAAP net income in the third quarter was $55 million as compared to a GAAP net loss of $12.6 million in the third quarter of 2018. GAAP net income in the third quarter increased primarily due to nice profit from operations and a benefit from income taxes of approximately $45 million. For the full year, we expect GAAP loss to come in at the low end of our initial guidance range and now expect the loss of between $65 million and $45 million.As you know, we also measure our performance on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on EBITDA and also excludes stock compensation, contingent consideration, and certain other specified items. Our non-GAAP income in the third quarter was $78 million compared to non-GAAP income of $61 million in the third quarter of 2018. We are now narrowing the range of full-year non-GAAP income to be between $150 million and $170 million. In terms of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, as of September 30, 2019 we had $1.15 billion as compared to $1.1 billion on June 30th, 2019.And finally, a note on our cash flows for the third quarter. Year-to-date cash used for operation activities totaled just about $9 million, whereas cash generated by operating activities for the third quarter was just over $70 million. GAAP profitability and continued cash flow growth are expected as our revenues increase. Our P&L structure is expected to be similar to our larger biotech peers we aspire to follow.In closing, BioMarin's current commercial business remains on track to deliver roughly $1.7 billion in revenues this year and close to $2 billion next year with increasing GAAP and non-GAAP bottom line profitability. Over the next 18 months we also expect to accelerate into the next phase of higher revenue and growth through potential approvals of ValRox and vosoritide, which could lead to approvals and revenue contribution starting before the end of 2020.Thanks for your support and I will now open it to your questions. Operator?Yes. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my questions. So for vosoritide, how should we think about the clinical meaningfulness of the Phase 3 data? So while you showed about a 2 centimeter a year benefit at the same dose in the Phase 2, clearly there is a range per various stratification measures that adds up here or gets you on a normal growth curve. So if you could give us any clarity there, and I have a follow-up. -- Hi, Salveen. The clinical meaningfulness of just the Phase 3 study I don't think can be considered in isolation because the Phase 3 study is a relatively short duration, one year, in that it's placebo-controlled, and that was what we and our investigators agreed was feasible to study and generate high-quality data. I think the way to think about clinical meaningfulness of vosoritide is in terms of cumulative effect over chronic therapy, and to remind you, we reported last year on the accumulated benefit of vosoritide through 42 months of chronic therapy in our Phase 1/2 cohort of 10 patients. This year we'll be giving you another update on that, which will now carry patients through 54 months of therapy. And as I mentioned in my talking points, we are now in a position to start addressing what the height gain over untreated patients can be expected to be, given that we're now coming online with our own contemporaneous natural history study. So all that taken together says value of the Phase 3 trials to prove that vosoritide is effective compared to placebo, but the magnitude of the benefit should be weighed in the context of longer-term therapy. -- Hopefully. that addresses that question, yeah. -- Yeah, that was helpful. And then can you discuss the forward trajectory and dynamics for Kuvan? Do you expect the majority of patients here to transition over to Palynziq prior to IP expiration? -- Hi, Salveen. It is certainly our goal to transition as many adult Kuvan patients to Palynziq as possible before loss of exclusivity in a year, and we are making a lot of progress. 38% of our Palynziq referrals -- our naive Palynziq patient referrals are Kuvan transition. So making a lot of progress there. It is also true that there remain a smaller now number of new adult patients that are being referred in for Kuvan treatment. And it is also true, particularly in the United States, that our pediatric population is growing on Kuvan. So, the trajectory. I would think, would be similar to what we are reporting year-to-date with patient growth of about 6% tied to continued revenue growth. Our focus, both in Europe and the United States is overwhelmingly now on adult patients gaining access to and benefiting from Palynziq therapy. -- That's it. Thank you. -- Salveen, also I just want to remind people on the line that the loss of exclusivity in Q4 of next year is only in the US. In Europe -- I mean, ex-US, we have protection until 2024. -- And also maybe one point that maybe is a little different from your traditional generics modeling is that when you're in small molecule, you lose protection or market exclusivity you enjoy. When you lose a patient to generic, they very rarely come back to the brand, if ever. In our case, [Indecipherable] if we do starting [Indecipherable] October, November 2020. if we do lose a Kuvan patient to a generic, they are not last forever to our business in the sense that they can always go to Palynziq down the road. So they're not lost forever. -- Okay. Thank you.And your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. One on vosoritide for me also. In the Phase 2 data, we saw at month 12 just below a 50% increase in annualized growth velocity. Hank, is there any reason why we shouldn't expect that in the Phase 3? Are there any notable differences in the patient populations who are enrolled that could change the expected results? -- Not really, no. So we purposely kept the eligibility criteria fairly consistent and obviously the outcome measures are same outcome measure and dose and regimen are the same. So we should expect a fairly similar result. Now the one thing that we pointed out is that we've been doing those calculations compared to the baseline run in, but as people have pointed out and as you noticed from publicly contemplated natural history growth studies, there is a gentle negative slope. So we have one year. There could be some negative placebo effects such that we underestimated at one year. The magnitude of treatment benefit from vosoritide. And I think where that's going to get to be more and more and more important as you go out farther and farther in time because those declines will start to add up. Then I was suggesting that at R&D Day, we'll have an opportunity to look at those -- both of those phenomenon, the cumulative benefit from chronic treatment as well as contrast that to similar populations of patients who have not been treated with vosoritide. -- Got it, OK. And even though the age 5 to 14 is exactly the same between Phase 2 and Phase 3, do you know whether the people who are actually enrolled have a similar age characteristics, too? Was the Phase 2 weighted toward younger patients and Phase 3 is getting older patients or as far as you know, the ages and the trial are also identical? -- As far as I know, there are no major and substantive changes. I think that I mentioned that we're going to talk in a little bit more detail about the vosoritide and ValRox programs and this is the kind of question that I think we can address a little bit more in detail at R&D Day, but for today the headliner is, no, we're not aware of any differences that could kind of a different result in Phase 3 than in Phase 2. -- Perfect. And then one last housekeeping question on Brazil. I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said when you talked about the proportion of revenue you expect in 2019. -- Yeah, no differences, other than the inclusion of placebo. -- Right. Great. Okay. No, sorry, I was asked about Brazil just a clarifying question. There was -- you mentioned I think $90 million in total and some proportion of that was going to be in 2019. I missed what you said about the proportion in 2019 from the Brazilian orders. -- Hi, Phil. So, the comment was we expect greater than 50% of that $90 million contract to be fulfilled in 2019 and less than in 2020 first half. -- Perfect. That's helpful. Thanks.And your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on vosoritide as well. And with the progress we're making in children under the age of five, I guess when could we expect to maybe see a first cut of data from the initial cohort. And then maybe more importantly, do you think it's possible that you'd be able to submit some of that data as part of your initial application and potentially launch with the label including younger children, or is that something we should think of more as a supplemental filing post your initial approval? -- Supplemental finding for efficacy purposes post initial approval if things go well. Initial application if anything will include safety data at most. And as far as timing for completion of analysis of the under five study, it's obviously going to depend on finishing enrollment. And as I said, we're projecting that we'll complete enrollment in the second cohort by the end of the year, but we are only just now beginning enrollment in the third cohort. So stay tuned for more clarity on timeline of expected enrollment completion. -- So you wouldn't show data until you had all three cohorts then, is that correct? -- The efficacy data. I think. -- Okay. -- We wouldn't be able to. It's a blinded study. So the benefit of waiting until the end is to protect their life. -- Okay, perfect. I will stop there. Thanks for taking the question. -- Yes.Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I just had a couple on ValRox. I know you've been asked quite a bit about the reimbursement model over the past year or so, but just checking to see if that has evolved over time just given the success of Zolgensma for example from Novartis. And in terms of clinical updates vosoritide, is there a trigger that regulators are looking for in terms of any updates -- pipeline updates or clinical updates you're looking for beyond what you released so far on things like duration of effect or exposure, etc? Thank you. -- Hi, Geoff. We continue to make progress with ValRox reimbursement preparation, both in the United States and in Europe. And and it is illuminating to see other products begin to make it to market and see how the market reacts to some of their programs and pricing, including Zolgensma. So I think we saw some so reported uptake of Zolgensma in the United States with an implied gross to net that was pretty high. That was -- both of those things were encouraging. The price level that we saw with Zolgensma was encouraging.There has been a lot of discussion about different price models. I think by now it's becoming pretty clear that outcomes-based agreements, unless there is a legislative fix, are going to be limited to something like 23% of purchase price without triggering big government price calculation and resulting price problems. I think it's also clear that the installment payment method that people have been interested in and talked about for a while is going to be problematic in the United States. All of those things are being reinforced in BioMarin's one-on-one discussions with payers to facilitate a potential launch in the United States. Discussions in Europe continue. Europe is substantially different situation with single national payor systems essentially that have more latitude and don't involve government price calculation problems. It's also the fact that that we don't see as much concrete real development of reimbursement models yet in EU. So that's a more nascent situation. J.J., did you want to add anything? -- No. I think you did very well. -- And your vosoritide question, as far as data triggers for next regulatory interactions and the big one is going to be the pivotal results of the Phase 3 trial. The three other pillars of the program study in children under five, the long-term extension study that we're going to give you 54-month data as well as its comparison to natural history data. Those three elements are necessary but not sufficient and the next meaningful milestone to occur in the [Indecipherable] program is going to be the unblinding of the Phase 3 program at the end of the year. -- Thank you . -- Yeah.And your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. -- Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just a question on Palynziq and I have a follow-up as well. But first on Palynziq. Just looking at the US patient dynamics. By our math, it looks like there were about 120 or so, maybe 118 naive patient adds in in the third quarter. And then just doing the same math in the second quarter, I think that was about 130. So looks like there was a sequential decrease, but you also reported an increase in PKU clinics. So I know this thing tends to see some choppiness and move around quarter-on-quarter in terms of naive patient adds. But can you maybe talk about what you're seeing. Are we at a steady state in terms of new patient adds or is there any reason to think maybe Q4 adds would be meaningfully different? And then I'm going to have a follow-up. -- Yeah, Chris. So good observation. If you look back to the numbers that we've reported at the close of each quarter, we've seen patient growth going from a high of 153 new patients on therapy at the end of the first quarter, 137 and 134 basis respectively at the end of the fourth quarter last year and the second quarter this year, and 119 new patients on therapy at the end of the third quarter. So there is some variability quarter to quarter and it is true that the third quarter was a little less than the previous several quarters.The other thing to note or the precursor on that is the level of new patient referrals, and so there is a little bit of variability there, too. But new patient referrals in the third quarter were very strong. So probably just a little bit of an up on one aspect and a down on another for total patients on therapy and nothing that I'm concerned about. In fact, as I noted in my prepared remarks, following all of the different parameters that we watch to see, are we having a very successful Palynziq launch, my overall conclusion is this looks like it's pretty much on rails right now without any yellow or red flags to worry about. So we're opening up new clinics. We're getting new patient referrals across the board from our existing clinics. We're getting reimbursement approvals in around 60 days on average for those patients. They're going on the commercial therapy. They're titrating up to daily dosing and then maintenance dosing. We're not losing large numbers of patients. There is -- this is just a really solid story, and all of that, by the way, is translating into weekly syringe, dispensers from our specialty pharmacy network, and translating into increases in revenue is why at this point I would advise saying, look, follow the increase in revenues, which are pretty steady quarter to quarter to quarter. We think that's the best measure to watch. -- Thanks for the color. And maybe just a quick one for Hank. BMN-307, so you filed a CTA first. Is there any gating factor or anything different between your EMA and the FDA, what's the gating issue in terms of filing the BLA in the US, please? Thanks . -- It's a relatively simple thing. We've got a lot of experience with the MHRA in filing gene therapy applications first-in-man there, and so we're starting with the MHRA. As I said in my prepared comments, we're preparing submissions in other regions to occur briskly thereafter. So there is nothing unique going on there. I did want to follow up on a question you asked me last time, Chris, the five versus the one. In the New England Journal what we were reporting was related symptomatic hypertensive events, and there has been only one in the ongoing Phase 1/2 4.5-year study. -- Okay. Thank you. -- [Indecipherable] -- Thank you, Hank. -- Yeah.Moving on we have Joseph Schwartz from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. -- Thanks very much. I have a question on vosoritide and then ValRox. So, for vosoritide, I'm wondering if you can expand on something that was asked earlier. And how do you expect the cumulative effects of chronic therapy for vosoritide to compare to growth hormone, which seems to have a bigger effect upfront that wanes over time, but it's still incremental. So when you consider long-term therapy for each treatment option, how much more impactful, do you expect the longer-term treatment option to be sort of vosoritide? -- Hi, Joe. Thanks for the question. Growth hormone in non-growth hormone deficiency syndromes and a little bit of the growth hormone deficiencies [Indecipherable] as well. There is a big effect initially and then there is [Indecipherable] effect, and we just don't see that with [Indecipherable] biologies is very different. In fact, what we've reported through 42 months last year is every period in which we look at the rate of growth compared to pretreatment baseline, the rate of growth is on the short side is in excess of what the growth was prior to taking the short side.Now, we've also said that growth velocity is gently slowing down as you approach adolescence, and as we said before, also there doesn't appear to be evidence of pubertal spurt. So our expectation is that as these children get older, their untreated growth velocity would be decelerating. And so that's why it's going to become -- and this is why the FDA asked us for this that in the absence of an ability to do essentially a 5 or 10-year placebo-controlled trial. The agency is going to be very keen to see the accumulated type benefit from our long-term treatments contrasted with long-term growth velocity outcomes in untreated patients. And I think that's going to be the best way you observe the cumulative benefit which we do expect to be fairly steady over time.And the another thing I want to make sure that everybody is clear about is that in United States and Europe growth hormone is not indicated for the treatment of achondroplasia. So we got to be careful when we talk about growth hormone that we're talking about growth hormone in non-achondroplasia disorders because growth hormone does not have a favorable benefit/risk as it's deemed by US and EU regulators. -- Okay. And then on ValRox . I was wondering if you have thoughts on why other gene therapies delivered via AAV5 may not require steroid prophylaxis, so much so that patients that are positive for AAV5 antibodies are not being excluded from other sponsors' ongoing study, but ValRox expression does seem to be sensitive to this now and whether steroids are used. I was just wondering if you've been able to determine why that might be. -- Well, first of all, let me just remind that although we acknowledge that number of the result at the end of 23- to 26-week period for the Phase 1/2 study is numerically higher than the result at the end of 23- to 26-weeks in the Phase 3 study. There is substantial amount of variability in patient response such that we can't conclusively say that there is a difference in the Phase 1/2 result and the Phase 3 result. And then to further speculate that that's due to steroids as a causal explanation is a hypothesis rather than necessarily fact.And as to the optimal steroid regimen for use with ValRox, as I said a couple of months ago, we and our investigators are intrigued by the results of the interim analysis, and we are tightening per the protocol the use of on-demand steroids. And let's see where that gets us to as a result. We've also talked about potentially doing a prophylactic steroid combination study, but as yet we haven't initiated that study. So our plan is to finish the present study as designed, bird in the hand winner, independent data monitoring committee to say we have a positive benefit/risk. We're very confident that we're [Indecipherable] the bleeding outcomes in the Phase 3 trial, and we're going to put a lot of details that substantiate these statements in front of you at R&D Day, so you can see why we're so keen to get across the finish line as directly as we could.As far as what other companies are doing and what read to make from that, it's a little hard to speculate, because we don't have the same access to their data. The one thing I would say, [Indecipherable] published information from other companies investigating AAV5 gene therapies and treating patients who are so-called antibody positive. Their assay is transduction inhibition neutralizing the antibody assay, which doesn't necessarily always correlate with preexisting immunity. And we have presented some several posters about that at various [Indecipherable] conferences. So I'd say let's gather more data before we make any conclusions about whether steroids are required, how they're required, and what the role of preexisting immunity, if any, there is in the need for steroid therapy management. -- Thanks a lot. -- Yes.Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Hi, this is Kostas on for Matthew. I have a question on BMN-307 and specifically let's assume that your CTA is approved soon. Can you talk about the starting dose that you are considering and about the efficacy that you are expecting to see with the starting dose? Also, can you discuss how quickly would you expect to see the clinical effect, which is [Indecipherable] reduction in patients? Thank you. -- Yes. So based on preclinical studies, we expect to see efficacy and Phe lowering from an active dose within just a few weeks and as far as starting those dose, one of the things that is a very strong positive is our collaboration with the MHRA. The MHRA's belief is that in gene therapies that considering the fact that they're essentially one and done, that the starting this has to be also informed by the prospect of benefit for patients. So, more specifically they don't really want to see a lot of patients dosed in inactive doses, which is very different than development of drugs in other indications.As to the actual number of the starting dose, that's something to finalize, because we're still in the process of review with the health authority. And obviously we have a point of view about where that should start, but until the CTA is activated, I think it would be premature to talk about what the specifics are. -- Thank you very much. -- Yes.The next question comes from the line of Eliana Merle from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. Another one on vosoritide for me. Just how should we think about the potential usage and other indications beyond achondroplasia and if you have sort of any plans to develop this or study this on other indications?And then second on vosoritide, I know you mentioned sort of collecting the data on the cumulative height benefit, but just from a payor perspective, given this is not a fatal disease, sort of, what other data are you collecting on other comorbidities beyond growth and height that you think will matter to the payors sort of as you think about pricing? Thanks. -- So, as regards to potential use in other indications, we forgot to mention that in summarizing our quarter that we posted Phase 2 data in the New England Journal of Medicine in early July. And subsequent to that there was a letter to the editor written to the authors exactly on this topic, speculating that because of the genetics of growth that vosoritide may be indicated in other growth disorders. The genetic data that people are talking about was actually cited by us in our last R&D Day where we illustrated that there are conditions in which loss of function on either the ligand side or the receptor side or gain a function on ligand or receptor side are associated with stature deficiency or stature excess, respectively.And that suggests that addition of CNP in patients with other mutations that cause statural impairment may also be amenable to vosoritide therapy. At this year's R&D Day, we're going to provide you an update on the progress of our thinking about whether that's attractable target for new indication development. And so I'd say, come to a theater near you.As regards information for payors and Jeff can chime in as well, but we've said all along that generating definitive proportionality data will take longer time than we expect to be able to option in the pivotal clinical trial and would really starting much earlier -- at a much earlier point in time. So we don't expect to see dramatic changes in proportionality in our favor.And moreover, functional benefits in short-term studies can be very difficult to cut by in the stature deficiency kinds of cases, but we're going to measure patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life by several different measures. But another big element that payors will be considering, and we've done a lot of work in this area is to characterize the burden of illness, because the burden of illness is not as neatly summarized in the condition of achondroplasia as simply how tall are you and how much efficiency in your stature do you have. The burden of the condition is measured in lots of different ways.And so, I think the strategy that we've employed in these kinds of context previously is to make sure payors really understand what it's like. And that's very important in these rare disease areas because for the most part, payors are not going to be seeing patients with rare diseases on any kind of regular basis and will have no reference standard. So we want to educate them well about the condition of study and then educate them well about the outcomes that have been demonstrated. And so far that's been a pretty successful strategy for BioMarin.And your next question comes from the line of Tim Lugo from William Blair. Your line is open. -- Thanks for the question. Another on vosoritide. Going back to the newborn to under-five-year-old trial, the growth velocity is so pronounced between the especially the newborns to one- year-old. Can you talk maybe about the unique safety, efficacy, concerns around this patient population maybe more so than the over five year olds? -- Yeah. Well, so we defined the study into three different age cohorts since we had reason to at least hypothesize that biodistribution of the drug would be different as a function of age. And it turns out that's likely to be true. And so three different cohorts that will be valued. By the way, that's a really important consideration and is actually quite an advantage of a short-acting -- relatively short-acting drug, in the sense that it doesn't take you months to adjust the dose of vosoritide if there's a problem. The half-life being what it is pretty much the next day you can start a different dose safely.So that's actually quite an interesting advantage that we have. And interpretation of safety therefore is going to be to what extent if there are safety [Indecipherable], can they be addressed with simple dose modifications. So when we get to the end of the study that will stack up all that information for you. I would say [Indecipherable] we have no real hypotheses about there being incremental differences in safety in this population compared to the older population.And finally in regard to efficacy, the critical consideration is that growth velocity is declining quite rapidly over that age period. So it's going to be much more difficult -- it would be much more difficult to compare these patients to a natural history control for that reason. So that's the reason that we chose to blind this study and randomized to placebo comparison. That will give us a healthy assessment of the treatment effect in this age group. -- Interesting. Thank you for the color. -- Yeah.Your next question comes from the line of Akash Tewari from Wolfe. Your line is open. -- Hey, thanks for taking me on. So talking to investors, there seems to be a large variation in how the vosoritide data will be perceived whether you show 1.5, 1.75 or 2, even though I feel like statistically you could totally be in that range. So what will be the data release procedure for vosoritide? Will we just get a top line average growth velocity number or will there kind of be a call and we'll be able to age match patient populations from Phase 2 versus Phase 3?And in that kind of light, are you targeting an average age of patients similar to what was in Phase 2 for your Phase 3 trial? And then maybe on your PKU gene therapy, I think if you look at your competitor homology, at least preclinical in mouse models, they weren't able to show Phe normalization until they hit a threshold of about 30 viral genome copies per cell in order to get Phe normalization. How do you think about the translatability of these like PKU mouse models into humans specifically on what dose [Indecipherable] ? -- Go on. Oh sorry, did I ... -- No, no, all good, all good. -- I see why you said thanks for taking on your questions and I appreciate the opportunity to address investor variability as opposed to any other kind of variability. So the target population for the Phase 3 trial should be fairly similar to the Phase 2 trial. So there should see some opportunity for some comparison. But again these are not side-by-side trials and they're not identical patients that are being randomized between Phase 2 and Phase 3. So interpretation could be difficult.I think the principal point of interpretive emphasis is going to be either met or didn't meet the primary endpoint for statistical testing, because in this condition, as I said before, what it adds up to won't be as neatly understood from just the Phase 3 data. And so I think the key thing to focus on in that top line result in the first instance is going to be met or didn't meet the primary endpoint.As far as what the contents of the press release are, it's very premature. I mean we -- I don't even think we've had the last patient out of the study yet. And so therefore, we haven't unblinded and therefore there's nothing really to talk about just yet. So stay tuned, hang in there. We'll try to give you the salient and pertinent information when we unblind, just the right amount, not too much. -- Hank, do you want to add something about the Phase 2 trial, the ongoing Phase 2 in under five patients that is actually a randomized control trials [Indecipherable]. -- Yes, yeah, yeah. So that trial as I said was stuck in the three cohorts. So three cohorts are two to five years old, six months to two years old, zero months to six months of age. Patients are randomized with -- well, actually each cohort has three sentinel subjects, and the purpose of sentinels are to obtain initial pilot safety data as well as well as initial PK data for the purposes of dose adjustment.There's going to be -- they're randomized one to one drug to placebo within each of the three cohorts. There are 30 patients in the first cohort that have completed enrollment. There are to be 10 patients -- 20 patients, sorry, 20 patients in the second cohort, 20 patients in the third cohort, again randomized 1 to 1. And the comparison is going to be high Z scores, the standard deviation scores, active versus placebo. Each individual cohort is powered to detect trends. But the study in aggregate is powered to detect an improvement in growth velocity. So a little more information about the design of the 206 trial.You also asked about 307 and translatability. Let me just take a little bit of a step back. We have an internal saying at BioMarin, mice lie and monkeys don't always tell the truth, and that's actually a reference to the history of gene therapy in which mirroring experiments didn't necessarily predict what would happen in primate experiments or what happened in human experience.As it turns out, AAV5 tends to be relatively predictable. I don't know that I would say the same thing necessarily for different capsids and particularly novel capsids for which there's hardly any preclinical data. But I think with AAV5 what we have observed is the stuff that preclinical mirroring data and the preclinical [Indecipherable] data, it's actually pretty reflective of what -- if you look at the right time points, it's pretty reflective of what happens in humans. And that I think gives us a lot of confidence that we'll be able to see that relatively rapid result once we get to an active dose. And whether there's really a threshold or it's just a steep dose-response curve, stay tuned. Let's see what the data are.Your next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your line is open. -- Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. This is Nate on for Paul. Just two, going back to Palynziq real quick that I hope you don't take too long to answer. One, I think more than 500 of your 800 patients on Palynziq were previously on Kuvan. Are there any differences in those underlying patient population? -- [Indecipherable]. -- What's that? -- I don't know if people can hear us, but we're having technical difficulties.But we're having technical difficulties -- -- Hi, can you hear me? -- [Indecipherable]. -- You guys still there? -- Operator, we'd like to now conclude the Q&A portion of the call, and let our Chairman and CEO provide closing comments.Absolutely. -- So as you heard, the coming 18 months will be transformative for the company, which we expect will allow us to drive significant growth beyond our existing commercial business. Top line growth, continued R&D expense management, and cash flow generated by operating activities will continue to increase in parallel with the investments of ValRox and vosoritide. Our strategic transition to larger operating indication is now on track with the out-licensing of Tralesinidase Alfa and the pursuit of new potential products. A few of you will hear about all this at R&D Day next month.Taken together, we believe BioMarin is poised for significant commercial expansion over the coming quarters, and we are preparing for success. So thank you for your continued support and we hope to see all of you or most of you in New York next month.

Specifically, the biotech crushed FactSet's consensus Q3 GAAP net income estimate by a whopping 75%, and beat the prevailing revenue forecast for the three-month period by a modest 1.16% as well. Investors, in turn, cheered this news by bidding up the company's stock by 3.83% in after-hours trading on moderate volume.While better-than-expected earnings are always a plus from an investing standpoint, there's actually a lot more to like about this orphan drugmaker other than its encouraging Q3 results. Here are three additional reasons to consider buying this top\u00a0\u00a0right now.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.When it comes to picking top revenue-generating biotech stocks, there are three core areas investors should focus on:\u00a0BioMarin passes each of these checkpoints with flying colors\u00a0On the valuation front, its shares are trading somewhere along the lines of 6.2 times next year's sales right now. While that figure might jump off the screen as a sky-high valuation in absolute terms, the stock is actually cheap for a top maker of orphan drugs -- especially for one whose annual revenue could more than double within the next four years.Keeping with this theme, shares of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy specialist\u00a0\u00a0 are presently trading at nearly 10 times next year's sales, and the cystic fibrosis giant\u00a0' \u00a0stock isn't much cheaper at 8.2 times the company's 2020 sales forecast.\u00a0The point is that both of these top orphan-drug stocks are markedly more expensive than BioMarin's at current levels. Best of all, BioMarin should at least match -- if not surpass -- both Sarepta and Vertex from a revenue growth standpoint over the next decade.\u00a0BioMarin also ticks the late-stage clinical pipeline box. During its Q3 conference call, management noted that the company is on track to submit regulatory filings for the severe hemophilia A treatment\u00a0\u00a0in both the U.S. and EU and release the top-line results for vosoritide's pivotal trial for children with achondroplasia (a form of dwarfism) before the end of the year. Both of these experimental rare-disease treatments are expected to achieve blockbuster level sales early in the next decade.\u00a0Regarding the health of its balance sheet, BioMarin sports one of the strongest cash positions among all mid-cap biotechs right now. Specifically, the company exited the most recent quarter with an eye-catching $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. That means that BioMarin shouldn't have to dilute current shareholders, take on boatloads of debt, or cut a bad licensing deal due to an imminent cash crunch.\u00a0BioMarin's relatively cheap valuation, strong growth prospects, and sizable cash cushion are three solid reasons to buy its stock soon. Now, it's true that this orphan-drug maker hasn't been a great investing vehicle over the past few years, but this situation should change for the better in early 2020. After all, BioMarin's late-stage pipeline has consistently produced big wins for shareholders over the years -- and valoctocogene roxaparvovec and vosoritide both appear poised to follow in this rich tradition in the not-so-distant future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of BMRN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $74.59/share today.\n\nBecause the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 71%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.00% return on the cash commitment, or 19.20% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., and highlighting in green where the $70.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of BMRN stock at the current price level of $74.59/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $75.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.78% if the stock gets called away at the November 15th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BMRN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing BMRN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $75.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.23% boost of extra return to the investor, or 33.46% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 43%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 41%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $74.59) to be 34%.

The\u00a0closely watched\u00a0 is presently up by over 6% for the year, and brighter days should be close at hand with the ongoing innovation bonanza showing no signs of cooling off.\u00a0Which biotech stocks should investors have on their radars right now? The rare-disease specialists   and \u00a0 are both poised to produce market-beating returns in the coming decade. Here's what you need to know about these top biotech growth stocks.\u00a0\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Wall Street's consensus 12-month price target on BioMarin suggests that this biotech stock could appreciate by a whopping 75% from current levels. That's a bold outlook for a mid-cap stock to be sure, but BioMarin arguably warrants such a glowing forecast.\u00a0What's on tap for this orphan drug kind? BioMarin has two game-changing catalysts on the calendar. First up, the drugmaker is expected to submit regulatory filings in the U.S. and EU for its severe hemophilia A treatment\u00a0 before the end of 2019. EvaluatePharma has the drug's sales topping $1.2 billion by 2024. That's a healthy sum for a company on track to generate a total of $1.94 billion in sales in 2020. Next up, BioMarin plans on unveiling the top-line data from its pivotal trial for the dwarfism drug candidate, vosoritide, before year's end. If this readout hits the mark, vosoritide might be on the market as soon as the third quarter of 2020. Taken together, these two drug candidates have the potential to light a roaring fire underneath the biotech's shares over the next 18 months.What's the key takeaway? BioMarin's shares might be trading as low as three times its 2024 sales. That's a dirt cheap valuation for an orphan drugmaker. The catch is that the market clearly isn't convinced that both of these experimental drugs will become commercial-stage products -- at least not anytime soon. The market's dour take is evident based on BioMarins' rock-bottom sales multiple, as well as the downright dreadful performance of its shares over the past five years.\u00a0Vertex's virtual monopoly in\u00a0cystic fibrosis (CF) is the sole reason the biotech's shares have risen by a staggering 400% over the past 10 years, and currently sport one of richest valuations in all of biotech at over 28 times forward-looking earnings.\u00a0Despite these jaw-dropping metrics, though, Wall Street seems convinced that Vertex's stock has even more room to run. The consensus 12-month price target on the biotech's shares, after all, implies another 22.7% jump from current levels.\u00a0Why is Wall Street so upbeat about Vertex's stock? The core reason is the biotech's triple combination CF therapy that's presently under review by the Food and Drug Administration.The brief rundown is that this experimental therapy could greatly expand Vertex's addressable market in CF. EvaluatePharma, as a result, has this triplet therapy pegged as the single most valuable pipeline candidate right now. Keeping with this theme, some analysts even think it might even go on to become the  in the entire industry in the latter half of the next decade.\u00a0\u00a0So, despite Vertex's monstrous run over the last 10 years and resulting top-shelf valuation, growth-oriented investors may still want to consider picking up some shares soon.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn't one of them!

My name is Atishian [Phonetic], and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today's interactive broadcast. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would now like to turn the show over to Traci, Vice President of Investor Relations. -- Thank you, Atishian. Thank you everyone for joining us today. To remind you, this non-confidential presentation contains forward-looking statements about the business prospects of BioMarin Pharmaceutical, including expectations regarding BioMarin's financial performance, its commercial products, and potential future products in different areas of therapeutic research and development.Results may differ materially depending on the progress of BioMarin's product programs, actions of regulatory authority, availability of capital, future actions in the pharmaceutical market, and developments by competitors, and those factors detailed in BioMarin's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission such as 10-Q, 10-K, and 8-K report.On the call from BioMarin's management team today are J.J. Bienaime, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Hank Fuchs, President, Worldwide Research and Development; Dan Spiegelman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Ajer, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Robert Baffi, President of Global Manufacturing and Technical Operations.Based on positive feedback from our last quarterly call, we intend to keep this call to an hour in length. If you do not get your question, please send me an email or give me a call and we'll get right back to you. Thank you for your understanding.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to BioMarin's Chairman and CEO, J.J. Bienaime. -- Thank you, Traci. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us todays on the call. We delivered another solid quarter and first half results, net product revenues for products marketed by BioMarin, which is excludes Aldurazyme were up 9% in the quarter and 12% in the first half of 2019, driven in part by a 21% growth of our PKU franchise, which is a combination of KUVAN and Palynziq. For the remainder of 2019, we are confident in our ability to achieve full-year guidance based on the number of very positive dynamics that Jeff will review momentarily. Beyond the strength of our base business and unparalleled commercial manufacturing capabilities, the potential returns on our investment in valrox and vosoritide are on the horizon. Both products represent very large market opportunities and growth drivers for BioMarin, which we expect will be transformational for the company over the next 18 months.Currently the base business is expected to produce about $1.7 billion in top line results this year and we are very confident it will be followed by $2 billion in commercial revenues in 2020. These estimates are based on projected growth of our existing commercial and substantial acceleration of Palynziq revenues. In the U.S. enrollment in Palynziq are expected to grow at a steady-state, while more and more patients reach maintenance dosing. In Europe, we are beginning our typical country-by-country launch process that will culminate in meaningful revenues in 2020. Specific to our new product opportunities, we plan to submit marketing applications for valrox in the fourth quarter of this year with potential approval and launch next year. The valrox opportunity represents the largest market we have entered today. Over 30,000 people living with severe Brineura and [Indecipherable]. On the heels of the valrox submission, we look forward to the results from our global Phase 3 study with vosoritide in children with achondroplasia vosoritide represents another blockbuster opportunity and addresses these therapeutic needs of over 25,000 children with the disorder in our commercial territories.As these two potential new therapies move through regulatory and possible approval phases, we tend to leverage our manufacturing and commercial capabilities to facilitate rapid and substantial losses. Finally, we look forward to hosting U.S., our annual R&D day in New York on November 14, where we will shed a light on the next potential growth drives beyond valrox and vosoritide. We look forward to share details of our next potential geographic product and BMN 307 for the treatment of PKU. We will also have an interesting line-up of pre-clinical candidates to share with you as we consider which programs to proceed to the development pipeline next. So, we hope you would join us there.Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff, who will provide more details on the commercial business in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Jeff? -- Thank you J.J. I'm very pleased with the commercial teams' execution in the second quarter and the first half of 2019. Following a brief review of our results in the quarter I will share our outlook for the remainder of the year. Starting with our PKU franchise, we are pleased to see 21% growth year-over-year from a combination of strong and deep update in U.S. and continued organic growth of Kuvan, specifically with Palynziq, we are very pleased with U.S. launched progress in the second quarter. Q2 revenue contributions of $18.8 million and year-to-date revenues of $31.1 million [Indecipherable].Turning to the key metrics and starting with commercial reimbursed patients, as of the end of the second quarter, we have a total of 551 U.S. patients on reimbursed R&D. Of those 141 patients transition from our clinical studies and 410 are formerly naived Palynziq. 37% of whom are Kuvan patient conversions. At quarter-end, there were an additional 158 naive patients with complete enrollments and pending shipment of the first injection representing a consistently strong pipeline quarter-over-quarter. Taking together, that totals over 700 enrolled Palynziq patients as of the end of the quarter representing approximately 130 million in annual revenues. This puts us well on track for a $7,100 million full-year guidance for Palynziq. In addition to robust patient update in the U.S., we are now entering the beginning phase of the launch in the key region awaiting first orders in [Indecipherable]. We anticipate meaningful revenue contributions from Palynziq in Europe beginning in 2020 as we make progress on the country-by-country reimbursement launch process.Turning to the other contributors through our PKU franchise Kuvan, revenues were $113.3 million in the quarter and $220.2 million for the first half of the year. To remind you of Kuvan, we typically see a seasonal pattern where first half sales -- some patients switched insurance coverage early in the year and must navigate new prior authorizations early in the calendar year. For the remainder of the year with Kuvan, we expect to see an increase in second half U.S. revenues consistent with dynamics previously described. Based on these expectations, we reaffirm full-year Kuvan guidance of between $420 million to $460 million.Turning now to Vimizim, quarterly revenue of the $122.7 million was impacted by the limited ordering from Brazil that was partially offset by other organic growth. Importantly, patients from therapy ahead of the quarter were approximately 10% higher than a year ago. Naglazyme delivered $98.2 million on revenue for the second quarter, an 8% increase compared to the second quarter last year and 13% over the previous quarter. Notably, patients for this 14-year-old brand were approximately 8% higher than a year ago when in particular by patient [Indecipherable] Saudi Arabia and Turkey. For the remainder of the year, we are very confident in the prospects for both Vimizim and Nagalzyme where we expect significant growth over the first half for both brands. In addition, the continued organic growth across global markets, significant contributions from the Brazilian Minster of Health support our bullish outlook. Specifically, the Ministry of Health has recently published their intended to purchase approximately $95 million of Nagalzyme combined with Vimizim over the next 12 months. The majority of which we anticipate to record in the second half of 2019.In comparison, we recognized about $13 million revenue from the Brazilian Ministry of Health in the first half of the year. Not only does this development provided increased predictability for contributions from Brazil it bodes us well for patients there. Finally, moving on to Brineura for the treatment of CLN2, which contributed $14.8 million in the second quarter, we continue to see strong and diversified patient growth resulting in significant quarter-to-quarter revenue growth and we expect this growth will continue in the foreseeable future.Moving out activities related to the potential launch of valrox in 2020, the great strides preparing for entry into this very dynamic marketplace. We have been through some of these key areas in preparation, including engagement with peers, healthcare providers, and advocacy groups introducing BioMarin and valrox to the hemophilia community and providing opportunities for stakeholders to learn about gene therapy. We have built-out our commercial team to include seasoned industry leadership with direct experience in the hemophilia market. We are excited about the opportunity to answer new therapy option with the potential to change the way severe hemophilia A is treated.Thank you, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Hank. -- Thank you, Jeff. Following our positive valrox update in late May, we've met with global health authorities where we shared three years of bleeding control data from the Phase 2 study and a safety and efficacy results from planned Phase 3 interim analysis. We've announced on July 8, the outcome of those meetings in the U.S. and Europe to support our plans to submit marketing applications to both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European medicine agency in the fourth quarter of 2019 for valrox for adults with severe hemophilia A.Those submissions are expected to represent the first time a gene therapy product for any type of hemophilia will be reviewed for marketing authorization by health authorities. Based on the clinical progress with the 6e13 vg/kg dose, the safety results from Phase 2 201 and Phase 3 GENEr8-1 studies with the 6e13 dose and relatively low interest in the 4e13 dose, we announce today that we will see development of the 4e13 vg/kg dose of valrox.Our patients want the most efficacious dose of 6e13 vg/kg dose, so we made this decision with them in mind. The next update you can expect from the valrox program will be completion of the enrollment in the Phase 3 GENEr8-1 study in early Q4, followed by submission of our marketing applications to U.S. and new health authorities, potentially followed by an announcement of the U.S. PDUFA 40 and validation with the file in the European Union.Now that we will be in regulatory review, you should expect the next material data readout will be the 52-week annualized lead results for the 130 patients global Phase 3 study at the end of 2020 or at the earlier 2021. To remind you, generate 1 study is powered to demonstrate superiority over current standard of care perfect therapy. [Indecipherable] progress on our late stage program vosoritide for the treatment of achondroplasia.We are nearing the finish line with our global Phase 3 program and anticipate sharing results from that study at the end of this year and beginning of next year. The study has enrolled 110 children divided as two randomized groups. One placebo group and one treatment arm receiving 15 milligrams per kilo of vosoritide per day.To remind you, on the Phase 2 study, the mean change from baseline and annualized growth velocity or AGV for cohorts and 3 and 4 at six months was approximately 2 cm per year. The Phase 3 trial has been designed under the assumption that at least 1.75 cm for your change from baseline and meanings will be observed at one year or at vosoritide and that the placebo subjects will have no or slightly negative change in AGV.Under these assumptions, the Phase 3 301 trial enrolled the sufficient number of subjects to achieve 90% power to detect the statistically significant difference between the true-to-treatment arms for the primary endpoint. Needless to say, we look forward to the pending readout of the Phase 3 study and sharing these results with you.In our most recent study of vosoritide, 0 to 5-year-old patients, enrollment continues to go very well. The first cohort of 2-year to 5-year-olds has finished enrolling is in now cohort 2, 6 months to 2 years of age is enrolling. We expect cohort to complete enrolment my years end, at which time we will begin screening subjects for cohort 3 enrolment, which will include newborn newborns to 6-month-old.Enthusiasm from families continuous to be strong across vosoritide program, based on robust enrollment progress just described. We look forward to providing an update on the vosoritide program, as well as the BMN 307 implicated gene therapy at R&D day planned for November 14 in New York. And finally, as announced in our press release today, we have chosen to cease development of BMN 290 for the Friedreich's Ataxia.After my preclinical research and testing, we have determined this in the best interest of our R&D organization to put our resources toward products that have demonstrated a clear path forward. To take decisions very seriously, we will continue to take a disciplined approach when determining which portfolio assets align with our stage of growth and in the best interest of our shareholders and patients.Thank you for your continued support, and I'll now turn the call over to Dan for a review of the financials during the quarter. Dan? -- Thank you, J.J. Please refer to today's press release summarizing our financial results for full details on second quarter. I will highlight a few items in the quarter and full-year expectations. First, with respect to revenues, we reported total product revenues in the quarter of 388 million and remained on track for full-year of 2019 revenues of between 1.68 billion and 1.75 billion.We are currently talking to the middle of this range for the full-year. One revenue item of note this quarter that Jeff didn't already discuss was our Vimizim net product revenues for which we recorded $5.8 million of revenues in the quarter, an unusually low reported number.As discussed earlier in last year, under the new revenue recognition rules Aldurazyme net product revenue is now recognized based on timing of Genzyme acceptance of product shipments from us, and is now disconnected from underlying sales sort of products by Genzyme. Genzyme previously received, reviewed, and accepted products from us at a UK location, but is part of their aggressive plan they relocated the receipt location resulting in a processing delay last quarter.Approximately 23 million of Aldurazyme revenue that was shipped in the second quarter is now expected to be recognized in the third quarter. Total Aldurazyme revenues reported to us by Genzyme remains strong with 9% growth in the first six months of the year to 136 million from 125 million in the first six months last year, and consequently we continue to expect full-year total Aldurazyme revenues recorded by us to be consistent with prior years and in the $100 million to $120 millionAnother item of note in the quarter is a $15 million milestone payment in Pfizer figured by the European Medicines Agency approval of TALZENNA, formerly talazoparib. The payment is being accounted for a gain on the sale of an intangible asset in operating expenses. We are also entitled to up to 100 million in additional sales milestones, as well as mid-single digit royalties on sales of TALZENNA.Moving to operating expenses, both R&D and SG&A expenses remain consistent with our initially provided full-year guidance. For the second half of the year, we expect our R&D expenses to be similar to first half levels as they complete enrolment of additional payments in the global Phase 3 GENEr8-1 study in the children in 0 to 5-year study with vosoritide.SG&A expenses for the second half of the year also expected to be largely consistent with the first half where sales and marketing will expand slightly as we launched Palynziq in Europe and continue to prepare for valrox and vosoritide approvals of launch.Turning to bottom line results, GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $37 million as compared to a GAAP net loss of 17 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in GAAP net loss year-over-year was due to higher R&D expense for the expansion of all our late stage clinical programs, and higher marketing and sales expenses in support of the commercial launches of Palynziq and Brineura.We remain on track for a small GAAP loss of between 45 million and 85 million. We also measure our performance on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on EBITDA and excludes interest taxes depreciation and amortization, and also excludes stock compensation, contingent consideration, and certain other specific items.Our non-GAAP income in the second quarter was 17 million, compared to non-GAAP income of 20 million in the second quarter of last year. We remain on track for full-year non-GAAP income of between 130 million and 170 million. And we are currently tracking to the middle of that range.In terms of cash, cash equivalents and investments, as of June 30, 2019 we had 1.1 billion as compared to 1.2 billion at the end of the prior quarter. In the second quarter, we had an $83 million milestone payment, which was made to Merck for the EU approval of Palynziq.In closing. BioMarin's current commercial business remains on track to deliver roughly 1.7 billion of revenues this year and 2 billion next year with increasing non-GAAP bottom line profitability. Over the next 18 months, we also expect to accelerate into the next phase of higher revenue and bottom-line growth through potential approvals of valrox and vosoritide, which could lead to approvals in revenue contributions starting before the end of next year.Thanks for your support, and I will now open it to your questions. Operator?Question-and-Answer Session -- [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan. -- Hi guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask one on vosoritide and what you anticipate you're going to need to get to 0 to 5-year-old patients onto the label. So, assuming your pending Phase 3 and all the patients goes well, do you think the Phase 2 study in younger children will suffice for future supplemental regulatory submission or would you need to run Phase 3 studies for that to? And I just have one commercial follow-up. -- Hi Cory. Very much depends on the results of the pivotal trial and the data is available for review. Our game plan is that we have at least safety data from the first couple of cohorts, and it's obviously premature again on labeling discussion, but there is quite a bit of awareness in the genetics community of the importance of starting therapy earlier, and previously with our products, the potentially label restrictions that there are and it hasn't been really meaningful barriers to product use given the safety of the product in earlier population. So, stay tuned. -- Okay. And then just quick commercial follow-up just on the heels as some of the lumpy ordering patterns, which is really nothing new, but your level of confidence going forward these all corrected, it sounded based on your prepared remarks like you are very much confident, but in that you reiterated your guidance, just making sure there is no other underlying issues behind this lumpiness and things are on track for 2H? -- Highly confident Cory. Brazil has been unusually uneven the last couple of years and then in Brazil when we see publication of intent to purchase in the official gazette that has always been followed by the start of the purchase process and the purchase, which has now begun, but adding $95 million in purchases and intended to cover demand for the coming 12 months or through Q2 of 2020 gives us a high degree of confidence in that figure. Other markets are uneven too, but they tend to kind of balance each other out over time in a way that we're building capacity. -- Okay. Very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions. -- That's just a major, major reason why we're confident because as Jeff pointed out, we only recognize about $13 million of revenue from Brazil MOH in the first half of the year, but the other one is related to the sales dynamics behind Palynziq. Jeff pointed out that we now have between the patients on commercial Palynziq and the patients that have completed the enrolment to get started on commercial Palynziq over 700 patients now. And what happens is that some other [Indecipherable] 4 to 6 months for most of the patients to get to steady state maintenance regimen, which is the one that generates some significant revenues in around $200,000 per patient per year. And now, we're getting to our state where a lot of patients that we enrolled in Q4 of last year, Q1 of this year targeting their steady state and are going to start generating some pretty significant revenues for the balance of the year. This is just pure mathematical or mechanical, but you're going to see a significant increase in finding sales in the second half of this year and also next year of course. -- Alright. Very helpful. Thank you. -- And our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. -- Yes, hi. It's [Indecipherable] for Salveen. I have a question on a kind of pollution competitive landscape and were vosoritide fit in? Thank you. -- Vosoritide, well it fits in competitive landscape. The emerging competitive landscape and I guess with the Phase 3 data around the corner and I think our next nearest competitor has just announced plans to start a Phase 2 study, 12 patients per arm, doze ranging, so they are just getting started in their efficacy program having only completed a single dose healthy volunteer study. Earlier than that there is a [Indecipherable] program, a small molecule program. I think you saw highlights the importance of [Indecipherable] therapeutic target, but it also highlights just how far ahead we are of all the competitors. Maybe I will say that's where it is now. -- Got it. Thank you. Are there any plans for different dosing schedules for the drop? -- We are investigating through the life-cycle and in the present time we have some product improvement in our mind. The power ability of the product, the compliance with the product, it is really sort of outstanding. We are not really being driven to a better product offering. If anything, actually you think about central application [Indecipherable] for other indications, but obviously all of this is going to be informed by the results of our Phase 3 trial at the end of the year beginning in the next year. And that's a really important milestone in the whole achondroplasia in growth disorder landscape, because this will be the first pivotal trial to complete. And as I said before, we're years and years and years ahead of anybody else. -- Thank you very much. -- And our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. -- Hi, thanks. I have a couple of questions. So, first, I wanted to ask maybe, Hank, on vosoritide. So, Hank, I just want to make sure I understand some of the language you guys have had in the past on these hypotension events. I think when you guys first started talking about these events in 2017, you mentioned, I think, five events out of 23,000 injections. And then last year, when you were going through that, you -- I think, you were only talking about one event. So, can you maybe just talk were the prior four events just classified or was there some other sort of driver behind that? -- Chris, you got me there on that degree of specificity. And I think one of the most important things is whether it's 523,000 or 103,000, vanishingly low. I think off the top of my head, the difference was -- the difference between recorded [Indecipherable]. But honestly, I'd have to look back into that what's the five and the one. I don't think we're reporting anything differently without changing on this call. Any -- there's not any new information about the lack of hypotension with vosoritide. I think you accept the point essentially simply is, how rare it is to occur and how much we do not even believe that it's related to vosoritide therapy. -- Yes. Yes, yes, OK. Yes, it is vanishing. It is very small. I guess, I was just -- was curious and maybe they were reclassified as having an orthostatic hypotensive event or is there something like that. But -- yes, OK? -- Some specific language difference in that with [Indecipherable]. -- Okay. And then maybe a question for Jeff on Palynziq. I think last quarter, you said the discontinuation rate was closer to the 3%. You guys disclosed in the Q4 -- on the Q4 call. Can -- is that number still around that same number, or is it -- have you seen any change in that? Is there any variability maybe between clinics that you can tell us about? -- I don't think we quoted a figure, but we did say, it was materially lower than our experience in the clinical trial. We also said it's too early to conclude mission accomplished on that dimension, because so many patients are early in their course of therapy. But for sure, what we have experienced so far is materially less than the rate of discontinuation in the clinical trial. -- And we must consider taking this season trial, with this continuation was around 11%. -- Yes. I think you said it was closer to the 3% you gave than 11%. I didn't mean to characterize it as 3%, but -- -- Around 11%. -- Yes. -- And so far in the commercial and this is emerging data, it is around 5%. So, you definitely got more than single trial in the second quarter. And importantly, I can tell you what the rate of discontinuation to Palynziq was in the last quarter, zero. You heard that? -- I heard that. Wrote it down, too. Thank you. -- Our next question comes from the line of Martin Auster from Credit Suisse. -- Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. I've got a couple on valrox. So, I guess, first, I was interested if you've gained any additional insights into the small number of valrox patients that were reported on in the interim analysis that failed to kind of muster an efficacious response? Curious if you've been able to kind of divide anything from margin analysis, blending analysis of patients undergoing trial or anything like that? And then secondly, curious if you've got a sense for your preclinical programs, what percent of liver cells get transfused with valrox at the commercial dose that you're studying? And also wondering if you have any sense of kind of variability around percentage of liver cells transfused? Thanks. -- Additional insights about the transducers, not so much, pretty much as reported. But I also put the emphasis here on the phenomenal reduction in bleeding that occurred in the interim analysis cohort. And how important that was in driving our confidence and health authority's confidence, our confidence in driving toward the submission and their -- our confidence and their willingness to accept this submission. And really the -- those patients were not even very much of the subject of discussion. As regards to ongoing trial analysis, I think it's really important to pave right now an expectation that we will not be reporting results of the ongoing clinical trial. The next data readout will be the 52-week ABR and 130 patient prospective primary endpoint, Phase 3 clinical trial that we report. Everything else is immaterial relative to that.And then, in terms of preclinical studies on the percent of transduction and variability of transduction, off the top of my head with the dose that we use, the promoter that we use, you're getting a much higher proportion of liver transducers at lower doses. I want to say, the whole liver is transduced. Now, whether the whole liver expresses protein is a different story, they do appear to be zones in which there is more or less protein expression. So, there is some variability of protein expression and the preclinical studies that we've reported, which is not dissimilar, where -- which is similar to the variability of expression that we observe in human clinical trials. But taking all together and tuning back to the top of valrox, we're really thrilled that we hit the interim analysis to the tune that was going to satisfy health authorities for initial submission. And we're really thrilled with the durability of valrox three years down and counting, demonstrating both the huge, not just economic value at this point, the economics of valrox are so self-evident that it's not an easy story to tell. What shouldn't get lost, here is the value of patients and we've heard such transforming stories from patients about the impact that this has in their lives. I would be pleased to talk about that all day, every day.So, because we feel complex and people sometimes look, they lose the big picture. I just want to remind people that the Phase 2 and the Phase 3 trials, we're not comparing gene therapy to no treatment. We're not comparing gene therapy to placebo. We were comparing gene therapy to standard of care treatment, and we saw a dramatic reduction in leading antidote. -- Well, the standard of care of was withdrawn. -- So I mean, so we took set up here. We drew it -- gave off and this how we are reporting the results and the patients did better. This is somewhat different from other gene therapy products. -- Thanks for that reply. One quick follow-up. So, the question I was asking about the, maybe the percent of liver cells and the preclinical models that were transfused, that were expressing protein. Both wanted to understand better, what you know about what's going on with valrox, but also as potential read through for other gene therapy programs you might be using with AV5, for example, the PKU program, just to get a sense of how kind of diffuse throughout the liver, you're getting transduction and then protein expression? Thanks for the color you provided. Is there's anything further from that, would be great to know to? -- There's a lot of learning from valrox to PKU gene therapy program. We'll go into this a little bit more detail at our R&D Day. But the short version is that, we won't really know what effective dose in humans is until we get to human clinical trials, and we know what the amount of liver transaction is influenced by the amount of dosing you give. So, a lot of this is TVD. -- Okay. Thank you. -- And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison. from Morgan Stanley. -- Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess two from me. So, first, I guess the one question is, on the few patients in the interim analysis for valrox, where you weren't able to report whether or not that the 40% threshold or not, do you think you'll report on them, or when might you report on them? And then the second question is, Jeff, can you just sort of comment for us around how we should think about the roll out of Palynziq in Europe in terms of -- what contributions we might see this year versus next year, and if there will be any patients transitioning from clinical supply to commercial supply? -- So, on the first question, additional reporting on the [Indecipherable] interim analysis, we're in the process of writing up a manuscript for journal submission, and I think that will dictate a lot about what and how it gets reported. And I'd say, stay tuned. As I said, there are not going to be any further data updates until the 52-week data on 130 patients with perspective endpoint of bleeding. So, for the most part, information that's to be had is out there. And I don't expect that publication will meaningfully change what's been in the public domain. We've obviously crawled through the data to patient-by-patient level and so are the health authorities and we provided expectation details to the health authorities already. And so far, the conclusions remain as we represented them that setting them as predefined interim analysis criteria adequate for regulatory filing, engages us tremendous amount of investigator interest in patients' interest in participating the studies and gives us kind of a sufficient enrollment in the federal clinical trial. And as J.J. mentioned just a second ago, gives us a huge amount of confidence that we're going to win when it comes to superiority against prophylactic standard of care when that standard of care is withdrawn. -- I mean, normal activity level that is bleeding? -- Yes. It's interesting that in general, bleeding was lower with no rare exceptions. And actually, one of the exceptions was somebody who's factory levels just the connection was a little bit slower in an individual set and their prophylactic we tried it before and they didn't get drug levels into a therapeutic [Indecipherable] when you can see a few weeks later. And so that's why they had a little bit more bleeding on, which actually validates the point that J.J. was making about some amazing resulting withdraw standard of care and in spite of that people stopped bleeding. So, the amalgam of the picture, both at the individual patient level, as well as the total group level is that [Indecipherable] effect on bleeding in patients who have withdrawn, prophylactic therapy. And like I said, that's been driving a lot of the interest at the patient level, the physician level and at the regulatory level. -- Okay. And over Matt your question about valrox in Europe -- OK, but I'm anxious. Okay, how is [Indecipherable] Europe and maybe I do a little compare and contrast. In the United States, we had really a running start. We had number -- a number of our best clinics that were experienced and founded through the clinical trial program. We had a material number of patients that we were able to transition pretty rapidly from a maintenance dose in the clinical trial to commercial maintenance dose to immediately grow revenue. We have the ability to get really rapid reimbursement approvals on a patient-by-patient basis in the United States and, in fact, that's what we've experienced. And then we have what we've described accurately as a slow start for patients when they begin the induction titration process roughly a quarter before they begin generating meaningful revenue. And then once they do, the evidence so far is they are pretty compliant and very persistent with therapy. So, that has resulted in the quarter-to-quarter step up in revenues. But I'm just thrilled about and the arithmetic on that if they follow $12 million to $19 million last quarter to this quarter, that kind of rate continues into the future and we're getting into big revenue numbers pretty quickly. In Europe, we've got a different situation. We don't have that running starts. We don't have clinical trial patients to transition. We don't have clinics that are experienced with R&D. And we have, as you know, pretty slow reimbursement processes to navigate before we can start commercial sales.That said, there are some really positive things going on in Europe because it needs to be really bearish about the prospects starting next year. One of which is, there's just a larger adult PKU patient population in Europe, and they are relatively well-managed in centralized centers of care relative to the fragmentation of patients in the United States. So, is why we're guiding the say, it will start seeing material revenues in Europe next year? We've got a lot of work to do to get through reimbursement processes to get sites trained, experienced with their first patients, first patients to get through induction titration before they start generating material revenue. I'd say, look, for Europe to start showing up materially next year and then being a growth driver for Palynziq early in the following years as we look to tap into that bigger patient population. -- Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz from SVB Leerink. -- Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could update us on your plans to study a higher dose and/or propylax with corticosteroids in order to optimize responsiveness to valrox. Previously, it sounded like you wanted to start this kind of a study before valrox approval, but now it seems like you'll likely wait until after? -- I don't know -- hi, Joe. I don't know that we've given any kind of granularity about the start time. So, I think the interest would be to have the data soon available after launching, I mean, I think it as opposed to approval optimization. But when the study starts, I don't think we've given really clear feedback about. And I think the other thing about that is that, I think it's great that we're getting a head start on product optimization, let's not lose track of product introduction as the next year is key milestone. And walking around at ISTH and -- but it is the cynics and whatnot, who are talking about, wow, what a profound effect this has. And wow, you guys are really out there in terms of the commitment you've made to the manufacturing capability, the fact that we could have certainly about the product going forward. We don't have to worry about are you going to change the recipe or the results going to change from here on out, impressive stories about the impact of lead reduction, the impact of just eliminating factor considerations from people replacing factor, considerations in our lives. It's really -- it was really a great team to be at and a key reminder of the big picture about valrox. Patients are having their lives transformed and we're just excited as we could be to bring that product to patients. We're always aspired to do better. Sure. But for -- in the first instance, the immediate goal is valrox is available as quickly as we can on a global basis. -- Great. Thank you. -- Sure. -- And our next question comes from the line of Akash Tewari of Wolfe Research. -- Hi, guys, thanks so much for the question. Can you walk us through your statistical assumptions for your Phase 3 valrox trial in order to show superiority over prophylactic factor therapy? I know [Indecipherable] showed an ABR reduction of about 4.8 to 1.5. And given your Phase 3 data, do you remain confident you'd be able to hit that? And how important is that kind of commercially? And then on vosoritide, there were about 20% of patients who had antidrug antibodies at the end of the dose fighting trial. Did you notice any reduce efficacy in those patients? And was there any correlation between the percent of these ADAs and treatment duration? Thanks so much. -- So valrox -- I should say, with 130 subjects overall has the power to detect a reduction in bleedings from up top of my head, I want to say, 3.5 ABR's to 1.5 ABRs, both of those numbers are relatively conservative in the following sense. As you correctly pointed out, the control arm raises in the high force. And they showed actually -- when they presented their [Indecipherable] data, they showed range of studies that were in the upper threes, fours, and low-fives, giving us a lot of confidence that, that 3.5 actually conservative is resulting conservative estimate in the -- is a high bar in terms of prophylaxis. And bleeding rate 1.5 on valrox, as you know out to your three in our 201 study, I believe it's 0.7, it's very low in the first six months of treatment in the interim analysis cohort. So, I walk away from this with confidence that we have every bit of 90% power that we plan to have, if not better. -- Got it. And could you just talk about vosoritide? -- Yes. Could you repeat that question, again? I was thinking about the answer to the first question when you were asking the second question. -- Yes, no worries. So just -- we noticed that there were about 20% of patients who had ADAs at the end of the dose finding trial. We just wanted to know if there was any reduced efficacy in the subset of those patients? And was there any correlation between the patients who develop these ADAs and overall treatment duration? Thanks. -- Yes. No correlation between the presence of antidrug, antibodies and clinical outcomes. And fairly consistent with that, what we observed across all our programs, you develop antibodies with Vimizim, Naglazyme, Aldurazyme and the dose that you give is higher than the antibodies to bleed in. And it's very difficult to demonstrate clinical significance of the antidrug, antibody there, obviously the [Indecipherable] etcetera, to the induction severity, induction reactions to [Indecipherable]. But in general, with vosoritide, together with vosoritide, no correlation of antidrug, antibodies in adverse outcomes. -- That's super helpful. Thank you so much. -- Yes. -- Any our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer from Evercore. -- Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a few quick ones on valrox. First, what is the gating stuff for the VLA filings? Second, do you expect not just approve, but also commercial launch prior to the Phase 3 data generation? And then third, how many patients were enrolled in the low-dose cohort? And when do you expect to report results from that study since its being terminated? -- Hi, Josh, good to hear from you. And I should mention that we're going to organize a little bit of follow-up on some of the vosoritide type things for you, because we want to make sure that you have the most correct information on vosoritide. But to get to your question on the VLA, it's mainly about writing the final reports. Believe it or not, in spite of the facts, there are mainly two studies going in. There are actually a fair number of reports that -- from preclinical my shop, Robert's got a ton of reports to write up in terms of validation and PPQ campaign results and stability. So, it's just a lot of reports to write. And that's what we're busy in the process of -- and the agencies are pretty specific about what they want to see in those reports. They want them all stand final feel validated. And that undertakes a fair amount of quality control to make sure that the results are the accurate, reliable, verifiable that we're inspection ready, etcetera. So, and we've been down this road many, many, many times before and a lot recently because there were lot of inspections, GOP inspections, PD inspections, GMP inspections. So, we want to make sure those reports are ticked and tied, so that the inspectors should come out and see what they've seen before, which is not. And, Jeff, do you want to comment on? -- I think the question was, what about commercial launch timing relative to the completion of the Phase 3 and presumably data available? -- Yes. So, it's too early to kind of PDUFA date. But submitting in the fourth quarter kind of implies, if it's a priority review in the U.S. sort of in the third quarter, early fourth quarter kind of an application review the data from the ongoing 301 study will -- the last patient out will be a year from the last patient in, because 52-week study last patient in will be, as we said on the call, early fourth quarter. So, the last patient out will be in the early fourth quarter of 2020, which is likely to be around or just after the PDUFA date in the U.S. and essentially even in the EMA Action Day in Europe depending on process and the data readout will be after that. So, the data will be available from the -- the bleeding data will be available from that portion of the studies shortly after our initial product launch. -- Okay. And number of patients enrolled in the liver's cohort [Indecipherable]? -- Negligible low and probably won't even get reported separately except as a formal update to health authority and no practical consequences at this stage. Nobody's interested in that study that does. It's just for people who can deliver higher doses. -- And our next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis. -- Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. This is Nate on for Paul Maybe just one on Palynziq. How -- you mentioned taking like a quarter to see meaningful revenue from patients? How variable is that titration protocol been across clinics to get on to maintenance dosing? And then are you seeing maybe repeat clinics to get faster as they gain experience of Palynziq? -- Great question. The experience to date with a pretty big body of new to treat the patients is that the patients are adhering very closely to the titration schedule in the label. There are some patients that go a little slower than the label step-up, which we've anticipated, because we know in our guiding clinicians to say, look, if you see reactions slowdown, you'll get there eventually, not very much evidence of patients are going faster. So, remarkably close to the label schedule for that. -- Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe quick one on the achondroplasia Phase 3. Just back of the envelope math, it seems like that powering, that 90% powering, maybe it's conservative? Are you thinking there's going to be a step-up in variability just based on the expanded age criteria or somebody else? -- Well, our statisticians like the people at the deli counter, they add a little bit on their side. And yes, it is a little conservative, because the growth rate that we have observed in the first year after vosoritide was probably a little bit north of what the target for powering is. And the other thing you should understand is that the target for powering, which I was -- in my comments, I said, it was 1.75 centimeters. If you actually observe 1.75 centimeters, your P value wouldn't be .05, it'd be .001. So, a different thing to talk about, let's say, the critical threshold for significance, and that's much lower than 1.75. So, we have a lot of insurance linked to ours -- physicians built in. And intrinsically, there's a lot of insurance from the fact that patients are serving as their own control. We have that running period that people might have forgotten about that. But we ran in patients through a perspective observational period. So that we change -- we compare the individuals change from their own individual-based on ADP to a post-treatment and then sum that across all the drug group and compare that with some across all the placebo group. So, the study was [Indecipherable] robust design in always. -- Really helpful. Thanks for taking the questions. -- Yes. -- And our next question comes from the line of [Indecipherable] from Cowen and Company -- Hi there, and thank you for taking my questions. The first one on Palynziq? I guess, are you seeing patients that are currently on Kuvan that do not want to switch over to Palynziq, and maybe what's the reason behind that? Are they happy with their current therapy, or want to see more safety follow-up data, or what are you hearing from that? And then second, on maybe more of a broader picture question. What are your thoughts behind additional investment in gene therapy versus other treatment modalities? And maybe how does BD fit into that? -- Okay. I'll take the first question about Kuvan patience and Palynziq. There is substantial data of Kuvan patients transitioning to Palynziq. So, fully 37% of our naive patients were referrals or active Kuvan patients that are choosing to switch over to Palynziq. And there is another body of patients that have previously trialed and not been successful on Kuvan that are choosing the sort of Palynziq. So, the evidence would be that patients that are in -- adult patients that are in clinic are highly motivated to switch over to Palynziq. What we have not done yet is gone out to survey the market and learned the attitudes and reasons why patients that are on Kuvan haven't trialed Palynziq are waiting. We'll do that, but I don't have data on that question yet. -- If I may elaborate on this, we don't have the exact answers to your question. Again, I think as we gather more and more experience with R&D if it is going to become [Indecipherable] powerful this product is and how much it is transforming the lives of the patients, which actually could even figure through the adult [Indecipherable] for R&D as more and more experiences gathers. Because again for the nine months experience with the driving on the market, we keenly have very small percent of these configurations, 5% versus 10% in the trials, most of them unrelated to actually side effects. We have patients like freely impressed with the impact of the drug on their [Indecipherable]. So, I think the product is doing [Indecipherable] anything we anticipate as in this respect and so it looks like it is behind us as we report over 700 patients already on commercial product or ready to go at the end of June, obviously since then we have included more patients and it is going very, very well for the growth of the product in the U.S. and down the road in the rest of the world. And you asked a question on additional roxaparvovec gene therapy -- -- [Indecipherable] come to R&D they first of all -- we have our sites that if not our next IND or probably our next two or three INDs, so we're feeling really good about pre-clinical pipeline and especially if you are really good about pivot to medium and their team have done just a fantastic job of putting the pedal to the metal. We look at things all the time and we have done since we have last looked into some smaller earlier safety. We like these earlier stage things, like -- thinks like valrox, for example, [Indecipherable] forgets, we licensed our preclinical asset in 2013 or new in clinical trials in 2015 started in 2017 will be filing for global approval in 2019. So, while we talk about them as early with the molecular specificity in the BioMarin track record, we can motor through those things. So, there are a few early stage license that were pretty higher feedback, you know if we had our reasons ready to talk about, what we will be able to talk about or some gene therapy ideas and non-gene therapy ideas and we have some really, really happy times for early pipeline of BioMarin. Looking forward to sharing more details. -- Great. Thank you. And congrats on the progress. -- In the interest of team on the schedule, that concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to the BioMarin, Chairman and CEO, J.J. Bienaime. -- Thank you, operator, and thank you for participating on our call today. So, as you just heard the coming 18 months, we'll open up many new opportunities for the company, which we expect to drive significant growth beyond our existing commercial business. And as far as you can expand and accelerate in two new markets, we will pursue [Indecipherable] valrox followed by the same path forward with vosoritide should the data be supported. Our manufacturing capabilities give us an important edge across our product pipeline, including gene therapy and we intend to leverage our gene therapy and expertise to rapidly develop our next gene therapy product BMN 307 for PKU. Taking together, finally a thought for significant commercial expansion over the next quarters and we are preparing for success. Thank you for your continuous support and we hope to see you at R&D day in November.

A handful of different gene therapies that help hemophilia patients produce the clotting factor they need to avoid uncontrolled bleeding events are making their way toward commercialization.

Welcome to , the show that dives into a different sector of the stock market every single day. Today is Wednesday, July the 10th, and we're talking healthcare. I'm your host, Shannon Jones. I am joined once again by all-around good guy healthcare guru, Todd Campbell. Todd, we missed you. The people missed you. So glad to have you back on the show. It's great to be back. I love to do hands-on research. I figure I might as well go get this crazy eye surgery and see what this eye surgery is all about, see if there's any stock investing tips. Unfortunately, no, there weren't. [laughs] [laughs] No stock ideas? It was all for naught, Todd! It was all for naught! Well, I don't know, I do have a lens from now sewn into the back of my eyes, so maybe I should be paying more attention to them. [laughs] Well, so glad to have you back, especially for this week, because we've got a lot to catch up on. First and foremost, we're going to be going into some news that came out of the marijuana industry and also giving some updates in the gene therapy space as it relates to hemophilia. So glad to have you back on the show, Todd.Let's kick things off with the news heard round the marijuana world. Really can't underscore just how big of a development came out of Canopy Growth on July the 3rd. This was the half day of trading right before the stock market was closed on July the 4th, by the way -- [laughs] Don't you love how they do that? I love how they do that. I was literally driving in the car on the way to North Carolina, and my phone started going off. And I was like, \"You've got to be kidding me, no way.\" But the news heard around the world is that Bruce Linton, co-CEO, is no longer CEO of Canopy Growth. Todd, there's a lot more to this story than meets the eye. Probably one of the more fascinating developments that I've seen. Really unexpected for a lot of people that have been following this space.Truly surprising, but maybe as we dive deeper into the story, we'll realize that we shouldn't be as surprised, perhaps, that this has happened. I think what made it so surprising is that Linton was one of the more vocal and successful advocates for the legalization of marijuana and the creation of marijuana markets and the mainstreaming, if you will, of legalization and it as a business opportunity that should be considered by investors. He was vocal, he was at the forefront, and he took a very small, fledgling company, Canopy Growth, operating out of a very small, old chocolate factory, and turned it into the biggest publicly traded marijuana stock on the planet, and the largest in terms of sales of the marijuana growers. A very successful entrepreneur. Like you said, surprising and interesting.Shannon, we'll dive right into it. Why? [laughs] Why did they get rid of Linton, right? If I'm just raving about how he was so important to the industry and such a pioneer, why would they get rid of him? And I think that when you dig into the story, you realize that a lot of it has to come from this cutting-edge deal he made with which of course is the beer, wine, and spirits giant behind Svedka vodka and Corona, Corona Light, and Corona Extra, and the way that changed once that deal got put in place, the makeup of the board of directors, and ostensibly shifted the goals of this company, from where it was before as an emerging marijuana company to where it could be in the future as a maturing marijuana company.What was interesting to me about this -- you mentioned Constellation. Of course, they gained four, I think, of the seven board seats with the $4 billion deal that was made. They now have the potential to own more than 50% of the company moving forward if you include the Warrens. So really, a lot of the control went over to Constellation Brands because of that deal. Bruce Linton was really the key player that brought this deal into play. And now, it's Constellation that ultimately gave him the boot. Of course, Bruce Linton, he's a pretty aggressive player. I think if you're any of the other major Canadian producers, you probably got the news and you're thinking, \"Thank goodness this guy is out because he's killing us.\" But at the same time, you mentioned how passionate he was about the industry, being an advocate. Canopy Growth is the bellwether of the entire industry right now because of Bruce Linton and his work and with him being the face of the industry.They did have a bad quarter, which we'll get into in a second. But I think for a lot of investors that have been watching this space, having someone like Bruce Linton on your side, really driving and moving and trying to expand globally, certainly a good thing. I think for Constellation, though, I know there was a question that was thrown out to the Constellation Brands CEO about, is this a financial issue, is this a more strategic issue? He seemed to back away from it being a financial issue. I've got some question marks on that because they came off of a bad quarter, Todd.Very, very bad quarter. And what is the corporate line? The Constellation CEO is not going to go on there and say, \"He was horrible! We had to get rid of him because we were losing money left and right!\" He's not going to say that. You think about boilerplate, just look at the press release announcing that Linton was gone. \"He's stepping aside.\" \"He's stepping down.\" The terminology... [laughs] [laughs] \"Stepping down.\" I mean, it's kind of disingenuous when you see that, because it makes you think as an investor, \"He's choosing to spend more time with his family,\" or, \"He's obviously been foot on the gas for four years, and now he just wants to ease back, he still owns a truckload of shares so he'll still end up benefiting from Canopy Growth in the future.\" So, it's a little misleading to investors to say, \"step down.\" And I think Linton didn't like that. He went on to CNBC that morning, and said, \"Hey, just to be clear, I'm not stepping down. I was terminated.\" If you get chance, listeners, go and watch that interview. It was a very intriguing interview. He struck a very realistic tone, a very mature tone for someone who's built this baby up into this crazy successful company, and has now been asked to say, \"Bye!\" I don't even know if they actually said anything in the press release about him serving as a consultant, which oftentimes, when you're easing somebody out, you do. I don't think I saw any mention of that.He said on the interview, quote-unquote, here, \"I really think, at the end of the day, sometimes entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs because they're not super employable. And I would say I probably don't have a resume because I like creating businesses and driving them. You don't always mesh well with everyone in the playpen. And I think probably, what they're doing will probably be a better decision.\" I mean, that's a very realistic tone. It's a logical tone. And granted, however millions of shares he has, he doesn't want the stock to tumble on his exit. But I think what he's saying there is, \"Yeah, I'm a foot-on-the-gas entrepreneur. You need to be that way at the start of a company, to build the company in to something that can take a leadership position.\" But the skill set that an entrepreneur like Linton brings to the table isn't necessarily the same skill set that you need to take the company to that next level as you're looking to expand out of Canada into a much larger playpen. Now you're talking global operations, European operations, moving into the U.S.So, I think there's that component to it. And, then, in the back of your mind, like you said, it wasn't the financials, says the CEO of Constellation Brands, but he was obviously not happy about the fact that he took a $0.20 hit to his earnings last quarter because of that $174 million operating loss that Canopy Growth reported in the quarter, which was a massive, massive loss. And that loss was punctuated, because right at the end of the quarter, there was some, I guess you could say scrutiny related to the massive amount of share-based compensation that was paid out. I think it was about a third of the losses that they saw in that particular quarter. That was more than many of the major ones -- you're talking about , ,  combined, just in terms of share-based compensation. Bruce Linton was very much of the opinion, \"I'm going to pay my employees 1.5 times their salary in shares to make sure they're aligned with the business.\" He even came out and said, \"If I hadn't done that, the losses would have been even wider.\" And this was before he was terminated.I think what you'll see with Constellation Brands, what I suspect will happen, they'll bring in someone with some industry experience, probably on the consumer packaged goods side, someone that is experienced in management, to help take Canopy from start-up to mature, growing global company, as you mentioned. It'll be very telling in who they bring in. Right now, co-CEO Mark Zekulin is serving as the interim CEO, but they have said that they are starting a search to look for a new CEO.Bruce Linton, on the other hand, I watched that CNBC interview. He was asked, \"What are you going to do now?\" I would not be surprised if he started a new company. He said he's not going to be doing it in Canada. But if he started a new company in the U.S. to get ahead of U.S. legalization, of the shares that he still owns with Canopy, I think it's 18 million shares right now, of those shares, he said he's going to be holding on at least until the U.S. legalizes marijuana here. So he's pretty bullish about that happening. I could easily see him back up on the scene sooner rather than later in the U.S. with a brand new company. What's really fascinating, Shannon -- I know you're going to figure out where I'm going with this -- to me in that conversation is, someone actually had the nerve to say, \"So, what do you think as far as investments?\" [laughs] \"Now that you're not affiliated with Canopy Growth anymore, what do you think are savvy buys? Here you are, the ultimate industry insider.\" And he said, unsurprisingly, Canopy Growth. He owns a ton of it, he's not going to say, \"Yeah, sell it all!\" He also mentioned , which is the U.S. investment arm of Canopy Growth that was spun out. And then he mentioned , which could be the very biggest takeaway for all of our listeners here at The Motley Fool. Take very close look at OrganiGram. If someone like Bruce Linton is saying, \"This is one of the best operators out there,\" and you want to try and have a diversified portfolio of marijuana stocks across a few different of these players, maybe OrganiGram is one to think about adding to a portfolio alongside Canopy Growth.Shannon, this news took the market by surprise. Shares are trading at a discount, probably 20% off the high, $40 a share now on Canopy Growth. So, theoretically, you could buy Canopy Growth on sale, you could buy OrganiGram on sale.Yeah, I think that's a very smart play. OrganiGram right now, one of the most efficient operators in the Canadian space. They've really cornered a particular section of the market in Canada as well. That was a huge takeaway coming out of that interview.I think there's going to be so much, we'll have to wait and see what happens with Canopy Growth moving forward. I do think you'll have a very different company that's not going to be as aggressive without Bruce Linton behind the helm. But ultimately, I'm really curious to see where Bruce Linton ends up next. We'll be sure to keep all of our listeners up to date as soon as we find out.But with that, let's shift gears. Let's talk about gene therapy, Todd. We got some news coming out of the ISTH conference, also known as the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Congress in Australia. Specifically, we got key updates in the race to get a gene therapy to market for hemophilia.Todd, before we dive into the updates, though, can we give everybody a brief overview of what hemophilia actually is?You have hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Both of those diseases are characterized by an inability to produce a particular clotting factor. In the case of hemophilia A, it's clotting factor 8. In hemophilia B, it's clotting factor 9. There are about 300,000 hemophilia A patients in the world. About half of those have severe or moderate disease, so 150,000 require significant intervention, usually in the form of prophylactic infusions of that missing factor 8. There are about 30,000 hemophilia B patients. Most of those patients do require some amount of infusions.The real risk to these patients is that left untreated, if they cut themselves, they fall, they have a break, they start bleeding, their blood can't clot. It's obviously a very emergent situation, if they have to have surgery, all of these things come into play. So, the goal -- over the past decade or so, there's been some pretty big advances -- the goal has been, let's figure out better ways to improve quality of life by allowing patients to have fewer infusions of these missing clotting factors. But because those infusions have to happen so often, Shannon, it's a very expensive disease, and it's prime, as a result, to be disrupted by a gene therapy.I want to say that you're talking about a half a million dollars for some of these drugs per year. If you have a situation that's emergent, then you can easily surpass a million in these indications. So the ability to come up with a one-and-done-type gene therapy that restores natively, in vivo, the production of those factors is, it's potentially a huge advance for payers, for patients, for the entire system. It's so encouraging to see and to hear about updates from multiple companies going after these one-and-done type of treatments. Granted, there's some questions about how durable the responses for some of these treatments right now being studied. But just to know that we're at a place where potentially, a patient could have a one-and-done gene therapy is just tremendous.Let's dive in with the first company, , that's ticker symbol SGMO. They're partnered with . A bit behind the competition, in terms of where they're at in their clinical trials. But they did give some updates in the conference related to their Phase I-II trial. Todd, what did we see there? Sangamo has been such a battle ground stock. I'm sure investors who are listening have very strong opinions on both the bull side and the bear side of this. I guess we'll try and keep it to just the facts of what we're seeing within this gene therapy and the update that they provided at the conference.They've just started dosing a few of these patients with their SP-525 for severe hemophilia A, so that's the larger of the two patient populations that we were talking about. We're trying to restore factor 8 production in these patients. Two patients that were treated at the 3e13 dose. I'm just going to say 3e13 dose. They achieved normal sustained factor 8 production levels, that's great, with no reporting bleeding events, and no need for factor infusions after 24 weeks following that dose. Two additional patients have also been treated. They're showing comparable results so far to those first two patients. So the idea here is, SP-525 restores what's considered to be normal production, and potentially eliminating or significantly reducing average bleed. So it certainly puts it in contention, but as you said, a little further behind another industry player that had some interesting data as well. Yeah. Still early. And this is just, for many of these companies, a very small subset of patients that we're looking at. But looking at the dosing plus lack of bleeding events, it does seem promising, particularly at 24 weeks. And now that Pfizer has former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb on its board, [laughs] I'd say prospects look even more promising for Sangamo right now, too. Yeah, that's a great point. The addition of Gottlieb to the board did spark a lot of interest in saying, \"What does this mean? Could Sangamo eventually be an acquisition target of Pfizer?\" I don't know. It's too early to say that. You have to get way further into the trials and test more people, and get multiyear data, at least a year's worth of data before you can draw those conclusions. If you look at  ,who put out data at the conference as well, they were able to provide information all the way out to three years postdosing.So, like you mentioned earlier in the program, you said durability is an issue. And with gene therapies, that's part of the pricing structure. We know we're going to save you a half a million dollars a year on the prophylactic treatments, so how do we price that drug? Do we price it at three years' worth of treatments and say, \"Okay, give us $1.5 million\"? Or do we say, \"If you're going to live 30 years... \" How do you price that? And I think it's going to come down to durability, like we saw with  when they launched their drug. They said, \"We're going to charge $1.8 million, but we'll spread it over X number of years, as long as the drug is working.\" Maybe we'll see a similar thing with these gene therapies in hemophilia, where they say, \"As long as it's working, you keep paying us over a certain period of time some big number.\" This is a $5 billion market, so there's a lot of money up for grabs for these companies.And BioMarin, they're likely to be the first to market, Shannon. Yeah, they're likely to be the first to market with their lead drug, valrox, also for hemophilia A. We talked about this on the show, I believe back in May, Todd. You and I broke down what we're seeing. But as you mentioned, even in May, it was a mixed bag of results because there were some questions about durability. Pretty impressive response rates, but just how durable were those response rates? So, for a lot of these companies, you talked about pricing becoming a factor of durability. When you look at the landscape in the field, when you add in more competition with similar efficacy, it is going to be about durability, and that's going to further put pressure on pricing moving forward, too. So, to see a company like BioMarin, ticker symbol BMRN, ahead of the field, likely to be the first, you do have to be very, very mindful of the durable response effect that we're seeing. Yeah. What BioMarin said is, they will file for FDA and EU approval of valrox in the fourth quarter of this year, which means that you could get a decision, if they expedite it, as soon as June or July. It depends on the timing, obviously, for when they file it. Six to 10 months after that is when you get the FDA to weigh in on it. In seven patients, 86% were bleed free for three years. To me, that's pretty impressive. Even though you're showing lower levels of factor expression in these patients, general thinking among clinicians is that if you're expressing at 12% or so, then you're fine, you're probably not going to need a lot of infusions to stop the tremendous risk for bleeds.So, let's watch the duration. They're going to file at the end of the year. If they win approval, potential to significantly capture a lot of this money. We'll also have to see, we didn't get an update from Spark Therapeutics, which is being acquired by They also have a hemophilia A gene therapy that's put up similar results so far. So, this is a horse race. You've got a few different players. Each of their viral vectors, the way they engineer them, are a little bit different. It'll be interesting, too, Shannon to see whether or not, can you follow one of these up with another one? Let's say the durability wanes, and you're no longer paying for this BioMarin drug. And Sangamo's comes to market. Well, can we try Sangamo's in these patients? So, there could be room for multiple players. Totally agree, could be room for multiple players. That brings us to our third company update. That is  , QURE. A bit of a bumpy road for this gene therapy player over the years. For our listeners who are not aware, this was actually the company that created and launched the first gene therapy, Glybera, back in 2012. But due to some commercial issues -- mainly that $1 million price tag that was on it -- it never really got off the ground. But uniQure has come back around, is focused on hemophilia. They've got a couple of other programs, too, but hemophilia is really where they are targeting their lead product AMT-061. That's their next gen. And then they've got AMT-060 that they're building off of. What did we see in terms of results there, Todd? This one is actually for hemophilia B. The other two were updates for hemophilia A. This is hemophilia B, so a smaller patient population. Like I said, about 30,000 people that could theoretically benefit from it. They updated the Phase IIB trial. Three patients. They achieved factor 9 activity of 45% average at the 36-week mark. Again, above 12%, probably a pretty good result. As a result, there were no bleeding events, there was no need for infusion in any of these patients. That's great. That's what you would want to see. Gold star on that.They also updated Phase I/II for that prior-generation drug, the AMT-060, and showed that over the past 12 months, from baseline, there had been an 83% reduction in bleeding events. Obviously, you've got patients responding to that first gen. The idea is that 061, the second gen, will be better, and maybe improve upon that, maybe get that into the 90% range. We have to wait and see.There's a Phase III trial that started enrolling patients earlier this year of 061. So, we're going to want, as investors, to keep an eye out for any interim data that gets released sometime in the next 12 months from that trial. That will be our best clue for whether or not uniQure is in great shape here in that indication.It doesn't have it all alone, though, because Spark Therapeutics is also -- again, being acquired by Roche -- developing its own hemophilia B gene therapy as well.This company also made headlines, I believe it was in June, for potential buyout rumors. Apparently, the company was exploring a sale. Earlier this year, with Roche and Spark announcing their acquisition, I think it brought renewed focus into this space. A lot of analysts believing that this is the next company to be acquired by one of the major biopharma players that is looking to beef up its gene therapy plays. We'll have to wait and see there. Of course, I mentioned they've got trials for Huntington's disease that they've started and congestive heart failure as well. So, yeah, a lot to look at here. It'll be really interesting to watch. In a sidebar, too, because we were talking about the acquisition, and you're starting to say, hey, what's going to happen from here, probably going to want to take a look at some of these other players that are marketing the prophylactic infusion medications at this point. Again, $5 billion. These companies do not want to give that up. So they are probably the ones who are going to be most eager to step in and buy these smaller clinical-stage companies.Great point. A lot to look forward to, a lot to keep our listeners up to date on. Again, if you take a step back, it's amazing to see how far we've come with gene therapy, especially in hemophilia. Really exciting 2020 up ahead.But for you and I, Todd, that'll do it for this week's . I want to thank all of our listeners for tuning in.

That mismatch is presenting investors a great opportunity to get in.So which stocks should investors buy today? We asked a team of Motley Fool contributors to weigh in and they picked\u00a0 ,  , and the \u00a0.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.The biotech industry is filled with minefields. First, there's the research and development, . Then, assuming the company successfully comes up with a decent prospect for a product, it has to make it through a long and costly testing and approval process before it can sell its wares.Even once those hurdles are passed, pharmaceutical manufacturing is one of the most tightly controlled and heavily regulated industries out there. It takes incredible know-how and substantial investment to manufacturer medications to standards once they're approved. Companies that are focused on research and discovery often find that they aren't well set up to manufacture, so outsourcing the manufacturing process is often an attractive alternative to doing it on their own.That's where Cambrex shines. A partner capable of helping other biotech companies bring their products to market, Cambrex can win when any of its partners wins. That makes it less exposed to the \"feast or famine\" nature of the biotech industry as a whole. As a result, Cambrex sits in a fairly unique position of being well-positioned to participate in the ultimate success of the overall biotech industry, even without blockbusters of its own.From an investor's perspective, Cambrex currently trades at around 20 times its trailing earnings, and those earnings are expected to increase by around 15% annualized over the next five years. While not a screaming bargain, it does look like a reasonable price to pay today to have a decent shot of participating in the potential biotech revolution to come. Picking winners and losers in biotech can be exceptionally hard. At the same time, it can be a mistake to ignore the sector altogether. What to do?One simple solution is to buy an ETF that offers broad exposure to the sector. My favorite is the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF.This ETF currently owns 119 biotech stocks of all different sizes. This includes a range of companies, from enormous biotechs like and  all the way down to small caps. One big reason why this ETF stands apart from others is that it uses an equal-weight strategy. That means the ETF invests the exact same amount of capital into each of its components. The ETF then rebalances itself each quarter. Following this strategy helps to prevent a single holding from becoming too big, and it gives investors exposure to small caps that hold enormous upside potential.This ETF has the numbers to prove that its formula works very well over the long term. data by .What's more, this fund's expense ratio is just 0.35%, so it isn't expensive.The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF offers investors easy access to a growing sector and a long history of outperformance, all for a modest price. That makes it a great addition to any portfolio.As we officially enter election season (despite it being 16 months away), we move toward a period of great uncertainty for healthcare companies, and more specifically, drugmakers. Early debates suggest that Democrats will make drug-price reform a priority, which is a worry for most drug developers. However, that isn't the case for BioMarin Pharmaceutical.What separates BioMarin from the bulk of its biotech peers is the fact that it's . These are therapies that traditionally have limited patient pools but often have little trouble gaining reimbursement from private insurers. Aside from being able to justify large price tags and modest price inflation over time, rare-disease therapies don't typically face much competition, meaning there's plenty of runway for BioMarin to succeed with its six revenue-producing drugs.In BioMarin's most recent quarterly report, nearly every one of its approved therapies was headed in the right direction. Newly launched Palynziq, a treatment for a genetic disease known as phenylketonuria, delivered $12.3 million in sales in the first quarter and is expected to generate up to $100 million in full-year sales in 2019. Meanwhile, established therapies like Vimizim, Kuvan, and Naglazyme generated year-over-year sales growth of 7%, 8%, and 16%, respectively, with patient growth playing a key role.\u00a0This is a company that's also on the precipice of turning the corner to profitability. Sales growth has been averaging close to 15% a year with its existing line of products but  if severe hemophilia A experimental therapy valoctocogene roxaparvovec is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. With sales projected to nearly double between 2018 and 2022, and BioMarin having a real shot at up to $3 in full-year earnings per share by 2022, it looks to be an intriguing bargain here.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There's   a fast-growing tech company serving the pharmaceutical industry.\u00a0\u00a0, a pharmaceutical company with a unique niche and still-solid growth expectations, is currently a little too unloved on Wall Street. And beaten-down\u00a0 , a boring industrial company, has been experiencing a slowdown in growth due to outside factors that don't actually change the company's long-term growth story. Take some time to get to know this trio, and it's highly likely you'll find one worth adding to your portfolio this month.I've been covering Veeva Systems -- the  company that's building the cloud for the pharmaceutical industry -- ever since it went public in 2013. I thought I had a handle on how fast the company could grow, and when it would reach the understandable limits of that growth.After reviewing the , I have to admit I was wrong: Veeva continues to impress with blockbuster growth. But unlike much of its SaaS brethren, earnings are growing\u00a0than sales right now.Image source: Getty ImagesThat's because Veeva has spent the better part of the past five years building out its Veeva Vault suite, which helps a pharmaceutical company do everything necessary to bring a drug to market. Currently, there are 17 tools in Vault, and that count will likely grow.\u00a0But over the longer time frame, two additional catalysts make me believe Veeva is an excellent buy at today's prices: the growing demand for Veeva solutions outside of life sciences, and the release of Veeva Nitro -- a warehouse database for drug companies. And all of these services are protected by very high switching costs away from Veeva's software in highly regulated industries.Combine these forces -- the popularity of Vault, the potential outside of pharmaceuticals, the release of Nitro, and a wide moat -- and I think Veeva deserves a spot on the list of best growth stocks for June.BioMarin, a mid-cap rare disease specialist, is worth checking out this month for a couple of reasons. First, the biotech's shares have fallen off a cliff over the last 12 months for all the wrong reasons.Like most publicly traded biopharmas, BioMarin has seen its valuation come under immense pressure from the prescription-drug pricing debate in the United States. BioMarin's products target exceedingly rare conditions, so the company has a solid reason for charging a premium for its medicines, but the market doesn't seem to care about the rationale. At some point, though, this \"man with a hammer\" phenomenon will fade, allowing orphan drugmakers like BioMarin to get back to business as usual from a valuation standpoint.\u00a0The biotech's\u00a0shares also took a big hit last month following the \u00a0readout for the experimental hemophilia A treatment\u00a0valoctocogene roxaparvovec, or Valrox for short.\u00a0While Valrox's pivotal data suggests that it could be a game-changer for this rare bleeding disorder, Wall Street was apparently expecting absolute perfection. During the same clinical update, BioMarin released data from an earlier-stage study that seems to imply that Valrox's benefits begin to fade at around the two-year mark.\u00a0That's not a deal-breaker from a regulatory standpoint by any stretch, but investors were clearly hoping Valrox would turn out to be a so-called \"one and done\" therapy. Regardless, the therapy's late-stage data appears to be compelling enough to get a green-light from regulators next year, potentially giving the company yet another major growth driver.\u00a0Another key reason to consider buying BioMarin's stock this month is the fact that the company sports one of the fastest-growing top lines in the industry. Wall Street's forecast calls for BioMarin's top line to jump by 14% each year for the next two years. That's a stellar growth rate for a company with a nearly $15 billion market cap.\u00a0\u00a0Bottom line: BioMarin's shares should eventually break out of this malaise to resume their winning ways. Long-term investors, in turn, might want to consider adding this top growth stock to their portfolio soon.\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing on Wall Street goes in a straight line. That said, nobody likes to see a fast-growing company quickly decelerate. Which is what's happened to water heater maker A.O. Smith. Investors have sent the shares down by roughly 40% since early 2018, with the company projecting just 4% earnings growth in 2019 after 20% growth in 2018 and high-teens growth the two years before that.\u00a0  data by But the long-term story is still pretty strong. A.O. Smith makes water heaters, a given in developed markets (about 65% of sales), but a luxury that everyone wants in developing markets like China and India (combined, about 35% of sales). In China, the company has expanded sales at a 19% annualized clip over the past decade using the same game plan it is now starting to put into play in India. A.O. Smith expects its target market to more than double in India by 2030. China, meanwhile, continues to offer a solid opportunity as more residents move up the socioeconomic ladder (and buy hot water heaters) and the company expands into air and water purification -- other things developed markets take for granted.\u00a0 The problem is that China's growth is slowing, a fact complicated by, and intertwined with, the . But remember: Nothing goes in a straight line on Wall Street. Ups and downs don't change the long-term desire for A.O. Smith's products. With a strong , there's no reason to think that the current headwind will be anything but temporary on this company's long-term growth path.

Today is Wednesday, May the 29th, and we're talking . I'm your host, Shannon Jones, and I am joined via Skype by healthcare guru Todd Campbell. Todd, how's it going?\u00a0Oh, it's going great, and I am just really, really excited to talk about some incredibly innovative, disruptive new medicines that could become available. I love these topics and I love doing these shows exactly for this reason.\u00a0I am so on point with you, Todd. Preparing for this show for this week, I always love coming on week after week, but for me, when we talk about innovation, when we talk about really pushing the needle and driving better health outcomes, I get super excited. So I've been waiting days to talk about this. For our listeners, today's show is really all about the field of gene therapy. First, we're going to be diving into what is right now the most expensive drug soon to come out on the market. It was approved last week. We're also going to be talking about BioMarin's updates on their potential game changer for hemophilia. We're going to be diving into all of that, but let's kick things off with Novartis.\u00a0There's been a lot of buzz here, Todd, and a lot of splashy, somewhat controversial headlines around Novartis, ticker NVS, and their gene therapy drug Zolgensma. Try saying that 10 times. This is a drug, one-and-done therapy, that truly has the potential to change lives. Todd, we've been talking about this drug on the show before. You pointed this out last Friday when the approval came through that this is not only a game changer for Novartis, for another company we've been talking about, , but truly a huge win for patients. What can you tell us about this drug and what this means?\u00a0Right, and we've talked about this indication a few times, too, because, as we get knee-deep into this conversation, I'm sure we're going to talk about another drug that's on the market already that got launched in 2016. What we're talking about with Zolgensma is a gene therapy that's now approved for use in an indication called spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA. It's approved for use in patients who are younger than 2 years old. One of the things that everybody who's following this story should understand is that SMA is a deadly disease. It's the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. It's characterized by an inability to produce a particular protein that's critical to the survival of motor neurons. Unable to produce that protein, these infants lose the ability to breathe on their own, they can't eat on their own. Ninety percent, sadly, of the patients with the most severe type, type one, are either on permanent ventilation by age 2, or sadly pass away. So there's a major need for new approaches to this.\u00a0Zolgensma, which just won FDA approval last week, is game changing because it's a one-and-done therapy. It uses an inactivated viral vector that was developed by Regenxbio, which as you mentioned, we've talked about on the show before, to deliver a functional copy of the gene responsible for producing the protein that they can't produce on their own. In trials, Shannon, the results are...I'll just call them remarkable. Remarkable.\u00a0This particular drug is truly a landmark. It's only the second gene therapy ever approved for a genetic disease. This is really pushing the needle in terms of just innovation. These are truly sick patients here. Many of these children don't survive past their second birthday. So the need has been huge. But I won't say this is the only treatment out there. and have a drug on the market called Spinraza. Spinraza is not a one-and-done treatment. Spinraza essentially was approved in late 2016, has been treated in over 7,500 patients with severe and milder forms of SMA. So they do have a slightly broader label. They can treat anywhere from the sickest, which are the type one patients that you mentioned, Todd, all the way up to adults who have milder forms of the disease, and had a more gradual progression of the disease as well. But Spinraza also comes with a high price tag. You're talking about spinal infusions that cost $750,000 in the first year, and then $375,000 annually thereafter. So, for a lot of reasons, Novartis and their drug with AveXis is not only one and done, but really also has the convenience factor, and even though it wasn't a head-to-head trial, potentially a drug that could prove to be even more efficacious than what's out there.\u00a0Right. The approval was based on data from two trials: an ongoing trial and an early stage trial. As of March 2019, 19 of the 21 patients who were enrolled in their STRIVE clinical trial were alive and not requiring permanent ventilation. Thirteen of those patients had reached the age of 14 months. Also, 10 of those patients were able to sit without support for at least 30 seconds at an average of 12 months. That's something that, Novartis, when it was talking about just how important this approval is for these patients, they said that wouldn't happen in this patient group, they just would not be able to sit on their own for that long of a period of time. They also said that only about 25% of the patients who met the criteria to be enrolled in STRIVE would even be expected to live beyond the 14th month mark. They also reminded investors of another trial called START in which 15 patients were enrolled. Twelve of those were enrolled in the highest dose cohort, the one that was approved. And at 24 months, all 12 of those patients were alive and not requiring permanent ventilation. That is just, again, remarkable for this indication.\u00a0We've been talking all around this, Shannon, for the five minutes we've been chatting -- talking about the price. We already mentioned this is a drug on the market, marketed by Ionis and Biogen, that's pretty expensive, $750,000 for the first year, in which four injections are given, and $375,000 in the remaining years thereafter, three injections per year. This drug, Novartis has priced at $2.125 million per patient. One of the things you're seeing in the media is, that's the focus. That's the clickbait-y headline that everybody's running with -- $2 million gene therapy. But we have to remember, too, that the way that Novartis has priced this drug, Shannon, is they're allowing payers to pay for the drug over five years. On average, that's $425,000 a year. If you add that up and then compare it to Spinraza, it's actually cheaper.\u00a0And not only cheaper, but Novartis has come out and said that because it's a one-time treatment, it actually costs 50% less than the 10-year cost of current chronic management of the disease itself. You even have ICER, which is the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, they evaluate drug prices, they are actually backing the pricing of this drug, too. They came out earlier this year, said the drug was worth up to about $1.5 million, and they estimated that a reasonable price would be between $1.2 million to $2.1 million based on their estimate of quality-of-life years. So for them, they're saying this falls right in the range of what they're looking at. So not only do you have Novartis trying to work with insurers to make sure access is there for patients, but you also have ICER coming back and backing the price of this, too.\u00a0Yeah, and that's important, because what it's really going to come down to is, OK, you have this drug. Theoretically, this can be life-changing for these infants. If you're a parent, you're going to want your infant to have this. Spinraza, not to knock it, it's a great drug, but in the trials that backed up its approval, it only worked in about 40% of patients. Again, not a head-to-head trial. But on the surface, having a one-and-done therapy rather than one that requires multiple injections per year is very attractive. They're working with payers, trying to figure out, OK, we'll do this five-year pricing plan. There may be some ensures\u00a0that get value pricing, where as long as it's working within those patients, they'll continue to pay for that five-year period. They're still ironing out all those details. But they do expect to make this product available within two weeks. Following this approval, that's a really rapid amount of availability. That'll be great, obviously, for Novartis' top line theoretically, because Spinraza's sales in the first quarter were over $500 million. It has a $2 billion revenue run rate. So if Zolgensma can win away a lot of market share, and I think it can, then this could be a significant drug for Novartis, and also for Regenxbio, because Regenxbio can collect royalties and milestones.\u00a0That's right. Really, for shareholders of Novartis, they're hoping to recoup some of that $8.7 billion that the company spent to buy and acquire AveXis last spring. And really, with the way the pricing is built out for this drug, and with the addressable market, it doesn't sound like it'll take long to recoup those costs. Certainly a blockbuster drug on their hands, for sure. But yes, for Regenxbio, super, super excited to see them get validation of their platform. Again, they are building out a technology platform for a lot of these viral vectors, a lot of these companies that are developing treatments for cell and gene therapies to move forward. So if it's not on your watch list, you should put it there, that's ticker symbol RGNX for Regenxbio as well.But with that, let's switch gears, let's talk about the other name in the headlines as well. And that is none other than BioMarin, ticker BMRN. Investors have been waiting pretty anxiously for new updates on their gene therapy drug for hemophilia (valoctocogene roxaparvovec). We'll just call it ValRox for short here, Todd.\u00a0 Thank you! Thank you! [laughs]\u00a0You're welcome! So, we got updates yesterday, actually multiple updates. Todd, it was a bit of a mixed bag of results. Left some investors scratching their heads. What did you make of\u00a0it?\u00a0 We're going to get into the nitty-gritty of that in a minute. I think that this, actually, this gene therapy is potentially more important to the healthcare system than the one we were just talking about in the earlier segment because this is a larger patient population. Hemophilia A, these patients don't produce a protein clotting factor VIII that's necessary for coagulation; as a result, they're at risk for life-threatening bleeds, and these bleeds can happen a lot for patients with the severe form of it. It's not a huge patient population, but it's big. Over 100,000 patients have hemophilia A, and it's a $10 billion treatment market right now. So, a one-and-done gene therapy in this indication could theoretically be even more important because it impacts more people and theoretically could save payers a lot of money by changing or disrupting the current treatment paradigm.\u00a0BioMarin's ValRox is the drug that they're evaluating. They have a Phase I/II trial that is continuing and ongoing. And they have a Phase III trial. And they released information from both of those trials. The Phase III data is the one that arguably was more of a mixed bag. A lot of people looked at the durability of this gene therapy and were wondering how long really will it benefit patients. We'll get to the data in a second. The Phase III study results were actually interim results. Those results were good enough that BioMarin now plans on filing for FDA approval of ValRox at some point soon. They're going to give us an update on the exact timing in the third quarter. But they did say on their conference call that they think it's possible to have ValRox approved in the EU and the U.S. in the third quarter of 2020.\u00a0Essentially, Shannon, what ValRox does is, it restores, it delivers a gene necessary to produce the missing clotting factor, restoring coagulation for these patients, thereby preventing the need for them to have regular prophylactic infusions of factor VIII. That's huge, because factor VIII infusions, prophylactic, run between $200,000 and $300,000 a year.\u00a0 Extremely expensive. I'm so glad that you brought up that point, because yes, this drug does have the potential to truly transform and change the healthcare landscape just because of how expensive it is to treat this condition. But really, what it comes down to is, ValRox is enabling patients to make their own factor VIII so they don't have to keep using this\u00a0expensive drugs to treat the disease. I think with the data that came out this week, bleeds, of course, and controlling bleeds, is one thing, and I think for patients and for physicians, obviously that's the outcome that they want. But for investors, for even practitioners, the question mark, I think, for the data that was released is really about the durability of response. What we saw for the first three-year Phase II update, No. 1, it came out before they were anticipating it. I don't think they were anticipating releasing that until June. So we got it early, which was great. But it was the durability of response here, Todd, that I think just has more question marks than answers right now.\u00a0Right. The Phase III that they're going to use to file for approval showed at weeks 23 through 26 a 96% reduction in average annualized bleeds. So, the average patient went from 16 events at baseline annualized per year to less than one event. That is huge. I think that is very important to recognize. You're talking about better than 90% reductions in bleed rates and significant reductions in the need for these prophylactic infusions. Like you said, investors actually knocked down BioMarin on this news because they looked at that three-year data on the Phase I/II and said, \"Yeah, but we're noticing a decline in the activity of factor VIII. What does that mean? Does that mean that over time it will continue to decline, production will decline, and these patients will end up needing to go back on prophylactic therapy?\" I mean, I suppose it's possible. If you look at that Phase I/II data, the three-year update, on average, the average patient, the activity was 64 international units per deciliter at the end of the first year -- 64. Remember that number, 64. At the end of two years, it had dropped to 36. At the end of three years, it had dropped on average to 34. I think patients are looking at that decline and saying, \"Whoa, we've gone from 64 at year one to 34 right now. What does that mean?\" And I think, Shannon, the thing that we need to remind everybody is that clinicians call hemophilia severe when patients are producing one international unit per deciliter. One. When you get above five, five to 40, that's considered mild disease, and less likely to be at risk for spontaneous bleeds.\u00a0So, if you're an investor, and you're looking at this data, I think the things to focus on are, ideally, a gene therapy that can produce at 40 would be great, because mild ranges from 5 to 40. But anything above 5, you're basically taking someone who is categorized as severe and requiring prophylaxis and turning them into a mild patient that may not require prophylaxis.\u00a0And ultimately, with particularly the Phase III, data management is really focusing on controlling bleeds. They were able to meet the threshold for submitting for approval for what the regulators wanted to see. So while the data are mixed, I think ultimately, this is approvable data moving forward.\u00a0Because the shares fell 5% or 6% off the news, I think another knock is just keeping in mind the competition. You've got , soon to be acquired by . You've got with their preclinical hemophilia A program. also has a drug with a potential to show longer durability. I think while the data are good, there are still some overall question marks, because ultimately, if this field gets crowded, and you see that the bleeds are controlled pretty comparably among all the competition, I think it will come down to durability of response. Management is saying that with factor VIII levels, it looks like they're starting to plateau. Ultimately, they think durability, at minimum, could be about eight years, which is still pretty good, to your point, Todd. I mean, these are patients who have had very little other options to choose from. So I think overall, it's headed in the right direction. There'll just be some question marks around competition.\u00a0Yeah. If you look at the cost, again, going back to the cost of prophylaxis, it's going to run you between $200,000 and $300,000. If you have a severe bleeding event, you can absolutely see the cost per patient climb above $1 million for a patient in any given year. But let's ignore that, let's just look at the $200,000 to $300,000. Multiply by that eight, that's $1.6 million plus in potential value, that then, you would have to figure out what the price is. And I think that's what a lot of investors are looking at. They're like, OK, if this is a lifetime fix, they could get away with charging anything -- $3 million, $4 million, $5 million per patient. But if it's not as durable, maybe they're only going to be able to price it at $1 million or something like that. We simply don't know. It's too early to even have that conversation.I think that what we need to recognize is that from a patient perspective, and from a doctor treating a patient perspective, it's really all about the bleeds. As long as you're producing enough factor VIII so that you're not at risk of those spontaneous bleeds, I think that you're going to find that patients and doctors are happy, and are going to be more than willing to use it. And I think you're going to find that payers are going to be more than willing to pay for it. You mentioned you've got Spark out there with SPK-8011. You've got Sangamo out there with SB-525. You've got all of these others who are also working on gene therapy.\u00a0As we saw with hepatitis C, if all of these drugs do come to market -- let's just assume, because there have been questions about durability with Spark's and some of these others, but let's assume that they all have this durability problem. Eventually, you'll get to a point where prices will be driven down because there's multiple players in the market. We're still pretty far away from that. I think that BioMarin, the fact that they're already an existing company, a proven company, $1.7 billion in estimated revenue coming this year already from their existing rare disease drugs, I think this is a very, very important advance and an important potential drug for this company. And frankly, I think that investors may regret selling shares yesterday.\u00a0All right, Todd, you're putting it out there. We're going to hold you to it. [laughs]\u00a0Yeah, I'm going out on a limb. And, before we jump, one more thing, too. Think about how important this market has been. Roche acquired Spark, which you mentioned. That was a $5 billion deal. Spark, they have one drug on the market that does a couple million dollars in sales. In 2018, you have\u00a0acquire Bioverativ. That was an $11.6 billion deal, and it was done when Bioverativ's sales were only about $1 billion. And in 2016, you had buy Baxalta for $32 billion when its sales were about $6 billion, of which half came from hemophilia. So I think this is a very attractive market. I'm not saying the BioMarin's going to get acquired --You're saying there's a chance there, Todd. [laughs]\u00a0I'm saying there's a chance. I'm saying there's a significant interest in this space, and that this is a disruptive medicine that we shouldn't ignore as investors.\u00a0Yeah, very, very well said. We'll be sure to keep all of our listeners up to date on all the latest as this continues to play out. But that'll do it for this week's  show.

For Todd Campbell, I'm Shannon Jones, thanks for listening and Fool on!\u00a0The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["emophilia A patients are at risk of spontaneous bleeds because they lack clotting\u00a0factor VIII, a protein necessary for coagulation. Since uncontrolled bleeding is life-threatening, nearly half of the 150,000 patients with this genetic disorder receive prophylactic infusions of factor VIII every week. The cost of these infusions can easily exceed $200,000 per year, and since the life expectancy for children with hemophilia A is normal, lifetime spending is well into the millions of dollars.\u00a0Clearly, there's a lot of room for improvement in terms of quality of life and costs.One solution could be  that deliver functional genes to these patients,  and possibly eliminating or significantly reducing the need for infusions. Although gene therapies for hemophilia aren't available yet, the latest results from a phase 3 study of s  valoctocogene roxaparvovec, or ValRox, suggest they're on the way.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.On May 28, BioMarin revealed interim phase 3 data for a subset of patients who received a single\u00a06e13 vg/kg dose of ValRox. At the April 30 cut-off for data analysis, seven of 16 study people who had reached week 26 had achieved factor VIII activity levels at or above 40\u00a0international units per deciliter (IU/dL). Overall, the\u00a0mean factor VIII level in these 16 patients was 36 IU/dL and the median was 33 IU/dL from week 23 to week 26.Importantly, the estimated median and average bleed rates for all 16 patients eligible for data collection was zero and 1.5, respectively, an 85% improvement from baseline bleed rates at the time of trial enrollment. The median and average annualized use of factor VIII fell 84% and 94%, respectively, for these patients.ValRox performance within this subgroup has BioMarin targeting a filing for accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval soon. An update of its timing for such a filing is expected next quarter.The data suggests ValRox could be a game-changer. Severe hemophiliacs factor VIII activity is typically less than one IU/dL, and clinicians typically view factor VIII activity of 12 IU/dL as the level at which bleeding risk is limited. Levels between 5 IU/dL and 40 IU/dL are characterized as \"mild\" hemophilia that's unlikely to result in spontaneous bleeds.\u00a0The ideal goal for a gene therapy for severe hemophilia would be maintaining levels above 40 IU/dL. However, levels above 12 could still be considered significant. Levels of 5 could also be viewed as a win since they would transform severe cases into mild cases less likely to need prophylactic infusions.By those measures, ValRox is a success.\u00a0However, the big question is if ValRox benefits will prove long-lasting. That question intensified today when management also updated results from patients participating in its phase 1/2 study. At the three-year mark, factor VIII\u00a0levels of these patients were an average and median of 32.7 IU/dL and 19.9 IU/dl, respectively. In May 2018, the average and median were\u00a036.4 IU/dL and 26.2 IU/dL, respectively, at the two-year mark. The drop-off is one big reason BioMarin's share price slipped despite the phase 3 results and plans to file for approval.Image source: Getty Images.Probably not.The phase 1/2 data still show levels remain in line with mild cases and that bleeds remain well controlled at the three-year mark. Specifically, the median annualized bleed rate was zero and the average annualized bleed rate was only 0.7 in year three. That was good enough for management to say that \"more conservative statistical modeling anticipates that bleeding control will be maintained for at least eight years after gene transfer.\"Since bleed risk and the need of prophylactic treatment are where the rubber meets the road for patients, doctors, and insurers, ValRox's ability to control bleeding for years will likely be viewed by all three as a remarkable advance.\u00a0Of course, BioMarin needs to win FDA approval before ValRox can be widely available, and there's no guarantee that the FDA will green-light it. Nevertheless, I think ValRox is likely to make its way through the FDA gantlet based on this data.

(Symbol: BMRN) saw new options begin trading today, for the September 20th expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 109 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the BMRN options chain for the new September 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.00.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $76.00 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of BMRN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $82.61/share today.\n\nBecause the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.00% return on the cash commitment, or 16.74% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., and highlighting in green where the $80.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of BMRN stock at the current price level of $82.61/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.82% if the stock gets called away at the September 20th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BMRN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing BMRN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.93% boost of extra return to the investor, or 19.86% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 42%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 40%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $82.61) to be 34%.

Hosting the conference call today from BioMarin is Traci McCarty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Traci. -- Thank you, Mary. To remind you, this non-confidential presentation contains forward-looking statements about the business prospects of BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., including expectations regarding BioMarin's financial performance, commercial products and potential future products in different areas of therapeutic research and development. Results may differ materially depending on the progress of BioMarin's product programs, actions of regulatory authorities, availability of capital, future actions in the pharmaceutical market and developments by competitors. And those factors detailed in BioMarin's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission such as 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K reports.On the call from BioMarin's management team today are J.J. Bienaime, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Hank Fuchs, President, Worldwide Research and Development; Dan Spiegelman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Ajer, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Robert Baffi, Executive Vice President of Technical Operations.Please note based on feedback from our last quarterly call, and out of respect for your time, we request that questions not be repetitive during the Q&A portion of the call, so we can try to get to everyone. Bear with us as we try to keep the call to an hour in length. If we do not get your questions, please send me an email or give me a call, and I'll get right back to you. Thank you for your understanding.Now I'd like to turn the call over to BioMarin's Chairman and CEO, J.J. Bienaime. -- Thank you, Traci. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today on the call. We are pleased that BioMarin marketed products grew 15% year-over-year, contributing to solid topline results of $400 million in the first quarter. We begin 2019 with many important product catalysts on the horizon, beginning with our seventh commercial product, Palynziq, for adult with PKU. Palynziq received an early positive CHMP opinion during the first quarter, and very likely will result in a corrective action from the European Commission in the second quarter of this year, this quarter basically.The pace of the US Palynziq launch continues to be very strong, having grown our commercial base of patients to 414 patients at the end of the first quarter. Recall that we were 252 Palynziq at the end of the fourth quarter 2018, that's a 60% increase in Q1 over Q4 of last year. So we are very pleased with the expansion of the US market.Importantly, (inaudible) continues to progress and even more importantly, our adult PKU patients have been highly motivated to work through the titration phase in order to achieve maintenance dosing and optimal efficacy with Palynziq. Actually, we are also hearing from patients that Palynziq is actually life changing therapy for them and it's changing their lives for the better. On the heels of this success, Jeff and his team are preparing for a potential European launch later this year.Moving now to Brineura. As we said last quarter, we have treated the subset of patients from the Phase 3 that could support accelerated approval. We are also on track to complete enrollment of the entire Phase 3 study for full (ph) approval in the third quarter of this year.Feedback from patients, physicians and payers has been extremely positive based on the potential transformational characteristics of gene therapy treatment for people living with severe hemophilia A. As we advance the valrox program and get closer to key data readouts, and a decision whether or not to pursue a potential accelerated approval pathway, excitement is continuing to build across the hemophilia community and here at BioMarin.I want to acknowledge the truly groundbreaking work that's being accomplished by our teams in R&D across our clinical organization and in technical operations, who are literally making history in the field of the hemophilia and gene therapy. We are really proud to be again at the forefront of developing an emerging therapeutic modality and we look forward to the next valrox milestones with great anticipation.Turning briefly to vosoritide. We completed an enrollment of the 52-week treatment arm of the Phase 3 trial last year and the results are just around the corner at the end of this year. Hank will provide an update on the global program of vosoritide in a moment. Needless to say, we are very excited to be in the final development stages with vosoritide, which, if approved, could potentially address the needs of nearly 25,000 children with achondroplasia in our current commercial territories.As we anticipate our potential growth trajectory over the coming one to three years, vosoritide are -- and valrox are front and center. These opportunities combined represent over 50,000 patients across our commercial footprints. The potential for one or both of these products to transform BioMarin is exciting to contemplate as we near completion of both global development programs.Turning to the financial outlook today based on current approved products. We are on track to deliver approximately $1.7 billion in revenues this year and $2 billion in 2020 before a potential contribution from valrox or vosoritide.Now, I would like to turn the call over to Hank to provide an update on our development programs. Hank? -- Thank you, J.J. First for Palynziq Europe, we announced on March 1st that the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the Company's marketing authorization application for Palynziq. Importantly, the CHMP noted in their press release that with continued long-term treatment, patients psychiatric and cognitive symptoms improved. We look forward to learning the outcome of the European Commission opinions later this quarter and to making Palynziq available to European, PKU patients shortly after approval.Moving to vosoritide, all of the studies currently under way across our global development program are progressing smoothly. Our most recently open study with children, newborn to five years of age, is enrolling very rapidly as families have shown a high level of interest in the treatment. Cohort 1, which includes children 24 to 60 months of age, will complete enrolling this year. Cohort 2, which includes patients six to 24 months of age, has enrolled in the four sentinel subjects and will also complete enrolling this year, followed by enrollment of the youngest participants in Cohort 3, children up to six months of age.As stated, the FDA Advisory Committee Meeting on achondroplasia last spring, there is strong support for starting treatment early in life because it may afford the most dramatic benefit for children with achondroplasia. We look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress, especially as we look toward our Phase 3 data readout later this year and we also want to thank the many families who have chosen to participate in our study.Turning to valrox and as J.J. said the subset of patients from Phase 3 study, whose results could support an accelerated approval, have all been treated with valrox. In addition, the three manufacturing campaigns required for the expedited filing have now completed and are in the process of being analyzed for inclusion in our CMC package.Ahead of our valrox updates over the coming months, I want to reiterate how we intend to communicate new information. As we have said previously, we have a comprehensive data access plan in place, which precludes everyone on the BioMarin management team for previewing (ph) any valrox data. We all remain completely (inaudible) valrox data including a Phase 2 data.We've not seen Phase 2 valrox data since our two-year update at the World Federation of Hemophilia last May. Once we are invited to see the Phase 3 -- Phase 2 three year data, we will put together a publication -- a public communication that provides a topline update on Factor VIII levels, determined both by the one-stage and the chromogenic assay, annualized bleed rate and Factor VIII usage at year three. As we have indicated, we will provide as much granularity as possible in the topline update without front running a potential late breaker presentation at ISTH should we be grant one.Deadline for submitting the late breaker abstract is June 7. So you should expect that topline communication before that time. After that and assuming we have a late breaker at ISTH, we will provide another Phase 2 three-year public communication that reflects any additional information that is included in the late breaking presentation that wasn't already communicated. We understand that there is a high level of interest and a very detailed topline update, so we'll do our very best to provide that for you without jeopardizing the integrity of the potential late breaker.The next meaningful communication regarding valrox will be our decision on whether or not to pursue an accelerated approval pathway in the United States. That decision will be provided before the end of the year and will be based on quote checking off unquote the following components, including number one a pre-specified number or (inaudible) subjects from the subset of the Phase 3 patients need to achieve at least 40 IU per deciliter at 23 weeks.Two, the manufacturing campaigns demonstrating similarity or comparability across all lots, including the filing -- in the CMC filing package. Three, data from the Phase 2 study demonstrating continued safety and durability, but no statistical threshold has been assigned to this component. And four, data that describes the discrepancy between the one-stage and the chromogenic assays will be supplied as part of the BLA package.So to summarize, you should expect a topline Phase 2 three-year update by the time of the late breaker ISTH submission deadline on June 7. Should we get a late breaker, you should expect the more granular data update that reflects ISTH presentation on the day that's presented in Australia. And finally, you should expect to learn of our decision on whether or not to pursue an accelerated approval path forward by the end of the year based on the components just outlined. We're all very excited about what is to come over the next few weeks, months and quarters and like you, we look forward to seeing the valrox data when it becomes available.And finally turning to other developments in the R&D organisation expected later this year. We are in the final stages of preparing the IND filing of our phenylketonuria gene therapy product, BMN 307. Recall the pre-clinical data we shared in January based on experiments conducted in the ENU2 mouse model, which we use for Palynziq and which is close to the human PKU phenotype.We demonstrated that within two weeks, Phe levels were normalized with BMN 307 treatment out to 80 weeks, well beyond the expected lifespan of the untreated in ENU2 mouse. We look forward to putting this product in the clinic and to leveraging our valrox manufacturing experience to initiate clinical studies with commercial scale material.In summary, we are extremely pleased with the productivity coming out of the worldwide research and development organization. We've learned so much over the past years on how to best focus our development programs, to enable rapid and effective drug development in BioMarin and anticipate continuing flow of new development candidates from our research organization.As we prepare for the highly anticipated valrox and vosoritide data readouts, my team and I are more inspired than ever to continue our good work for the benefit of patients with rare disorders. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff who will review the commercial business in more detail.Jeff? -- Thank you, Hank. As we begin 2019, I'm very pleased with the team's performance across all brands and all regions. In the first quarter, net product revenue contributions from BioMarin's marketed brands grew 15% year-over-year. Total revenues totaled $400 million in the quarter and then included contributions from Aldurazyme and other revenues. Starting with Palynziq, as we move past the initial launch phase in the US, we're very pleased with the performance and trajectory of this launch. The team is principally focused on managing patients through the continuum from enrollment to first injection, followed by titration, the phase that the majority of patients are still working through. Notably, we finished Q1 with over 600 enrollments, representing 15% of the in-clinic adult population. So very strong results less than a year since receiving approval in the US.Starting with commercial reimbursed patients. As of the end of the first quarter, we had a total of 414 patients on reimbursed Palynziq. Of those 136 transitioned from our clinical studies and 278 are formerly naive to Palynziq. At quarter end, there were an additional 140 naive patients with complete enrollment and pending shipment of their first injection. Very nice pipeline of new patients.Our efforts to convert adult Kuvan patients, who might benefit from additional Phe lowering from Palynziq have been quite successful. Only 37% of new Palynziq enrollments are Kuvan patient conversions. The team is doing a tremendous job, leveraging our deep experience on relationships in the PKU community to promote the availability of Palynziq treatment in the US. We can now confirm that there were 89 unique clinics of the 125 PKU clinics in the United States that had at least one complete enrollment.Considering the time required to titrate a typical naive patient to daily dosing, Q1 results are tracking to plan. Palynziq net product revenues were $12.3 million in the first quarter of 2019. Now based on the number of patients, who began treatment with Palynziq last year, we expect an increasing number of patients to be achieving maintenance dosing, and those patients will be driving revenue to PPACA in the next quarters of 2019.In summary, we are past the initial launch phase, commercial uptake is going according to plan and we now turn our focus to execution in the US for the remainder of the year.Turning now to other product revenues in the quarter starting with Vimizim. Vimizim contributed $125.8 million in the first quarter, representing 7% year-over-year growth, benefiting from sales increases across all regions. Net patient growth was 12% year-over-year. For Naglazyme, revenues totaled $86.9 million. This represented a 16% year-over-year growth for the well-established brand, coupled with 6% patient growth. As with Vimizim, the difference between patient and revenue growth are largely due to order timing. Next, for Kuvan, we saw an 8% increase in net product revenues. In the United States, as anticipated, we experienced the seasonal decline in Q1 due to insurance plan changes as well as Palynziq conversions. Year-over-year net product revenue increased to $106.9 million, keeping the brand on track to achieve fiscal year guidance in 2019.And finally, Brineura contributed $12.2 million in net product revenues, which was relatively flat over Q4 due to uneven order timer -- order patterns late in Q4. Importantly, Q1 saw growth and diversification in patients with the addition of four new markets, bringing the country counts deficit to 19. Net patient growth year-over-year was 79%, suggesting that we are making good progress in our efforts to raise awareness of CLN2. We expect that this steady growth will continue throughout the rest of 2019. All-in-all, first quarter results were strong and encouraging and I'm very pleased with revenue performance on all fronts.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to review financial results in more detail. Dan? -- Thank you, Jeff. Please see today's press release for full details summarizing our financial results for the first quarter. As Jeff has already reviewed Q1 individual product revenue results, I will cover other items in the first quarter. Consistent with our communicated goals, we anticipate 15% topline growth for full year 2019, based on achieving the midpoint of $1.68 billion to $1.75 billion. This would be solely on the currently approved products. In addition as J.J. reiterated, 2020 total revenues should grow an additional 15% and be approximately $2 billion with the expectation that contributions from vosoritide and valrox will take us significantly above that growth rate in the years beyond.Now turning to quarterly results. First, to a revenue item that Jeff did not cover. Aldurazyme revenues for the first quarter of 2019 of $45.3 million were 31% below the Q1 2018 level. This reduction was due entirely to the timing of product shipments to Genzyme. You may recall that under the new GAAP revenue recognition rules that went into place last year, we are now required to recognize our estimate of the full revenue we will see from Genzyme at the time they accept delivery of the product from us and not when they sell it to the end user. Significantly, Aldurazyme net product sales reported by Genzyme increased to $75.7 million in the first quarter or up 20% compared to $62.9 million in the same quarter in 2018.Moving to R&D expenses, which have largely stabilized, with Q1 '19 and Q1 '18 levels essentially unchanged at $184 million. And the full year 2019 R&D spending still looking to be less than a 10% increase over 2018 even with the continued progress of our late-stage programs. On a product level, valrox, which is near full enrollment of its Phase 3 study and the vosoritide Phase 3 is fully enrolled, driving increases in expenses in these programs compared to the first quarter of 2018. These expenses were largely offset by reductions in R&D expenses for Brineura and Palynziq, following their launch and a reduction in BMN 250 or tralesinidase alfa manufacturing expenses. These trends should continue throughout the year and we remain on track with our full year R&D guidance of $740 million to $780 million.Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2009 (ph) compared to last year due to the US launch of Palynziq and valrox launch preparation as we look forward a potential accelerated approval pathway decision later this year. However, SG&A expenses of $162 million were essentially flat compared to the prior quarter Q4, 2018.Moreover while expense levels, and sales and marketing will expand slightly throughout the year as we launch Palynziq in Europe and continue to prepare for valrox and vosoritide, full year SG&A guidance of $650 million to $690 million remains intact.Turning to bottom line operating results. We reported a GAAP net loss of $56.5 million in the first quarter, compared to $44.1 million GAAP net loss in the same quarter of 2018, primarily due to increased SG&A expenses that is just outlined, a reduction in the GAAP tax benefit and an increase in contingent consideration expense due to the continued progress of Palynziq and the associated increased probability of certain milestone payments to Merck Serono.Non GAAP income of $24.8 million in the first quarter was a slight improvement over 2018 non-GAAP income of $21.3 million. For both GAAP and non-GAAP results, our original guidances remains unchanged and we look for a nearly break even results of $45 million to $85 million loss on a GAAP basis and non-GAAP income of $130 million to $170 million.Finally cash and investments ended Q1 at $1.2 billion. And while working capital timings can have small impact on actual quarter end cash levels, with our planned GAAP and non-GAAP results, we expect cash balances at the end of the year to be similar to the current level, consistent with our limited cash usage in 2018.Now I would like to open the call for questions and we'll ask the operator to open the line. Please remember that as Traci mentioned at start of the call, based on your feedback, we plan to wrap up this call by 5:30 pm Eastern time. If we end the call and you still have follow up questions, please feel free to reach out to Traci this afternoon or tomorrow morning. In order to keep to this timeline, we request that you limit yourself to a single one-part question. Operator, please open the line.Sure. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'll abide by the one question rule. So maybe Hank, I want to ask about the importance of bleeding rate because investors have squarely focused on the Factor VIII level from the three-year update. So in your discussion with agency and also maybe even payers, how important is the bleeding rate in their consideration? Thank you. -- Bleeding rates pretty darn important to the FDA. For accelerated approval, the basis approval is about faster and there are no statistical tests on bleeding. They do want to have evidence to support the notion that achieving factor levels in the non-hemophiliac range are reasonably likely to reduce bleeding, but there's no statistical tests associated with it. Where bleeding rates become really important from a regulatory perspective is in the full approval scenario, where for the US is the primary endpoint of the ongoing confirmatory clinical trial. So, for accelerated approval, they are part of the reasonably likely expectation. No statistical test for full approval, a full statistical test for regulatory decision making in the US. -- Thank you.Our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Hey, good afternoon guys. Thank you for taking my question. I'm not surprisingly wanted to ask about valrox as well. And as we get closer to the three-year update early this summer obviously, investors are speculating quite a bit on what you might report and what would be good or not so good, but I'm curious what would you consider as success in terms of Factor VIII levels and ABR, what are you hoping to see to give you that much more confidence in this program, which you obviously already have a lot of confidence in? -- Hi, Cory. So, if I were to bifurcate, I would say, by far and away the most important thing out of the three-year update is the bleeding data. And the two reasons for that are, one that's the clinical morbidity of a patient's experience, it's what cost the healthcare system a lot of money, it's going to be what payers care a lot about, that's not to say that they won't care about other things, but for sure they're going to care about bleeding rate data. And so, what I think about that is little to no bleeding in the third year is going to be great.If there is breakthrough bleeding, we'll have to understand in whom and at what frequency and of what type and it's a little bit premature to kind of speculate about how to interpret all of that, but one way to think about that is, if breakthrough bleeding as of a relatively innocent type that is in target joints or patients who push themselves extremely, physically or in patients who on a particular day had a low factor activity that may not be problematic at all. So good outcomes are going to pertain to evidence of sustained reduction in bleeding.As far as factor activity goes, I don't have -- I don't think we have a specific number in our mind's eye about what we would consider to be great or good. And the reason for that is twofold. First, there is quite a bit of inter and intra patient variability in factor expression, so such that at any given time point, a subsequent time point could look different up or down. So the variability makes it difficult to be reasonably accurate, reliable, certain about what trajectory might exist in the data. And the second challenge is the assigning a clinical relevance to a number of a Factor VIII level. And as you know, the relationship of transgene Factor VIII and bleeding control hasn't been established as the first company to follow the patients for a long period of time, we're going to be building that database.So for two reasons, I can't give you a specific number. So zoom back out and kind of an amalgam with Ying's question earlier, bleeding most important thing, factor levels have to look at them because people are interested in prognosticating, going to be very difficult to prognosticate of. And I think that's why you have to go back to how did the bleeding data look, what was its time course, if it happened. -- To reiterate what Hank said earlier for full approval, which we will need by the way whether or not we get accelerated approval, we need full approval or full approval Factor VIII does not enter into the FDA's consideration at all. And second, regarding payers, because we forgot to answer the questions from the previous person. On the payers, the main thing payers want to know is how much money are they going to save with our product. And especially in Factor VIII that zero impact on the (inaudible). What impacts the reimbursement levels are Factor VIII usage -- recombinant Factor VIII usage and this recombinant Factor VIII usage is generally pretty directly linked to annualized bleeding rates, which is a primary endpoint of the full study. -- Okay. Got it. Appreciate all the color. -- Thank you.Our next question is from the line -- our next question is from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Yes, hi. Thank you for taking our question. This is Marianna (ph) for Salveen. I actually had a follow-up on valrox. And I was wondering given that we have seen some data from Nathwani study, out to eight years, is it reasonable comparison to hemophilia A and would make any significant differences allow the comparison to be made or not? -- I think that's a great question, and I think the field knowledge of the durability of factor expression in hemophilia after gene therapy is highly informed by Nathwani's six and eight-year data. And let me just remind you, he started, I think, it was in 2011, published and updated '14 in NASH. In December, he presented a eight-year update on the low and the mid dose cohort of his original study and a six-year update on his high dose study. Factor levels were sustained flat and through six and eight years, according to all three doses and more importantly, bleeding was substantially reduced in spite of the fact by the fact that the high dose cohort only got the 5% Factor IX levels.So the community is really encouraged by that. Experience is establishing a precedent of durability and an expectation. And I think that although there are substantial numbers of scientific differences between his Factor IX program and our Factor VIII program, I think the essential message is, there is evidence in humans with hemophilia given gene therapy a durable expression for six or eight years.There are a couple of other pieces of evidence which inform expectation. Uniqure is out now, passed two years. Spark is now passing two years in Factor IX and durability looks good in those programs. There's pre-clinical data in canines with canine hemophilia, given the canine trans gene about correction for their entire life. So provided that your gene therapy vector is a high quality product, the expectation in the field is that durable expression will be established after gene transfer.Our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Maybe I'll give Hank a break here and ask him non-valrox question. On Palynziq, maybe Jeff. So you have 414 paying patients, I guess now on therapy. And 278 naive, I think you said. Just trying to see if I can get a sense -- if you can give us a sense of where the discontinuation rate has gone. I think in the clinical experience, it was around 11%. And I think Jeff you guys mentioned last quarter, you had seven or so of the 212 naive patients had discontinued. So can you give that number now and is it sort of relatively -- is it a stable rate or any color would be appreciated. Thanks. -- Great question, Chris. And we're watching that closely. I'll caveat my answer by saying that for most patients on commercial balance that are naive, the treatment, it's still relatively early in their course of therapy. So things could change and to put that in context, patients have started mid Q3, for example, would just be now getting to the point where in the fastest possible titration schedule, they would be reaching 24 weeks of 20 milligram once per day. So just a little bit of context about that kind of long pass up the induction and titration schedule.So far the experience has been with discontinuations that they are materially less than what we experienced in the clinical trial, consistent one quarter later with the number that I quoted, last quarter and no real surprises inside of those discontinuation figures. Some patients discontinuing due to tolerability issues, other patients discontinuing for other reasons.And I will point out that we've got -- we've learned a lot about the use of Palynziq through the clinical trial program. Those learnings really shaped our thinking about how to support the commercial use of Palynziq. So, got a number of clinical coordinators out in the field working with US clinics and providing support with their patients to try to ensure that they're following the guidance of their clinics and getting the best possible experience as they induct and titrate their way up to a maintenance dose. Thank you. -- So just be clear. So, when you say materially lower than the 11% number, so is it safe to say you're still in the low-single digit? -- Yes, consistent with the numbers I quoted last quarter. -- Okay. Thank you.Our next question is from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First, I'm going to go back to Hank on valrox. Hank, appreciating everything that you said about bleeding rates being the most important. I'm certain that when the topline data, three-year data released, people are going to look at the trends and fact to determine the longevity of the clinical effect, in particular people are going to assume that when patients factor levels fall below 12%, they're going to become susceptible to bleeds even if they aren't currently. So what do you think of this analysis. Would you dissuade us from doing it? What point should we keep in mind as we interpret the data and try to extrapolate to figure out the longevity of the effect? -- Oh! boy, Phil, would be my first instance reaction. Just simply because there's just too many -- it's so subject to multiplicity. Meaning you could construct a regression curve to give you almost any answer you wanted to and you could tell yourself anything you want to about transient factor in bleeding. And so, I think that people have to remember we're in year three of a seven patient of experience of something that's never been done at industrial scale in the world. And that measure of durability of gene transfer and to interpret its surrogate significance in a long-term setting and I'm keen that we left the data and form our understanding of these relationships rather than speculate about it. So that's my best perspective on advice to give about prognosticating Factor VIII levels into the future and the clinical relevance of those factors. -- I mean I agree 100% with Hank, I would just also add that actually the data that Hank (inaudible) in his previous answers, with Factor IX as we contradict this 12% threshold being a magic threshold. And again I'm not making these comments because I know it's going to be below 12%. We have no idea again, but the Factor IX data, six year, eight years where they were still bleeding control as per the presentation from Dr. Nathwani at ASH last December, the Factor IX levels are around 3% to 4%, but six and eight years and the patients have bleeding control with chromogenic assay. -- And I might add that I don't know that payers are going to be excited about letting patients go back to factor replacement therapy at $500,000 a year because their factor level fell to 11.9% especially, if they're not bleeding. So I think we have to suspend our overly keen interest in factor levels. For the time being, I understand that they play a role in the overall picture that's going to be developed, but let's try to understand the context of where we are right now. -- That's helpful. Thank you. -- And also I want to point out (inaudible) because I've heard this call like, we are pointing out to the (inaudible) around 3% to 4%, not because we believe that this is where we are going to be, but it is because this is the only video available. -- Next question?Our next question is from the line of Joseph Schwartz from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. (Operator Instructions) -- Okay. Let's go to the next operator. Thank you.We already have the line of Joseph. -- Hello, can you guys hear me? -- Hi, Joseph. -- Yeah. -- Hey there. Not sure what happened there. So recognizing that predictability is such an important attribute for one-time gene therapy and you've had considerable variability, are you doing any work to determine the factors that correspond with patients who respond more or less to their valrox administration? -- We've done a little bit of work in that area, Joe on the seven patients. As you know, there's a little bit of variability in the group that got to trans gene expression levels above 40 IU per deciliter in the first year, but there's also the variability of one patient who only got to -- who didn't make it into the non-hemophiliac range. So we've looked at that one patient versus all the six, the other six patients can identify anything that's significantly different between that one patient and the other six or seven patients -- six patients.We've also looked at a lot of chemistry manufacturing control attributes to see if we can understand if there's a product related predictor and we haven't been able to identify product level predictors of patient responsiveness and I think that it's going to take more and for us to better understand if we can at all factors that determine the magnitude of the initial response.Now, what I hope that we'll be talking about by the end of the year is a repeat of what we've already seen in the 201 study, which is in spite of this variability, the vast majority of patients have an awesome response to gene transfer consisting of turning off of bleeding, elimination of target joints, sustained treatment benefit. So we will keep an eye out and try to learn more about predictors of variability in the go forward, but at this point, all we have to go on is, we've got a really robust response from our patients. -- Yeah, I would say, although there has been variability in factor levels, there has been no variability in response to bleeding in our control and even the patients move -- the one patient who has had lower Factor VIII levels from the get-go at year two was -- has had his bleeding under control and was not found in recombinant Factor VIII injections, right? -- Yes. -- So, the clinical assay is not variable. -- Thanks. I'll leave it there.Our next question is from the line of Josh Schimmer from Evercore. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking the questions. Hank, despite all your previous answers to all the prior questions, I'm still going to ask, if it does turn out to the Factor VIII levels continue to decline at three years, and there are questions about durability, despite your commentary about the challenges interpreting that. Do you have a strategy then to consider either redosing or alternative vectors? And then considering the strategic importance of that information, potentially the need to move quickly to consider some alternatives or solutions, why blind yourself to that information? Thank you. -- Hi, Josh. Thanks for the question. Nobody said anything about blinding ourselves to the consideration of potential for redosing. What we've done is, blinded Wall Street to our research activities and our redosing program and part of the reason for that is that is competitive obviously, but also part of the reason for that is, we're fairly limited and focused in what we're doing in the redosing area largely because the expectation as I said before going in as we said that clinical benefit of gene transfer will persist.I suppose that one could imagine the results of a subsequent clinical trial. I can only look forward to the year six update and we're talking about at that point somebody actually did lose materials and a gene expression and then it will be relevant to ask the redosing question, but we haven't triggered a major investment in redosing, but it doesn't mean that we're not thinking about it and it doesn't mean we're doing nothing about it. It means that we're doing stuff about it that it's proprietary. -- I guess why blind yourself to the data, because the data may be informative for potential strategies and urgency of those strategies? -- Joshua, you're on question two. So all my friends here pointing at me, but what I would say is, I think, we undertook a strategy to manage the conduct of the clinical trial and we baked into it all of the things that we could think of in terms of why you might want to know the data earlier and out of all of that team, our decision to keep the data at arm's length from us. And the most just positive element of that decision really is, just try out integrity and trying to understand the relationship between factor activity and unbiased interpretation of bleeding data for a very good discussion with health authorities about a very big decision that was going to be made about the availability -- accelerated availability of a gene therapy product. So as I said before, once we decided to move into the pivotal registration phase, we put all of the data into the data monitoring committee's hands and if they had significant concerns that suggested we needed to reactivate a -- or increase our activity around that redosing, we'd have heard that. And so we made the decision about how to manage the trial and here's where we are, we're sticking with the decision. -- I just want to clarify that what we -- Hank meant by the integrity of the trial is the integrity of the pivotal Phase 3 trial. That's critical here. -- Thank you very much. -- Especially as we are trying to shoot for accelerated approval, the data has to be squeaky clean. And that was what is very important. Actually we are, as Hank said, we don't want to advertise us, but we actually are working on the potential redosing strategy, not that much for our own product as we believe there will be a lot of opportunities to redose patients who fail our competitors' therapies.Our next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks for the question. Just going back to Palynziq. So, given that you have about almost for every patients that are new on drugs, do you see any changes in the trajectory, as you go forward and then also you mentioned a broad European label, what does that mean for you, for the market opportunity, for Palynziq in Europe? Thanks. -- Great questions, which I heard is two, but I think we can cover. (multiple speakers) -- You can skip one. -- I think we can cover them both. The trajectory question first. If you look at the numbers that we reported or not -- on commercial therapy that were previously naive to Palynziq treatment at the end of Q4. You take the mid-quarter update that we provided a little while ago, you add in the end of Q1 data, what you see is basically a pretty straight line pointed in the same direction, which is up in total. And that would imply that the trajectory is staying pretty stable and because of those patients that we reported at the end of Q4 were largely patient referrals that we got early ish in Q3 that points to kind of a lot of stability in the uptake of patients. The other number that you can watch and say, hey, that looks pretty stable, is the number of patients that are enrolled, but not yet on therapy. So that's a good looking number too. It kind of indicates that if we continue doing our job right, the trajectory of patients on therapy should remain about the same. That's our expectation. The number of patients kind of in queue, that's our pipeline, if that stays steady, that's a good indication that we're getting patients continuing to enroll and getting them steadily on to treatment. So that's good.In terms of the European label, we won't know if that is entirely until we've got an easy approval, but the draft label language that we've seen looks very positive and I think that will give us -- if that holds up, that'll give us a really nice market opportunity in Europe, which is a very large pool of potential patients to deal with. So really excited about that prospect. -- Great. Thank you.Our next question is from the line of Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your line is open. -- Hey, thanks for taking the question. This is Nate on for Paul. How quickly are patients progressing from REMS enrollment for Palynziq to their first treatment and has it been gated by the titration protocol in anyway? -- Sorry, I just want to make sure I heard your question correctly. Your question was how quickly our patients progressing through enrollment to -- from REMS enrollment to initiation of therapy, and is induction titration a barrier to -- is the REMS a barrier to induction titration, perfect. So far the REMS has not been a barrier to enrollment or to patients start. It's an added step, but we've been really well organized around that. And it's not an onerous additional step.The time for enrollment to starting therapy has been pretty steady the last couple of quarters and not in consistent with our experience with other drugs in the United States, including Kuvan, Naglazyme and Vimizim. It's currently running between two and three months on average with some variability by patients. And what we know about -- so far what we know about the induction and titration schedule is, the label basically defines the fastest path. I don't have -- I don't have anything other than anecdotal reports on that schedule of patients. But anecdotally, what I've heard is pretty consistent, which is a lot of patients and as we expect it requires some slow down steps along the way. And clinics that are new to using Palynziq are being more conservative than they're -- than the clinics that were experienced with Palynziq through the clinical trial. And I just want to reinforce all according to expectations, no problems or surprises there. -- Great, thanks.Our next question is from the line of Ellie Merle from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my question. So in terms of your gene therapy strategy outside of valrox, just given your clear manufacturing and rare disease expertise, when do you think that you might unleash this capability into say expanding into new programs. And I mean I guess what are say like the gating factors from you having, like five gene therapy clinical programs in 2020 versus the two that you currently guide for. I mean is it sort of the pre-clinical work or vector optimization that's taking time or is it more of a strategic choice to just initially prioritize hemophilia and PKU? Thanks. -- So it's more an assessment of the business opportunity of every -- of every possible gene therapy product as compared to other pre-clinical candidates that we have in the clinical pipeline. So because as we have said before although gene therapy is a very important component of BioMarin in the future, at this time, we are not planning on turning into a gene therapy company. So there are other components that are -- candidates here after a gene therapy, (inaudible) gene therapy, but so the relativity factor is actually bit more financial than anything else. And but it's slightly -- so we like though we have to decide what's going to be our next idea after PKU gene therapy hopefully next year, sometime next year and there are gene therapy candidates, there are non-gene therapy candidates that we just need to prioritize them depending on what we believe, probably a technical success of the competitive levels, the size of the market and all those considerations. So that's kind of what enters into the generation here. You want to say a few words about the manufacturing component of this, Robert? -- Certainly, we have substantial capacity to produce the gene therapy programs both for valrox and 307. And as Hank and his team evaluate additional gene therapy candidates, we propose to put those into the clinic, we can certainly accommodate additional programs with our current capacity.Our next question is from the line of Timothy Lugo from William Blair. Your line is open. -- Hi, this is Myles on for Tim. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on the PKU gene therapy. Considering that the strength in the public quest relates to the positive decision for Palynziq, started neurocognitive benefit. I'm wondering whether potential trials for your gene therapy program would actually have to happen neurocognitive endpoint predisposed there and if Palynziq would be the benchmark that you'd be looking to (inaudible). Thanks -- Clearly, health authorities like controlled clinical trials better than uncontrolled clinical trials. But, what I think you could expect is that, if the effect of gene therapy is large and larger than might have otherwise ever been observed in a natural setting, I don't think that there will be a requirement to compare gene therapy to either Palynziq, or to Kuvan, or to an untreated control group.Now, we haven't launched our clinical program yet. As I said in my comments, we're going to file our IND later this year. So stay tuned to more explicit and specific descriptions, but from what I know of the regulatory landscape at least so far, while you could certainly get a health authority to say, let's do a controlled clinical trials, let's compare things, I do believe that there's ample reason to believe that patients with their own control study, looking for very large effect on blood Phe would support registration and I'll just remind you that blood Phe have supported registration of Kuvan in the United States, Kuvan in Europe, Palynziq in the United States, will support Palynziq in Europe. So there's no real evidence that anything beyond Phe would be required for an endpoint for regulatory approval. -- Thanks for the question.Our next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I will give the team a break from valrox and maybe just ask how you're thinking about competition in achondroplasia both from sort of a mechanistic and clinical standpoint as well as the potential commercial standpoint. On the commercial side, I mean how should we be thinking about physicians choosing to put patients on theoretically commercial valrox in a couple of years versus potential registrational trials of competitor agent? Thanks so much. -- You said valrox in the middle of the -- end of your answer. I think this is all about vosoritide -- -- Sorry, achondroplasia, yes. I'm sorry -- Yeah, well so first of all, from a mechanism and competitive view, there are a number of competitors taking different approaches to restoring growth in achondroplasia and without getting into the details about every single one, we like the target specificity of the approach that we're taking. There is a competitor, who's taking a very similar approach to us, but approaching this from the point of view of the long-acting preparation of the product. They have single dose data and no biomarker -- new healthy volunteers. So they are years behind us and so now into the other part of your question, how will payments will go or not go on vosoritide according to their own individual interests and wishes, and depending on their experience with vosoritide, they may be more or less amenable to alternative options from other manufacturers.Now in that time interval, we will be investigating next generation products ourselves. And so, hopefully our expectation is that satisfaction with vosoritide will be relatively high in the first instance and the only thing that would be moving people off of vosoritide is a much better presentation of the product. And we're working on that. -- And also if I may the window, the treatment window for this product is limited. Because as you know one physician work base is closed. There is no -- unlikely there's any opportunity for -- people benefit here. So waiting four or five years for the next miracle product, they would lose about 10 to 15 centimeters of growth.Our next question is from the line of Edward Nash from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. -- Hey. Thank you for taking our question. This is Fang-Ke Huang for Edward Nash. Just going back to the variability topic, hemophilia. So based on our observation comparing hemophilia A and hemophilia B gene therapy trials, we kind of always think that what hemophilia A, there is more variable compared to hemophilia B. Do you think that observation is correct based on your experience in the field? -- Sorry. Did you get more questions? -- Yeah. Just want to follow up just if that correction is correct and then secondly is there any potential reason behind it? -- I think it's very difficult to compare class clinical trials across diseases, across interventions. So I don't know that I'm ready to make a categorical comparison of Factor VIII and Factor IX gene therapy hemophilia A and hemophilia B, other products and our products. I mean it's still very early days. -- Okay. Thanks.This will be the end of the Q&A portion of the call, and I will now have the call back over to the Chairman and CEO, J.J. Bienaime. Your -- go ahead. -- Thank you, operator. So as we look forward to the future, we are energized by the prospect of a potential accelerated approval with valrox, the data readouts of our global phase -- vosoritide Phase 3 trial of the year, the start of PKU gene therapy product with BMN 307 at the end of the year, also and continued growth of our current global commercial brands. So BioMarin has never been in a stronger position across the commercial R&D and manufacturing organization. We look forward to a great things ahead in the coming quarters. And thank you for your continued support, and goodbye.This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining.

After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and BioMarin Pharmaceutical wasn't one of them!

Economic recessions, after all, tend to go hand in hand with steep downturns in the broader markets.With this theme in mind, we asked three of our Motley Fool contributors which defensive stocks they think are worth buying ahead of the next market crash. They picked  (NASDAQ: BMRN) ,  (NYSE: WM) , and  (NYSE: WMT) . Here's why.Image source: Getty Images. Recession-proof equities are a rare breed. Not many companies run operations that are essentially independent of the economy, after all. But that's what sets the orphan-drug specialist BioMarin apart from the crowd.With seven drugs indicated for rare diseases already on the market and two more in late-stage development, BioMarin is poised to become an elite orphan drugmaker within the next decade. Why does this matter?Orphan drugs are highly prized commodities within the pharmaceutical industry for a number of reasons. First off, these drugs rarely face pushback from third-party payers, even though these products tend to be some of the most expensive medicines on the market. Secondly, a fair number of these drugs are absolutely essentially to a patient's welfare. You can't simply skip a treatment in most cases -- making these products extremely reliable sources of income for their manufacturers. Last but certainly not least, orphan drugs generally have much longer shelf lives than their non-orphan peers. Rare-disease manufacturers, in turn, aren't nearly as vulnerable to patent expires as traditional pharma companies.Why BioMarin in particular? BioMarin has an excellent track record at bringing important new orphan drugs to market in a timely fashion. Last year, for example, the company grabbed its seventh regulatory approval with the phenylketonuria treatment called Palynziq. This latest addition to its impressive product portfolio is expected to help boost the company's 2020 sales by a whopping 15% year over year. The best part is that the overarching economy should have little impact on BioMarin's  . Waste Management's business might not be very exciting, but \"boring\" can be one of the best characteristics to look for when you're hunting for stocks that might actually be worth buying  of a potential market crash. The company's dependable, low-risk business model makes it the type of stock that investors could flock to in the event that the broader market takes a bearish turn.When it comes to hauling trash and operating landfills, Waste Management looks primed to continue enjoying what effectively amounts to a regional monopoly, and these industries shouldn't feel much pressure from a potential economic downturn. Shares might not look cheap trading at roughly 23 times this year's expected earnings, but the company has a strong business and operates in industries with very high barriers to entry -- and these characteristics should ensure the company is able to keep growing.Waste Management also pays a dividend, with its yield coming in at roughly 2% and the company having raised its payout on annual basis for 15 years straight. Again, not the most exciting dividend profile in the world, but it's a solid yield for a  company that's delivering regular payout growth. So while the trash hauling and storing business won't be shedding its less-than-glamorous reputation anytime soon, an encouraging outlook for the business and more dividend growth suggest that Waste Management stock could continue to be a winner. While most investors would rather buy stocks after the market crashes than before, it doesn't hurt to be prepared. One stock that could even benefit from the next recession is Walmart.The retailer that invented Everyday Low Prices still lives by its reputation for savings today so the company tends to do better than most when consumers tighten their purse strings. With more than half of domestic sales coming from groceries, Walmart also sells mostly essential items that consumers need to buy no matter what the economy is like. Moreover, Walmart is a  , having raised its quarterly payout every year since 1974, and today offers a dividend yield of 2.1%.If Walmart's strengths as a defensive stock aren't enough, the retail giant could even benefit from the next recession or market crash as it will likely hit its rivals harder. For instance, a number of retailers are already closing stores and even teetering on bankruptcy and a recession would only hasten that process, giving Walmart an opportunity to gain market share, especially in rural America.The company has also recently gone on a  for digitally native brands like Modcloth, Bonobos, Bare Necessities, and others, and a market crash could force more of them to put themselves up for sale as it will get harder for them to raise funding and find customers.Though Walmart's sales could be pressured by a recession, there are a lot of reasons to think that the retail giant could emerge in an even stronger position when the economy recovers.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The major indices each enjoyed solid gains on Tuesday for the first time in three sessions.Financial stocks have been under pressure since the Fed announced a moratorium on rate hikes for 2019. However, today they bounced back, along with tech and energy.The S&P continues to dance around 2800. It slipped slightly below the mark yesterday, but came roaring back today with a 0.72% advance to 2818.46. The NASDAQ was up 0.71% to 7691.52. These were the first positive closes since last Thursday.Tech had a good session even though Apple dipped another 1%. The iPhone maker is now down more than 2% since announcing a suite of new services on Monday, including the Apple TV+ streaming platform and the Apple Card credit card. Yesterday's event included Spielberg, Oprah,  and even  (among others), but it didn't include a price for the services.Meanwhile, the Dow was the only major index to finish on the plus side yesterday with a tiny gain amid all this nervousness. This session's advance was much more robust with a rise of 0.55% (or nearly 141 points) to 25,657.73. However, it had been up approximately 280 points at its best of the session. The EMCORE (EMKR) move was not working out as Brian Bolan had hoped, so he sold the stock on Tuesday. However, the editor still wants exposure to the space, so he replaced the open position with LG Display (LPL).

It looks like SB-525 can help people with a rare bleeding disorder called hemophilia A, but it isn't the only potential new treatment for this condition.  and\u00a0  have experimental gene therapies of their own aimed at the limited hemophilia population, and they're further along on the development timeline. Let's weigh Sangamo's update with results we've seen from its potential competitors so far.Image source: Getty Images.Recently, Sangamo held a conference call to give a long investor presentation that included a few  about SB-525, an experimental therapy that plugs in a working gene for the clotting factor that hemophilia A patients can't produce on their own.Last August, Sangamo Therapeutics and its collaboration partner,  , excited the medical community  when it reported the fifth patient in an ascending dose study achieved therapeutic clotting factor activity levels. Patients seven and eight received three times as much SB-525 as patient five, which looks like an effective dose to move into a pivotal trial.As of March 27, patients seven and eight haven't needed any clotting factor replacement infusions for 12 weeks and six weeks, respectively. Sangamo needs to show SB-525 lasts a lot longer, but the company's clearly on the right track with a therapy that might be able to rise above the competition.Image source: Getty Images.Roche recently agreed  for $4.8 billion to get its hands on Spark's approved gene therapy used to treat a rare cause of blindness. The Swiss pharmaceutical and diagnostics giant also received an investigational gene therapy for the treatment of hemophilia, SPK-8011.Two out of seven patients given the highest dosage of SPK-8011 experienced an immune response that reduced their clotting factor levels to less than 5% of normal. We're still waiting for more data from the highest-dose group, but we know two patients who received half as much SPK-8011 showed clotting factor activity around 12% and 22% of normal that stayed steady through 52 weeks.BioMarin is advancing a gene therapy, nicknamed ValRox, for the same limited population of hemophilia patients, and it's a bit further along the development timeline than SPK-8011 and miles ahead of Sangamo's SB-525. BioMarin is running a 130-patient phase 3 trial with a dosage that looks like it works early on and keeps working for hemophilia A patients. At the 104-week follow-up, the average patient's clotting factor activity level was within the normal range at 59% and the median was near normal at 46%.So far, the proposed dose for Sangamo's candidate from now on looks like it could wipe the floor with Spark's candidate and BioMarin's. Patient seven started showing clotting activity at 150% of normal five weeks after treatment with SB-525 and sustained this level through week 12, the most recent observation.Patient eight had only been observed twice, but this one is doing pretty good so far. Clotting factor activity burst out of the gate at 50% of normal two weeks after treatment with SB-525, and it reached 100% at week four.Sangamo, Biomarin, and Roche are all trying to treat hemophilia A patients, but sample populations vary from study to study. Without a head-to-head trial, any comparisons should be taken with a grain of salt. That said, it looks like Sangamo's treatment could be the best one yet.Image source: Getty Images.Sangamo also presented an early look at the first patient dosed with ST-400, an experimental gene therapy for the treatment of beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Unlike SB-525, this candidate uses zinc finger nucleases to snip a gene and restart production of fetal hemoglobin.The first beta thalassemia patient treated with ST-400 experienced an allergic reaction but recovered without too much trouble. This beta thalassemia patient's total hemoglobin level has remained high enough to avoid transfusions seven weeks after treatment. The company was also encouraged to see fetal hemoglobin rise from around 1% of the total to 31% at week seven.Before you get too carried away with excitement for Sangamo, you should understand it's still too early to draw broad conclusions about SB-525, or any conclusions about ST-400. For SB-525, we'll need to see more than two hemophilia patients display normal clotting factor activity for a lot longer than 12 weeks. Of course, a repeat performance with a larger group of patients, without any signs of serious immune responses, could send the stock soaring again.BioMarin plans on sending an application for ValRox to the FDA in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, Pfizer and Sangamo are still waiting for data so they can begin planning SB-525's pivotal study. By the time the partners get a chance to change the hemophilia treatment landscape, it might not look the same.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Although Roche's big investment is a plus for the entire field, some biotechs have a better chance of receiving a juicy buyout offer than others. (NASDAQ: BMRN) and  (NASDAQ: QURE) don't receive as many headlines as their younger peers do, but they have programs in late-stage development that some big pharmas will find hard to resist.Image source: Getty Images.To understand what makes UniQure and Biomarin more attractive than their gene-editing peers, we need to understand why Roche  . The Swiss pharma giant's main motivation was to head off a potential threat to a new hemophilia treatment that could earn $4 billion annually by 2022.In 2017, Roche launched Hemlibra, the first easily injectable treatment that helps hemophilia A patients prevent bleeding episodes. At the moment, most patients still receive clotting factor replacement therapy through an intravenous infusion multiple times each week, and the expenses really add up. Roche priced Hemlibra at around $450,000 annually, and an independent industry watchdog, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, still thinks it can save end payers around $1.85 million per adult patient every year.Hemlibra already has big pharmas with significant hemophilia sales nervous, and Roche's step into the gene therapy arena could be the extra push needed to make a big acquisition.In 2012, UniQure became the first company to launch a gene therapy, called Glybera, but had to pull it from the European market because it was a complete commercial failure. Glybera carried a million-dollar price tag, and the therapy was aimed at an ultra-rare disorder. UniQure's new lead candidate, AMT-061, has a much better chance at commercial success as a treatment for hemophilia B, which affects an estimated 20,000 people in the U.S. alone.UniQure's lead candidate, AMT-061, helped three out of three hemophilia B patients produce enough clotting factor to reduce their need for replacement therapy 12 weeks after receiving their first and only dose. In February, the company treated the first of 50 patients in a pivotal study that will measure their ability to produce their own clotting factor after waiting six months, one year, and five years.At recent prices, UniQure sports a $2.1 billion market cap, which puts it in range for dozens of biopharma's larger members.  might be stretched a bit too far after a record-setting $62 billion merger with Shire last year to make another purchase in the near term, but investors should know that hemophilia treatments were a key attraction that brought the Japanese pharmaceutical giant to the deal table.Image source: Getty Images.BioMarin is becoming a euphemism for \"  that never gets bought,\" but a heightened interest in hemophilia could do the trick in 2019. BioMarin markets a handful of rare-disease drugs with combined annual sales that rose 14% last year to $1.5 billion, and a potential new gene therapy for hemophilia A patients is getting close to the finish line.After showing the FDA some breathtaking early results for an experimental gene therapy called valrox (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) last year, BioMarin began enrolling more patients into a special cohort designed to support an application for accelerated approval. The FDA wants to see clotting factors from the larger cohort reach levels seen with the same dose in a small group of patients.BioMarin won't finish enrolling and observing baseline patient data in the third quarter, but we should know if the results might be good enough to support a new drug application before the end of 2019.Image source: Getty Images.As a commercial-stage company with significant sales, BioMarin is too expensive for most suitors. That almost includes  (NASDAQ: SNY) , a big pharma eager to boost its presence in the rare-disease space, and hemophilia specifically.About a year ago, Sanofi shelled out a whopping $11.6 billion for  's hemophilia spinoff, Bioverativ, and received Eloctate for hemophilia A patients plus Alprolix for the much smaller hemophilia B population in the process. In the fourth quarter, Eloctate sales rose 4.3% to $223 million, which is a lot slower than Sanofi investors were expecting a year ago. A merger with BioMarin could be exactly what the French pharma giant's new rare-disease segment needs.Predicting future mergers and acquisitions is so difficult that you should never buy a stock simply because it might be acquired at a premium. While UniQure's price range makes it more likely to receive a buyout offer, you might be better off with shares of BioMarin. After all, the company's expecting $2 billion in annual sales next year, even if its gene therapy gamble comes up snake eyes.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares have lost about 0.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BioMarin due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recen  in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.BioMarin missed estimates for earnings as well as revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018.Adjusted loss of 7 cents per share in the fourth quarter was in sharp contrast to the Zacks Consensus Estimate o  of 10 cents. Adjusted loss per share was 1 cent in the year-ago quarter.The adjusted loss excludes amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and a contingent consideration expense; benefit from income tax; and a gain on sale of intangible assets.Total revenues were $353.2 million in the reported quarter, down 1% from the year-ago period owing to lower product revenues. Moreover, sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $380 million.Product revenues were $347.2 million in the fourth quarter, down 1.2% year over year, on account of lower Naglazyme sales and Aldurazyme sales volume. Royalty and other revenues were $6.06 million in the reported quarter, higher than $4.7 million in the year-ago period. New drugs Brineura and Palynziq did well in the quarter.Kuvan revenues rose 4% to $112.2 million. Kuvan sales were hurt, to an extent, by patient switching to Palynziq, given its superior efficacy profile.Naglazyme sales declined 18% year over year to $76.7 million due to volatility of central government ordering patterns. Vimizim contributed $114.0 million to total revenues, flat year over year.Naglazyme and Vimzim revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from some countries, mainly Brazil.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties - totaling $17.4 million - from Genzyme in the quarter, down 39% year over year owing to lower volume of product sales to Genzyme due to unfavorable timing of shipments.Brineura generated sales of $12.2 million in the fourth quarter compared with $9.9 million in the previously reported quarter, indicating a sequential increase of 23.2% as BioMarin continued to add new commercial patients.Palynziq injection grossed sales of $8.1 million in the fourth quarter compared with $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2018.As of Feb 15, 2019, 335 U.S. commercial patients were on treatment with Palynziq. Of the 335 patients, 123 were from clinical studies and 212 were naive to Palynziq treatment. Another 131 patients have enrolled and are awaiting their first commercial treatment with Palynziq. In the EU, a marketing application is under review with a decision expected in the second quarter of 2019. A CHMP recommendation for European approval of Palynziq is anticipated in the first quarter of 2019.Research and development (R&D) expenses rose 1.6% year over year to support expansion of its pipeline program. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 2.6% in the quarter due to marketing expenses associated with Brineura and Palynziq commercial efforts.As of December 31, 2018, BioMarin had $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, versus $1.6 billion as at the end of September 30, 2018.Full-year 2018 sales rose 14% to $1.49 billion, marginally missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 billion. Revenues were within the guided range of $1.47-$1.53 billion.Adjusted earnings for 2018 were 40 cents which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents. However, earnings rose 53.9% year over year.BioMarin anticipates total revenues in the range of $1.68-$1.75 billion in 2019. This indicates year-over-year growth of approximately 15% based on the presently approved products.Vimizim sales are expected in the range of $530-$570 million. Kuvan sales are projected in the range of $420-$460 million. Naglazyme sales are projected in the range of $350-$380 million. Brineura sales are expected in the range of $55-$75 million. Palynziq sales are expected in the range of $70-$100 million mostly from U.S. market. The Palynziq 2019 guidance range does not include any material EU revenues, if approval is received in the region.R&D costs are expected to be within $740-$780 million. SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $650-$690 million.The company expects adjusted net income in the range of $130 million to $170 million, a year-over-year improvement of 65% from the mid-point.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted -408.27% due to these changes.At this time, BioMarin has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise BioMarin has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Email all feedback to If it weren't for Boeing, we would've had an even better Tuesday session. But even with the aerospace company pressuring the Dow, the other major indices still managed a second straight day on positive ground.The FAANGs didn't have as good a day as yesterday, but Alphabet still jumped approximately 1.5% and Apple advanced about 1.1%. In the end, the NASDAQ rose 0.44% to 7591.03.It'll be really interesting to see how close the market allows the S&P to get to 2800 before blocking the path. That milestone has proven to be elusive in the post-correction market. The index briefly closed above that mark on Friday, March 1, but then quickly gave it back. On Tuesday, the S&P inched even closer with a gain of 0.30% to 2791.52. said Jeremy Mullin in These indices have now put together two consecutive days in the green after failing to close positively even once last week.The Dow probably would've joined the indices on the plus side if it weren't for Boeing. The aerospace giant had an even worse session on Tuesday than on Monday, dropping by 6.1% compared to yesterday's 5.3%. The company is still dealing with the second crash of a 737 Max 8 jet in less than 6 months. Several countries, including the U.K. and China, have suspended operations of those models pending investigations, though the FAA has not grounded the planes in the U.S.Boeing's pullback led the Dow lower by 0.38% (or about 96 points) to 25,554.66. The recent NVDA/MLNX deal refreshed Brian Bolan's bullishness and has him looking for a chip name to add. The editor picked up Emcore (EMKR), which offers a broad portfolio of compound semiconductor-based products for the broadband, fiber optic, satellite and terrestrial solar power markets. The editor thinks the deal - in which NVDA paid  for MLNX - sends a signal that \"bigger is better\" and provides a tailwind for chips. The portfolio held EMKR a couple years ago when it was approximately $9.

For the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQEW), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $69.33 per unit.With QQEW trading at a recent price near $62.59 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.76% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQEW's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN), Sirius XM Holdings Inc (Symbol: SIRI), and Electronic Arts, Inc. (Symbol: EA). Although BMRN has traded at a recent price of $91.05/share, the average analyst target is 33.73% higher at $121.76/share. Similarly, SIRI has 23.70% upside from the recent share price of $6.00 if the average analyst target price of $7.42/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting EA to reach a target price of $106.90/share, which is 12.80% above the recent price of $94.77.

The widening year-over-year loss can be primarily attributed to a significant rise in operating expenses.Notably, the adjusted figure excluded one-time items, depreciation & amortization expenses, interest expenses, and income tax benefit. Including all these items, the company incurred a loss of $2.05 per share compared with a loss of 37 cents in the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, Sarepta's Exondys 51 - the first Duchenne muscular dystrophy (\"DMD\") treatment to gain approval in the United States - continued with its strong performance. Sarepta recorded total revenues of $84.4 million, up 7.5% sequentially, entirely from the sale of Exondys 51. The demand for the drug has increased during the quarter. However, the top line marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.91 million. In the prior-year quarter, Sarepta had earned revenues of $57.3 million.Consequently, shares of Sarepta were down 2.3% in after-hours trading. However, Sarepta has rallied 144.2% in a year's time.Duchenne muscular dystrophy (\"DMD\") is a rare muscular degenerative disease that mostly affects boys and can be fatal before patients turn 30.Adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses totaled $77 million in the fourth quarter, up 87.8% year over year. The upside was driven by increased patient enrollment in late-stage golodirsen study and ramp-up of manufacturing activities for pipeline candidates, including gene therapies, and higher costs due to pipeline expansion. The metric was partially offset by lower cost related to clinical studies evaluating Exondus 52.Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses were $52.9 million, up 101.9% year over year. Higher costs related to the global commercial expansion of its products and increased personnel expenses led to the uptick.Cost of sales was also higher, reflecting higher inventory costs due to rising demand for Exondys 51 and royalty payments to BioMarin  , per the terms of the 2017 settlement and license agreements related to the latter's exon-skipping technology used in DMD therapies.Sarepta recorded 2018 sales of $30.1 million, up 94.7% year over year, solely from the sale of Exondys 51. The company incurred adjusted loss of $2.14 per share, wider than the year-ago loss of $1.34 per share. The year-over-year loss despite solid sales growth was due to rising costs to support global expansion for Exondys 51 and development of golodirsen, and gene therapies as well as higher royalty payments to BioMarin.Sarepta is building its DMD pipeline, which will enhance its approved drug portfolio. The pipeline candidates, on approval, will be eligible to treat a larger patient population than Exondys 51. Currently, the company has about eight exon-skipping pipeline candidates, which can treat 75-80% of DMD patients. Sarepta is also developing gene therapies for treating DMD.Earlier this month, the FDA granted priority review to the new drug application (\"NDA\") seeking accelerated approval for golodirsen. A decision is expected by mid-August. This apart, Sarepta is planning to submit a new drug application for its second DMD candidate, casimersen, by mid-2019, if study data confirms preclinical dystrophin expression.An approval to golodirsen NDA is likely to boost Sarepta's top line as the drug will increase the eligible patient population by 8%. The company is planning to have three approved exon-skipping drugs - including Exondys 51, golodirsen and casimersen - in its portfolio by the first quarter of 2020, following which it expects the eligible patient population to double.Concurrent with press release, Sarepta announced positive preliminary results from an early stage study evaluating gene therapy, MY-101, for treating Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). Data showed robust protein expression in muscles, which was significantly higher than the pre-defined threshold value. Moreover, Sarepta exercised its option to acquire Myonexus Therapeutics for a purchase consideration of $165 million that will add the latter's five LGMD candidates to its pipeline. It is important to note that MYO-101 was also developed by Myonexus.In October, Sarepta signed a license agreement with French gene therapy company - Lysogene - to develop the latter's central nervous system (\"CNS\") targeting candidate, LYS-SAF302. The candidate, an AAV-mediated gene therapy, is being evaluated in a phase II/III study, AAVance, for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA). First patient in the study was dosed earlier this month.Sarepta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector include Celgene Corporation  and Genomic Health, Inc.  . While Celgene sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Genomic Health carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Celgene's earnings estimates have been revised 5.3% upward for 2019 and 9.2% for 2020 over the past 60 days.

But dig a little deeper, and the decline appears to be explained by the nature of the company's business. With new-drug launches off to a good start and a well-stocked late-stage pipeline, there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the orphan-drug company.Data source: BioMarin Pharmaceutical.Image source: Getty Images.In its clinical trials, Palynziq had some issues with anaphylaxis -- a severe allergic reaction -- but Henry Fuchs, BioMarin's president of worldwide research and development,  the side effect hasn't been a major problem in the commercial setting. \"I think one of the things I am very encouraged about, about this, is we do see anaphylaxis occurring, but the majority of patients who have it are successfully rechallenged,\" Fuchs said. \"In the clinical trial studies, the majority of patients who had an anaphylactic event are able to successfully receive continued Palynziq safely, and the fact that doctors are doing that in the commercial setting as well bodes really well because I think that the key thing to keep your eye on is discontinuations due to adverse events.\"As a one-time, potentially curing gene therapy, valrox is going to run into challenges with getting paid for by insurance plans and government programs, but Chief Commercial Officer Jeffrey Robert Ajer doesn't seem too concerned and thinks gene therapies being developed by other companies for other diseases will help pave the way:Management is looking for 2019 revenue in the $1.68 billion to $1.75 billion range, a 15% increase over 2018 at the midpoint and on the way to management's  of 2020 revenue of $2 billion. Palynziq could get approved by EU regulators in the second quarter, setting up a European launch in the second half of this year, but don't expect much in EU sales this year as it can take a while to get reimbursement set up in many European countries.On the bottom line, management is looking for a net loss on a  basis, but expects adjusted income to come in between $130 million and $170 million, substantially higher than the $91 million last year.BioMarin could certainly get to GAAP profitability if it wanted to, but chooses to spend on research and development instead. These investments ought to pay off in the long run. Investors should look for late-stage data, expected later this year, on vosoritide for children with achondroplasia, a form of short-limbed dwarfism. In the second half of this year, management also expects to announce whether it'll pursue an accelerated FDA approval for valrox or use the standard approval pathway.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We just feel it's now the right time to step up,\" Schwan told in an interview.\"The fit of Spark and Roche is really excellent. It provides us with a broad portfolio, it provides us with expertise across the value chain.\"Schwan is counting on new medicines, including gene therapies, to help compensate for patent losses on his $21-billion-per-year trio of cancer medicines Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, that are facing competition from cheaper copies.Roche, the biggest cancer drugs maker, was late to the game in immuno-oncology where Merck's Keytruda is becoming the dominant player and has eclipsed Roche's own product, Tecentriq, that seeks to harness the body's immune system to fight cancer.Bank Vontobel analysts said the Spark deal gives Roche a proven platform for commercialising gene therapies, but did not come without risks -- including getting beaten to market by rivals with similar treatments in the works.Roche shares were 0.4 percent lower by 1140 GMT.Gene therapies use specially engineered viruses, or viral vectors, to deliver genetic material into defective cells, in hopes of improving or potentially even curing an inherited condition.Luxturna, sold in the United States by Spark and elsewhere by Novartis after its approval in 2017, targets a rare genetic disease, Leber's congenital amaurosis, that causes blindness in about 1 in 200,000 people.Loss-making Spark had $51.6 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2018 from Luxturna and also had income from a deal with Pfizer , which it is partnering on another gene therapy for haemophilia B.Philadelphia-based Spark's shares are up about 30 percent this year. The U.S.-company's stock tumbled last year after two of 12 patients showed an unfavourable immune response when treated with a higher dose of Spark's haemophilia therapy SPK-8011.Schwan said Roche was satisfied that the issues that emerged could be addressed with steroid treatment.HEAD STARTRoche's Spark deal, seen closing in the second quarter, follows Novartis's$8.7 billion purchase of U.S.-based Avexis last year, also to gain a platform of gene therapies for disorders including spinal muscular atrophy.Novartis has made gene therapy one of its focus areas, giving it a head start on Roche. U.S. approval of Novartis's SMA medicine is slated for coming months.Among Spark's top drug hopefuls is SPK-8011, for haemophilia A, expected to start Phase 3 trials in 2019. It is also working on treatments for Pompe disease, blindness-causing choroideremia and Huntington's disease.\"The needs of patients and families living with genetic diseases are immediate and their needs vast,\" Spark Chief Executive Jeffrey Marrazzo said.Roche already sells Hemlibra against haemophilia A that helps stop bleeding in patients with the genetic disorder that prevents their blood from clotting. Hemlibra, approved in 2017, had 224 million Swiss francs ($224.18 million) in sales last year.Schwan said he was not worried about gene therapy and Hemlibra cannibalising sales from each other. \"Our best guess is, it is complementary and that actually patients will need both options -- a medicine like Hemlibra, and increasingly over time, gene therapy,\" he said.With Spark, Roche enters a crowded haemophilia gene therapy market, as other players - Biomarin Pharma, Uniqure NV and Sangamo Therapeutics - also have gene therapies in the works.\"We view Biomarin likely first to market,\" Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider said. \"We view the market opportunity big enough to accommodate more than one gene therapy - but a favourable safety profile will likely win gold.\"($1 = 0.9992 Swiss francs)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he following companies are expected to repor  after hours on 02/21/2019.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, J.J. Bienaime. -- Thank you, Tracy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's call. 2018 was extremely productive year on execution for BioMarin. During the year when we advanced our three largest product opportunities to date, we grew the base business 14% to nearly $1.5 billion in revenues which is our best full-year results, and year-over-year GAAP net loss decreased 34% and non-GAAP income improved 23% demonstrating our continued focus on topline growth, expand controls and improve margins. We are projecting similar financial progress in 2019 as we work toward approval of both Valrox and Vosoritide, the achievement of which will be truly transformational for the company.Turning first to accomplishments in 2018 and 2019, I would look to Palynziq the treatment of phenylketonuria. US lunch began last July and continue to progress extremely well. The US PKU community has been very enthusiastic about Palynziq, given the dramatic [inaudible] demonstrated across our multi-year clinical program. For Palynziq outside of the US, we now expect the CHMP opinion for our market team authorization application in this first quarter of 2019. If the opinion is positive, we expect European commission action in the second quarter followed by the potential launch of Palynziq second half of this year. In a moment, Jeff will provide more information on European preparation as well as more recent metrics on the US Palynziq launch which is BioMarin's largest market opportunity today.Moving to another significant potential value driver this year, we look forward to a number of important updates with Valrox. As announced last month, we have completed enrollment of the cohorts of patients in the ongoing Phase 3 study with the 6e13 dose that are intended to satisfy accelerated filing requirements, depending on the results of [inaudible]. We will communicate our decision on whether or not we plan to file an expedited filing in the second half of this year.Currently we're on track to complete enrollment of all 130 subjects in the full Phase 3 study in the third quarter of this year. And finally, we expect to provide a three-year data update from our ongoing Phase 2 study of the 6e13 dose on the two-year update with the 4e13 dose in the middle of this year. And in a moment, Hank will provide some additional detail on Phase 3 enrollment progress as well as our plans on the Phase 2 data update.Turning now to Vosoritide for children with achondroplasia, we were very encouraged by the 42-month data that we shared at R&D day last November demonstrating an average cumulative height gain of 5.7 cm which is a significant outcome for the children in our Phase 2 study. We hope to prove efficacy in our global Phase 3 study which completed enrollment last November and is expected to weed out at the end of this year.Looking beyond these two late-stage products, we are leveraging our Valrox experience to give out in the next wave of gene therapy products, such as BMN307 for the treatment of phenylketonuria. We shared some exciting [inaudible] recently with BMN307 that demonstrated long-lasting normalization of Phe. We're on track to finalize these in the second half of the year with BMN307, and we believe this is just the beginning of our expansion into a broader gene therapy pipeline.In conclusion, we are very pleased with our accomplishments in 2018, and we are excited by the prospects for continued growth. In the near term we continue to target $2 billion in 2020 revenues which is next year and beyond that, given the strength of the base business and the potential for the big three Palynziq, Valrox and Vosoritide to drive substantial upside and long-term growth we expect the next few years are going to be truly transformational for the company.I will now turn the call to Jeff who will provide updates on the current commercial business. Jeff? -- Thank you, JJ. Starting with the US launch of our seventh commercial drug Palynziq, we want to provide some additional color on patient and physician demand since our last update in January. Both the patient and physician communities have been tremendously enthusiastic about Palynziq since approval in the US last May, and the numbers speak for themselves.Starting with commercial reimbursed patients, as of last Friday, February 15, we had a total of 335 patients on reimbursed Palynziq. Of those, 123 transitioned from our clinical studies, and 212 are formerly naive to Palynziq. We're very pleased with the opportunity that Palynziq provides to expand our reach into a broader patient population. We are seeing high levels of interest and enthusiasm from adult patients that had formerly been on or try old Kuvan but were not at the time a Palynziq referral as well as patients naive to both Kuvan and Palynziq.In addition, our strategy to proactively convert adult Kuvan patients who might benefit from additional Phe lowering from Palynziq has been quite successful. Only 35% of new Palynziq referrals are current Kuvan patients. Physicians are engaged in our commercial team is doing a tremendous job leveraging our experience and relationships in the PKU community to promote the availability of Palynziq treatment in the US.Also contributing to robust uptake is the number of clinics that have at least one complete patient enrollment defined as a patient having a complete enrollment form with direct connections coupled with a complete trend's enrollment. We can confirm that there are now 80 unique clinics of the 125 PKU clinics in the US that now have at least one complete patient enrollment. One final leading indicator of patient demand we want to share is the number of patients who are enrolled yet have not received their first commercial dose. As of Friday, February 15, that number was 131. So, a robust pipeline of patients awaiting their first treatment with Palynziq.Turning now to Palynziq revenues, we were pleased with the 2018 full year contribution of just over $12 million. Considering the time required to get patients started on therapy following enrollment the deliberate titration protocol for new patients that results in partial revenue per patient for at least their first eight weeks of treatment and the pacing of transitioning clinical patients to commercial Palynziq sales in 2018 tracked to plan. Based on the growing number of patients we expect the transition from the induction titration stage to daily dosing combined with current and expected enrollment rates are 2019 full year Palynziq revenue guidance is $70 million-$100 million.Should we receive EU approval of Palynziq in 2019, though we don't expect material EU revenues in 2019, we would expect to see a meaningful revenue contribution from that region beginning in 2020?Now, turning to other products in our commercial portfolio which drove 14% growth in nearly $1.5 billion for the full year 2018, first I'm glad to announce the fifth anniversary of the approval of Vimizim, the one and only product approved for the treatment of Morquio A. In 2018, Vimizim revenue grew 17% to $482 million for the full year compared to 2017. Uneven quarter to quarter ordering patterns from the Latin American region were offset by increased revenue from the Umea region resulting in a strong results for the full year.We expect to see continued steady growth of Vimizim now that pricing and reimbursement has been established in the vast majority of our commercial markets and then it's important to focus on annual revenue guidance for Vimizim and all of our global brands. For full-year 2019, we expect Vimizim net product revenues of $530-$570 million as we anticipate new patient growth in established markets and continued progress gaining access in smaller markets.Similar market dynamics were in play for Naglazyme despite uneven ordering patterns in the fourth quarter, strong results in the first three quarters of 2018 contributed to revenue of $346 million or a 4% increase for the full year. Importantly, recall that Naglazyme represents a steady cornerstone of our MPS franchise after 13 years on the market as demonstrated by an efficient growth of 6% in 2018. We expect this steady trend to continue in 2019 and expect Naglazyme revenue for the full year 2019 $350-$380 million.Moving now to Brineura for the treatment of CLN2 which contributed almost $40 million of revenue in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we continue to add new commercial patients resulting in net revenue of just over $12 million. Our teams around the world continue to focus their efforts on education of the early signs and symptoms of CLN2 disease and the importance of early diagnosis. We believe our efforts to increase awareness and testing of CLN2 will result in the steady diagnosis of children with CLN2 and we anticipate Brineura revenue of $55-$75 million in 2019.Finally, moving on to Kuvan which achieved 6% growth or $434 million of revenue in 2018. As we consider Kuvan market dynamics in the US in 2019, it is important to remember that many adult patients are choosing to start therapy with Palynziq including patients converting from Kuvan. New Kuvan patients tend to be children and teenagers who consume a relatively smaller total dose compared to adults and that contributes to smaller revenue per patient. For 2019, we anticipate full year Kuvan revenue of $420-$460 million due in part on our plan to focus on converting US Kuvan adults to Palynziq treatment given its superior efficacy.To summarize, I'm very pleased with the commercial team's performance across the globe in 2018 and believe we are well-positioned for continued in 2019. As the commercial team looks toward other key priorities in 2019 and beyond, we are extremely excited by the prospects of launching Palynziq in the EU, launching the first gene therapy product for the treatment of severe hemophilia A as well as the first treatment for children with achondroplasia and we are preparing for all three potential approvals accordingly.Now I'd like to the call over to Dan to provide financial update from the fourth quarter and full year. Dan? -- Thank you, Jeff. Please see today's press release summarizing our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2018. Overall, our excellent 2018 financial results show that we are tracking toward our long-term financial goals including growing revenues, controlling expenses, expanding margins, and ultimately delivering GAAP profitability.Starting with revenues, full-year 2018 topline growth was 14% to just under $1.5 billion and for full year 2019 consistent with our prior long-term guidance, we anticipate approximately 15% further topline growth to between $1.6 billion to $1.75 billion based solely on currently approved products. Moreover, as JJ noted, 2020 total revenue should grow an additional 15% and be approximately $2 billion with the expectation and the contributions from Vosoritide and Valrox take us significantly beyond those levels in the years ahead.Importantly, expense growth was less than revenue growth resulting in improved bottom-line results and reduced cash usage. Starting with GAAP net loss in 2018, it decreased 34% to a loss of $77 million for the full year and for full year 2019 we expect GAAP net loss to decline an additional approximately 16% based on the midpoint loss guidance of $45-$85 million. Moving to non-GAAP income for the second year, in 2018 we had an increase of 23% to $91 million, and for 2019 we expect further non-GAAP income improvement of approximately 65% based on the midpoint of our guidance of $130 million in income $270 million in income.Consistent with our financial progress in 2018, excluding repayment of the convertible debt, our net usage of cash and investments was $87 million for the full year. Recall that last October we paid the principal amount of our convertible bonds using $375 million of cash resulting in cash, cash equivalents, and cash investments totaling $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.8 billion on December 31, 2017.Moving to operating expenses, R&D expenses increased to $696 million for full year 2018 compared to $611 million for the full year 2017. The increase in R&D in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased Valrox production and support of process qualification activities to satisfy a potential accelerated filing and clinical trial expenses in support of the Phase 3 program. Vosoritide clinical expenses as we completed enrollment in the Phase 3 and BMN250 production expenses.Looking forward, R&D expenses in 2019 as a percent of revenues will continue to decline and on an absolute basis should expand modestly relative to 2018 consistent with the potential accelerated path and the AAV5 with Valrox, the IND filing for BMN307 as well as other clinical programs, such as 0 to 5-year-old study with Vosoritide. To support the numerous development programs advancing in 2019, full-year R&D expenses are expected to be $740-$780 million.SG&A expenses for 2018 expended marginally compared to 2017 to $604 million compared to $554 million for the full year 2017. The increase was primarily driven by Palynziq and Brineura product launch campaigns and preliminary Valrox commercialization effort. SG&A expenses in 2019 will increase to $650-$690 million driven primarily by activities associated with the global repellency launch and Valrox market preparations and general commercial expansion.And finally, a few comments on taxes. The tax expense benefit line was impacted in both 2018 and 2017 by US tax reform. In 2017, we had an $81 million tax expense primarily due to $83 million of charges purchase associated with the 2017 Tax Reform Act. A $42 million charge directly related to revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate and a $41 million valuation allowance related to California tax credits, related to tax planning changes driven by the Tax Reform Act.By contrast, in 2018, we had a $65 million tax benefit driven by $50 million of orphan drug tax credits recognized in 2018 and increased losses in the US. Our US-based operating loss for tax purposes increased in 2018 as a result of shifts in our global tax strategy due to tax reform whereby we recorded higher US-based R&D expense than in prior years.In summary, our financial results in 2018 set us up for another strong performance in 2019. Topline growth, cost controls, and cash use are all being managed with the goal of driving significant long-term shareholder value and profitability as we prepare for potential approvals of Valrox and Vosoritide. Now I would like to turn the call over to Hank. -- Thanks, Dan. Since the team has already outlined a number of our anticipated catalysts, I will touch on a few other items before we open the call to questions and answers. First, for Palynziq Europe, the marketing authorization application is under review and tracking to an anticipated CHMP opinion this quarter. We'll keep you posted on developments with the application but suffice to say European health authorities are well aware of the dramatic Phe lowering properties of Palynziq and the importance of lifetime treatment of phenylketonuria. We look forward to sharing news of the CHMP opinion in the near future and for potentially making Palynziq available to European phenylketonuria patients soon.Moving to Vosoritide, there's tremendous enthusiasm from families for the treatment of achondroplasia in patients under five years of age as demonstrated by the high level of interest in our infant and toddler study. I stated the FDA advisory committee on account of pleasure last spring, their strong support for starting treatment early in life as it may afford the most dramatic benefit for children with achondroplasia.We look forward to data from our 0 to 5-year-old study to providing important insight into the potential benefits for starting Vosoritide treatment early in life. The study is enrolling very well, we have nearly completed enrollment of Cohort 1 which includes children 24 to 60 months of age and having entered the expansion phase, Cohort 2 which includes 6 to 24-month-old infants has been authorized to enroll sentinels and this will be followed by expansion of the enrollment phase and is on track to be concluded by the year-end.To summarize, we're very pleased with the progress of our global Vosoritide development program including the large contemporaneous natural history study is under way, we believe results from our four-pronged development program will support improved clinical outcomes for children with achondroplasia. Results from our ongoing Phase 2 in older children have been encouraging, demonstrating an average age additional height gain of 5.7 cm in 42 months. Enrollment in the Phase 2 infant toddler studies is going well, and thus far Vosoritide has been generally well tolerated with no symptomatic adverse effects identified. We look forward to the next significant catalyst in the program with topline Phase 3 data readout by the end of the year.Briefly on Valrox, as we stated in January, we look forward to completing the next steps needing the support of BLA filing to the accelerated approval pathway. The completed enrollment of the initial cohort for the Generate 1 Phase 3 study intended to support this BLA and our focus now turned toward completing the manufacturing components of the CMC package, we expect to complete all manufacturing campaigns for a potential accelerated approval filing by the end of this quarter 1Q 2019. We're making great progress in all aspects of the BLA filing package, and as we have communicated, we will inform you of our decision of whether or not to pursue an accelerated path forward by the second half of this year.Turning now to ongoing enrollment in the Phase 3 Generate 1 study using 6e13 dose for Valrox, also known as the 301 study, we are pleased to share today that we have now enrolled over 100 subjects in the so-called 902 or non-interventional study whose purpose is to collect baseline leading rate data prospectively prior to treatment with Valrox the transgene. Of these subjects who have determined through the 902 study to be eligible for the Generate 1 study and Generate 2 studies, 95% or more are indicating their preference for the dose 6e13 dose over the 4e13 dose in the 302 study. Recall that the full 301 studies are full approval, 52-week study powered to demonstrate superior R&D versus standard of care and reducing bleeding. Achieving this enrollment milestone marks another achievement in our Valrox program, much as been accomplished in a very short period of time.Pioneering and develop of innovative products to improve health outcomes for patients with rare diseases is not new for BioMarin and we look forward to leveraging this experience with the endeavor to transform the treatment landscape for patients living with severe hemophilia A. The Valrox development journey has been fast and furious at times but is important to remember what has been accomplished. Durably control for severe hemophilia A patients was an inconceivable concept only a couple of years ago and that is exactly what has been demonstrated in the Valrox Phase 2 study today.I'm very proud of what's been accomplished thus far, and we look forward to learning more about Valrox as we prepare for the upcoming three-year data update of our Phase 2 program. As communicated previously we expect to provide a top line data update in the middle of this year followed by more detailed data presentation at a medical meeting. I would like to share with you today that we are planning to present the more detailed three-year Phase 2 Valrox data at the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis or ISTH whose abstract deadline for submission of late breakers is June 6.And finally to remind you of the other developments expected this year, in the middle of preparing to file for the IND filing for our PKU gene therapy product BMN307, recall the preclinical data we shared in January using NU-2 mouse model, which were used for Palynziq and which is close to the human PKU phenotype, we demonstrated that within two weeks the levels would normalize with BMN307 treatment continuing out to 80 weeks, well beyond the expected lifespan of the untreated NU-2 mouse. We look forward to putting this product in the clinic and to leveraging our Valrox manufacturing experience to initiate clinical studies with commercial scale material.These are the highlights of the R&D organization; I want to thank you for your continued support and turn the call back to the operator for fielding questions. Thank you.At this time, I would like to inform everyone in order to ask questions; please press *1 on your telephone keypad, again, that would be *1 on your telephone keypad. We have your first question comes from the line of Slaveen Richter from Goldman Sachs; your line is now open.Thanks for taking my question. Two questions for me, one is, do you have any other hypothesis for the pullback in expression levels that you saw with the hemophilia A program versus the circulating to noncirculating DNA? And then secondly, what is the gating factor to higher penetration into the MPS6 market, it seems per hour models that you're roughly a little higher than 50% penetrated at this time point? Thanks. -- Yeah, hi Slaveen, I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Jeff. Other hypotheses to depict the pullback in factor expression levels have been surfaced to include considerations like endoplasmic reticulum stress, we measure biomarkers of that both pre-clinically and clinically and are unable to document endoplasmic reticulum stress, we considered the possibility that corticosteroids are falsely elevating expression, we don't find evidence for that. We considered the possibility that there's promoter silencing or [inaudible] the vector, we don't see evidence of that. And so, we are left with speculating that the reason for the pullback in Factor VIII expression is a function of metabolizing the vector.And of course, and several months, we'll see where year three fits in regard, not just to Factor VIII, which is interesting but not as dramatically important to patients as long-term clinical outcomes such as sustained reduction in bleeding and improve quality of life. Jeff. -- Slaveen, this is Jeff, I'd like to address your question about penetration of the MPS6 patient population, at least that was on when your questions. We are at and have been at a little over 85% penetration of known patients for several years. The gating factor on growth of Naglazyme is almost entirely the identification of new patients, the vast majority of which we are able to get to treatment in a relatively short period of time.In the event your question was directed toward the Morquio A patient population, we are currently about 65% penetrated of known identified patients there, a substantially larger patient population. We've been added for less time, and we're still trying to get into some markets that we don't have commercial access to. So, probably the gating factor on higher penetration of the Morquio A patient population is getting into the secondary and tertiary commercial markets, and we're making progress on that.Great, thank you.Question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley; your line is now open.Hi, this is Ishmael Niang for Matthew, thank you for taking our question. Can you comment on the enrollment progress for the 4e13 dose in the hemophilia gene therapy study and what impact, if any, will the data have on an accelerated filing strategy? -- Hi Ishmael, 4e, we've said all along, was going to go slower than the 6e and my comment today that asked where screening patients for A85 positivity and running them through the baseline prospective bleed rate study, patients are like 95 to 5 holding their hand up for the 6e dose. We're going to continue to enroll in the baseline observational study once we conclude fully over enrolling it for the 301 6e dose, we can start talking to patients about whether they are interested in rolling in the 4e study or waiting for commercial 6e program. But we had always anticipated that the 4e was gonna go slower. Patients are very much voting with their feet; they want a higher level of factor expression if they can get it. -- Again, this has zero impact on the timing of our accelerated filing. Hank just said, we've heard many rumors that patients would like lower levels they would prefer that, but we have here on a sample of over 100 patients faced with the decision of which [inaudible] they wanna have the low dose or the high dose which could generate higher Factor VIII level, 95% of them.The next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cohen and Company; your line is now open.Good evening, thanks for taking my question. Hank, just to start with you on your guidance around the ISTH meeting, are we to take from your comments that were likely to see that top line released around the deadline for the late-breaker abstract submission, so maybe early June we get the top line release with the full data at the meeting in July? -- Well, Phil, all I said literally was the late-breaker deadline was June 6 and I need to let you do the rest of the calculations.Okay. And then -- -- It's not crazy to say you're interested in Valrox being around in early June.Got it, and then second on what you consider topline data versus full data, it sounds like productions in bleeding will certainly be topline data, what about factor expression levels? Would that be either in the top line or the ISTH presentation? -- Well, my view of that is that bleeding is what people care about, it's what payors care about, quite like it's also what people care about, but I'm also very aware that people are trying to use factor expression levels to try to predict for how long Valrox will last for people. So, I would imagine that that will be an element of the top line as well.Got it, OK. -- I think one of the most important things, sorry Phil, to keep in mind about the top line is, again, people need to be remembering one stage in chromogenic substrate assays, when we provide the data, we'll try to put that in an easy-to-understand format, so everybody understands which values we're talking about.That's very clear. And then just one commercial question on Palynziq, are you seeing anything different in the commercial setting about the dose titration that is being used versus what you had thought based on the clinical trials and also the side effect profile, so the commune reactions are they at all in different frequencies of severity in the commercial setting versus what you had seen in clinical trials? -- Well, starting with the dose and titrations schedule, it had been sometime since we had been dosing new patients in the clinical trial and if you recall, in the clinical trial setting one of the things that we adjusted during that program was to a docent titration schedule along with recommended premeds that would maximize the response and minimize and toward effects. So, so far, no surprises, most of the clinics that are dosing patients are following the package insert in the dose titration schedule, and we are starting to see some patients that are getting to an efficacy response that 20 mg patients or 20 mg per day, I think I reported nine at the J.P. Morgan conference, and that number has gone up in the last six weeks. So, that's encouraging.What we don't know yet is whether that efficacy response is going to stop at 20 mg daily or progress to 40 mg daily and we don't have enough time yet to observe any patients moving up to the 40 mg dose. And maybe I would ask Hank to comment on what he seeing and anaphylaxis. -- Sure, Jeff's team and my team keep a real close eye on this together and we see and anaphylaxis rate crudely which is consistent with or maybe even slightly lower than what we observe in the package insert, although as Jeff just observed there's not a huge amount of and yet since we just launched the drug in July, and it took a little while for some of the naive patients to get commercial authorization. So, we are really just coming up on the wave were going to get into triple digit numbers of patients who have been on drug for at least six months.I think one of the things I am very encouraged about, about this, is we do see anaphylaxis occurring, but the majority of patients who have it are successfully rechallenged so that in the commercial setting, which we capitulate to what we saw in the clinical study, in the clinical trial studies, the majority of patients who had an anaphylactic event are able to successfully receive continued Palynziq safely and the fact that doctors are doing that in the commercial setting as well bodes really well because I think that the key thing to keep your eye on is discontinuations due to adverse events. We want to keep that number as low as possible because we can get you past the first six months, the odds are you're going to stay on Palynziq for a very, very long time. So, Jeff and I and our teams are keeping a very close eye on things on that.That's very helpful, thanks for taking my questions.The next question comes from the line of Martin Auster from Credit Suisse; your line is now open. -- Hi, this is Mark Nguyen for Marty, thanks for taking my question. I guess my question is related to the Valrox high titer study, would you be able to provide an update of enrollment of that study and potential timing for data there? And in addition, could you outline what the immunosuppression protocol is for that study? Thank you. -- Yeah, OK. So, if we're talking about the high titer study if that study 203 and AA85 positive patients, their titers are actually not that high. In the while, people don't really have a lot of titer to AA85, certainly nothing remotely like the titer that developed after you been treated with the A80 capsid. We are starting at relatively even lower titer patients first to see if we can affect gene transfer in those patients. Unfortunately, that study is going a little slowly, finding AA85 positive patients, they are not the majority of patients as we've said before and so I can't give you any more specific enrollment update.You asked about the immunosuppressive regimen that's used in that has the potential to be a very confusing question and let me take a bit of a step back first. We talk about immunosuppression, I think with the field most significantly thinking about is the prevention of a cytotoxic T response close gene transfer which can kill the liver and cause the loss of Factor VIII expression. We don't see that phenomenon in AA85 capsid, and we've gone into some length into previously explaining what our data are at least on our Phase 2 study and were very grateful to Dr. Mingozzi whose lab has done all the characterization of the side effects of T response. You'll recognize that name; he is a key opinion leader in the field, he's also Spark's Chief Scientific Officer so, I think it carries some extra credibility when his lab is not able to document T cell responses to our capsid.So, we're not giving corticosteroids to affect and immunosuppression to block the catastrophic loss of Factor VIII expression and Doc Spark is in the process of testing the hypothesis that their immunosuppressive regimen can block catastrophic loss of factor expression. I'd say stay tuned to that data on the one side, but on the other side, it's not really especially relevant to us.The other thing that people talk about is if you have a pre-existing or you develop a titer to AA85, can you immunosuppress to enable subsequent treatment. Now as I said, for us that's a relatively lower bar because AA85 serum prevalence is relatively low and the titers are relatively low. So, we've got some laboratory concepts of what we want to do from an immunosuppressive point of view, but first, we want to see if we can affect gene transfer in relatively lower titer patients who are in this 203 AA85 positive study.Now, way in the back in the back of people's minds are what if you got an AA85 dose, and 10 years later, 15 years later you need another dose, you been drinking a lot, you been taking a lot of acetaminophen, whatever, your liver is worn out, and you need another dose of Valrox. We have, because of how far that problem is in front of us, we haven't put together a clinical trials concept for how we might achieve immunosuppression in that context yet just because we haven't observed enough loss of expression to make us want to investigate that climate.So, big picture, immunosuppression not a big thing for BioMarin, relevant to other members in the community. Our evidence is both stock data as well as don't see catastrophic loss of Factor VIII expression accompanying T cell satisfactory response and stay tuned for more data on whether you need to even immunosuppress patients who have borderline low titers of AA85 positive. Hopefully, that was comprehensive answer to a relatively short question. -- Got it, thank you.The next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz from SVB Leerink; your line is now open. -- Thank you very much. I have a question on Palynziq and then Valrox. So, how is the EMA review of Palynziq been progressing relative to what you experienced in the United States? Are there any notable differences in the issues that are most important to the different agencies? -- Hi Joe, I'll just give you a qualitative. It's going better actually than where we were in the US, and I think to talk about that concretely, we need to get a little further into -- we need to get to the tail end of the process so we can put the exclamation in the point on top of it, but just to say I think it's going better. We've seen, for example, drafts of some of the language that would be relevant, and we're encouraged by that. When we're saying that were guiding you to an opinion in March, if you're an aficionado of the CHF you process, you know they meet at regularly scheduled times. You have to meet certain submission dates. So, we are pretty tight in on what we think is going to happen and when we think it can happen. -- The end of the first quarter is not very far from now. -- That's very helpful, thank you. -- Useful direction. -- Absolutely, thanks again. So, then on Valrox, given that development has been fast and furious at times, how are you planning to coordinate or perhaps already coordinating with payors in order to support a smooth rollout in the marketplace when the time comes that's consistent with current perspectives of value in healthcare? -- That's a great question, Joe, and we see the payor perspective as one of the unique challenges of commercializing Valrox. As others have stated often, we're talking about a change in paradigm from chronic treatment to one-time curative therapy and healthcare systems not only in the US but in other markets that are not accustomed to dealing with this. On the positive side, I think that a commercial experience in the United States and around the world puts us in a uniquely good position to deal with that challenge.We've been meeting with payors participating in cross-stakeholder groups addressing this issue for a year and a half at least. So, we've been pretty active on that front. We meet with payors individually now in the United States and in Europe we've been meeting with them not only in cross-stakeholder groups but in groups organized solely by BioMarin. Probably the US the more challenging environment for a couple of reasons. One is the fragmentation of payors and different type of payors. You've got commercial payors, you've got Medicaid payors, you've got Medicare payors. And the second is kind of the overlay of the government pricing rules and the price reporting rules such that the things that you want to do with certain payors could read through to really bad discount levels that would have to be extended to government payors.We are not alone in addressing that, I think their stakeholders inside of the government and other payors that are trying to address this. We've got a little time to work this out and so forth. It's certainly possible in the US if that was our first approval, that we could be starting on kind of a traditional one-time payment while models for other types of payment structures were being worked out and facilitated.And finally, we do see some players already taking shape in the United States so; there's Luxturna that's on the market, watching that. Novartis could add an SMA gene therapy on the market in the not-too-distant future and before Valrox hits the market and that would also be instructive to watch the experience there. So, in short, we haven't solved for this problem, but we are really active and were all over it. -- Let me add that it's likely that we might end up with different paying structures in different parts of the world or even in the US we also may have different paying structures depending on the payors. Some might be more interested in paying most of the value of the product up front, some overtime, some overtime based on performance. We are very open to those needs and willing to satisfy the different needs of the different segments in the market. But I just want to also emphasize even if we file for accelerated approval, it's likely that by the time we get approval we will have between four and five years of data with the Phase 2 patients whereby we will hopefully be able to demonstrate sustained reduction in seeing episodes and elimination or significantly reduce need for Factor VIII injections which is kind of the basis of the cost-effectiveness of the product. -- Right, thank you.The next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from J.P. Morgan; your line is now open.Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions, I also have one on Palynziq and one on Valrox. So, first, a follow-up on the tolerability profile of Palynziq, can you talk a little bit about how the dropout rate for the drug compares, in the real world, compares with what you saw in clinical trials? We also heard from a KOL who said patients are able to continue with the drug post anaphylaxis event but are you finding that any of the naive patients drop off as they start to go through the administration process or are, they able to put up with it and kind of learn to get through it? -- Hi Cory, this is Hank. I'll start and then Jeff I don't know if you want to add some color, but just the tolerability profile that we see today relatively low sample size because of relatively just getting started in July with commercialization, but it's tracking to be at or lower than what we observed in the clinical trials. We challenged success occurring in the majority of patients just as we had observed in the clinical trials. And the overall dropout rate is relatively low, and in fact, it has more to do with the logistics and in one case internal family planning considerations in another case. So, relatively infrequent dropouts and relatively encouraging news about a relatively low anaphylaxis rate and positively challenged safety. Jeff, did you want to add anything about your current experience? -- Well, and going back to Hank's earlier comments about anaphylaxis, an issue here is our total end patients is growing pretty rapidly, but kind of the area of under the curve over time, there's not that much time for many of those patients to draw conclusions. But we did note in the press release how many commercial patients we've got on therapy. In total so far, we've had seven patients that were naive to treatment discontinue therapy and kinda for a mix of I would say generally tolerability coupled with lifestyle considerations. We also lost a couple of patients that discontinued for family planning purposes. So, the ends are pretty small, but I'm really encouraged that a drop off of seven patients at this stage in the game is not overly concerning so far. -- Okay, that's very helpful. And then on Valrox, I wanted to also ask on the pending three year update and kinda ask you the question the way we're asked about it and that's how do you think about the durability of Factor VIII expression levels insofar as is there a rough threshold you hope to be over at the three year time point and how has the FDA communicated to you the relative importance of Factor VIII levels versus bleeding rates? -- Boy, so, Factor VIII levels versus bleeding rates, let's start with that part first. Basically, what they have communicated to us is that you can apply for accelerated approval, will approve on the basis of Factor VIII levels alone provided that you convince us that the assay that you're using is a valid measure of Factor VIII activity and that you can document that a substantial proportion of patients who are treated with your gene therapy get into the non-hemophiliac range and you can document that their bleeding rate that you've observed post gene transfer is reasonably likely to predict clinical outcomes. So, that's how to think about where Factor VIII played a role. It doesn't really play much of a role in the full approval consideration per se, and so far, it hasn't played any role in durability discussions that we've had.I suppose that confirmation of continued expression, which is what we at BioMarin expect to be the midyear update will be reassuring to the FDA and I suppose that if the data are unexpected that we'll have to have new conversation based on new expectations, but so far, that has not been durability of expression beyond two or three years has not been a key concern of the FDA. And I have to say; when I interact with the medical community, their working assumption is if you put the turn key in, it's going to stay in. And so, they don't have a lot of questions about durability other than we just want to see the data. -- Okay, great, thank you very much. -- And again, I think we have communicated this, but there is a precedence with Factor IX in patients, Dr. Nortiore presented data last year from patients that were eight years now after the treatment, you know they had T Factor IX levels in the mid-teens and then after several years they were below 10%, at eight years they were definitely below 10% and the patient still had no significant spontaneous bleeding episode after eight years with blood levels, with Factor IX levels significantly under 10% and no need for Factor IX infusions. That reassured that company. -- They didn't start as high as we are starting so, our expectations maintained factor levels much closer to the non-hemophiliac range than what JJ was saying. We are not setting you up to expect 5% at ISP. -- No, we're not. -- Okay, that's good, thanks, guys.The next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray; your line is open. -- Hey, thanks, guys. I guess since we're only asking about Palynziq and Valrox, I'll follow the pattern if that's OK. So, two questions, I guess on Palynziq, just eyeballing the trends between naive and clinical trial patients, it seems like the naive patient load seems to be accelerating I guess faster than the clinical trial participants and by my count for example since the end of the year, you added 72 naive patients but only 11 clinical trial patients? I think I remember you guys talking about at launch that you had hoped to get that full 200 number sort of converted of clinical trial patients. Can you maybe talk about what's going on there with those that have yet to convert, those clinical trial patients? -- So, good observation Chris, I think your observations are correct, and we just need to give you kind of the simple answer behind that. So, they were approaching 200 patients in the clinical trial program some of which stayed in an extension study and have continued in that extension study because they have dose that's higher than the label dose. That, I think we communicated at the time, there were about 160 patients at the labeled doses of up to 40 mg that we would expect to be transitioning to commercial and we've been working on that.What we've experienced at that 160, we have some patients that have lacked insurance and some patients we had kind of extended periods of times working through reimbursement approvals. So, at the end of January at JP Morgan, we reported 112 of those patients were on reimburse therapy as of 12/31, that's gone up to 123 as of February 15, and we're continuing to make progress against that 160 patient or so number from the clinical trial.At the same time, the rate of new patient referral has been going on. It's about six weeks on average from a new patient referral coming into the time that we start those patients. So, we've got more momentum going on with new patients. So, we'll be working on both of those different cohorts, but the new patients or the previously naive patients are going to start overwhelming completely the clinical trial population this year. -- Great, and then maybe if you'll bear with me on another Valrox question and the factor on the whole issue around factor levels, we do get a ton of questions from investors on what to expect. And maybe I hear what you're saying with respect to FDA cares most about ABR rates, etc., but maybe Jeff -- -- In the long term, not in the short term. -- Right, exactly, yeah. And so, just assuming that that holds up, right? And whatever number you present, maybe Jeff could you talk about what pay our discussions you've had with respect to that long-term factor expression level in terms of what they're looking for? -- Well, payors are focused in part on durability, you know that's a big variable for them and payors are very pragmatic and practical people and they say well, we'll want to see the data when you get there in terms of durability and recognizing that nobody's gonna wait around for 10 years to see what 10 year data looks like before patients get treated. This has them talking about well, how do we risk mitigate against the variable of durability if we are approving patients for treatment and what's clear is that when the payors are thinking about durability, they are thinking about two things. First is annual bleed rates or bleed rates and the second is concomitant utilization or not of factor replacement. Those are the two things that they care about. -- Great, thank you.The next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch; your line is now open. -- Hey, guys, it's Aspen on for Ying, thanks for taking our questions. So, first for Valrox, can you remind us the FDA requirements on the accelerated filings, specifically what saturate were looking for with which assay? And then on the Vosoritide, can you talk at all about how the Phase 2 patients are doing beyond the 42 months? Are you still seeing durable effect on AGB? Thank you. -- So, what factoring level, which assay. So, chromogenic substrate assay, non-hemophiliac range above 40 IU per deciliter. What we haven't specified is the statistical test in what numerator, what denominator, but we have good clear-eyed discretion with the FDA about that, and as we said at J.P. Morgan earlier, we have already enrolled the sufficient denominator and now we're waiting for the data to mature before talking about it with the FDA as to its file ability. As far as -- -- The timeframe is 6 to 12 months? -- Measured as early as 23 to 26 weeks and taking no longer than 52 weeks to gather all of the data that's pertinent to that accelerated approval filing package. We jus  ed the 42-month data two months ago, three months ago, so, I would say don't look for another update from us until maybe a year from now roughly. And the key catalyst that's happening between now and then anyway is the pivotal 301 randomized, double-blind clinical trial.I think we've very convincingly established that the effective sorta durable adds up, now we just have to finish our pivotal trial in the other three prongs of our program. -- Thanks.The next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi; your line is now open. -- Maybe go to the next, operator?Your line is now open. -- Operator, maybe we'll go to the next caller? Thank you.The next question comes from the line of Tim Lugo from William Blair; your line is now open.Thanks for the question. For the Phase 2 of Vosoritide infant and young children study, what is the growth you're seeing for that three-month baseline run in and how does that compare versus what you noted in the older patients and may be natural history and what normal healthies look like? -- Yeah, there was a slide I think the agency showed it at the AMCOM that's from a Julie Hoover Fong study published in 2008 which looked at AGV and achondroplasia as a function of age and over the first two to three or four years of life, AGV drops dramatically before stabilizing from about your age five to the prepubescent at about 5 cm per year, or 4 cm per year I should say. So, when you ask what's the expected growth rate for the under-five population, it very much depends on whether you're talking about a four-year-old or three-year-old or two-year-old and the range can be as much as for example 8 cm off the top of my head, I want to say that the average growth velocity for four-year-old, but for a one-year-old might be expected to grow more.Off the top of my head, I don't know what number. So, there's a very steep decline in the AGV untreated natural history population. And that's a big part of why people are so interested in treating patients from an earlier time point. I mean that's when most of the disproportionality sets in, and that's when most of the loss of stature happens.So, as a follow-up, are you just going to match against that natural history kind of on a per patient basis or are you looking for some sort of average like you mentioned for the 4 cm versus 6 cm of average children with achondroplasia in the past? -- Well, healthy over the five-year-old study and the under five-year-old studies were placebo-controlled for a year. So, there won't be any need for matching for the year long. Where matching could be relevant is what it all add up to in terms of cumulative height gain compared to an untreated population. That's where our ongoing natural history study will be very important where we can match patients by say tenor stage, gender, baseline age, baseline parental height and where one group is no Vosoritide treatment, and the other has got say for or five years of Vosoritide treatment. That's how we can get to the what did it all add up to a portion of the discussion.Okay, in this will only inform safety in the package that you eventually submit and not efficacy for this patient population? -- Well, it's a little early to talk about what's good to be in the package insert. You could imagine it supporting both in the sense of people really do care, you know if I'm putting my child on Vosoritide or any growth promoting agent, what can I expect is the ultimate outcome. So, I don't want to predict where the ages going to come out on this, but it's certainly been an important topic of discussion between us and them, and we are doing a fairly robust evaluation of what is that all add up to. So, I would be surprised if it doesn't make its way into a package insert, but you know we've got several rivers to cross still.Yep, understood, thank you.The next question comes from Akash Tewari from Wolfe Research; your line is now open.Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So, according to our calculations, it seems that factor levels are somewhere between 35 and 40 at year two using a chromogenic assay. With that in mind, with the team internally be surprised that in the three year update factor levels had drifted below 30 and I guess more broadly, are you comfortable with this idea of where the street is where this midyear Valrox update is now becoming kind of a -- it's gonna prove whether circularization theory is true or not. How instructive is the three-year update in terms of that long-term theory?And then on your PKU gene therapy. So, it looks like the data we got at the R&D day was using your metering construct. So, just to clarify, are you able to show lifetime durability using a humanized construct and what type translational work are you doing with nonhuman primates in order to get a better understanding on how 307 will behave in patients? Thanks so much. -- Wow, want to take a shot at BioMarin because that was a lot of stuff that we want to cover. So, let me start by first clarifying that we show the two-year data the World Federation for Hemophilia using the one stage assay, at the end of that two-year time point, I think the mean off the top of my head was about 46%. We've also said that the chromogenic is about 60% of the value of the one stage assay. So, you might've been a little high when you were using numbers for the two-year chromogenic. I think our number would be at around 26%. So, we would regard stabilization as not to minus within that 26%.As far as long-term durability, how much will we be informed about hypothesis, I'd be willing to bet all my money that no matter what we present ISTH, there's going to be another hypothesis about why it's gonna wear off next week and so I would just pull back a little bit and just remind that the people have been working on vector design for a long time, and durability of expression has been a huge consideration in the relationship between durable forms of the vector and vector design has really been investigated quite intensely and our expectation about durable expression really comes from those experiments as well as experiments that we've done as well as other investigators that have shown that when she gets the vector in and regardless of short-term expressions in protein, the vector stays in. That's also assuming by the way that there's no immune hepatitis as others have observed, not us.So, our expectation is that there will be a long-term durable expression, that it will validate that the way we design the vector recapitulates what's been observed in prior vector designed work and that we will face a well of additional new hypotheses that are generated at that year for in year five and year six .As far as the constructs used for 307, we showed you both the mirroring construct going out a really long time and shorter duration experiments for the human construct. You can't evaluate durability of expression of the human construct in the mirroring species studies giving the heterologous nature of the protein. So, the experiments that -- meaning foreign species, so the experiments that documented durable expression were done with the mirroring construct. We have no reason to expect in humans; the human construct will behave any differently.And I think your last question was about nonhuman primates, but I think we've covered a lot of ground right here. -- Operator, next question.Participants, please limit your questions to one. So, our next question comes from the line of Paul Mateis from Stifel; your line is now open.Hi, thanks for taking the question, this is Nate on for Paul. I guess just one on Vosoritide. Beyond growth velocity, are there any other key elements of the data may be bone ratios or any other or any other medical complications or something like that that might be important from a regulatory perspective? -- Safety, and not because there's a particular safety hypothesis but just that when you ask about any other, and we are accumulating a fairly large safety database. We have an ongoing randomized pivotal trial that will be fairly definitive for evaluating safety and getting rid of any concerns about hypotensive episodes. Safety in the younger populations we'll have available for market authorization submission. So, in terms of the FDA initial decision, benefit, risk, benefit is good to be principally driven by consideration of the height velocity gain, risk, safety, overall with no particular signal generated so far.Functionality, proportionality, bone health, all academically interesting, all scientifically interesting, not particularly key from a regulatory perspective. All around pretty covered by in May giving advice to the FDA on design of clinical trials in the achondroplasia patients and if you go back to that, you'll see our program pretty closely matches the FDA's advisory committees' recommendations for development program. So, mainly efficacy, AGV, long-term outcomes, height gains, and then safety considerations mainly in the target population but also in very younger patients.The next question comes from the line of Eliana Merle from Cantor Fitzgerald; your line is now open. -- Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Just on hemophilia again, you guys seem very confident in seeing durability after year three. If you do not see durability to the way that you define it, would this change anything about sort of your future plans or timelines for your other gene therapy programs at all? And I guess how much of your manufacturing capacity are you holding for hemophilia? Thanks. -- We haven't done a lot of scenario planning around durability post-ISTH simply because of the expectation of that expression will be durable, and I don't know if JJ want to add anything else? -- Based on everything we know, and again, the animal data the Factor IX experience we believe that it's likely that we're going to have a durable threefold factor in terms of dramatic reduction in bleeding episodes and Factor VIII replacement units. So, we're not really planning on this scenario. And also, I mean it will depend if anything happens as to what are the reasons, but I mean right now, we're going full blast on the PKU gene therapy program, very unlikely that that's gonna change.This is Robert Baffi -- -- Based on the manufacturing.Yeah, so what we reported at R&D day is we have capacity for 4000 patients per year at the highest dose, and we are prepared to apply that capacity to ensure that we can meet all of the commercial demand for Valrox when approved. -- And next year we can move to 5000 patients with a minimum investment in the same facility and adding some equipment should we need to have capacity beyond 5000 patients, by the way, that would be a combination of potentially Valrox and PKU clinical trials and PKU infusion therapy. We already are making plans for a second facility, it's a little early to pull the trigger for that one, and I'm looking forward to the day when we have -- we are running out of capacity at 5000 patients per year at about $2-$3 million patient.The next question comes from the line of Whitney Ijem from Guggenheim line is now open.Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one on hemophilia again. In terms of the medical community or patient community, focus on the factor level from a longer-term perspective in the context of some of the micro-bleeds and other issues that might occur in the mild range that maybe aren't captured by an ABR? -- Yeah, I went to a great symposium that was sponsored by Sparks on factor levels all that matters are just some of the other considerations matter. And you're absolutely right that there's more to this than just factor expression and one of the things that we are very intrigued by is our quality of life data which kind of ties to micro-bleeds, very difficult to measure clinically, micro-bleed. More straightforward to measure quality of life. We use this instrument called Hemoqual Validated and Hemophilia studies, and what was shown in the use of that instrument was that all domains improved from pretreatment baseline and that improvement continues in year two over year one even while this pullback as Slaveen like to call it, and the factor expression levels was occurring.So, we think that there's good strong evidence for there being more to gene therapies benefit restoring Factor VIII levels or stopping ABR's, stopping Factor VIII is improving quality of life. This, by the way, is very important as Jeff Ajer sitting to my right because the value proposition for patients is contained in way more just simply the offset of factor use. Now having said all of that, you are asking about what the patient's perspective. A patient was a panelist on the symposium that I went to it was really interesting because he spoke about all the other considerations and benefits, but at the end, the chair of the panel asked the patient so, if you were given a choice between a gene therapy which produces let's say a mild degree of protection or a more wholesome degree of protection , which would you rather take?And the patient said are you kidding me? I want the high dose stuff. And so, I thought that was also pretty profound because it speaks directly to the question you're asking, what patients prefer. They want the whole package, they want ABR reduction, they won't factor reduction, they want durable expression, they want bleed control persisting through a number of years, they want improved quality of life. They want to live as close to a normal life as they can. They want to increase their activity, which you can't really do when you're mildly hemophiliac. So, they want the values to be as close to the non-hemophiliac ranges they can get. -- And that answer from the patient at our competitor's symposium is consistent again with the 95% of the patients that are preferring the high dose to the low dose in our own trial.The next question comes from the line of Edward Nash from SunTrust; your line is now open.Thanks for taking the question. The first question I want to ask on the MPS3 program, can you guys give us some guidance in terms of your regulatory strategies? -- Not much more than we said previously which is that the agencies put out a guidance document for slowly progressive of diseases, we're studying it very carefully. There's almost certainly an accelerated approval pathway there based on normalization of the substrate which accumulates and is responsible for the disease. But we are still in the collecting the primary data phase. So, it's a little early still to be talking about regulatory strategy other than just an awareness of the evolving regulatory landscape for enzyme replacement therapy.The next question comes from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets; your line is now open.Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a housekeeping question. I was wondering if you could comment sort of globally what the impact of net pricing has been sort of across the portfolio versus prior years and how that's baked into guidance if we're sort of seeing increased headwinds here? And then additionally, on the Palynziq patient switch guidance it seems like maybe about 50 patients so far have switched from Kuvan, some of these adult patients, could you maybe help us understand what percent of Kuvan patients are adult versus pediatric and adolescent and potentially susceptible to this cannibalization and is that 35% switch trend baked into the Kuvan guidance? Thank you. -- I'll start, and then I'll have Jeff answer your question on the patient switch on Palynziq. For the net pricing, I don't know exactly what you mean. If you mean the issue of gross versus net, we got a rebate which is something that happens a lot in the big Pharma industry. At BioMarin, we do not rebate whatsoever, so if this is your question, the fact of this potential regulation or changing regulation of BioMarin is zero. Was that your question? Rebates related? -- Maybe a take on the other question about Kuvan to Palynziq switch. So, our experience so far is 35% of our naive to treatment patients' referrals are coming straight over from Kuvan and based on the total number of enrollments we've got that is 344 as of well, I'll quote a different number, just 35%, we were talking about a little bit over 120 patients that are coming over from Kuvan so far and in terms of our guidance, it's exactly into account when providing the 2019 guidance. So, we're expecting that our adult patient population on Kuvan is going to reduce modestly and not dramatically, that we will continue to see increases in our pediatric population on Kuvan and the combination of that results in the guidance that we provided.And how many adults on Kuvan, that was part of the question. -- It's about a 40/60 mix adult and pediatric,In the US. -- In the US.So, the 100 as a relatively small fraction of the overall Kuvan adult population. -- Yeah, although again, I think in the long term this is good for BioMarin to switch adult Kuvan patients to Palynziq because as you know, it is anticipated that generic competition will occur in the Q4 of 2020. So, that is not something we want to prevent, that something we want to encourage.The next question comes from the line of Liana Moussatos from Wedbush Securities. In the interest of time, this will be the last question today. Liana, your line is open.Thank you. So, Valrox pricing, did I hear JJ correctly say $2 million-$3 million per patient in the manufacturing question? And if not, what would be an appropriate range, and would you include redosing? -- So, what I said is that let's assume we can demonstrate in 4 to 5 years of clinical banking in terms of the need for recombinant factor injections or any treatment of the hemophiliac patients. The metric is just this is background metrics, the metric is that if you look at severe hemophilia patients is on prophylactic Factor VIII therapy, 2 to 3 times per week or a few patients that will potentially be taking Hemlibra, the price for an adult patient between $700,000 and $800,000 a year. So, you multiply this by four or five, and that's the background of the pharmaco-economics we are dealing with. I would not be giving the price, but this is just the metrics are there.There are no further questions; I'll turn the call back over to Chairman and CEO JJ Bienaime, -- Well, thank you, operator, and thank you all for participating in our call today. So, 2018 was a notable year for BioMarin. We grew revenues to nearly $1.5 billion while we advanced three potential blockbuster products which are our largest market opportunities today. So, our financial discipline, our focus on expense controls and margin improvements will continue throughout 2019 and beyond. So, we all want to thank you think, we want to thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress throughout the year.

Adjusted loss per share was 1 cent in the year-ago quarter.The adjusted loss excludes amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and a contingent consideration expense; benefit from income tax; and a gain on sale of intangible assets.Total revenues were $353.2 million in the reported quarter, down 1% from the year-ago period due to lower product revenues. Moreover, sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $380 million.In response to the poor quarterly performance, shares were down almost 6% in after-hours trading. In the past year, BioMarin's shares have risen 7% while the  witnessed a decline of 17.7%.Product revenues were $347.2 million in the fourth quarter, down 1.2% year over year, due to lower Naglazyme sales and Aldurazyme sales volume. Royalty and other revenues were $6.06 million in the quarter, higher than $4.7 million in the year-ago period. New drugs Brineura and Palynziq did well in the quarter.Kuvan revenues rose 4% to $112.2 million. Kuvan sales were hurt, to an extent, by patient switching to Palynziq, given its superior efficacy profile.Naglazyme sales declined 18% year over year to $76.7 million due to volatility of central government ordering patterns. Vimizim contributed $114.0 million to total revenues, flat year over year.Naglazyme and Vimzim revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from some countries, mainly Brazil.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties - totaling $17.4 million - from Sanofi's  subsidiary, Genzyme in the quarter, down 39% year over year owing to lower volume of product sales to Genzyme due to unfavorable timing of shipments.Brineura generated sales of $12.2 million in the fourth quarter compared with $9.9 million in the previously reported quarter, indicating a sequential increase of 23.2% as BioMarin continued to add new commercial patients.BioMarin's newest drug, Palynziq (pegvaliase) injection grossed sales of $8.1 million in the fourth quarter compared with $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2018. Palynziq was approved in May 2018 for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) and was launched in July.As of Feb 15, 2019, 335 U.S. commercial patients were on treatment with Palynziq. Of the 335 patients, 123 were from clinical studies and 212 were naive to Palynziq treatment. Another 131 patients have enrolled and are awaiting their first treatment with Palynziq. In the EU, a marketing application is under review with a decision expected in the second quarter of 2019.Research and development (R&D) expenses rose 1.6% year over year to support expansion of its pipeline program. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 2.6% in the quarter due to marketing expenses associated with Brineura and Palynziq commercial efforts.Full-year 2018 sales rose 14% to $1.49 billion, marginally missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 billion. Revenues were within the guided range of $1.47 \u2212$1.53 billion.Adjusted earnings for 2018 were 40 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents. However, earnings rose 53.9% year over year.BioMarin expects total revenues in the range of $1.68 \u2212$1.75 billion in 2019.

It is conducting two separate phase III studies on the candidate - GENEr8-1 (6e13 vg/kg dose) and GENEr8-2 (4e13 vg/kg dose) - in patients without pre-existing AAV5 antibodies. Enrollment in both the studies is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2019.BioMarin completed enrollment of the initial cohort of patients in the GENEr8-1 study that will be included in a potential accelerated submission. However, BioMarin will take a decision regarding a biologics license application submission through an accelerated approval pathway in the second half of 2019.BioMarin is also conducting a separate phase I/II study to evaluate the 6e13 vg/kg dose in severe hemophilia A patients with pre-existing AAV5 antibodies.Another important candidate in its pipeline is vosoritide, which is currently in a phase III study for the treatment of children (ages 5-14) with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism. The study is fully enrolled and top-line data from this study is expected by the end of 2019. 42 month data from the study presented at R&D day in November demonstrated an average cumulative height gain of 5.7 cm on treatment with vosoritide.In addition, BioMarin is conducting a separate phase II study to evaluate the effect of vosoritide in infants and toddlers (ages 0-5 years) in June 2018.Other interesting candidates include enzyme replacement therapy tralesinidase alfa/BMN 250 (phase I/II for Sanfilippo B syndrome or MPS IIIB) and BMN 290 (in pre-clinical studies for Friedriech's ataxia, a rare neurologic disorder).Moreover, a gene therapy program (BMN 307) for PKU is expected to move into clinical studies in 2019. An investigational new drug application (IND) for BMN 307 is expected to be filed in the second half of 2019. At its R&D day, BioMarin discussed compelling preclinical BMN 307 data.

Unfortunately, the company's track record got more disappointing on Thursday when managemen  ed  from an early-stage trial evaluating gene-editing therapy SB-318 in people with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I).Individuals with MPS I, or Hurler syndrome, face a poor prognosis. The lysosomal storage disorder, caused by genetic mutations that impede the production of the alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme, occurs in 1 in 115,000 births.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.IDUA is critical to breaking down glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Because people with MPS I can't metabolize these complex carbohydrates normally, they experience life-shortening organ damage as the substances build up.People with the severe form of the disease usually pass away in childhood, and people with the milder form typically don't live long past their 30s.  's (NASDAQ: BMRN) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) Aldurazyme is the only treatment currently available, but life expectancy remains short despite the existence of a therapy. (ZFN) is a unique approach that attempts to functionally cure genetic disease by editing genes to restore normal activity.The approach uses zinc-finger DNA-binding proteins to guide Fok1, a cutting enzyme, to a precise target in a person's DNA. To make an edit, two ZFNs are built with each containing one half of the Fok1 cutting enzyme. The ZFN pair binds to each side of the targeted DNA, and when Fok1's two halves combine, a cut is made, allowing for the new code to be inserted.In the case of MPS I, Sangamo's SB-318 inserts a functioning copy of the IDUA-producing gene in the liver so the individual can produce IDUA in his or her body, eliminating the need for ERT infusions, essentially curing the patient.The notion that SB-318 can restore IDUA production may be off-target given the data unveiled by Sangamo this week. In people receiving the treatment, there wasn't any evidence of a significant enough increase in IDUA activity to suggest this is an effective treatment.Sangamo Therapeutics is going to analyze liver biopsy tissue to see if there's some evidence of successful gene editing, and it plans to continue evaluating patients, including by withdrawing them from ERT treatment, to further evaluate efficacy.Sangamo's latest trial update isn't encouraging, especially in light of the fact that the company reported data last year showing little benefit from SB-913 in MPS II, or Hunter syndrome. People with MPS II can't produce the iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme necessary for breaking down GAGs. Similar to the SB-318 study, SB-913 attempts to insert a functioning gene in the liver to restore enzyme production.It's hard to rally around Sangamo Therapeutics' zinc-finger nuclease approach. The company's dustbin is littered with trial failures over the past two decades; that does little to inspire investor confidence. There's still a chance that this company can prove its gene-editing approach works, but if this doesn't happen soon, it could find itself losing the lead in gene editing to other approaches, including CRISPR/Cas9. Ultimately, there are over 6,000 genetic disorders and many have no treatment options; hopefully, that will change.

Patients born with a handful of rare diseases have already received experimental gene therapies that essentially act like one-shot cures, and before the end of the year we'll find out if they work as hoped.All three of these gene therapy stocks could soar if incoming clinical trial results hit the right marks. Here's what you need to know about the catalysts that could send their share prices skyward.\n  \nData sources: Yahoo! Finance and company filings.Hemophilia patients need regular infusions of the blood clotting factors they can't produce themselves, or else they run the risk of a fatal bleeding event. These treatments aren't cheap, and insurers can cough up over $250,000 per year caring for patients with this incurable condition.BioMarin is currently testing an experimental gene therapy that looks like it allows hemophilia A patients to produce clotting factor 8 on their own. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec (valrox) uses a softened virus to deliver a functional gene for factor 8, and early results from a small study suggest it works as expected. After 104 weeks, patients reduced their use of factor replacement therapy by a stunning 96% compared to the baseline.Last year, Biomarin expanded a 40-patient pivotal study with valrox to 130 patients. The company will present data from the first group this year, and success would send the stock soaring. The FDA appears willing to grant accelerated approval based on the first patients, and then monitor the rest for perhaps a couple of years before granting full approval.Biomarin markets a handful of rare-disease drugs that raked in $1.5 billion last year, and total sales are expected to reach $2 billion in 2020 without any help from valrox. That makes this the safest stock in this list.Image source: Getty Images.Since the beginning of the biotech industry, start-ups with experimental drugs have waited for human proof-of-concept results before tapping the public markets. CRISPR Therapeutics went public long before the company could tell investors when studies with people might begin, but that didn't stop investors from throwing heaps of money in its direction.In 2019, we'll find out if the  technique that CRISPR Therapeutics is built upon can become a useful tool for developing new gene therapies. An estimated 10,000 human diseases are caused by a single faulty gene, and the vast majority still have zero effective treatment options. In the months ahead, CRISPR Therapeutics will share early results from its first clinical trials, and investors will be looking for signs that there could be plenty more gene therapy candidates emerging from its pipeline in the years ahead.Late last year, CRISPR Therapeutics began enrolling patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia into separate studies with CTX001. This experimental treatment involves using CRISPR to edit a patient's own stem cells offsite before shipping them back to be reinfused. If successful, the modified cells will engraft and produce enough fetal hemoglobin to allow patients with both diseases to stop relying on regular blood transfusions permanently.The pair of studies will each enroll up to 45 patients, but CRISPR wants to try CTX001 on just two patients with each disease before enrolling the rest. If the first four patients produce enough fetal hemoglobin on their own to remain transfusion-free this year, the stock will probably climb.Investors need to remember that CRISPR Therapeutics doesn't know when it will begin clinical trials with its next candidate, which means one whiff of trouble for CTX001 could lead to severe losses.Image source: Getty Images.Sarepta Therapeutics is advancing a potential cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe muscle-wasting disease. Sarepta began marketing its first DMD treatment, Exondys 51, in 2016, and sales reached an impressive $301 million in 2018.Exondys 51 only treats DMD patients born with a dystrophin gene that lacks exons 48 through 50, which describes just 13% of the DMD population. Sarepta has a gene therapy on the way that could help just about every DMD patient.Sarepta's candidate, AAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-Dystrophin, is a one-time gene therapy that delivers a functional micro-dystrophin gene to muscle cells throughout the body, including cardiac muscle. It's early but so far, micro-dystrophin  . The first four patients dosed showed increased expression of micro-dystrophin and reduced signs of muscle wasting. Levels of creatine kinase, a general sign of muscle damage fell, while their ability to move around improved.After meeting with the FDA in late 2018, Sarepta began a 24-patient, placebo-controlled study that's already dosed two patients. Sarepta has boasted about impressive functional results among the handful of patients that have been treated with micro-dystrophin so far. It could take years to measure all the outcomes from this study, but an interim assessment could give us some clues before the end of the year.Image source: Getty Images.As a commercial-stage company, Sarepta Therapeutics isn't nearly as risky as CRISPR, but Sarepta's a long way from safe. Although annual product sales rose 95% last year to $301 million, the company also lost a whopping $221 million during the first nine months of 2018.Sarepta has already submitted an application for a new DMD candidate similar to Exondys 51 that will treat an estimated 8% of DMD patients. Golodirsen could earn approval by the end of the year, and micro-dystrophin might not be very far behind.Right now, Sarepta's a $9.3 billion company that's still losing money, but probably not for much longer. Timely approvals for golodirsen and micro-dystrophin could drive the company to profitability in a few short years, which is probably worth the risk.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares of the top orphan-drug specialist  (NASDAQ: BMRN) , for example, were up by a healthy 7.69% heading into the last month of the year, but ended up losing a staggering 11.3% of their value in December, according to data from  . As a result, BioMarin's stock exited 2018 with a modest loss of 4.51%.What triggered this double-digit slide? BioMarin, like most biotechs and biopharmas, experienced a drastic decline in its value last month due to the uncertainty created by President Trump's trade war with China, the continued political unrest in Washington, D.C., as well as rising interest rates.Image source: Getty Images.The bright spot is that BioMarin's December swoon wasn't sparked by a company-specific event, such as a major clinical failure or regulatory setback. In fact, BioMarin arguably sports one of the  , product portfolios, and clinical pipelines in the industry right now -- a fact that probably explains the company's strong rebound during the first two weeks of 2019. At the time of this writing, BioMarin's shares have gained almost 11% in just the first nine days of trading this year.Fortunately for shareholders, BioMarin's strong momentum appears set to continue for the remainder of the year. The reason is that the company noted -- during a presentation at the 37th annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference last week -- that it should end up rolling out two major clinical updates later this year.Specifically, BioMarin is expected to update investors on the status of its gene therapy candidate, valoctocogene roxaparvovec, for hemophilia A, as well as its late-stage achondroplasia candidate vosoritide, before year's end. Both of these experimental therapies have the potential to reach blockbuster status (annual sales exceeding $1 billion per year), giving investors good reason to be optimistic about the company's long-term growth outlook.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This rare disease biopharmaceutical is expected to pos  of $0.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +133.3%.Revenues are expected to be $379.66 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For BioMarin, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -61.34%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that BioMarin will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that BioMarin would pos  of $0.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.14, delivering a surprise of +7.69%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.BioMarin doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

After spiking to around $125 a share on Jan. 7, SRPT stock gave up those gains when markets took in the developments in its DMD pipelines and its Exondys 51 fourth-quarter sales outlook. Although shares rebounded from December 2018 lows, should biotech stock investors seriously consider investing in this company?At the J.P. Morgan conference, Sarepta said it will run 45 biopsies this quarter for SRP-4045. This is an  DMD or Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients with mutations in the DMD gene. The drug works by directing cells, through Sarepta's  , to skip exon 45 when processing RNA. The dystrophin protein is shortened but is still synthesized, slowing the negative symptoms of DMD.If the biopsies are positive, Sarepta will file a marketing application, setting up a possible approval date of early 2020.SRPT stock volatility rose after the company issued its revenue outlook for Exondys 51. In the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2018, it made $84.4 million in revenue from sales of Exondys 51. For 2018, revenue was around $301 million. It ended that same period with a healthy balance of $1.1 billion in cash.Markets reacted negatively to the outlook because it expected quarterly revenue of $85.8 million. The barely $2 million difference is a rounding error and the market quickly realized it. Quarterly revenue is in line with forecasts. As markets rebounded, taking the  (NASDAQ:  ) up 11.5% on the week, SRPT stock also rose the same amount (11%).Sarepta's global growth plans should lower the risks of relying solely in one market:\"We continue to build our international presence with limited infrastructure but dedicated colleagues in Latin America and Europe and a managed access program or MAP now live in some 44 countries.

BioMarin currently manages the drug's European launch, where it has been on the market since  .LEMS is a rare autoimmune disorder reportedly affecting one in every 300,000 people. The condition's main symptoms are severe muscle weakness in the limbs, stemming from the insufficient release of a key neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) at the point where the nerve meets the muscle.Despite the rarity of LEMS in the general population, however, Wall Street expects the drug to generate peak sales of $375 million by 2025 -- thanks in no small part to its projected wholesale price of around $300,000 per patient per year. And that's just for its first approved indication.If the drug's ongoing trials for other neuromuscular disorders like congenital myasthenic syndromes and MuSK antibody positive Myasthenia Gravis pan out, Wall Street thinks Firdapse's sales can surpass $490 million within the next six years. That would be quite a haul for a company that currently sports a market cap of only $288 million.So why is the market selling this encouraging news? Two reasons. First and foremost, Catalyst arguably needs to raise additional cash soon to support Firdapse's commercial launch and carry on with the drug's broader clinical development. The company, after all, ended the most recent quarter with a paltry $66.7 million in cash and cash equivalents.Next up, Catalyst is probably going to have to prove to investors that Firdapse really can generate hundreds in million in sales every year. BioMarin is no slouch when it comes to launching rare-disease products, yet Firdapse has only raked in about $15 million in revenue through the first nine months of the year over in the EU.

Even better is that number of indications, combinations and other uses for Adcetris have grown like weeds. SGEN continue to rack up more approvals and \"breakthrough\" designations for the drug.

Celgene - soon to be Bristol Meyers - must continue to pay royalties on sales from the drug via a tiered structure that gets into the mid-teens. Given its buyout of CELG, BMY may just want to control the whole pie, and with AGIO's market cap sitting at just over $3 billion, it's an easy pill to swallow.And with the two medicines, BMY would be getting a healthy  of additional cancer therapies as well as some rare disease work for a song.Given that, there's a good chance that AGIO gets the nod. No wonder why shares have jumped higher since both CELG's and LOXO's buyout bids.Source: Shutterstock It's very rare to find biotech stocks trading for bargain-basement valuations.

The biotech company's stock has surged 110.3% against the 20.3% decline of the industry in this period.The company has only one marketed product in its portfolio, Exondys 51, which received accelerated approval in September 2016. The drug is approved for treating patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (\"DMD\"), a rare genetic disorder affecting children who have confirmed mutation of the DMD gene susceptible to exon 51 skipping. The company is also developing other pipeline candidates including gene therapies for treating DMD.The company has progressed well with the commercialization of Exondys 51, development of its lead pipeline candidate and collaboration for gene therapies in 2018 so far.The drug generated sales of $216.6 million in the first nine months of 2018, a significant increase of 122.6% year over year on the back of strong demand trends. The drugs has also grown sequentially so far in 2018. Sales of the drug in 2017 were $154.6 million. Based on sales trends witnessed so far in 2018, Sarepta expects Exondys 51 sales to be almost $300 million for the year.The launch of a Managed Access Program in Europe and North America last year is also favorably impacting sales as the drug is now available to a larger patient population. The company remains on track with its phase III PROMOVI study evaluating Exondys 51. Data is expected in 2019 and will form the basis for continued approval of the drug.Moreover, settlement of a global patent litigation related to exon skipping technology used in DMD therapies with BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  in mid-2017 removed a major overhang for Sarepta. Per the settlement terms, BioMarin has granted Sarepta global exclusive rights to its DMD patent estate for Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products.Sarepta is focused on building its DMD pipeline beyond Exondys 51 by developing other exon-skipping treatments. In fact, the company has about eight exon-skipping candidates in its pipeline, including golodirsen and casimersen, which are expected to treat 75-80% of the DMD population.Sarepta's lead candidate, golodirsen, showed better improvement in patients in a mid-stage clinical study compared to results achieved by Exondys 51. The candidate has demonstrated 100% response rate with 10.7 times increase in mean dystrophin protein production from baseline, whereas Exondys 51 had achieved nearly three times, in DMD patients. A phase III study is currently enrolling patients.Sarepta remains on track to submit a new drug application for this DMD candidate by the end of this year. The company is developing casimersen in a phase II study.Sarepta is also developing gene therapies for treating DMD and other nervous disorders. The gene therapies have shown promising results so far in treating DMD patients by restoring dystrophin production in muscles throughout the body by delivering microdystrophin via adeno-associated virus. Sarepta is evaluating it most advanced gene therapy, AAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-Dystrophin, in a phase I/II study in DMD patients.Sarepta is collaborating with other companies and academic institutions to boost its pipeline or manufacturing capacity for gene therapy. The company's gene therapy portfolio currently has 14 programs in several early stages of development. | Sarepta currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the pharma sector include Exelixis, Inc.  and Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  .

Coming off such a sharp correction, it's not a bad idea to take a profit when you can. That's what Brian Bolan was thinking when he sold Energy Fuels (UUUU) on Tuesday. You may remember that this company was one of the top performers yesterday due to a big spike in volume. The editor took the chance to \"sell into strength\" and secure a nearly 12% return in just a little over a month. The portfolio still has exposure to basic materials through HighPoint Resources (HPR) and Halcon Resources (HK), so its covered if the sector jumps higher.The portfolio immediately replaced the position by adding Energous Corp. (WATT). The company develops wire-free charging technology and was once a real high flyer, but it has since come way back to earth.

But now the editor is seeing some resistance in SPX getting past 2750. Instead of waiting around to see if it has the energy to break through, Kevin decided to get out now and sell TQQQ for a 12% return.Speaking of breaking through, you've probably heard that today is the midterm elections. The market would be totally fine if the power in Congress is split between the parties, but Kevin thinks this outcome could still bring an \"exhale and sell\" reaction this week. Therefore, he also sold Russell 2000 Small Cap 3X Bull ETF (TNA) on Tuesday for an 11.7% return and Direxion S&P 3X Bull ETF (SPXL) for 2.3%.

The new tax reforms left more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies that could be invested for M&A activity. The first few months lived up to the bullish expectations but the number of mergers and acquisitions dwindled thereafter, probably because potential acquisition targets demanded a premium.Key acquisitions this year included Bayer's $63 billion buyout of Monsanto, Sanofi's  multi-billion dollar buyouts of Ablynx and Bioverativ, Celgene's  purchase of Juno Therapeutics, Novartis' (NVS) acquisition of AveXis and Roche's (RHHBY) purchase of Foundation Medicine. Meanwhile, Irish firm, Shire is due to be acquired by Japan's Takeda early next year for a whopping sum of almost $62 billion. Glaxo, earlier this month, announced a definitive agreement to acquire small cancer biotech, TESARO, Inc. (TSRO) for $5.1 billion. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. Also, Glaxo's $13 billion buyout of Novartis' 36.5% stake in their consumer health care joint venture in June was given a heads up by the investor community.Overall, the outlook for pharma/biotech M&A deal remains bullish for 2019 due to growing availability of capital for these firms and a lot of innovation happening in the sector.Drug/biotech companies regularly merge with or acquire competitors in mega deals to achieve critical mass both in research and development (R&D) and sales and marketing. Meanwhile, smaller biotech research firms investigating new therapies or interesting pipeline candidates have also attracted the attention of larger counterparts in the last few years.Historically, the drug/biotech industry probably sees more merger and acquisition (M&A) activity than any other industry to get access to innovation, share pipeline development costs, eliminate competition and bolster product portfolios.The major drug/biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers into their pipeline/product portfolios - either from internal development or from the purchase of assets. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines.In this article, we discuss some mid- and large-cap names that may be logical acquisition targets next year for big dug/biotech companies like Gilead, Amgen, Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others. What matters for buying a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of its drugs/products, prospects of future sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline. The fields that have attracted a lot of industry attention lately are immuno-oncology treatments and drugs to combat rare diseases.The five companies discussed herein have most of these factors going in their favor. Acquisitions of small drug/biotech companies are difficult to predict and are quite frequent. Hence, these have been excluded from the discussion.Companies whose product portfolio/pipeline includes rare disease drugs are in great demand as it is a less competitive space and the expensive treatments can bring in huge profits. BioMarin is one such drug developer. Its market cap is around $17 billion.BioMarin has seven commercially approved rare disease drugs with some more in the pipeline, which makes it worthy of being considered for a buyout. BioMarin's key orphan disease drugs - Vimizim and Kuvan - continue to do well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. The newest rare disease drug in its portfolio, Palynziq's commercial launch is off to an encouraging start. BioMarin believes the injection has peak commercial opportunity of roughly $1 billion as it demonstrated dramatic Phe reductions in PKU patients in pivotal studies. BioMarin's impressive rare disease pipeline is also progressing well. Growing pipeline focus toward gene therapy agents is encouragingThere has been speculation about BioMarin's takeover for a long time. Companies like Gilead, Amgen and Roche may be interested in buying BioMarin.Vertex's holds a dominant position in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market. Consistent increase in eligible patient population for Vertex's CF drugs, Kalydeco & Orkambi, is driving sales growth.

Symdeko has been a significant contributor to growth in 2018. Approval of Symdeko in EU in November should further boost sales in 2019.Vertex's CF pipeline is also accelerating rapidly. Studies on Vertex's triple combination CF regimens are moving fast. The CF triple-pill regimes are crucial for long-term growth as these have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients. Meanwhile, Vertex's non-CF pipeline, though in early stage, looks interesting.Vertex, with a market cap is around $44 billion, could prove to be a good acquisition option for PfizerIncyte's strong oncology portfolio makes it a lucrative target for companies like Gilead, Amgen and Bristol Myers. The market cap of Incyte is around $14 billion.The primary reason behind Incyte being a strong buyout target is its key marketed product, Jakafi, a JAK inhibitor. It is the first and the only product to be approved for polycythemia vera (PV) and myelofibrosis (\"MF\") - two rare blood cancers. Jakafi is seeing strong sales performance driven by strong patient demand for both indications. In order to expand the patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug, the company is working on expanding its label further.Another asset of interest to investors is Olumiant, also a JAK inhibitor, marketed in the EU and the United States (only the lower 2 mg dose) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Meanwhile, Incyte's pipeline boasts interesting targeted therapies like pemigatinib, itacitinib and capmatinib among others.Like BioMarin, Alexion is also focused on the development and commercialization of life-transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra-rare disorders. Its key drug is Soliris, approved for three severe and ultra-rare disorders - paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) - has consistently done well.Alexion is working on expanding the drug's label to include additional indications, which if approved, can boost further sales growth. It has two other drugs for rare diseases called Strensiq and Kanuma, which are emerging as key growth drivers, benefiting from continued patient additions. Alexion also has a robust pipeline of several candidates under development including Soliris follow-up candidate, Ultomiris (formerly ALXN1210). Ultomiris could be approved for the PNH indication in February next year.Roche, Pfizer, or Novartis may be interested in buying Alexion. The market cap of Alexion is more than $25 billion.Alnylam, though a relatively smaller biotech compared to the previous four, has become a hot acquisition target after approval of its key pipeline candidate, Onpattro (patisiran) in the United States and Europe this year.Onpattro is the first-of-its-kind RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic approved for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis in adults. Onpattro is the first and only FDA-approved treatment for this indication. Meanwhile, Alnylam also boasts two late-stage pipeline candidates in its portfolio, givosiran for acute hepatic porphyrias and inclisiran for hypercholesterolemia. Sanofi could be interested in buying Alnylam considering their ongoing partnership for rare genetic disease programsThe market cap of Alnylam is around $8 billion.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

(NASDAQ: BMRN)Q3 2018 Oct. 25, 2018 , Welcome to the BioMarin Third quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. Hosting the conference call today from BioMarin is Traci McCarty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Tracy. -- Thank you, Alexis. To remind you, today's call is non-confidential and contains forward-looking statements about the business prospects of BioMarin's Pharmaceutical; including expectations regarding BioMarin's financial performance, commercial products and potential future products in different areas of therapeutic research and development. Results may differ materially depending on the progress of BioMarin's product programs, actions of regulatory authorities, availability of capital, future actions in the pharmaceutical market and developments by competitors, and those factors detailed in BioMarin's filings with the SEC such as 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K reports.On the call today from BioMarin management are J.J. Bienaime, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Hank Fuchs, President, Worldwide Research & Development; and Dan Spiegelman, EVP, Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Ajer, EVP, Chief Commercial Officer; and Robert Baffi, EVP of Technical Operations.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to BioMarin's Chairman and CEO, J.J. Bienaime. -- Thank you, Traci. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. The first three quarters of 2018 has been extremely productive and have positioned us for increased top line results, for the key data results for potential regulatory filings and a new IND in 2019. So our commercial team has delivered record revenue in this quarter, with the addition of Palynziq or Palynziq, we expect to continue to strength $392 million in this third quarter and $1.14 billion in the first three quarters of the year, our both record top line results. And we remain on track for approximately $1.5 billion in full-year revenues this year and $2 billion in 2020.Starting with US Palynziq launch in July after approval in May. The initial launch during the third quarter went extremely well and we had 124 reimbursed commercial Palynziq patients at the end of the quarter. We expect to add new features in Q4 and beyond as PKU Clinics Drive patient referrals and starts at a risk phase, and we expect between 250 and 300 adult PKU patients to be on reimbursed commercial Palynziq's by year end. We are very please with the level of interest in Palynziq, since approval in May and Jeff will walk you and us through additional more detail in a moment.For Palynziq outside of US, we expect a CHMP Opinion on our marketing authorization application in Europe in the first half of 2019. And if that opinion is positive, we expect SEC Commission action followed by the potential launch of Palynziq in the EU in the second half of 2019. As we look forward the next important drivers of growth, our late-stage products, Val ox for Hemophilia A and Vosoritide for achondroplasia are both tracking to plan in their Phase 3 studies. Results from the full 52-week data readouts of vosoritide is targeted in the second half of 2019. And Valrox 6e13 dose in mid 2020, with potential regulatory filings for approval to follow. Moreover, we're excited by the prospect of potentially filing for accelerated approval of valrox in the second half of next year.Looking beyond our excellent late-stage clinical projects, we plan to leverage our valrox experience to develop other gene therapy products. The next one being phenylketonuria readout. We plan to provide a deep dive into our gene therapies capabilities, our extensive pre-clinical data on our PKU gene therapy products and how we're thinking about the development landscape with this platform at our upcoming R&D Day in New York on November 7th. And we look forward to seeing you there. Then conclusion, we are very pleased with our accomplishment to-date in 2018, we are excited about our prospects for 2019 and beyond.I will now turn it over to Jeff, who will share details of the US Palynziq launch, as well as update on our other commercial products. Jeff? -- Thank you, J.J. Due to some inquiries received from a few of you this morning, I'd like to acknowledge the President's speech today on proposed Medicare and drug pricing plans. Given the global and innovative scope of our business, we generally maintain a tight pricing corridor across our commercial products. To remind you, revenue from part -- Medicare Part B is less than 1% of our global book of business. We will continue to monitor closely potential changes and policy that might impact BioMarin, but it is too early to say more until additional details are available.Moving now to the US launch of Palynziq and then do a walk through third quarter results for our base business. With over 11,000 adult PKU patients in US one-third of whom are actively being treated in the PKU clinic, Palynziq represents the largest US patient population of all our approved products. We call that only 12% of all adult PKU patients in the US are being treated with Kuvan, so we have a tremendous opportunity ahead, during this launch period. We are focused on a number of key metrics that are lead indicators of future revenue growth. The following were all measured as of the end of the third quarter; first there were 124 patients receiving reimbursed commercial treatment with Palynziq. Of these 81 are from the clinical studies and 43 were formerly naive to palynziq treatment.In addition, at quarter end there were an additional 68 naive patients enrolled in our rare connection system, who have signed all authorization forms then prescribed Palynziq, then REMS enroll and are now waiting for their first injection to be shipped. By year-end, we expect between 250 and 300 adult PKU patients to be on reimbursed commercial Palynziq. Second, at the end of the third quarter this (inaudible) clinics had one or more active Palynziq patient. In addition, there were a total of 76 clinics that had at least one healthcare provider REMS certified. This is a key indicator of intent to prescribe Palynziq and is complementary to our significant efforts to in-service clinic and provide education on the use of Palynziq.An encouraging observation in the quarter for the PKU franchise was the enthusiasm that adult Kuvan patients have shown for treatment with Palynziq. A meaningful number of adult Kuvan patients still seek to optimize our outcomes with greater fee control when it's been unachievable in the past with Kuvan alone. To-date almost 40% of naive patients enrollments have constituted active Kuvan patients. Long-term and in the context of expected loss of exclusivity for Kuvan in two years, this is a very positive dynamic.An important consideration for understanding the Palynziq market is the time it takes from that first injection to driving meaningful revenue. To simplify in the early weeks, and in some cases months, when a patient is working through the induction and titration phase of treatment, their revenue contribution is fractional, approximately 10% to 20% of maintenance revenue. Once daily dosing has been achieved, more meaningful revenue contributions have approximately 70% of our expected commercial level of $192,000 per patient per year will be recognized.Once patients are on their maintenance dose, assuming half are on 20 milligrams and half are on 40 milligrams daily, we still project net revenue per patient at the $192,000 per patient per year of level. Given the anticipated conversion of clinical trial patients to reimburse commercial patients and the predicted modest revenue contribution during the initial months of Palynziq treatment for naive patients. We believes Palynziq full-year revenue in 2018 will be between $10 million and $14 million.In summary, we are very pleased with the US Palynziq launch and the progress made the transition clinical trial patients to reimburse commercial product. Palynziq has been well received by PKU community and we believe this is only the beginning of another successful long-term contributor to our growth story.Now turning to our other commercial products, which drove almost 20% growth year-to-date, compared to last year. Starting with Vimizim, which benefited from a large Brazilian Ministry of Health order in the quarter, strong net product revenue growth of 37% in the quarter and 23% year-to-date, compared to the same periods last year, resulted in record year-to-date revenue for the brand. We continue to experience uneven ordering patterns from certain markets, which has the impact of uneven quarterly revenue pattern. As always, we encourage you to refer to the annual revenue guidance for both Vimizim and Naglazyme, which we reaffirm. Similar market dynamics were in play for Naglazyme in the third quarter and year-to-date with net product revenue increasing 43% and 13% respectively, compared to the same period last year.Moving now to Brineura for the treatment of CLN2, which is just in its first fourth full quarter of commercial sales since being approved in the US and EU mid-2017. In the third quarter of 2018, we continue to add new commercial patients resulting in net revenue of $9.9 million. We are making progress against our twin goals of identifying new patients from our disease awareness and diagnostic screening programs and national reimbursement approvals. We are optimistic of slow but steady growth of Brineura going forward, and expect that it will develop into a more material revenue contributor.In closing, the commercial team delivered strong net product revenues in the third quarter of 29% and 23% year-to-date. The launch of Palynziq, our seven commercial products is exceeding our expectations in terms of patient and clinician interest. And we are confident, we are laying the groundwork for a significant revenue contributor in the coming quarters.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to provide more details on the financial results in the third quarter. Dan? -- Thank you, Jeff. Earlier today, we issued a press release summarizing our financial results for the third quarter, and I refer you to that release for full detail. Starting with topline results, as J.J and Jeff mentioned, we are pleased to report the total revenues for the first three quarters of 2018 were a record $1.14 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year, driven by strong contributions from all of our marketed products. Looking beyond 2018 and keeping with what we have said previously, we expect topline growth over the next couple of years to be around 15%, thus 2020 total revenue should be approximately $2 billion from our current products, and we expect to track toward that revenue percentage growth goal until the contribution from Vosoritide and Valrox faces above that level, hopefully at the start of next decade.Moving to operating expenses, R&D expenses increased to $161.4 million in the third quarter of 2018, and $520.9 million year-to-date 2018, compared to $154.1 million and $442.1 million in those respective periods of 2017. The year-to-date increased in R&D is primarily due to increased Valrox production and clinical trial expenses in support of ongoing Phase 3 program. Vosoritide clinical expenses as the Phase 3 head toward full enrollment in October. Tralesinidase formerly referred to BMN 250, which reflects -- that was still open we call production expenses.Looking forward to Q4, R&D expenses should continue to expand relative to Q3 consistent with the progress of our major clinical program, while remaining within prior guidance for the full-year. SG&A expenses increased to $148.6 million in the third quarter of 2018 and $440.2 million year-to-date, compared to $130.5 million and $394.1 million for the respective periods of 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses associated with Kuvan, Brineura and Palynziq commercial efforts.The year-to-date increases were primarily driven by Palynziq and Brineura product launch campaigns, and preliminary Valrox commercialization efforts. SG&A expenses for the balance of the year and inter early next year will increase slightly over prior quarter is driven by the US Palynziq launch, a potential EU launch. Though these expenses are expected to remain within the full-year guidance for 2018.Turning to bottom line results, GAAP net loss in the third quarter 2018 was essentially flat, compared to the same period last year at $12.6 million in 2018, compared to $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Year-to-date, GAAP net loss in 2018 increased marginally to $73.6 million, compared to $65.7 million in 2017. As you know, we also measure our performance on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on EBITDA and excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. And also excludes stock compensation, contingent consideration and certain other specified items.In Q3, 2018 and for the fourth consecutive quarter, we recorded non-GAAP income, which increased to $60.7 million in 2018, compared to $7.8 million in the third quarter of 2017. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2018, due to receipt in Q3 of a large Brazil MOH order for both Naglazyme and Vimizim, we expect the Q4 revenues will be lower than Q3 revenues though still within full-year guidance.In addition, as noted above, R&D and SG&A expenses will also increase in Q4, but also still within full year guidance. In total our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged. In terms of cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30th, 2018, we had $1.7 billion, as compared to $1.8 billion at the end of 2017. In October of this year we utilized approximately $375 million to repay the principal on the convertible note that matured. With this conversion, we also issued 190,220 shares of our common stock and also received fast 95,127 shares from CashCall counterparties. These shares have subsequently been retired.In closing, BioMarin delivered a strong quarter and year-to-date results in 2018 with robust contributions from Vimizim and Naglazyme, steady Kuvan net product revenues, control of operating expenses and our continued progress toward increasing non-GAAP profitability for the full year 2018, compared to 2017.Now, I would like to turn the call over to Hank. -- Thanks, Dan. Since J.J. has already provided an overview of development and regulatory accomplishments so far this year, and because we have R&D Day in November 7th, where we will provide many new updates. I'll just take a minute or two to touch on a few items. For Palynziq Europe, the marketing authorization application is under review and tracking the unexpected with CHMP decision expected in the first half of 2019. Given the enthusiasm we're seeing for Palynziq in US, we're optimistic that the dramatic Phe lowering demonstrated in our clinical studies will translate well into demand in ex-US regions.Briefly on Valrox, we believe the recent draft FDA guidance for the development of gene therapy products are very supportive of our Valrox study design and approval pathways. The recommendation for Factor VIII activity in normal range to file with the FDA for an accelerated approval, raises the bar for results below that range and gives us an important competitive advantage. Recent discussions with Health Authorities increases our confidence and our plans to potentially expedite registration. In addition to aligning well with US Health Authorities, we are very encouraged by our ongoing conversations and development planning with European Health Authorities.And finally to remind you of what to expect in our upcoming R&D Day in November 7th, in New York, we look forward to a number of exciting updates from the Research Group. In addition to review all the development products, we planed to provide key updates, including 42 months with Vosoritide of children with Achondroplasia, as well as extensive preclinical data for our PKU Gene Therapy product. Given the relevance of recent key regulatory advances, we're excited to have one of our talented colleagues from regulatory policy in patient engagement, share insights into how BioMarin leverages policy approaches to get products and treat rare diseases approved.And finally, our Chief Scientific Officer, Lon Cardon, will share his perspective on the future BioMarin's pipeline and how he thinks about leveraging scientific innovation and genomics. To achieve our next stage of growth and beyond. It should be an interesting and informative event, so please try to attend in person or tuning in via the webcast. As always thank you for your continued support and I'll now open the call to your questions.(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. -- Alright, great, thanks very much. So I know you don't have much medicare exposure with your current products, but given HHS' new international reference pricing proposal, and how that could impact back to replacement therapy in hemophilia? I was wondering, if you think this could impact your pricing strategy for Valrox by extension, since there could be lower potential cost offset associated with your gene therapy to save the health system spending on factor replacement therapy? -- Yes, I mean, I'll start and just give these comments. But and as you know, we have the price fluctuate, obviously Valrox, because it is not approved yet. So we have price in the US, it was priced in Europe. So, obviously this was -- this will be an important consideration, if indeed this does happen, but I think we have time and flexibility to come up with the best pricing strategy on both sides of the Atlantic here. If indeed this becomes a regulation, because there are lot of details here that need to be covered, and also, you know, many of you are already getting a lot of discounts in the US. So I don't know, if this is going to make a huge difference for us and just can give you more details, but our average European price that compared the US government price is not that different from our current products. -- Yes, thanks J.J. not much to add to that I think we've got plenty of time to be working out the details and as it relates to pricing and reimbursement for gene therapy and other advanced products there maybe developments within CMS that would facilitate our reimbursement models refer you to similar Obama's recent remarks on the subject. -- Okay, great. That's helpful, thanks. And then in your recent data updated SSIEM, it look like some patients on BMN 250 stabilized, but it wasn't like Brineura, where all patients did I think. So do you think that there's any chance that you can get BMN 250 to market on the existing data? What do you think is the most likely regulatory path for BMN 250, and when do you expect to get clarity from regulators? -- Hi, Joe. So the tralesinidase data was presented at SSIEM demonstrated dramatic reductions in heparan sulfate levels and brain fluid, normalization of liver size in patients who have hepatomegaly and stabilization in the development portion and something like 5 out of 7 patients. DQ is a tough endpoint, and I think partly in recognition of the challenge of documenting improvement in cognition in these kinds of diseases, the FDA issued a draft guidance document on the development of therapies for slowly progressive diseases, which we think comes pretty close to checking all the boxes for Tralesinidase. So the next step for us would be to have a conversation with Food and Drug Administration about how those guidance, document supply and whether that presents an opportunity to exploit regulatory pass. Suffice to say, we have a fair amount on our plate right now, so I don't want to commit to a particular time frame around which to report back to you on that conversation. -- Okay, great, that's super helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.And your next question is from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. -- Thanks for taking my question. And so with regard to Valrox, it looks like you're pursuing the accelerated approval pathway, and apart from the data from the Phase 3 study there do seem to be other factors that will play a role in your decision on this approach and so I was just wondering when it comes to the assay and the discrepancy between the chromogenic and the one stage assay, can you help us understand why there appears to be a discrepancy there, and the work that you have to do around that for the filing or in order to pursue a filing?And then secondly, with regard to the continuous data set from the ongoing Phase 2 study and that profile being attacked -- intact. Are you still expecting stabilization there based on remaining circulating versus non-circulating at the SUMO DNA. Just wondering if that thesis is still intact in your mind? -- Yes. Hi, Salveen. So the issue of the assay discrepancy that was raised in the guidance document is to some extent it is more of a general phenomenon in factory products in that. These kinds of discrepancies have been observed for other products. And with the FDA wants to make sure is that there is no potential for under-dosing or overdosing, for that matter of, we're trying to replace some products on the basis of a incorrectly interpreted assay results.And so they've asked the sponsors of gene therapy products to look into that to the extent that might inform their decisions. And where they're coming from, in the context of gene therapy is that the transgene products may be biologically different than the -- were common and factor products with which the FDA has a lot more familiarity. So to the point of establishing a Factor VIII level, which is reasonably likely to represent a clinical benefit of lead reduction. The agency has asked for two pieces of information either resolved or present data, which indicate why you believe that the factory levels that you're observing are reasonably likely, and the FDA went on further to say that the only value of Factor VIII that they would consider for accelerated approval under these kinds of -- in this context with the Factor VIII levels that achieved the normal range. So I think that's the -- sort of regulatory context for why this is an important question and how they operationalize it in terms of their guidance document.And for the second part of your question, the more we look at the literature on persistent forms of DNA in vivo in animals, we have received the transgene, the more convinced we are that the settling phenomena is real, reliable, reproducible and reasonably likely to apply to BMN 270 and of course out in the, let's call it at the elder (ph) years after gene transfer that we will observe clinically relevant and persistent expression. Proof is obviously in the putting and we look forward to providing you an update on where things stand in the middle of next year. -- And also I think, we can cover this, the mid-year to circuit or conversion. We going to cover in detail at R&D Day. And also based on some interaction with -- had with regulatory authorities, we don't believe that, we don't believe that this, I'd say discrepancies, there will be a significant for us. -- Thank you.(Operator Instructions) Thank you. And your next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Jaffray. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. So maybe just on Palynziq, you guys now five months in the launching, I know it's still kind of early days, but with the 43 treatment naive patients you've gotten through arguably a decent number of these folks have gotten into that sort of critical eight weeks or so timeframe, I think, Hen could you describe, as the sort of period when you might running the biggest chance for anaphylaxis. Can you maybe describe it, are you running into anything unexpected during that time frame for some of those folks, you're referring along. And have you seen any discontinuations and maybe describe what some of those look like, and then maybe a part due to this question, any Kuvan patients are part of that 43. Thank you. -- So, and this is Jeff, great questions. Chris, let me see, if I can cover them. The first thing to note is, those numbers that we were quoting were as of the end of September and so we've got -- going on another month of practical experience with the launch. The vast majority of reactions that have been reported, adverse events or injection site reactions, which were completely expected for Palynziq. We haven't seen other types of adverse events reported, arthralgia or anaphylaxis, but to-date the caveat on that is because of the time it has taken to get new patients through the case management reimbursement and start process, we don't really have very many patients that have gotten up to that daily dosing with 20 milligrams and beyond, which is the point at which we would expect to start seeing more serious adverse events beyond just the injection site reactions. So I think might be a good question to ask, for three months from now.In terms of Kuvan patients approaching 40% of our naive patient enrollment have been active Kuvan patients, so there is a -- fair amount of active switching going on which we think is the really positive thing for the PKU franchise, overall to get those patients, adult patients on the Palynziq and on to a maintenance dosing well ahead of loss of exclusivity. -- There was a question on (inaudible) discontinuation. -- Discontinuation. So far we haven't seen any discontinuations from naive patients, but again, we're just getting started with patients in that reduction and titration phase. -- Okay. Thank you very much.And your next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. -- Hi, it is Carmen on for Cory. Thanks for taking our question. So your guidance for Palynziq for full-year '18, you mentioned you're expecting 250 to 300 commercial patients on drug, which implies if I am counting this correctly, another 50 or so new patient starts at the low end of the guidance. And so that's kind of inline with what you saw in the first quarter of launch. I'm wondering how we're thinking about that these new patient starts, as we get into 2019, compared to this? And what you think will catalize kind of an uptick in new patient starts. Thanks. -- Hi. So let's see, let's get back to those numbers. We reported that (Multiple Speakers) assuming that the balance of the clinical patients are the first ones in and that's about 17 and therefore another 50 would get you to 250 at the lowest end of our guidance. So I think that's what you said. -- Carmen, is that what you're -- you've asked for? -- Yes, yeah, that's how I calculated it. -- As your question is what are we looking for uptick in that rate of new patients going forward into next year. -- Yeah, so it's been at the rate of new patient enrollment has been picking up throughout the third quarter, and we would expect that to continue as more of our target clinics become active, we'll call this -- we reported the 50 clinics are now active, we'll call that it launch, we said that our Tier 1 clinics 32 of them that are coming out of the clinical trial, account for about 50% of adult patients, an additional 30 clinics are tier 2 clinics that account for 35% of adult patients. So if more clinics become active the rate of enrollment should pickup, also what we've experiences a lot of the clinical trial sites focus their initial efforts as they should have in the third quarter in transitioning their clinical trial patients. And with most of those patients now on commercially labeled drug, if not fully reimbursed drug that should facilitate those clinics start enrolling new patients. -- Okay.And your next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. -- Hi, guys, this is Kripa on for Robyn. Thank you so much for taking my question. Given that the interest that you indicated in Kuvan patients to get onto Palynziq? How should we think in terms of conversion of switching of Kuvan patients to Palynziq in the long-term? Is there a percentage of patients that you expect to convert or do you think majority or all of them will convert is there any color you can provide for us. Thank you. -- We've stated that it's an explicit objective of ours to have as many, Kuvan adult patients converted to Palynziq treatment as possible. By the time we lose exclusivity for Kuvan in the United States and that's expected to be at the end of Q3, 2020. The numbers so far of new patient referrals are small, and so on that small and 40% are Kuvan active patients, the numbers are too small and the experience is too early to project what percent next year to expect from Kuvan patient. Overall a positive dynamic may have some material effect on Kuvan revenue by late next year, possible. -- But I think, this is very encouraging that with us probably we get currently we're not worrying Palynziq to Kuvan patients, we're not trying to actively to remove the switch and naturally we get a lot of patient that are interested, we strip inside, which means that, I mean, there is a pretty good chance up by the time of generics hit the US market. We have the substantial number of Kuvan patients converted. Here the good news and something you need to, take into account and your model in the -- even it's a Kuvan patients get into a generic, they are not entirely lost on Palynziq, because we could still (inaudible) and get them on Palynziq, even if they are switched to generic. So that we know it actually can get little longer it's actually pretty long, we don't need to convert all the Kuvan patient to Palynziq to capture a significant number of the stations, we can do that after the generics hit the market. -- Okay, great. Thank you. And one more quick question, can you provide any sort of detail on what we can expect to see on the PKU gene therapy program at the R&D Day? -- Information about vector, design, safety considerations, efficacy considerations, durability considerations, biological marker considerations, dosing and man considerations, manufacturing considerations, I don't know, is there anything else, Traci? I don't think we answered your toxicity there. -- Great, thank you so much.And your next question is with Martin Auster with Credit Suisse. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I had one about the Vosoritide Phase 3, I noticed in the press release that trial is continuing to enroll. I wanted to clarify, have you found all the 110 patients you are looking for into the kind of run in six month type philosophy measure before dosing? Are you still looking for patients to enter that phase, and if you could maybe update us on when we might expect to see top line data. Thanks. -- Yeah, we're still on track for top line data at the end of year. -- 2019. -- And that's because close of enrollment is expected to occur imminently. In fact, we are well able to project that, and we are really, as we have said on our previous call, all we are doing is making sure that the last remaining KOLs, who are those slowest site activators have an opportunity to put their patients and so we expect enrollment, you know, closing announcement to occur imminently. -- Okay, thanks for clarifying that. And just on the Valrox Phase 3 you're continuing to expect to complete that dosing in Q2 of next year, and that -- is that the right conclusion. We can make and you'll have that trial fully enrolled for the running patients by the end of this year, then by the end of '18? -- Yes. That's the target. -- Excellent, thanks.And your next question is with Ying Huang of Bank of America. -- Hi. It's Aspen on for Ying. Thanks for taking our questions. Couple of quick question -- quick ones. Could you give as a revenue breakdown ex-US and ex-EU and how long you are foreseeing any kind of currency impact there. And then what kind of date can we expect from the 42-month update on the Vosoritide? Anything beyond close philosophy. Thanks. -- I've asked to give you a bunch numbers on the ex-US -- ex breakdown, I don't have that right in front of me, I can tell you, the currency impact from net for the year relative to what we had budgeted and expect it is near zero, it's a couple million dollars and similarly on a net basis relative to last year's rates, taking into account FX rate changes is nearly -- it's nearly unchanged. And the US, ex-US breakout will be out in the 10-Q tomorrow. -- And then the second part of your question to remind you the question about 42-months is really a question about evidence of durability and let me just remind you about the discussion that the FDA Advisory Committee added up the issue of durability. Durability is a bigger consideration in context in which biology suggests that durability, may be a problem. So, couple of things that will -- we review for you at our R&D Day or what's the preclinical biology that causes us to believe that the effect of the (inaudible) tied on achondroplasia joints growth rates is going to be durable, that's the preclinical biology. Will present a novel biomarker data that speaks to the potential for durability. Will present you the annualized growth velocity of patients treated up to 42-months with the 2D (ph) market it dose with the products. And we'll present some ancillary data on for example proportionality and safety. I think the main thing to pay attention to that will be new at R&D Day will be the biomarker data and the actual annualized growth velocity and patients have been treated through 42-months of therapy.And maybe just one more to data point on what, you might have been asking. At the US, our sales continue to be about 50% in US dollars, the balance obviously in other currencies and within our other currencies, the euro represents about third. -- That was out of appendix, trying to make that sort of comment. -- That was the completion of the fire process. -- Thanks.And your next question is from Eli Merle with Cantor Fitzgerald. -- Hi guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Just back to sort of gene therapy and durability, you've talked about the importance of a circular DNA and thinking about long-term durability. Just curious what you think sort of the key determinants are in terms of like whether a vector turned into circular DNA or not. And might, I guess, long-term, do you think the -- our aspects of how gene therapy products are designed that can make them more or less likely to lead to circular DNA. Thank you. -- That is a question that has been substitutive intense research, but it included about 20 years ago. So we're going to -- we can summarize some of that (inaudible) R&D Day to remind you about things like our IPRs, and then how the vectors are package, and how we assure there are petrological truncations with the genome, that which could affect circularization. So I say come to R&D Day and those will be good things to pay attention to you. -- Got it. Thanks.And your next question is from Paul Matteis with Stifel. -- Great, thanks so much for taking the question. Just one on the Palynziq launch in the US, I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of the bandwidth for an individual physician? And how many patients in experience a doctor could get through the titration period at once versus a less experienced physician, how you think that plays out over the coming quarters? And then just on the European Palynziq process, wondering if you've seen anything so far through the reviewing and your interactions that would suggest there's any risk of a dis-coordinated result from the FDA's approval. Thanks so much. -- So maybe I'll take the first question about the Palynziq in the United States. Clinic bandwidth in the patient capacity by experiences level. So in the past and on the launch call, we guided to an expectation, that we think that clinics will be handling patients in the induction titration phase in small groups are several-ish and speculated that we thought that the clinical trial experienced clinicians would probably be able to handle more patients initially then they're non-experience clinic peers.So empirically what we've seen to-date is small number of pretty aggressive clinics that have a put forth more than few patients, new patient, naive patients, peripherals small number. Most of the clinics that have referred naive treatment patients have referred one to several patients so far, we haven't seen a separation in those numbers from the Tier 1 clinical trial experienced in Tier 2 clinics, but one of the dynamics that may be impacting that is the focus of the clinical trial clinics in the third quarter to manage the transition of their clinical trial patients on to commercial labeled products and also to support the effort of gaining reimbursement, which will likely largely be done in the fourth quarter.So I think we still need a little bit more time to see how that goes, another interesting dynamic is most of the clinics that have referred patients have kind of referred one in at a time, there are a small number of clinics that have reported that they want to start patients in groups and manage them through the induction titration to maintenance phase in groups. So that's another one that will be watching probably too early to draw more conclusions, maybe we'll have more color on that next quarter.And then the European regulatory, I think the biggest difference between the EU regulatory seen and the FDA is just a simple fact that we didn't have the benefit of having a lot of ongoing dialog and experienced with EU regulators during the development phase, simply because of the licensing arrangement that we had at the time that we are in the development. But I think that, that is substantially offset in this case by the fact that the diagnosis of phenylketonuria is a global diagnosis, is not like your two different PKUs. The management of PKU on a worldwide basis is more similar than it is different. The mainstay of that management would be the reduction of protein intake and the possible use additionally of Kuvan in patients, who respond to Kuvan.I think that in Europe, there is a pretty substantial perception of the unmet need both for the Kuvan non-responders, but also for the Kuvan treated patients, who have relatively modest de-lowering, but require still restriction on their diet and I think a very positive thing that's going in our favor in Europe, compared to the United States is that EU regulators have recognized the problem of restricting protein intake, what Kuvan didn't offer was complete freedom from protein intake and restrictions and protein intake and our Palynziq date demonstrate how powerful it is in reducing fee even in the face of relatively normal protein intake.The final difference between the US and Europe is that in Europe, they're a little bit more clear about what they call anaphylaxis and it's being tied to IgE particularly, which we documented it for the US submission doesn't -- there is no evidence that points to the access to the type reactions being needed by IgE. So it's (inaudible) lack of experience and dialog we feel pretty good about the prospects, and we're expecting a CHMP opinion in the second quarter of this year and just to remind you about the EU process full approval doesn't actually happen and so that opinion is referred to the European Commission for legal authorization, which would then lead to Jeff seem being able to commercialize beginning in H2 of next year. -- Okay. Got it. Great, thanks.And your next question comes from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just wanted to go back to one of your prior responses. I was wondering a little bit more if you could help us understand how we should be thinking about the negotiated stage rates to Kuvan generic entry or if there are any sort of comps relating to step generation that we should be thinking about there. And then lastly, but still on the PKU market, depending success from your other gene therapies in the space, I was wondering from your market research where you saw these bidding in, and if this would overlap more with sort of the Kuvan patients or the current situation. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter. -- Go ahead. -- Yes, so let Keenen, let me see if I understand your question regarding the loss of exclusivity in -- of Kuvan in the United States. I think you were asking, if there was any kind of analogs that we've guide expectations for the pace of conversion of branded generic business, if I guess that about right? -- I thought it was a state generalization from some of the negotiations that you had or some of the settlements that you had come through. I was wondering, if more if there were any comps around that staging or if it was just a close to it? -- The staging of one entry and then other entries six months later, which is what we have is actually, I believe, sort of the standard and the industry, because that in the generic business, one of the -- a large part of the profits actually from a generic business comes out of being the first and only generic for six months. So that is pretty standard, the thing for which there is lack of benchmark comparison is our sort of highly personalized specialty high-priced medicine, that's where the lack we expect generic erosion, we have lots of efforts in place to attempt to modulate that, but there are not great analogs that you can look to with a high degree of confidence. -- Got you. Thank you for the color, I was (Multiple Speakers) there were volume limitations. -- Sorry what was your second question? -- No, I appreciate the color I wasn't sure if from those settlements if there were any sort of volume limitations or anything like that, so I appreciate the color there. -- But as Dan said, just want to reinforces that, you know, we don't -- although there will be some erosion, I think this is the US issue in, say 2020 only the US to protect until 2024. Together we don't believe that the erosion model will be the same as what you see for a generic that someone can buy in the retail pharmacies around the quarter, this is required us entirely distributed through specialty pharmacies and we provide a loss or to be PKU patients when they receive (inaudible). So little bit of the erosion will be somewhat lower than your traditional order. But there is no real model available and we actually are interesting case study for the future. -- Got it. Thanks for the color.And your next question is from Gena Wang with Barclays. -- Thank you for taking my questions. So I just have one regarding the Valrox accelerated approval, I would assume you will be looking for Factor VIII level over 50%. So just wondering, how would the Phase 1, 2 ,3 year longer follow-up data, which like will be first half in next year, would that impact FDA a solid approval decision specific to say in the case of, if there is somewhat further declining for the Factor VIII? -- Well, the guidance documents doesn't get very clear on durability considerations. And our view is that the initial registration is going to be predicated mainly on the Factor VIII levels from the ongoing pivotal trial using that to be commercialized material, but that support for durable expression is Factor VIII will come from the earlier Phase 1, 2 trial and from what we can tell from the FDA's guidance document and I mentioned subsequent interactions that we've had with the FDA. The primary decision on approval is going to be based on net benefits and risk in the principal Phase 3 population and reusing this for registration. So that longer term data will be coloring, but not essential to the initial decision. -- Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.And your next question comes from Vincent Chen with Bernstein. -- Great, thank you very much for taking the question. I guess taking a step back, I'd like to ask one on your broader strategy with respect to gene therapy. So we've seen a number of other companies really flocking to strike deals in the gene therapy space and the argument seems also be that the size of gene therapy is more or less pronounced, the regulatory environment is pretty favorable. So a company that has got a robust gene therapy manufacturing capability and rare disease expertise, that has been a natural owner for gene therapies able to readily in license assets, bringing the market to quickly build out a broad portfolio.So it seems to me that BioMarin would be really ideally situated for this strategy, given your expertise and you're established manufacturing platform was quite impressive. But you certainly been a bit quieter at least in terms of disclose deals. First, am I thinking about this the right way. And two, I guess how are you thinking about your strategy in gene therapy for example, here is the focus of roll that gene therapy plays in the broader business portfolio and the use of a LNA versus in internal development? -- I think you're right. -- We are perfectly poised. -- We are perfectly poised and we're looking at, I mean, the reason why we haven't done the deal, because we're having total capability to come up with candidates is one reason. And we are -- we just did that with PKU gene therapy. And also maybe we have a different portion, some of the players, whereby we are looking at gene therapy opportunities that have the economic viability, and we don't believe going after ultra orphan diseases is economically viable without a top position of, so doing a lot of little ultra orphan gene therapy deals is great for press releases, we're not sure is going to be based on the bottom line. -- And how do you think about these attractive indications in gene therapy, because I do tend to agree that in many ways, gene therapy signs looks great, but in terms of finding truly attractive opportunities that can be a little more challenging to find things where you've got this confluence or something as readily address what gene therapy and something where the opportunity is really there. How do you think about finding those? -- Well, you actually now -- in your second question explains the challenge of finding the right opportunities, we believe there are some and we are exploring some, but in the sense what we are using it and we believe that you need an opportunity that is large enough to the -- not only a present market, which is -- it is patients, but as it is somewhat significant incidence market that allows your gene therapy product is have long-term economic viability. -- And the good news is we have our R&D Day coming up in a couple of weeks and sort of our long-term thoughts and strategy on how to build a pipeline is part of what we're going to talk bout there. So this will hopefully we can provide more answers to you at that time. -- And we'd like to say that we are because of our emerging manufacturing expertise and capability in gene therapy, we are approach on a regular basis by some gene therapy the companies. So it's likely that, there could be some deals in the future.Your next question comes from Tim Lugo with William Blair. -- Hi, management who answered. Tim Lugo, thanks very much for taking the question, launches pertains through the ongoing Valrox trial in patients with sort of positive side for A5 (ph), I'm just wondering whether you can provide an update on enrollment many sort of safety concerns that you. Hopefully on saying and when we can expect top line data. And second part of the question would be, in the case that Valrox is approved? How is the field, sort of looking about potential supplementary label extensions which are the match and putting something on the label like, show a positive to IFRS 5 if it, which should in that category. Thanks. -- Yes, so no safety things to report. We don't usually give detail, because I blow enrollment updates. And just to remind, it's a bit of a slow study because of safety study, it's the first time anybody is purposely trying to put the gene in knowing that there is a positive antibody tied to it. So, we haven't given guided -- we haven't given guidance to a completion date.And as far as post approval supplements that a scenario that we were looking at very carefully and we have some ideas about, what's the relative order of priority might be. But to some extent that's going to be informed by our first label and how clinicians and payers are looking at the data that we've gotten and where more data is going to be required to secure reimbursement and it's still a little early to be matching up the lifecycle place for Valrox and we think about it. But beyond the zero positives we haven't really taken a (inaudible) specific actions about -- to broaden the initial indication.And your next question comes from Joseph Thome with Cowen & Company. -- Hi, there. Thank you for taking my questions. Just one on Brineura's launch, you've indicated in the prepared remarks that you kind of going after to aim getting broad reimbursement and identification of patients or either one of these more gating than the other, and when we look at the launch we assume more of a steady grind up or could you guide to more of an inflection sales how are you thinking about that. Thank you. -- Probably as a combination of both issues, I think we guided from the time of launch that there was a kind of a big warehouse prevalent patient population, but we could go after -- such as -- is the case for other lysosomal disorders including Vimizim for Morquio A when we launched that. So we guided that it was going to be a commercial effort of incidents not prevalent. The incidence of CLN2 is pretty rare, we estimate 100,000 and 200,000. So we are putting the pieces out in the field, including diseases awareness efforts and targeted screening programs to be able to pick these patients up and we're making progress on that.At the same time, we need to be working through reimbursement processes that's time consuming, we're utilizing name patient sales approvals and markets where it's appropriate. That's been successful, but time consuming as well. So the combination of those factors are part of and the rarity of CLN2 is really the picture of a slow revenue ramp. Having said that, we expect as was noted in the prepared remarks that will make slow, but steady progress on revenue in that Brineura will be a more meaningful revenue contributor going forward.This concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. J. J. Bienaime. -- Thank you, operator and thank you all for participating on our call today. So, we've deliver an another strong quarter growing year-to-date revenues 19%, compared to last year and continuing on a path to deliver $1.5 billion in full-year revenues this year. With Palynziq now in the US and on track for EU opinion in the first half of 2019, we believe we can generate approximately $2 billion in revenues in 2020. With the firstly commercialized products alone. So we are very pleased with the US Palynziq and even though it is early days, we expect our decade trust of Kuvan experience that will help us drive significant contributions from Palynziq over the coming quarters.So we look forward to providing a total overview of the pipeline and other relevant topics at R&D Day on November 7th. So we hope to see you there and thank you for your continued support and good bye.This concludes today's conference call. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The bottom line also came ahead of the year-ago earnings of 7 cents. Earnings increased on the back of higher revenues, offset by escalated R&D and SG&A expenses.However, excluding interest expense, amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and other expenses, the company incurred a loss of 7 cents per share, narrower than the previous quarter's figure of 9 cents.Total revenues logged $391.7 million in the reported quarter, up 17% from the year-ago period, driven by strong sales of Vimizim and other key products. Moreover, the top line topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $369 million.Notably, earlier this month, BioMarin received a milestone payment of $15 million from Pfizer  , triggered by the FDA approval of the latter's pipeline candidate, Talzenna (talazoparib). The drug has been developed for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA (gBRCA)-mutated, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.The milestone payment was committed to BioMarin by Medivation, which bought global rights to talazoparib from BioMarin in August 2015. Medivation was later acquired by Pfizer.So far this year, shares of BioMarin have risen 8.1% versus the  's decrease of 20.7%.Product revenues were $386.3 million in the third quarter, up 29.3% year over year, supported by continued strong demand for BioMarin's marketed products. Royalty and other revenues were $5.4 million in the quarter under review compared with $35.4 million in the year-ago period.Vimizim contributed $123.3 million to total revenues, up 36.5% year over year, primarily attributable to an increased patient base and the favorable government ordering patterns in certain countries.Naglazyme sales surged 43% year over year to $103.1 million owing to a favorable timing of government orders across certain countries in Latin America and higher new patient starts in the EU.The receipt of a large government order in Brazil bettered sales of Vimizim and Naglazyme in the third quarter. However, this benefit can reverse in the fourth quarter, weakening revenues during the same.Notably, Naglazyme and Vimzin revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to infrequent ordering patterns from some countries, mainly Brazil.Kuvan revenues rose 7.1% to $113.3 million, reflecting rise in patient strength in North America.Brineura generated sales of $9.9 million in the third quarter compared with $10.9 million in the previously reported quarter, indicating a sequential decline of 9.2%.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties - totaling $27.6 million - from Sanofi's  subsidiary, Genzyme, in the quarter, up 23% year over year owing to higher volume of product sales to Genzyme.BioMarin's newest drug, Palynziq (pegvaliase) injection, grossed sales of $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2018. Palynziq was approved in May this year and was later launched in July. As a result, the drug could not record any sales in the second quarter since supply was first made available during the first week of the month it was unveiled.In the United States (n=124), patients were treated with Palynziq at the end of the third quarter. BioMarin expects the number of patients to reach 250-300 by this year-end.In the EU, a marketing application for Palynziq is under review with a decision awaited in the first half of 2019.Research and development (R&D) expenses were 5.6% higher year over year while selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 11.8% in the quarter under review.At the end of the third quarter of 2018, BioMarin had $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, same as its earlier reported quarter.BioMarin is a developing valoctocogene roxaparvovec, a gene therapy for severe hemophilia. Following encouraging safety and efficacy data presented from the phase I/II study, BioMarin s launched two separate phase III studies on the candidate - GENEr8-1 (6e13 vg/kg dose) and GENEr8-2 (4e13 vg/kg dose) - to treat patients without pre-existing AAV5 antibodies. Enrollment in both studies is estimated to be completed in 2019. BioMarin is also conducting a separate phase I/II program to evaluate the 6e13 vg/kg dose in severe hemophilia A to address patients with pre-existing AAV5 antibodies.BioMarin plans to initiate an accelerated approval path forward for Valoctocogene roxaparvovec gene therapy, based on the recently drafted guidelines published by the FDA. The company will inform investors about its decision on this project during the second half of 2019.Another important candidate in its pipeline is vosoritide, currently in a phase III analysis (n=110) for the treatment of children (aged 5-14 years) with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism. Top-line data from this study is anticipated during the second half of 2019.This will be followed by an open-label extension study with lower dose (15 \u00b5g/kg/day). Additionally, BioMarin commenced a separate phase II study to assess the effect of vosoritide on infants and toddlers (aged 0-5 years) in June. Vosoritide is granted an Orphan Drug status in both the United States as well as the EU.BioMarin will present a 42-month update on the study at the company's R&D Day on Nov 7 in the New York City.Other interesting candidates include enzyme replacement therapy, tralesinidase alfa/BMN 250 (phase I/II for Sanfilippo B syndrome or MPS IIIB), and BMN 290 (in pre-clinical studies for Friedriech's ataxia, a rare neurologic disorder). Also, another gene therapy program for PKU is expected to move into its clinical studies' stage in the first half of 2019.BioMarin continues to envision total revenues in the range of $1.47-$1.53 billion in 2018.Kuvan sales are projected in the band of $440-$480 million. Vimizim sales are projected within $460-$500 million. Naglazyme sales are likely to be within $325-$355 million.

Yesterday's sharp intraday bounceback did  signal a bottom in this correction as many were hoping. Instead, stocks seemed to find another gear in their descent on Wednesday, leaving two of the major indices in the red for 2018.The major indices accelerated their losses into the close, which was almost a complete opposite of Tuesday. When the closing bell had finally rung, the Dow plunged 2.41% (or 608 points) to 24,583.42. It started the year at 24,719.2. Ironically, the index began the day in the green due mainly to a strong report from Boeing.The S&P was even worse with a drop of 3.09% to 2656.1, compared to where it started the year at 2673.6. The Dow and S&P were up more than 25% and 19%, respectively, in 2017.But the absolute worst performer of the day among the major indices was the NASDAQ, which was off 4.43% (or about 329 points) to 7,108.4. Tech's fall from grace is one of the market's many issues right now. The FANGs had a horrible session. The best performance was a 3.43% drop from Apple, while the worst was a 9.4% plunge from Netflix. That makes tomorrow's reports from Amazon and Alphabet all the more important.Earnings season is having no impact on the market right now\u2026at least not a good one. The concern seems to be that the global malaise has finally come home to the U.S. economy. And when you mix that with nail-biting over rising rates, trade, the ongoing Saudi Arabia situation and the tech wreck; it leaves a fearful market that's jumping at its own shadow.The funny thing about fear, though, is that it can sometimes be the precursor of a rebound\u2026and this rebound should be a big one whenever it comes. Several of the editors are putting together watchlists to pick up quality stocks at oversold levels. But it would be great to see the market reach a bottom here soon.

And it is! But it's also a lot more. The company has a very solid Earnings ESP of 8.6% for the quarter coming a week from today. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for three straight quarters, and Dave expects that AEE will do it again.

TAZR Trader: Kevin was certainly on point this Monday when he picked up ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF (SQQQ). The editor felt that another downturn was coming for the NASDAQ 100\u2026and that's exactly what we got today. As a result, this portfolio had the only position that gained in the double digits on an otherwise brutal day. SQQQ was up 13.8%. It's times like these when this portfolio really shines.

Counterstrike:\"Tomorrow is the day I'll be ready to buy, especially if the S&P can get to the flush below the 2660 area and bounce back aggressively. I will be dipping into my list and buying a handful of stocks, for both Counterstrike and myself. Patience has allowed us to sit on cash and take minimal losers over the last month. We are now positioned to pounce when this market finally capitulates, which I believe could come tomorrow or Friday.\"There are a lot of oversold stocks, the key is picking the right ones that don't have too much technical damage.

The index spent most of the session in positive territory, though it did close off its highs. Other than Alphabet, the FANGs were all positive on Tuesday, led by green performances from Netflix (+1.89%) and Apple (+1.39%).The market looked like it might be able to close with modest gains all around, but the choppiness from earlier in the session never abated. In the end, the Dow slipped by 0.21% to 26,430.57 as it again swung by a couple hundred points throughout the day. The index managed a positive close just yesterday to break several days in the red.

While rates are getting most of the press for this recent sluggishness, you can bet there's also a good amount of profit-taking in front of earnings season and the upcoming mid-term elections.Speaking of earnings season, it can't come soon enough! We love earnings here at Zacks since they form the basis of the Zacks Rank. But in addition to that, a new string of positive reports would probably help this market find a new upward direction to finish 2018 on a strong note. It all starts on Friday with reports from a few of the big banks and then it'll really reach a new gear in the following weeks. We can't wait!

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2018, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This rare disease biopharmaceutical is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +271.4%.Revenues are expected to be $369.43 million, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For BioMarin, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -13.93%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that BioMarin will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that BioMarin would post earnings of $0.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.12, delivering a surprise of -29.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.BioMarin doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Is it time to cut and run?Before investors do any panic trading, there are a few things they need to understand about Sangamo's latest clinical trial results and the rest of its pipeline.Image source: Getty Images.The first look at four people with mucopolysaccharidosis type 2 or Hunter syndrome that received SB-913 was more than a little disappointing. The experimental gene therapy was the first intended to correct a faulty gene  , but it failed to produce solid evidence that it works as intended.Hunter syndrome patients suffer from the lack of a digestive enzyme called iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) and require constant enzyme replacement therapy to keep glycosaminoglycans (GAG) from accumulating and wreaking havoc on practically every organ in their body.Sangamo gave two Hunter syndrome patients a starting dose and gave two others twice the starting dose. If all went according to plan, these patients would be producing IDS on their own now, but investigators couldn't detect any in their bloodstream.Sangamo recently infused a two-patient cohort with 10 times the starting dose of SB-913, and there are reasons to be hopeful. The pair of patients who received twice the starting dose showed a 39% and 63% reduction in circulating GAG at the 16-week follow up point.Image source: Getty Images.Circulating GAG  slightly among both patients given the starting dose, which could be a simple case of choosing an ineffective dosage to start with. If SB-913 is having a dosage-dependent effect, despite not producing measurable quantities of IDS, we'll see further evidence in about 16 weeks.Right now, investors should probably take GAG reductions observed in the double-dose cohort with a grain of salt. All of the patients were also receiving enzyme replacement therapy at the time of their baseline readings, and at their 16-week evaluation. Since investigators couldn't detect any IDS production, it really isn't safe to assume SB-913 caused the reductions observed for just two patients.Sangamo's been advancing zinc finger gene editing tech for decades without a single late-stage clinical trial success to show for it. Investors' lack of faith in the unproven technology is a big reason the stock dipped only 23% on the day the company released disappointing preliminary results for SB-913.Luckily, Wall Street's far more concerned with a program that Sangamo hasn't smudged up with zinc fingerprints. Last year,  (NYSE: PFE)  , a viral vector that carries a functional copy of a gene driven by a proprietary promoter designed to get liver cells to express the gene once it's been delivered.If SB-525 allows hemophilia A patients to produce clotting factor on their own, Sangamo could receive up to $300 million in milestone payments from Pfizer, plus a tiered double-digit royalty percentage on annual sales that could top out in the mid-nine-figure range. Treating hemophilia A with constant factor replacement infusions costs insurers a bundle.Image source: Getty Images.Of course, Sangamo's promoter needs to work as advertised during an ongoing dose-ranging study, and so far it doesn't look terrific. In August, a year after the trial began, the company told us it observed a dosage-dependent effect but didn't share any details. The first patient to be treated at the third dose level started producing enough clotting factor to avoid replacement factor infusions. (NASDAQ: BMRN) is several steps ahead of Pfizer and Sangamo, with a hemophilia A candidate that has already been shown to reduce factor replacement usage by 96% over two years following a single treatment. We'll find out if SB-525 has a chance to overcome this potential rival when the investigators present the results at a medical conference later this year.Sangamo's far too risky to begin a position at its recent price, but I don't think it's time to cut and run just yet. The company has another partnership with  that's already enrolled beta-thalassemia patients into an early stage clinical trial with an experimental cell therapy, called ST-400.Also, Sangamo owns two clinical-stage candidates outright, one for hemophilia B and another for mucopolysaccharidosis type I. Sangamo's recent  of around $1.5 billion could fall if another early clinical-stage candidate fails to impress. A diverse pipeline, though, should help the stock breeze past through this latest mishap.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If an investor was to purchase shares of BMRN stock at the current price level of $97.93/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $100.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.89% if the stock gets called away at the November 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BMRN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing BMRN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $100.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

If the game is played long enough, one player will claim a monopoly by owning all of the properties.In the real business world, though, there aren't very many true monopolies. But there is one area where several monopolies -- or at least near-monopolies -- exist. Biotechs that develop drugs for treating rare diseases frequently have the market all to themselves.Three biotech stocks that have profited tremendously from their virtual monopolies are  (NASDAQ: ALXN) ,  (NASDAQ: BMRN) , and  (NASDAQ: VRTX) . Do these biotechs' market positions make them winners for investors over the long run?Image source: Getty Images.Alexion Pharmaceuticals gained Food and Drug Administration approval for its first drug, Soliris, in 2007 as a treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is a very rare genetic disease where red blood cells break down prematurely when attacked by immune cells. Fewer than 1.5 out of a million people are impacted by the disease. Soliris remains the only approved treatment for PNH.In 2011, Alexion won approval for Soliris in treating atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). This approval gave the biotech yet another monopoly in a rare genetic disease. Alexion also picked up approval for another indication, generalized myasthenia gravis (GMG), last year. Unlike PNH and aHUS, though, GMG isn't a rare genetic disease and does have other approved treatments.For a while, Soliris stood as the most expensive drug in the world. In 2017, though, its price tag of more than $540,000 ranked Soliris  . The drug has also made Alexion very profitable. Last year, the biotech made $443 million in profit off nearly $3.6 billion in revenue.Three of BioMarin's seven approved drugs target different types of mucopolysaccharide (MPS), a rare genetic disease caused by an enzyme deficiency. The biotech's biggest-selling product, Vimizim, won FDA approval in 2014 for treating MPS IVA, also known as Morquio A syndrome. Two older drugs, Aldurazyme and Naglazyme, target MPS I and MPS VI, respectively. While  and  have approved drugs for other types of MPS, BioMarin still enjoys a near-monopoly on the MPS types that its drugs target.Two of the biotech's approved products treat phenylketonuria (PKU), another rare genetic disease caused by an enzyme deficiency. Kuvan, BioMarin's No. 2 best-selling drug, won FDA approval in 2007. Palanzyq gained FDA approval earlier this year. BioMarin also markets Brineura for treating CLN2 disease and Firdapse in Europe only for treating Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).Despite claiming monopolies with its solid lineup of rare-disease drugs, BioMarin continues to lose money. The biotech again  of 2018. But on an adjusted basis, BioMarin already has a positive bottom line. And climbing sales, especially for Vimizim, should have the biotech on a solid path to profitability.Vertex now has three approved drugs: Kalydeco, Orkambi, and Symdeko. All of these drugs treat cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare genetic disease that causes breathing problems. While there are other approved drugs that can be prescribed for the symptoms of CF, Vertex's products are currently the only approved CF drugs that target the underlying cause of the disease.But Vertex has even bigger plans. Its currently approved drugs can treat around 34,000 CF patients. Label expansions based on patient age and targeting additional residual function mutations with the three drugs should be able to boost the number of patients who can be treated to 44,000. Vertex also has triple-drug combination regimens in late-stage testing, though, that could expand the addressable patient population to 68,000.Sales for its already-approved drugs continue to grow. And they've put Vertex in a great financial position. The biotech made nearly $2.5 billion in revenue last year with over $263 million in earnings. At the end of June, Vertex had nearly $2.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.Monopolies don't necessarily last forever. Alexion, for example, faces a potential threat in aHUS from  . Vertex could see a challenge from  in CF.But maybe not. Omeros' results for OMS721 in a clinical study targeting rare kidney disease IgA nephropathy were disappointing. This same drug is being evaluated in a phase 3 study for treating aHUS. As for Galapagos, it also  for a  that could mean Vertex's monopoly will remain intact for at least several more years.Just because these biotechs enjoy monopolies doesn't make them smart picks right now. Even monopolies can cost more than they're worth. However, I think that Alexion, BioMarin, and Vertex should be pretty good choices for long-term investors. I especially like Vertex's prospects with its dominance in CF and expansion into other indications.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Welcome to  , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is August 15th, and we'll be talking  . I'm your host, Kristine Harjes, and I'm joined by  contributor Todd Campbell via Skype. We have a ton to cover today -- an update on Rite Aid's woes, a historic FDA approval.First, Spark Therapeutics, ticker ONCE, lost 28% of its market cap on Tuesday of last week. We weren't able to cover it on our last  show, so we're digging in today. Todd, what happened? It's funny, I was looking at the three stocks we're following, and it's the three tough luck tumbles. Yeah, it's pretty much all bad news today. Buckle up. Investors, bear with us. We'll hold your hands and get you through this crazy time. History does rhyme. Spark Therapeutics reported data for its hemophilia A gene therapy. Like you said, it got whacked after the data got parsed by investors. That's very similar to what we saw happen back in December, when they reported interim data for the same exact gene therapy, and investors concluded after looking at that data that Spark Therapeutics' SPK-8011 may not be as robust of a treatment option as competitor  's (NASDAQ: BMRN) . BioMarin is working on a similar gene therapy. I won't even try to pronounce the name of it, it's long, it's crazy, it has all sorts of letters in it. We'll call it by its own name, BMN 270.Essentially, what both of these therapies are trying to do is significantly improve the quality of life for people with hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a disease that's characterized by an inability to produce a blood clotting factor. As a result, these patients are at risk for serious bleeds, and they must have regular prophylactic infusions of their missing factor VIII coagulate. Efficacy for this Spark drug, SPK-8011, was pretty strong. But, there were some concerns about safety. Seven of the patients in the trial needed to take steroids to offset the immune response that they had to drug. Some patients also showed signs of liver damage. This clotting factor that the drug is designed to help with, levels of that declined enough that two of the patients in the study required infusions of the factor replacement therapy once again. Let's dive into that a little bit. Back in December, SPK-8011, the doses that Spark was investigating at that time, delivered factor VIII activity levels that ranged between 9-37%. For comparison, BioMarin's data showed activity levels of 49%. You ask, why is that important, that's a lot of numbers. If you look at what's normal, activity levels of 50% and up is normal. However, if you ask any clinician, they're going to tell you that as long as you have an activity level of greater than 12%, you're likely to avoid the serious bleeds.I think investors might be looking at this data and saying BioMarin's is more robust, but missing the point that both of these gene therapies could significantly remove the need for prophylactic infusions. If you look specifically at the data that Spark just put out, you saw an increase in the activity levels on this higher dose cohort that are now added to their trial.Like you mentioned, there were some immune responses that concerned investors, though. You had five patients who were given the higher dose. They saw in those five patients a 100% reduction in both bleeding events and need for prophylactic treatment. Pretty good, 100%. But, as you mentioned, there were two specific cases where an immune response caused a decrease in activity levels below 5%, and that caused these patients to have to get steroid treatments.People are looking at it and saying, if seven of 12 total patients -- 12 total have been tested so far, across all cohorts -- needed to have steroids because of elevated alts that could signal some liver problems, and two needed special intervention to get themselves back on track, does that mean this is an unsafe drug? Right. We'll see, as we move forward. They are going to take the drug into a Phase III trial, so more data will come out then, and we can see exactly how serious these adverse events might be across a larger patient cohort. But there will be this impending competition from BioMarin.Meanwhile, there are other things going on with Spark Therapeutics. The name might sound familiar because we've previously talked on the show about Luxturna, which was their first gene therapy to be approved as a one and done treatment for a rare type of blindness. They also have started a pivotal trial in hemophilia B, which is another drug with an insane name that we're not going to try to say on the show.Ultimately, this is still a pretty early stage company. That's why you're seeing this volatility. The company had run up quite a bit based on the early data from SPK-8011. Also, they have a partnership with  (NYSE: PFE) that was very exciting to hear about. The Luxturna approval, of course, was good news. Now it's being walked back a little bit. I'm glad you mentioned that. If you look at December, they got hit 30% after the news broke and they compared the results to BioMarin's results. You would have doubled your money buying it at that time, when it fell. No one knows where the stock is going to go from here, but they do have a lot of interesting things going on.The one other thing I would mention is, in addition to the competitive threat from BioMarin,  , which is another gene therapy company, is also working on a drug for hemophilia A. It could be, while this is over a billion-dollar market, and maybe it can support multiple players, it could be, in two to three years, when all these drugs are reading out their Phase III data and making their way to the FDA, they could have to cut that pie up in a few different places. Rite Aid, another company with a fantastic ticker, RAD, has also had a disappointing week. The stock is down nearly 20% over the last week, following the Thursday announcement that the company is terminating its $24 billion merger with grocery chain Albertsons. The announcement came on the eve of a shareholder vote. What's the story here? The company desperately wants to go to prom, but it keeps getting stood up, Kristine. Aw, that's so sad! Poor Rite-Aid. [laughs] I know!  Poor Rite-Aid! Rite-Aid is the third largest of the stand-alone pharmacy players. You have  ,  , and Rite Aid. Rite Aid came to the conclusion a few years ago that, as a stand-alone company, it was going to struggle to compete against its much bigger foes, especially because it's been dealing with, for about a decade, a tremendous amount of debt that it took on through its own acquisition spree during the 2000s.Initially, Rite Aid's solution was, \"I know what I'll do! I'll sell myself lock, stock, and barrel to Walgreens.\" Regulators objected to that because they decided it would consolidate too much market power in the pharmacy market, so they blocked that deal. Rite Aid then had to go back with Walgreens and ink a new deal, in which they basically sold almost half of their stores, and a few distribution centers, to Walgreens in exchange for a pile of cash that they could then use to help delever their balance sheet.Then, more recently, in May, Rite Aid finally found a suitor for the rest of the company, agreeing to merge together with the venture-backed Albertsons, which is one of the largest grocers in America. If you don't know the Albertsons brand, you may know some of the other brands, which include Safeway and, in the Northeast, Shaw's. That deal, however, has now also been scuttled. That's brought us back to square one as investors. A lot of the biggest shareholders in Rite Aid were not happy about the Albertsons deal. They seemed to think that Rite Aid was not getting a good enough valuation in this deal. It's interesting to me that shares plummeted on the news that investors got what they supposedly wanted. I can't really explain that one. [laughs] There are no breakup fees for either company. That's at least a small positive for Rite Aid.Honestly, this company is really, really struggling. It's down to a $1.5 billion market cap. It still has a retail footprint, it still has a PBM, but I honestly can't say I think it's in value territory right now and might be a good buy. You look at the broader pharmacy retail landscape, and it's not even the best-positioned company in that space, and the entire space is being pressured by competition from  . It has a really small scale. I don't know, I'm not very bullish on its future.The one thing I will say is, if I could look into my crystal ball and make a prediction here, I can see the company being picked apart. If you separate the PBM from the retail business, I could see a little bit of promise in the PBM. Potentially, it could have a little bit of success if it's able to partner with some of these smaller health insurers that are looking to partner with a PBM that's not affiliated with a competitor, given how many other large PBMs are now affiliated with giant insurance companies. That would work to its advantage. We'll see. That's about all I have, as far as optimism for Rite-Aid goes. [laughs] I think one of the reasons they sold off was, the hope wasn't necessarily that the deal would get scuttled, but maybe that Albertsons would rework the deal and give Rite Aid investors a bigger share of the combined company. The way the deal was structured was, Rite Aid shareholders would end up owning 29% of the combined Albertsons-Rite Aid. The problem that investors had with that is, Albertsons being privately held, very hard to value that. What is Albertsons really worth? We don't know, because it's not publicly traded. We don't have that price discovery.As a result, people were looking at it and going, \"I don't know if we're really getting the value that we deserve out of this.\" Maybe it would have been nice if they were able to restructure the deal where Rite Aid shareholders got a little bit bigger share of the company. But even then, who knows. Maybe they would have balked at that, as well.I have similar concerns about it on a stand-alone basis. Even with the pile of money they got from Walgreens, they still have, as of June, $3 billion in debt on the books. Their interest expense last quarter was $62 million. As a result of that interest expense, their net loss from continuing operations was about $42 million. Obviously, that interest expense remains a very big problem for the company. If they could solve that problem, theoretically, they would be profitable on a GAAP basis. But we just don't have a clear path for them to be able to do that.And, if you look at the fact that CVS is combining with Aetna, and that's going to narrow the ability for Aetna members to go to Rite Aid, and what kind of drag that puts on it... Then, you look at Walgreens, and the fact that they own part of  , so they have some synergies that Rite Aid doesn't have. There are some real concerns about how this company competes as a stand-alone.I think it should be one of those wait-and-see stocks. Let's see how this goes over the course of the next quarter or two, see whether or not they can start to get the prescription volume trends moving in the right direction. Given how long this saga has already played out, I feel like we'll be covering it for years to come. This thing has really stretched on. Rite Aid claims it's in discussions with an extensive list of third parties around a range of strategic options. Take that for whatever it's worth. Supposedly, there are interested buyers. But it's pretty clear that Rite Aid is in a somewhat desperate situation. I don't know that they're going to find a deal that's more favorable than this one with Albertsons would have been. It may be one of those things where people go, \"Oh, maybe I didn't want to object to that deal after all.\" Time will tell. We'll have to keep a close eye on it. Yeah, we'll see. For our last story of the day, Alnylam had its drug Patisiran, which is now known as Onpattro, approved last Friday for nerve damage that's caused by a rare disease known as hATTR. You would think that's good news, and it is. It's monumental, interesting news from a scientific perspective. From a stock perspective, the company's market cap actually fell a little bit in the wake of the news. Alnylam is working on a mechanism of action that's pretty unique. They're targeting RNAi, RNA interference. Their goal here is, genes control the production of proteins. A lot of diseases are caused by the overproduction or underproduction or incorrect production of proteins by these genes. Messenger RNA is used to execute the genes' rules to create those proteins. RNAi is a naturally occurring path that disrupts the protein production.What Alnylam has been able to do is develop this new drug that can interfere with the production of this protein that is, in these patients, being produced incorrectly. Because it's being produced incorrectly in these patients, it's building up in vital organs and around nerves. That's causing all sorts of problems for these patients.As you mentioned, it's a rare disease. This is the first FDA-approved treatment for it. Alnylam estimates that, based on the label they were given, they can treat about 3,000 people in the U.S. Their addressable market is about 3,000 people in the U.S. With a sky-high price tag, theoretically, that could still translate into a nine-figure drug. But, I'm sure we'll talk about this, there's some competition looming that we, as investors, have to be aware of. Yeah, absolutely. I want to talk first about the price that you mentioned, which is quite high. List price is $450,000 per year. They claim that after discounts, the price will be $345,000. [laughs] Quite the deal, there. They've also said that they're going to introduce value-based pricing, meaning that if the drug doesn't work or it doesn't work very well, you don't pay or you don't pay as much. The details on what that pricing structure breaks down to are still hazy. I think that's a big reason why investors reacted poorly to this news. Revenue forecasts with value-based pricing are very difficult to make.I think people were disappointed about that, and I think investors were also disappointed over the label for the drug itself. Alnylam had hoped to include some trial results that showed cardiac benefits and put that on the label itself, but the FDA disagreed with that. Then, as you mentioned, also, there is competition coming, both from  and Pfizer. That cardiac benefit could have been a differentiating factor on its label that it now doesn't have. It's been argued that that's actually the most important part of this patient population to address, the cardiac risk to these patients, and not having that data included on the label. Honestly, I didn't think they were going to be able to get that on the label. The study wasn't powered for that. I'm not surprised that's not on the label.As far as the value-based pricing goes, what I've seen so far is, they're going to get a baseline reading on the patients. Nine months to a year later, they'll go back, get another exam on those patients to see whether or not their pain is being managed well and they're staying out of the hospital. If they're able to show that, in their view, they deserve the whole amount of money, the $300,000-plus. If they don't achieve that, that's when that rebate would come back into play.What's interesting is, the value-based pricing deal is a rebate. We've heard a lot in the media about the concept of getting rid of rebates. I don't know how that value-based pricing would work if Alnylam couldn't offer rebates anymore. I don't know how that would work. That's something to keep in mind.You did also mention the competitive landscape. That's fast evolving. If you look at Ionis' drug, they're working with their spin-out,  , on that drug. They've already won approval in the European Union for it. Alnylam has the first FDA-approved drug for this indication, but it's Ionis and Akcea that have the first European approval for this indication. And, the FDA approval for Ionis' and Akcea's drug is expected in October. You're not talking about a very big head start for Alnylam, which means you're going to end up making this decision based on what the doctor views as being the most efficacious and safest treatment, the easiest dosing ritual, etc. I'm not sure we can come to any conclusions on which of these is the better drug.Then, you look at the Pfizer situation, which is really interesting. Pfizer is expected to roll out data later this month for a drug called Tafamidis. That's a Phase III trial, and it's specifically designed to evaluate the cardiac impact. Theoretically, if that trial's data results back up and show this is very good at reducing hospitalizations because of cardiac problems, it could end up carving away a lot of this relatively small market. It's a 3,000-patient market in the U.S. the way that Alnylam can target it. Maybe they're looking at it and saying, Alnylam has a high-priced drug, only 3,000 patients that they can treat, maybe they lose some of those to Ionis and Akcea, and they lose some of them to Pfizer. The Pfizer drug is pretty interesting. It's an oral drug, so it has the convenience edge. It's also been on the market in Europe for years. It has an established safety track record. If I'm a doctor and I'm trying to decide which medicine to prescribe, I'm probably going to choose the one that I know is safe.This is not all bad news. It's still awesome news for patients, to have this treatment on the market. Even though there are around 3,000 people that the drug can currently address, it's widely believed that this is a more widely spread disease that could affect around 50,000 people worldwide, it's just under-diagnosed. Previous treatments were just for symptom management. To have a drug that can come in and actually silence the gene responsible for it is pretty cool. This is also the first time that an RNA interference drug was ever approved by the FDA! This is Nobel prize-winning technology. Very cool from a scientific perspective, from a patient perspective.It's also good news for Alnylam, in terms of validating its RNAi-based platform. They have three other late-stage RNAi drugs being developed. Hopefully, this goes a long way to validate that, yes, the FDA will approve RNAi drugs.That said, though, if you tie it all together, the stock is sitting at $9 billion in market cap. That, to me, seems pretty expensive. I would say that indicates that success is expected now for all of those other late-stage drugs. That's a great point. In the past year, a lot of exciting technology that you and I have talked about for the last couple of years is finally making it to market. One of the things investors are seeing is, there's a big difference in how investors value clinical-stage companies vs. commercial-stage companies. Oftentimes, what ends up happening is, it's not that easy to jump out of the gate with a big commercial success, even if you have pie in the sky forecasts for it. So, investors tend to move into other, more exciting clinical-stage companies. As a result, the share price of these stocks tends to trade sideways to down, at least until we get a couple of quarters behind it and can actually see that, yes, this is indeed a very big market they're able to tackle. All told, we covered three stories of stocks losing value this week. I want to end us on some optimism. I'm taking this from FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb regarding the Alnylam approval. He says, \"The approval is part of a broader wave of advances that allow us to treat disease by actually targeting the root cause, enabling us to arrest or reverse a condition rather than only being able to slow its progression or treat its symptoms.\" Overall, I think that's very positive news for the whole medical landscape. Having one and done models, where you can get in, target the root cause of a disease, and rather than having patients have to manage their symptoms for the rest of their lives, being able to actually get at that root cause and stop or reverse the disease itself, is really great news. I love seeing companies working on this type of treatment. It only took 16 years to do it, but they did it! [laughs] Yeah, it has taken Alnylam a long, long time. You can just hear their management team being like, \"Finally! This is the best moment of my career! It has taken me decades to do this!\" They definitely did not have an easy pathway. Right. If you toss aside the dollars and cents of it, this is, like you said, such an exciting time for patients.

Despite solid efficacy, safety concerns quelled investor optimism. Is Spark Therapeutics on the cusp of a major advance in hemophilia treatment or will competitors outmaneuver it?In this clip from The Motley Fool's  , host Kristine Harjes and Motley Fool contributor Todd Campbell update investors on how drugmakers' efforts to create a one-and-done hemophilia treatment are progressing.A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Spark Therapeutics wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! First, Spark Therapeutics, ticker ONCE, lost 28% of its market cap on Tuesday of last week. We weren't able to cover it on our last  show, so we're digging in today. Todd, what happened? It's funny, I was looking at the three stocks we're following, and it's the three tough luck tumbles. Yeah, it's pretty much all bad news today. Buckle up. Investors, bear with us. We'll hold your hands and get you through this crazy time. History does rhyme. Spark Therapeutics reported data for its hemophilia A gene therapy. Like you said, it got whacked after the data got parsed by investors. That's very similar to what we saw happen back in December, when they reported interim data for the same exact gene therapy, and investors concluded after looking at that data that Spark Therapeutics' SPK-8011 may not be as robust of a treatment option as competitor  's (NASDAQ: BMRN) . BioMarin is working on a similar gene therapy. I won't even try to pronounce the name of it, it's long, it's crazy, it has all sorts of letters in it. We'll call it by its own name, BMN 270.Essentially, what both of these therapies are trying to do is significantly improve the quality of life for people with hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a disease that's characterized by an inability to produce a blood clotting factor. As a result, these patients are at risk for serious bleeds, and they must have regular prophylactic infusions of their missing factor VIII coagulate. Efficacy for this Spark drug, SPK-8011, was pretty strong. But, there were some concerns about safety. Seven of the patients in the trial needed to take steroids to offset the immune response that they had to drug. Some patients also showed signs of liver damage. This clotting factor that the drug is designed to help with, levels of that declined enough that two of the patients in the study required infusions of the factor replacement therapy once again. Let's dive into that a little bit. Back in December, SPK-8011, the doses that Spark was investigating at that time, delivered factor VIII activity levels that ranged between 9-37%. For comparison, BioMarin's data showed activity levels of 49%. You ask, why is that important, that's a lot of numbers. If you look at what's normal, activity levels of 50% and up is normal. However, if you ask any clinician, they're going to tell you that as long as you have an activity level of greater than 12%, you're likely to avoid the serious bleeds.I think investors might be looking at this data and saying BioMarin's is more robust, but missing the point that both of these gene therapies could significantly remove the need for prophylactic infusions. If you look specifically at the data that Spark just put out, you saw an increase in the activity levels on this higher dose cohort that are now added to their trial.Like you mentioned, there were some immune responses that concerned investors, though. You had five patients who were given the higher dose. They saw in those five patients a 100% reduction in both bleeding events and need for prophylactic treatment. Pretty good, 100%. But, as you mentioned, there were two specific cases where an immune response caused a decrease in activity levels below 5%, and that caused these patients to have to get steroid treatments.People are looking at it and saying, if seven of 12 total patients -- 12 total have been tested so far, across all cohorts -- needed to have steroids because of elevated alts that could signal some liver problems, and two needed special intervention to get themselves back on track, does that mean this is an unsafe drug? Right. We'll see, as we move forward. They are going to take the drug into a Phase III trial, so more data will come out then, and we can see exactly how serious these adverse events might be across a larger patient cohort. But there will be this impending competition from BioMarin.Meanwhile, there are other things going on with Spark Therapeutics. The name might sound familiar because we've previously talked on the show about Luxturna, which was their first gene therapy to be approved as a one and done treatment for a rare type of blindness. They also have started a pivotal trial in hemophilia B, which is another drug with an insane name that we're not going to try to say on the show.Ultimately, this is still a pretty early stage company. That's why you're seeing this volatility. The company had run up quite a bit based on the early data from SPK-8011. Also, they have a partnership with  that was very exciting to hear about. The Luxturna approval, of course, was good news. Now it's being walked back a little bit. I'm glad you mentioned that. If you look at December, they got hit 30% after the news broke and they compared the results to BioMarin's results. You would have doubled your money buying it at that time, when it fell. No one knows where the stock is going to go from here, but they do have a lot of interesting things going on.The one other thing I would mention is, in addition to the competitive threat from BioMarin,  , which is another gene therapy company, is also working on a drug for hemophilia A. It could be, while this is over a billion-dollar market, and maybe it can support multiple players, it could be, in two to three years, when all these drugs are reading out their Phase III data and making their way to the FDA, they could have to cut that pie up in a few different places.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["onday's session closes with the NASDAQ Composite Index at 7,821.01.

However, stocks came well off their lows of the session and, therefore, remain just a few steps behind all-time highs that were set just last week.The NASDAQ was off 0.23% on Tuesday to 8091.3, while the S&P slipped 0.17% to 2896.7.

Discussions will resume in Washington tomorrow, but without as much optimism as before. On the China front, $200 billion worth of new tariffs are set to be imposed on Chinese goods this week.While the market continues to sweat about trade issues, it's important to remember that such worries have not impacted the economy just yet. For example, the ISM Manufacturing Index reached 61.3 in August, which not only beat expectations and July's 58.1, but was also the best reading since 2004.Move over Apple! Another big piece of news to start September was that Amazon briefly became the second American company to reach $1 trillion. It was over the threshold of 2050.27 this afternoon, but couldn't hold it into the close and finished at 2039.51. It was still up more than 1.3% in the session. Apple hit the $1 Trillion mark just a little over a month ago (August 2). Payment services company Square (SQ) has been a great performer for the portfolio. In fact, it's been the  performer with a gain of more than 77% since inception in March. So it's no wonder Dave wants more exposure to that space with today's addition of MoneyGram (MGI), which handles money transfers, money orders and payment processing solutions for financial institutions and retail customers.

When looking for a new portfolio pick, Brian Bolan doesn't usually gravitate toward stocks that have fallen short of earnings expectations in three of the last four quarters. But he's making an exception for Avid Tech (AVID), which is in the business of video and multimedia delivery. Basically, the stock missed big in its most recent report, but has a solid outlook, an attractive chart and continues to hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The editor thinks this stock is headed to new highs as all the profit will be coming in the next two quarters, so he added AVID on Tuesday before this seasonal swing.

The stock dipped 10% after its recent quarterly report, but has shown a lot of resilience by grinding back near pre-earnings levels. The editor thinks TILE, which raised its 2018 guidance, is set to end its sideways pattern\u2026and his Fibonacci analysis supports a great risk/reward setup.The other buy today is a mirror image of TILE. Keysight Technologies (KEYS) has been a great performer with shares jumping 50% this year, but the stock recently pulled back despite a strong quarter. This provider of electronic design and test solutions jumped 15% after beating earnings and revenue in its most recent report and hiking its Q4 guidance. It has since pulled back to pre-earnings levels, which gives Jeremy a great chance to pick it up at a bargain before the next leg up. TILE and KEYS were each added with 12% allocations.

Management recently reported updated results for its hemophilia A therapy, SPK-8011, and it officially transferred development of its hemophilia B drug, SPK-9011, to collaboration partner  (NYSE: PFE) . Can Spark Therapeutics become a leader in this blockbuster indication, or will competitors beat it to the punch?In January, Spark Therapeutics launched Luxturna with an $850,000 price tag after it won  for the gene therapy in December.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Luxturna uses an inactivated adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector to deliver a gene to a patient's retinal cells that can produce a missing protein and restore vision in 90% of patients with biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy, a rare genetic disorder affecting between 1,000 and 2,000 Americans.Luxturna was the first FDA-approved gene therapy to use an AAV vector, and its approval adds conviction that other therapies that rely on AAV for delivery can be similarly safe and effective.There are two types of hemophilia: hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Hemophilia A patients can't produce adequate amounts of coagulation factor VIII, while hemophilia B patients can't produce adequate amounts of coagulation factor IX.In both hemophilia A and B, patients are at risk of uncontrolled bleeding events, and as a result, patients can receive regular prophylactic infusions of their missing clotting factor to help control their condition. Alternatively, they can receive these infusions as necessary to stop bleeding. Globally, the World Federation of Hemophilia estimates about 150,000 people suffer from hemophilia A and about 30,000 people suffer from hemophilia B.Regular prophylactic treatment with missing clotting factors can reduce the risk of severe bleeding and internal bleeding that can damage joints, but it isn't without its drawbacks. Prophylactic administration of the missing clotting factors is inconvenient and the cost of these factor replacement therapies can eclipse $100,000 per year. Additionally, up to 30% of hemophilia A patients and 5% of hemophilia B patients develop inhibitors that make treating them even more difficult and expensive.Instead, Spark Therapeutics is developing AAV gene therapies that may safely restore coagulation factor activity in hemophilia patients. Its SPK-8001 is a wholly owned therapy being evaluated in hemophilia A patients and its SPK-9001 is licensed to Pfizer for use in hemophilia B patients.In December, Spark Therapeutics  from small trials for both of these drugs. In the case of SPK-8001, a single administration of 5 x 1011 or 1 x 1012 vector genomes per kilogram of body weight reduced bleeds by 100% after week four compared to an average 5.5 annualized bleeds previously. It also reduced the need for infusions by 98% to an average 1.2 per year from 57.8 per year. Importantly, none of the trial participants developed factor VIII inhibitors.Spark and Pfizer also reported data for SPK-9001 showing 11 patients who received a single administration of 5 x 1011 vector genomes per kilogram of body weight saw a 97% reduction in annualized bleeds and a 99% reduction in annualized infusions.Across the two sets of data, the concern investors had was that factor VIII activity levels following SPK-8001 dosing were lower than levels reported for a competing gene therapy,  's (NASDAQ: BMRN) valoctocogene roxaparvovec. In BioMarin's study, most patients achieved factor VIII  above 46%, which is close to the 50% expression levels considered normal.To close the gap with BioMarin, Spark said it would enroll more patients to see if it could boost factor VIII activity further and earlier this month, it said five patients given a 2x1012 vg/kg dose had factor VIII activity of between 16% to 49%, with a 30% average, after 12 weeks. Bleed rates and infusion rates fell by 100% in those five patients.That success has Spark planning to use that dose in a pivotal phase 3 trial it expects to start later this year. As for SPK-9001, Spark officially handed off development of it to Pfizer in accordance with their licensing pact. Pfizer has already begun a six-month lead-in to that phase 3 study that will serve as the control group for its subsequent SPK-9001 trial. According to Clinicaltrials.gov, the study's estimated completion date is in November 2020.Despite progressing toward phase 3 trials, Spark Therapeutics investors sold shares following the company's update. The decline was ignited by news that two patients receiving the 2x1012 vg/kg dose suffered an immune response that caused their factor VIII levels to drop below 5%, requiring them to shift to on-demand factor VIII treatment. One patient responded to oral steroids. However, the other patient was admitted to the hospital to receive IV steroid infusions. The infusion worked, but the hospital admission qualified it as a serious adverse event.Management also said that seven of the total 12 patients in the SPK-8011 study required oral steroids to address elevated liver enzyme levels.Based on these events, the SPK-8011 trial will include a prophylactic course of steroids, which management believes will keep the immune responses in check. We'll have to wait to find out if they're right, but a similar steroid course is being used alongside Luxturna, so there's some reason to think that this approach will work.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Until we get more insight from Spark Therapeutics hemophilia A trial or Spark and Pfizer's hemophilia B trial, investors will want to watch for hemophilia A updates from BioMarin and another competitor,  (NASDAQ: SGMO) .BioMarin is conducting two phase 3 trials for its hemophilia A gene therapy and it expects the first of these trials to complete enrollment early next year. Sangamo recently reported top-line results from early-stage trials of SB-525, a therapy that also uses  to restore factor VIII production.According to Sangamo, SB-525 is well tolerated and there haven't been any serious adverse events witnessed so far. One patient achieved factor VIII activity rates above 12%, which is considered to be the cutoff for reducing the risk of bleeds, and a prophylactic, tapering course of oral steroids hasn't been necessary.Sangamo's going to enroll six more patients, and based on how SB-525 works in them, the company will either add another cohort or advance SB-525 into a pivotal study. Management also plans to unveil more details from its SB-525 trial in December at the American Society of Hematology conference.As it stands today, Spark's timeline is a little behind BioMarin, and Sangamo's timeline is a little behind Spark. There could be room for all three of these gene therapies to succeed, but the therapy that proves itself to be safest is likely to be the one that's most successful. Therefore, investors will want to keep close tabs on these companies' progress.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Robust patient growth and penetration should propel the drugs' sales.Naglazyme and Vimzim revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from some countries, mainly Brazil. However, on the first-quarter call, management once again stressed that Brazilian revenues, as a percentage of total revenues, will continue to decline as BioMarin launches products.Nevertheless, the drugs continue to witness steady patient growth and we expect the trend to continue this quarter.Brineura, for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease - a form of Batten disease - was approved in both the United States and EU last year. Brineura generated sales of around $9 million in 2017 and $6.9 million in the first quarter. Sales are expected to be higher in the second quarter.In June, BioMarin received a milestone payment of $20 million from Pfizer  triggered by the FDA and EMA acceptance of the latter's new drug application (NDA) submission for pipeline candidate, talazoparib. The milestone payment was committed to BioMarin by Medivation, which bought global rights to talazoparib from BioMarin in August 2015. Medivation was later acquired by Pfizer. The milestone payment should boost BioMarin's sales in the soon-to-be reported quarter.On the second-quarter investor call, we also expect management to comment on the launch preparation for pegvaliase injection. Pegvaliase was approved by the FDA in May to be marketed by the trade name of Palynziq for the treatment of adults with PKU, a rare genetic disease.We also expect management to discuss how the pipeline is progressing on the conference call.

Fidanacogene elaparvovec, a high-activity human coagulation factor IX gene, is a one-time treatment option.Pfizer also plans to conduct the next part of the phase III study and the patients who completeat least six months in the lead-in studywill be moved to this pivotal study. Fidanacogene elaparvovec was previously known as SPK-9001/PF-06838435 and was originally developed by Spark Therapeutics  . Fidanacogene elaparvovec was transferred by Spark to Pfizer, following positive results announced from an ongoing phase I/II study in May 2018.The results showed that all 15 patients in the study were able to discontinue routine infusions of factor IX concentrates with no reported serious adverse or thrombotic events. Consequently, Pfizer has now assumed sole responsibility for all subsequent pivotal studies, and regulatory and development activities of any product, resulting from the hemophilia B gene therapy programHemophilia B is a rare, genetic bleeding disorder found almost exclusively in males. It causes the blood to take a long time to clot because of a deficiency in one of several blood clotting factors, most notably clotting factor IX, a specific protein in the blood. It is expected that hemophilia B patients if once treated with fidanacogene elaparvovec will be able to produce factor IX themselves, rather than having to regularly inject factor IX.Year to date, shares of Pfizer have increased 3.7% compared with the  's decline of 1.7%.Gene therapy is set to become one of the most promising space in the volatile biotech sector, which continues to grapple with increasing threat from biosimilars.Pfizer is also developing other candidates for gene therapy.The company's mini-dystrophin gene therapy candidate, PF-06939926 is in phase Ib clinical trial, being evaluated in boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy.We remind investors that Spark, in December 2017, obtained the FDA approval for its lead gene therapy drug, Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl), for the treatment of patients with viable retinal cells and confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy.Luxturna is the first FDA-approved gene therapy for inherited retinal disease and the first adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector gene therapy approved United States. The company has built a pipeline of gene therapy candidates that are directed to the retina, the liver and the central nervous system.The pipeline includes an ocular program consisting of SPK-7001, targeting choroideremia, currently in phase I/II clinical trials. Its hemophilia programs also consist of SPK-8011 for hemophilia A, currently in phase I/II clinical trials.BioMarin Pharmaceutical  is also developing valoctocogene roxaparvovec, an experimental gene therapy for the treatment of patients with severe hemophilia.uniQure N.V. is another promising player in this space, which is creating a pipeline of innovative gene therapies that have been developed both internally and through its collaboration with Bristol Myers-Squibb  . | Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(It's already there on an adjusted basis.)Data source: BioMarin Pharmaceutical.Image source: Getty Images.CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime highlighted the company's midterm growth prospects: \"With Palynziq now approved in the U.S. and on track for an EU approval in the second half of 2019, we believe we can generate approximately $2 billion in revenues in 2020 with our currently commercialized products alone.\" Not too bad, considering it only  the combined $1 billion mark in 2016.Chief Commercial Officer Jeffrey Ajer pointed out the mix of patients starting Palynziq:The naive patients are obviously more financially beneficial to BioMarin since they don't cannibalize sales of Kuvan.Management left its 2018 guidance pretty much intact. BioMarin plans to spend a little more on research and development than previously planned to fund the expanded clinical trial for its hemophilia gene therapy, valoctocogene roxaparvovec (val rox). But the company will be able to absorb the increase, so earnings should still be in the range of previously announced guidance.While the growth of BioMarin's currently approved drugs is certainly important, the results of the phase 3 trials for val rox will likely drive the biotech's valuation into the next decade.

This biopharmaceutical company, based in Cambridge, MA, is focused on the development of RNA-based therapeutics targeting rare and infectious diseases. The company's sole marketed drug, Exondys 51, is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (\"DMD\").In the last three months, Sarepta's share price has significantly outperformed the  to which it belongs. The stock has gained 89.2% compared with an increase of 8.1% for the industry.Sarepta received accelerated approval for Exondys 51 in 2016 for treating patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene susceptible to exon 51 skipping in the United States. The drug showed impressive growth in 2017 and its sales increased 12.7% sequentially to $64.6 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase was fueled by strong demand trends. The company expects the drug's sales to double this year.The company is carrying out activities to further boost the drug's sales. Sarepta has launched a Managed Access Program in Europe and Americas to increase accessibility of Exondys 51. The drug is under review in Europe. The settlement of a patent litigation with BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  in 2017 also helped Sarepta as it now owns global exclusive rights for Exondys 51.However, the company's dependence on this drug for growth is a concern as a downfall may severely impact the stock. The majority of Sarepta's pipeline candidates are in early to mid-stage development.The company is building its DMD pipeline, which will enhance its approved drug portfolio. The pipeline candidates, upon approval, will be eligible for larger patient population than Exondys 51. The company has about eight exon-skipping pipeline candidates, which can treat 75-80% of DMD patients.Golodirsen, the lead DMD candidate, has shown better improvement in patients in a mid-stage clinical study compared to results achieved by Exondys 51. In fact golodirsen has increased mean dystrophin protein production by 10.7 times from baseline against nearly three times for Exondys 51.

This biopharmaceutical company, based in Cambridge, MA, is focused on the development of RNA-based therapeutics targeting rare and infectious diseases. The company's sole marketed drug, Exondys 51, is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (\"DMD\").In the last three months, Sarepta's share price has significantly outperformed the  to which it belongs. The stock has gained 89.2% compared with an increase of 8.1% for the industry.Sarepta received accelerated approval for Exondys 51 in 2016 for treating patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene susceptible to exon 51 skipping in the United States. The drug showed impressive growth in 2017 and its sales increased 12.7% sequentially to $64.6 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase was fueled by strong demand trends. The company expects the drug's sales to double this year.The company is carrying out activities to further boost the drug's sales. Sarepta has launched a Managed Access Program in Europe and Americas to increase accessibility of Exondys 51. The drug is under review in Europe. The settlement of a patent litigation with BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  in 2017 also helped Sarepta as it now owns global exclusive rights for Exondys 51.However, the company's dependence on this drug for growth is a concern as a downfall may severely impact the stock. The majority of Sarepta's pipeline candidates are in early to mid-stage development.The company is building its DMD pipeline, which will enhance its approved drug portfolio. The pipeline candidates, upon approval, will be eligible for larger patient population than Exondys 51. The company has about eight exon-skipping pipeline candidates, which can treat 75-80% of DMD patients.Golodirsen, the lead DMD candidate, has shown better improvement in patients in a mid-stage clinical study compared to results achieved by Exondys 51. In fact golodirsen has increased mean dystrophin protein production by 10.7 times from baseline against nearly three times for Exondys 51.

In May, Biomarin received FDA approval for pegvaliase to reduce blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in phenylketonuria (PKU) patients.This was the second product approval for BioMarin in less than two years, the first being Brineura in mid-2017. Its impressive rare disease pipeline is also progressing well. BioMarin's key orphan disease drugs - Vimizim and Kuvan - continue to do well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. BioMarin expects sustained growth in both the drugs. (NASDAQ:  ): The company's share price has increased 25.1% in the past month. The company benefited from its numerous licensing agreements.This year so far, Ligand has entered into a worldwide OmniAb platform license agreement with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals per which the latter will be able to use the its full OmniAb platform to discover fully human mono- and multispecific antibodies.Ligand also entered into a worldwide OmniAb platform license agreement with Ferring Pharmaceuticals and venBio Partners this year.

Three of QQEW's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY), T-Mobile US Inc (Symbol: TMUS), and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN).

Tax reform has freed up more cash and made potential targets more accretive. The economy is humming along. And in a few key sectors - consumer goods and media come to mind - there's an obvious logic behind consolidation.The old rules still apply as well. Older companies are looking to drive scale and cut costs. Newer companies are looking to expand their reach - or cash out by selling to one of those older companies looking to spark growth of their own.With U.S. mergers  - perhaps due to tax uncertainty - there's some pent-up demand as well. And so this might be exactly the type of market to look for takeover stocks. These 18 stocks all have been rumored or reported targets. And in many (though not necessarily all) cases, the possibility of an acquisition doesn't necessarily look priced in.On this site late last year, Larry Ramer argued that  (NYSE:  ) was  . Ramer isn't alone in that argument. Noted short-seller Citron Research made a similar claim last year in arguing that BB stock had  .Rumors of potential acquirers have swirled for some time. BlackBerry of course almost went private back in 2013 at $9-per-share. Two years later, the company  with Samsung about an acquisition.There's still a logical takeover case for BlackBerry at the moment. The phone business is gone, leaving an attractive software business. The QNX operating system has a real role to play in  . BlackBerry's patents have real value, with potential upside from a filed suit against  (NASDAQ:  ). And with over $2 billion in cash on the books, another go-private transaction could work as well.BB stock, meanwhile, has pulled back below $10 despite  . Investors are worried that the company's turnaround simply isn't progressing fast enough (indeed,  ). But with real value in the software and the nameplate, it simply may be that the turnaround could be better executed under different ownership.The acquisition of Time Warner by  (NYSE:  ) has led to an belief that consolidation is coming in the media space. As James Brumley  :\"\u2026the previous lines between media distribution, media creation, and content licensing have been completely wiped away. This is just the beginning of a heated M&A race, with all players knowing once-unthinkable partnerships are now going to be permitted.\"And so the owners of content look like attractive targets, and  (NYSE:  , NYSE:  ) is high on the list. As Will Healy argued last month, its ownership of Starz, films such as  and TV programs, including  and  for larger distributors.LGF earnings have struggled a bit, and so has LGF stock. Analysts have  of late. And investors likely will need a bit of patience. It seems likely that consolidation, if it comes, won't kick into full gear until  between  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) has completed. But for investors who believe that consolidation is inevitable, LGF's lower valuation and content portfolio make it among the most attractive takeover stocks to buy at the moment.Lions Gate isn't the only potential target, however.  (NASDAQ:  ) is another mid-sized content provider that could provide an attractive consolation prize for acquirers who miss out on the big fish. It also provides a nice 'tuck-in' acquisition for companies looking to expand their reach.AMC owns five networks, including the flagship AMC, along with WE tv, Sundance, BBC America and IFC. Ratings for The Walking Dead have declined of late, but it's still the most-watched program on cable and it has a huge long tail of content licensing revenue ahead. (AMCX owns Dead in full, unlike  and  .)Meanwhile, AMCX is controlled by the Dolan family, who has already sold off Cablevision and reportedly would like to do the same with  (NYSE:  ). And of late, the company has aggressively repurchased shares instead of paying down debt, which suggests at least a possibility that management believes that debt could become someone else's problem.The only concern here is valuation. I sold AMCX on a recent runup near $70, while the stock looks cheap on a price-to-earnings basis, further declines from  can lead earnings south, and even 2018 growth looks relatively muted. With a recent pullback after a big run following the AT&T/Time Warner deal, however, AMCX is starting to drift back to an attractive valuation.Acquisition rumors have swirled around specialty biotech  (NASDAQ:  ) for years now. In fact,  has had it on  .Analysts have become part of the act off and on as well, with speculated acquirers including  (NYSE:  ) and  (OTCMKTS:  ).The M&A case here makes some sense. BioMarin has developed  , including several \"orphan drugs\", as well as potentially valuable  for hemophilia. 2018 revenue should be in the range of $1.5 billion, but BioMarin continues to post losses, which is one reason why the stock has flat-lined the past few years.A larger acquirer could add growth from BioMarin's drugs and cut costs to turn the company profitable. The big concern is valuation, particularly after a 30% run off of April lows. Still, at some point, the long-awaited sale of BioMarin appears likely. And even just below $100, there's still more upside to come in that scenario.Aircraft parts manufacturer  (NYSE:  ) has been a subject of takeover speculation ever since it split from  (NYSE:  ). An activist stake owned by Elliott Management, whose strategies generally center on a near-term sale, only added to the frenzy. CNBC's Jim Cramer argued last year that  (NYSE:  ) was  , after  (NYSE:  )  (NYSE:  ).That speculation has been paused, however, as Arconic's performance has hit the skids. The stock plunged in late April after cutting its full-year outlook. Higher aluminum costs are hitting margins (and somewhat ironically benefiting the Alcoa unit that supposedly was hiding Arconic's true potential). Production missteps under Elliott's new, hand-picked CEO have only added to the pressure.Still, at some point, Arconic seems likely to return to being one of the most talked-about takeover stocks. It will take some time for the company to work through near-term issues. But with end demand from  (NYSE:  ) strong and likely to stay the way, and consolidation in the space inevitable, Arconic very well may be acquired sooner than many investors currently believe.There are three key reasons why chipmaker  (NASDAQ:  ) is a likely acquisition target. The first is that the chip space in general is performing well and optimism toward the future is rising. With trends like IoT (Internet of Things) providing tailwinds, there's an increasing belief that the old, more cyclical, nature of the space is starting to fade.Secondly, Xilinx looks like a strong play on one of the bigger trends: artificial intelligence. Its FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) are  . Indeed, the company  in May.And, third, there's a logical acquirer here in  (NASDAQ:  ). Even before Broadcom's bid to buy  (NASDAQ:  ) fell through, XLNX was  for that always-acquisitive company. With Broadcom now U.S.-based, and with plenty of dry powder, such a deal makes even more sense at the moment. With XLNX lagging the chip space - it has gained less than 5% over the past year - despite strong earnings, the valuation looks workable as well. (NASDAQ:  ) is another target for Broadcom or another large semiconductor company. Indeed, speculation has swirled for some time. Rumors of interest from Japan's  (OTCMKTS:  ) spiked MXIM stock in January, but the rumor was quickly shot down. Back in 2015, sources said Maxim held talks with  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).In both cases, price was a reported issue, and that still may be the case. At 21x forward earnings, MXIM stock isn't exactly cheap. But a takeover at some point does seem possible, if not necessarily likely. And in the meantime, investors can receive a 2.8% dividend yield as they wait. (NASDAQ:  ) is not a stock for the faint of heart. Execution missteps and weak demand have led MAT stock to drop by about 62% over the past five years, and 32% over the past three, even with a recent rally. The  with Disney to rival  (NASDAQ:  ) has only added to the pressure.Indeed, I don't see MAT as a buy, particularly after gains over the past couple of months. I argued a year ago that  (when it traded above current levels) and  .But Mattel appears to have entered the realm of takeover stocks, and with some reason. Hasbro could be a suitor, although antitrust concerns are an issue. The company itself said it had  from MGA Entertainment in May.The huge amount of debt is a big problem, as markets are valuing that debt as low as 82 cents on the dollar, making it less likely that an acquirer would want to pay par and provide a premium to equity owners. Still, rumors continue to swirl, and if Mattel can make some progress on its turnaround, the calls for a sale likely will only get louder. (NYSE:  ) is in an interesting spot at the moment. The open-source software developer unquestionably has  . But it's also coming off  that sent RHT stock plunging.Even after the losses, RHT still isn't cheap.Yet takeover speculation has continued, with recent rumors suggesting  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  )  as it builds out its cloud business. Any interest could start a bidding war, with other tech giants including  (NASDAQ:  ) perhaps becoming interested.Whether there's room for more premium is unclear, with RHT still trading at a dear 34x+ forward P/E multiple. But given its growth potential and importance in such a key space, Red Hat could become a target at any time.Grocery stocks have struggled for the past year, ever since Amazon  of Whole Foods Market. And with the industry's majors looking to increase scale and stand out from the crowd,  (NASDAQ:  ) seems like an intriguing target.Analysts have  . And indeed, Sprouts itself has taken steps down that path. Its CEO said in December that Sprouts was  . It held talks with Albertsons early last year, though after they fell through, that giant instead  with  (NYSE:  ).  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) all potentially make sense as buyers.The concern is that - like many of these takeover stocks - some M&A premium is already priced in. And SFM did fall hard after  in early May. But the stock has regained most of those losses, and it has held up despite the pressure on the space. That's likely because the market believes that at some point, a buyout offer will come along.Drone manufacturer  (NASDAQ:  ) has been a logical M&A target going back to the last decade. Longstanding relationships with the U.S. Army and the Department of Defense, along with a generally heavy cost structure, theoretically made AVAV a natural target for a major defense contractor like  (NYSE:  ) or  (NYSE:  ).But the recent gains in AVAV stock, which has tripled from late 2016 lows, are coming from improvements in the business, not takeover speculation. Margins are improving. AeroVironment has two key opportunities in commercial applications (notably for agricultural use) and a joint venture with  (OTCMKTS:  ) to offer 5G wireless from high-altitude drones.Still, there's a potential M&A case here, with the only concern being its valuation. AVAV looks awfully stretched from here, trading at ~45x forward earnings. There are a lot of costs to cut, but it remains to be seen if the savings, and the potential growth, are large enough to justify more gains for AVAV.Chemical producer  (NYSE:  ) doesn't get a lot of attention from investors, despite a $5 billion market cap. But there is increasing belief that Grace could be a takeover target relatively soon.In April,  surrounding a  (NYSE:  ) bid sent GRA shares up over 6%. Before that, RBC cited the company as  . And the 2016 spin-off of  (NYSE:  ) made a potential sale easier, as Grace's CFO  .In the meantime, GRA still looks reasonably attractive. Despite a sharp rebound from early April lows, GRA trades at a still-reasonable 17x forward earnings. Chemical production  . GRA doesn't look like a bad stock on its own, and a buyout from Honeywell, or another acquirer, could create real upside.There are few, if any, companies that have been takeover stocks longer than optical networking provider  (NYSE:  ). Investors were looking for a Ciena buyout  . In 2010,  (NYSE:  )  . Two years ago,  from  (NASDAQ:  ), which was supposed to buy the company  .More recent speculation names  (NASDAQ:  ) as  . And several firms, including Morgan Stanley, have added CIEN to their list of takeover stocks.Will this time be different? Possibly. But in the meantime, Ciena has a healthy balance sheet, a focus on margin expansion, and a reasonable valuation. Even if a takeover doesn't (finally) materialize, there could be some value left in CIEN stock. (NYSE:  ) seems like a classic takeout candidate. It's disrupting a payment space largely led by giants. The business could benefit from increased scale, and an acquirer could gain from lower sales and marketing spend.The only question at this point is whether SQ stock is too expensive. I've long been  , but so far, I've been completely wrong.In my defense, I'm not alone. At $65, SQ stock is well ahead of the consensus Wall Street target of $57. And at nearly 10x revenue, there's a question as to whether the valuation can support anything left in the way of premium. Companies like  (NASDAQ:  ) and even  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) could be logical suitors. But can they - and will they - pay what Square shareholders would ask for?Just a few years ago, beverage maker  (NASDAQ:  ) was a sleepy producer of smaller soft drink brands. But the company's LaCroix sparkling water brand took off, and so did FIZZ stock. It has risen 484% in the past five years alone.Along with that increased valuation has come increased attention. Short sellers have targeted FIZZ stock. And rumors of a takeover have only amplified.After all, LaCroix looks like a big winner. It has massive market share in sparkling water, a category that is taking share from diet soda (and regular soda as well). Quirky branding, design and marketing has garnered the label a cult following.And so an acquisition makes sense - if one of the majors can't undercut the LaCroix business.  (NASDAQ:  ) is trying to do so with  .  (NYSE:  ) has rolled out Dasani sparkling water and  . But if LaCroix continues its dominance, Pepsi or Coke may simply decide to buy out National Beverage. Acquisitive  (NYSE:  ) could be in the mix as well.The rumor mill is as hot around  (NYSE:  ) as any of the takeover stocks right now. In May, disappointing numbers and  sent CPB stock to its lowest levels in nearly five years. But reports that  (NASDAQ:  ) is  have sent CPB shares soaring.From here, the logic of a Kraft-Campbell's tie-up seems minimal. Adding one zero-growth, indebted manufacturer to another doesn't seem like an attractive combination. But at the least, it does seem like CPB's family ownership group is accepting the need for a sale. And with activist pressure helping, that could lead to a buyout, whether by Kraft or by someone else.A common trend in the food industry the last few years has been for larger companies to buy smaller, faster-growing brands in the natural and organic spaces. But  (NASDAQ:  ) seems to have missed out.Over the past few years, Hain has been cited as a possible target for a number of companies, including Kraft Heinz, Campbell's and  (NYSE:  ). But a somewhat unwieldy portfolio, which includes personal care, meats and snacks, has made a straight sale difficult. In the meantime, HAIN stock has taken a big hit, touching a six-year low in late May before a recent rebound.But a sale finally may be on the way. An  and is pushing for a sale. HAIN probably won't get a price close to its peak, and it may have to break itself up to create incremental value for existing shareholders. There is some value here, however, and a clear motivation to - finally - get a deal done.Takeover speculation has ramped up around  (NASDAQ:  ) this year. Once founder Steve Wynn  in February, the path to a sale actually became a bit clearer.Rival  (NYSE:  ) seemed like the most logical acquirer. Rumors followed in April that  (NYSE:  ) was  .And with WYNN pulling back over the past few weeks, largely due to concerns surrounding its operations in Macau, the case for a takeout looks stronger. U.S. casinos have been in full-out M&A mode, with  (NASDAQ:  ) buying up Isle of Capri and other assets and  (NASDAQ:  ) merging with  (NASDAQ:  ), among many other moves. Similar logic would work for a takeout of Wynn.The logic of a deal doesn't necessarily mean one is on the way.

In the first four months of the year (January-April), the biotech industry significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The biotech industry declined 9.3% compared with the S&P 500's decline of 0.8%.However, the  has bounced back in the past month. It rose 6.8%, better than the S&P 500's increase of 2.9%. A better-than-expected first quarter pulled up the biotech industry. As of May 31, 2018, 94.8% of the medicalsector's total market cap in the S&P 500 index reported results. Total earnings for these companies were up 13.8% on 7.1% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 71.7% beating revenue estimates. Several positive pipeline and regulatory updates also contributed to the rise.Acquisitions and strategic collaboration deals have also been rising consistently this year with the tax reform in place. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is spurring merger activity.In fact, the drug/biotech sector has been one of the best-performing industries in the U.S. stock market. The outlook for biotech/drug sector is quite positive for the rest of the year.Here we take a look at three stocks whose share price has increased in the past month. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see  . The company share price has increased 5.9% in the past month. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2. In May, Biomarin received FDA approval for pegvaliase to reduce blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. This was the second product approval for BioMarin in less than two years, the first being Brineura in mid-2017. Its impressive rare disease pipeline is also progressing well. BioMarin's key orphan disease drugs - Vimizim and Kuvan - continue to do well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. BioMarin expects sustained growth in both the drugs. ): The company's share price has increased 25.1% in the past month. The company benefited from its numerous licensing agreements. This year so far, Ligand has entered into a worldwide OmniAb platform license agreement with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals per which the latter will be able to use the its full OmniAb platform to discover fully human mono- and multispecific antibodies. Ligand also entered into a worldwide OmniAb platform license agreement with Ferring Pharmaceuticals and venBio Partners this year. Ligand also carries a Zacks Rank #2. The share price of the company has increased 32.9% in the past month. In May 2018, VIVUS entered into an agreement with Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson  , to acquire all rights to the latter's exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (\"EPI\") drug, Pancreaze, in the United States and Canada. This is the first of what the company expects to be a series of product acquisitions designed to generate revenues and strengthen its financial position. Pancreaze has a positive cash flow, which is expected to boost VIVUS' revenues. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Right now, political uncertainty in Italy has sent global markets into a tailspin, and the U.S. has just put a global tariff tiff back into play. However, even in these conditions, there still are several stock picks that look like compelling opportunities right now.Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Garthwaite, who still sees stocks as a valuable source of returns, recently wrote in a note to clients: \"We conclude that a US recession is unlikely until Q3 2020. Remain overweight equities.\"So if it's still game-on for bulls, which stocks are worthy of a closer look? We used  market data to compile a list of 10 of the most intriguing stock picks right now. TipRanks tracks the latest stock ratings from more than 4,700 analysts. As a result, we can pinpoint the stocks that Wall Street's top analysts believe are set to rally in the coming months.Let's take a closer look at their favorite stocks now:Market value: $66.8 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $76.65 (33% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Highflying semiconductor stock Micron (  , $57.59) revealed multiple positive catalysts at its annual analyst day on May 21. First came an earnings guidance raise for its fiscal third quarter, then news of a deal with Intel (  ). The icing on the cake? A massive $10 billion share buyback program. Micron now expects revenue this quarter of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion (up from a prior range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion). Shares subsequently jumped almost 8%.Analysts rushed to boost their MU price targets, with Rosenblatt Securities' Hans Mosesmann (  ) offering the highest price target of $115 (84% upside potential). After the meeting, he commented, \"Micron executed one of its best investor days we can remember by cementing the case of the structural change in the memory/storage industry with both significant Micron specific operating profit improvements, and a $10 billion share repurchase authorization starting in FY19.\"For Mosesmann, this firmly rebuts fears that the memory market was about to enter a downturn cycle. On the contrary, he believes we are looking at a prolonged cycle for the memory/storage markets with sustainable profitability. Data-center storage and AI has increased demand, while supply is more limited as the manufacturing process becomes increasingly complex.\"Micron is generating roughly $10 billion in (free cash flow) per year going forward and with the improved balance sheet and $10 billion repurchase program for FY19 we believe investors will start to view the shares in a different light in a sustainable fashion\" Mosesmann writes.This \"Strong Buy\" stock currently boasts 20 buy ratings, versus just three holds and one sell.Market value: $40.7 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $146.44 (12% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: \"Ride the tide,\" advises Oppenheimer's Andrew Uerkwitz (  ) when it comes to video games giant Electronic Arts (  , $130.91).This five-star analyst has just attended a Battlefield reveal event for the latest installment in the franchise, Battlefield V. He managed to get a sneak peak on some of the upcoming features for the game, which is due for official release in October.\"We believe BFV is a solid improvement over the proven formula of BF1 and retains the core mechanics that made the BF franchise successful,\" Uerkwitz writes. In particular, EA has made a big effort to include live service (i.e., constantly updated content), but this time for free. Indeed, EA introduced the Tides of War system in BFV to continuously service gamers with new maps, time-limited unlockable items and new modes that are embedded with narrative storytelling to improve immersive game play.The bottom line: \"Overall, we see the potential for this title to set up both near and long term outperformance for the BF franchise. The live service component looks intriguing and should be closely watched by investors.\"Encouragingly, Electronic Arts also scores a \"Strong Buy\" consensus rating from the Street. To be precise: In the past three months, 10 analysts have published buy ratings on EA, against just one hold rating.Market value: $46.5 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $13.33 (15% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating:  *When you think of stocks set to rally, you may not immediately think of old auto stalwart Ford (  , $11.55). But according to JPMorgan's lead automotive equity analyst, Ryan Brinkman (  ), that would be a mistake.\"We believe Ford management understands the previous deficit relative to the positioning of the investment story in comparison to General Motors and also that the story is now improved as a result of the recent announcements,\" Brinkman wrote in a May 18 research note.He continues: \"We believe Ford is in the process of pulling the trigger, or soon to pull the trigger, on walking away from previously core but loss-making aspects of its business,\" adding \"We suggest investors pull the trigger on Ford shares now, as its earnings - and its multiple - are likely to inflect higher as it undergoes this transformation.\"Brinkman isn't alone in this bullish analysis. On May 29, top Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois (  ) upgraded his F rating from \"Hold\" to \"Buy.\" He assigned a $14 price target to the stock, arguing that Ford is getting \"no credit for ambitious but credible cost targets and for multiple operating and strategic levers still available to improve market and product exposure.\"*TipRanks-ranked \"top analysts\" rate F shares a  .Market value: $16.1 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $119.82 (33% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: BioMarin Pharmaceutical (  , $90.34) is a biotechnology company that specializes in treating rare genetic diseases. The stock is buzzing right now following a much-sought-after regulatory approval for its drug Palynziq. This is a treatment for phenylketonuria, a rare metabolic disorder that can potentially cause brain damage leading to seizures or mental disorders.Citi analyst Robyn Karnauskas (  ) reacted by ramping up her BMRN price target from $100 to $108. She notes that the drug received a broad label and monitoring only, as a single dose can accelerate patient uptake.But investors should note this isn't necessarily a slam-dunk. The impact of Palynziq's approval will take a while to materialize, writes Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz (  ).BioMarin views Palynziq as a potential  , but Schwartz estimates peak sales of only about $500,000 in 2029. He's still bullish on the stock, but thinks breakout success for Palynqiz \"will require substantial uptake and compliance.\"In total, this \"Strong Buy\" stock has received 10 buy ratings and only one hold rating in the previous three months.Market value: $2.3 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $41.18 (26% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Heron Therapeutics (  , $32.60) specializes in the huge market of post-surgical pain management and drug delivery. Its lead product candidate is HTX-001- a powerful combination of local anesthetic bupivacaine and anti-inflammatory agent meloxicam.\"We believe HTX-011 addresses what we see as an unmet need in the postoperative pain market - failure of local anesthetics when inflammation is present\" writes top Mizuho Securities analyst Difei Yang (  ), who has a $35 price target on HRTX. She is excited about the drug's potential, as \"Recent studies suggest a potential synergistic effect from both components which we see as an important differentiator for the drug over the current standard of care, i.e., generic bupivacaine.\"As Heron's website states, the drug has been designed to help tackle America's growing opioid crisis. According to the former U.S. Secretary of Health, Tom Price, 140 Americans die each day from opioid addiction. That's where Heron steps in: \"By delivering sustained levels of both a potent anesthetic and an anti-inflammatory agent directly to the site of tissue injury, HTX-011 was designed to deliver superior pain relief while potentially reducing the need for systemically administered pain medications such as opioids, which carry the risks of harmful side effects, abuse, and addiction.\"HRTX has accumulated 11 buy ratings from analysts over the past three months.Market value: $517.3 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $246.07 (24% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Top Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena (  ) has these key words to describe Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (  , $198.01): \"A Very Investible Outlook.\"On the back of strong quarterly results, Sena wrote, \"Our recommendation of Alibaba factors its large addressable, scaled advantage in transaction and data, and its leadership in China Cloud, where this quarter saw yet another triple-digit growth rate (103%).\" Revenue more than delivered, with fiscal fourth-quarter revenues growing 61% year-over-year to $9.9 billion, beating expectations for $9.3 billion.This strong revenue offset the only fly in the ointment: margins. High spending on new growth initiatives tilted margins below what was expected. However, Wall Street approved of BABA's focus on investing at the expense of profits.\"We feel the narrative on the stock is shifting from concern over investment spending to a focus on profit growth and long-term opportunity,\" wrote top MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson (  ). He called this investment \"absolutely worthwhile\" and reiterated his buy rating with a $180 price target.And in respect to Alibaba's much-hyped \"new retail\" initiative to combine offline and online retail, Sanderson wrote, \"We think this business will ultimately be as high a margin, or better than the existing marketplace model.\"Alibaba has earned 14 buy ratings in just three months.Market value: $1.6 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $23.33 (14% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: From a Street perspective, Evolent Health (  , $20.45) is a first-class stock with a lot of potential. Shares are already up 60% year-to-date, but this isn't the end of the story - far from it. Evolent Health sells software and consulting services to help healthcare providers, such as hospital systems, offer care at lower costs. In the past three months, EVH has received five buy ratings (from top analysts) and one hold rating.One of these buys comes from five-star Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper (  ). He sees prices reaching $28 (35% upside potential). EVH recently hosted an upbeat investor meeting showcasing its capabilities and growth opportunities. Following the meeting, Halper is more confident than ever that EVH has 'significant growth opportunities' ahead. This is partly because of the transition to a value-based reimbursement system for healthcare providers. This means providers are rewarded for helping patients improve their health rather than the number of services.Halper writes, \"We believe EVH is positioned to execute on its population health growth strategy given the large addressable market. EVH currently has over 30 partners and about 3.1 million lives on its platform. Medicaid and Medicare represent a significant growth opportunity for the company as providers enter partial and full risk arrangements. As U.S. healthcare costs keep rising, there is more pressure than ever to control costs.\"Market value: $664.1 millionTipRanks consensus price target: $26.17 (11% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating:  *From a family-run store to more than 200 locations in 29 states, Boot Barn Holdings (  , $23.68) shows that cowboy boots can be a lucrative business. In fact, the company's revenues have tripled over the past six years. What's particularly promising is that Boot Barn is growing offline and on, with the latest figures showing website traffic of more than 29 million visits in 2017.Four top-performing analysts have published buy ratings on BOOT in the last three months. These analysts see the stock (on average) spiking 14% to $28. On the high end of the consensus, Jefferies' Randal Konik (  ) raised his price target from $25 to $30. Konik is a fan of the company's \"robust\" comps, \"healthy\" merchandise margin expansion, and \"tight\" expense discipline.Also, BOOT now has a unique position in the market because it has managed to unify the fragmented western/workwear market, Konik writes.*TipRanks-ranked \"top analysts\" rate BOOT shares a  .Market value: $2.0 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $14.21 (28% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Gulfport Energy (  , $11.11) is one of America's largest natural gas producers, and the stock offers exposure to two hot plays: 1) Utica shale and 2) Anadarko Basin SCOOP. \"We reaffirm our Buy rating and GPOR remains our top pick for natural gas exposure,\" top Williams Capital analyst Gabriele Sorbara (  ) wrote on May 21. He sees prices spiking 44% to $16.\"The Company is well positioned via a strong hedge book, firm takeaway, locked-in services, strong balance sheet and numerous catalysts,\" she writes. In Sorbara's eyes, \"Stock underperformance is unwarranted, as we believe this high-quality Company demonstrates capital discipline and is positioned to generate free cash flow and strong production growth during 2018+.\" It is this unjustified valuation discount, especially in respect to peers, that drives Sorbara's \"Top Pick\" status.Also bullish: GPOR already executed its $100 million buyback program in the first quarter, then expanded it by an additional $100 million.Market value: $33.0 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $275.21 (39% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Chip equipment maker Lam Research (  , $198.18) has 100% Street support right now, with 14 consecutive buy rankings over the past three months.Cowen & Co analyst Krish Sankar (  ) initiated coverage of LRCX with a very bullish $285 price target (41% upside). Lam is poised to benefit from \"secular trends like the increasing memory content in storage, mobile and eventually autos,\" Sankar writes. \"All of this implies increased demand for equipment, especially deposition and etching tools, playing right into LRCX's sweet spot.\"Sankar anticipates memory wafer-fab equipment to grow 5% in 2019 as DRAM strength this year is replaced by NAND next year. Notably, enterprise servers are now increasing the mix of solid-state drives powered by 3D NAND technology. The mobile market is getting saturated from a unit standpoint, but DRAM content per smartphone is growing as augmented-reality applications become increasingly popular.Harriet Lefton is head of content at TipRanks, a comprehensive investing tool that tracks more than 4,700 Wall Street analysts as well as hedge funds and insiders.

It is widely expected that the biotech/drug sector will rebound as the year progresses.We believe that new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, frequent FDA approvals, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track.A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits.Importantly, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is ramping up with the tax reform in place.

The CDA also approved Epclusa in combination with ribavirin (RBV) for adults with HCV and decompensated cirrhosis.

The FDA has set an action date of Nov 28, 2018.Firdapse has been developed for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (\"LEMS\"). The NDA submission addressed the two issues raised in the 2016 Refusal to File letter during the previous Firdapse NDA submission and included all additional information requested by the FDA.Priority Review designation from the FDA is generally granted to drugs that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease.Year to date, Catalyst's shares have declined 2% against the  's increase of 0.8%.Firdapse is currently approved in the European Union (EU) for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS in adults. However, the drug is not yet approved in the United States. In January 2017, it held a Type C meeting with the FDA, wherein Catalyst was advised, based on the briefing documents, that the company's proposed NDA should be sufficient for resubmission. In November 2017, the company announced positive top-line results from its second phase III study of Firdapse in patients with LEMS.Catalyst also announced its decision of not including in this FDA submission those limited types of congenital myasthenic syndromes (\"CMS\") that are considered mechanistically similar to LEMS. Catalyst decided not to overcomplicate the review of its NDA submission for LEMS with this second indication.The company is currently conducting a phase III study evaluating Firdapse for the treatment of CMS and expects to complete enrollment before the end of 2018 and report top-line results from this study in the first quarter of 2019. If the results of the trial are successful, the company plans to add the CMS indication to its labeling for Firdapse.Catalyst had in-licensed rights to Firdapse from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  in 2012 for the development and commercialization of the product in the United States. Also, Firdapse enjoys Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy status in the United States for the treatment of LEMS. Firdapse received Orphan Drug status in the United States for the treatment of congenital myasthenic syndromes (\"CMS\") and myasthenia gravis (\"MG\").LEMS is an ultra-rare disease even though several drugs and treatment therapies like steroids, azathioprine, other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin are currently in use. Guanidine HCl tablets are approved for the treatment of LEMS. However, due to significant side effects, the drug is not viewed as an effective treatment. This, in turn, has created ample space for introducing new therapies for LEMS.Therefore, approval of Firdapse in these indications will be a huge boost for the company, given its commercial potential in the target markets.Catalyst carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Illumina, Inc.  , Ligand Pharmaceuticals  .

Expensive, time-consuming clotting factor transfusions aren't going away entirely, but new therapies from several companies are about to dramatically reduce their necessity.It's commendable to develop rare disease treatments that are so effective, some might call them \"cures,\" but that hardly guarantees market-beating returns. Let's look into three companies with a hand in next-generation hemophilia treatments to see which has the best chance of coming out ahead.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance.Last November, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Hemlibra for hemophilia A patients, but only those with inhibitors to standard clotting factor replacement treatments. That's why Roche's latest major drug to launch generated just $23 million in sales during the first quarter.Sales of the weekly injection are expected to peak at around $5 billion annually, but it needs to earn an approval to treat hemophilia A patients who  have factor VIII inhibitors, as well. Based on some recent trial results, a greenlight from the FDA to treat the wider population is widely expected. A stunning 33 of 35 patients taking Hemlibra every other week experienced between zero and three bleeds on an annualized basis. Just 1 out of 18 patients in the placebo group achieved the same goal.Down the road, Roche's Hemlibra could run into trouble from experimental gene therapies making their way through clinical trials, but cautious investors still can find reasons to appreciate this big pharma stock. A multiple sclerosis drug it launched in 2017, Ocrevus, already hit an annualized $1.9 billion run rate in the first quarter of 2018.Image source: Getty Images.I think peak annual Ocrevus sales eventually will top $6 billion, and Hemlibra also could be a big contributor for at least a few years. That will go a long way to offset impending losses to sales of the company's top-selling cancer therapies.Aging cancer therapies will give Roche an uphill battle in the years ahead, but it's the only company in this list with reliable profits at the moment. If shares of the pharmaceuticals and diagnostics giant happen to tumble, you'll still receive a dividend that offers a 3.8% yield at the moment.Investors want to keep an eye on Spark Therapeutics in the quarters ahead. Through a partnership with  , this biotech is developing a one-time hemophilia treatment that could cost a heap of cash upfront but save insurers a bundle down the road.Spark and Pfizer's candidate SPK-9001 takes aim at the much smaller hemophilia B indication using a virus and DNA to help patients produce vital clotting factors on their own, and it's produced impressive results with a single dose. All 15 participants given the treatment in an early-stage trial have discontinued routine clotting factor infusions with the average patient-observation period lasting more than 14 months. Moreover, none of these patients experienced any treatment-related adverse events.Spark has the distinction of earning the first approval for an adenovirus-delivered therapy. The FDA greenlighted Spark's Luxturna for the treatment of a rare eye disease in December, and it still is too early to tell whether its commercial launch will succeed. Just three patients were administered the $850,000 treatment during the first quarter, and if it doesn't pick up the pace soon, the stock's $3 billion market cap could take a tumble.Biomarin doesn't have a dividend or profits, but it's producing significant revenue from a stable of rare disease drugs that have put up some impressive growth  . The company expects an approval decision for its  pegvaliase any moment now, and an eighth could be a big winner in hemophilia A.Image source: Getty Images.The company's hemophilia candidate valoctocogene roxaparvovec also makes use of an engineered virus to deliver a one-time treatment that has shown impressive results. Two years after receiving a single dose during an early-stage trial, a majority of patients exhibited factor VIII activity at 46% or higher, which is awfully impressive when you consider 50% is  for patients  hemophilia.Perhaps coincidentally, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb recently signaled a willingness to use a biomarker, such as changes in clotting factor activity, to support an approval rather than wait years for trials to generate annual bleeding-episode data.At recent prices, BioMarin trades at around 10.4 times this year's revenue expectations of between $1.47 billion and $1.53 billion. A successful launch for pegvaliase and valrox could help the company more than double total sales within several years, making this the best hemophilia stock to buy right now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

BioMarin already markets one PKU therapy, Kuvan, so it should be able to hit the ground running. Is BioMarin a stock worth buying now?A genetic disease caused by an inability to break down an amino acid, PKU can result in the toxic buildup of phenylalanine in the brain, particularly if patients consume protein-rich foods or foods containing aspartame, an artificial sweetener.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.As phenyalanine levels increase to dangerous levels, it can cause irreversible brain damage, developmental delays, and neurological problems, including seizure. It's a severe condition, but it's relatively rare. Globally, it impacts about 50,000 people.Because PKU is debilitating, all 50 states in the U.S. require PKU screening at birth. There's no cure for PKU, so treatment involves a lifelong dietary restriction that's very hard for patients to comply with. In some PKU patients, BioMarin's Kuvan, a pharmaceutical version of BH4, a natural substance that reduces phenyalanine levels by breaking it down, is also prescribed.Currently, only about 12% of PKU patients, most of whom are children, take Kuvan, yet it's BioMarin's second best-selling product, with $408 million in sales in 2017.Palynziq is a potent drug, and because of this, it's initially only being approved for use in adults with PKU. BioMarin believes roughly 12,000 adults in the U.S. could benefit from using its newly approved drug and that its worldwide addressable market totals about 33,000 people.An enzyme replacement approach, Palynziq substitutes the deficient phenylalanine enzyme in PKU with a version of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which can break down phenyalanine.Immune responses, including anaphylaxis, occurred in Palynziq's trials, so the FDA approval includes a REMS program, and the dosing of it in patients will be titrated over four to six months to improve tolerability and so that patients can take the lowest effective dose. In trials, 11% of patients discontinued Palynziq because of adverse reactions.While safety concerns can't be ignored, Palynziq is a first-of-its-kind solution for adult patients, and its efficacy could allow BioMarin to treat substantially more PKU patients than Kuvan. According to BioMarin's management, Palynziq has billion-dollar per year peak sales potential.Initially, BioMarin's focus will be converting the 200 adult PKU patients that participated in Palynziq's trials into commercial users. Once that's done, the company will focus on the 2,300 adult Americans who are being treated in clinics, and then, it will embrace a strategy to reach the roughly 7,500 patients who are diagnosed with PKU, but who haven't sought out treatment at a clinic for at least two years.BioMarin expects that Palynziq will be available commercially in late June at an average expected cost of $192,000 per patient per year. At that price, the company would generate $38.4 million in annual sales if it converts the 200 trial participants into regular patients and $480 million per year if it also successfully gets Palynziq prescribed to the 2,300 people being treated in clinics.Pricing isn't likely to be as high outside of the U.S., but the addressable market there is bigger, so an EU approval would also be meaningful. EU regulators accepted Palynziq's application for approval earlier this year, and overall, management says there are 15,000 adult PKU patients in Europe and Turkey, including 4,900 who are being treated in clinics.Kuvan's use in children should continue to make it a top-seller for the company, at least until generics become available. BioMarin has licensed rights to two generic drugmakers, and generic Kuvan could arrive as soon as October 2020.In the meantime, BioMarin will enjoy a dominant position in PKU that will help BioMarin take another step toward achieving profitability. Following Palynziq's OK, BioMarin has now won approvals for seven drugs. In 2017, the company's global  , so the potential to add hundreds of millions of dollars in new sales would significantly move the needle. data by  .In addition to improving progress toward profit, the additional revenue will also come in handy in support of BioMarin's R&D pipeline, including a potentially game-changing PKU gene therapy. BioMarin hopes to begin human trials for a gene therapy that could restore the production of the missing enzyme in PKU patients in 2019. The potential for a one-and-done gene therapy in PKU would significantly disrupt the market.Overall, the impact Palynziq may have on BioMarin's financials in the next year or two, and the opportunity longer-term to create even better treatments for PKU, make it an interesting stock that I think is worth buying in growth portfolios.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The biotech company's stock has rallied 64.7%, significantly outperforming the 9.6% decline of the industry in this period.The company has only one marketed product in its portfolio, Exondys 51, which received accelerated approval in September 2016. The drug is approved for treating patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (\"DMD\"), a rare genetic disorder affecting children, who have confirmed mutation of the DMD gene susceptible to exon 51 skipping.The company has been progressing well with the commercialization of Exondys 51 and development of pipeline candidates in 2018 so far.The drug generated sales of $64.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, increasing 12.7% sequentially on the back of strong demand trends. Sales of the drug in 2017 were $154.6 million. Based on sales trends witnessed in 2017, Sarepta expects Exondys 51 sales to double in 2018.The launch of a Managed Access Program in Europe and Americas in July 2017 is also having a favorable impact on sales as the drug is now available to a larger patient population.Moreover, Sarepta also settled an ongoing global patent litigation with BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  in mid-2017, thus removing a major overhang. BioMarin has granted Sarepta global exclusive rights to its DMD patent estate for Exondys 51.However, Exondys 51's approval in Europe hit a roadblock as the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted negative trend vote on its marketing approval application. This is expected to delay the approval of the drug.Sarepta is focused on building its DMD pipeline beyond Exondys 51 by developing other exon-skipping treatments. In fact, the company has about eight exon-skipping candidates in its pipeline, including golodirsen and casimersen, which are expected to treat 75-80% of the DMD population.Sarepta's lead candidate, golodirsen, has demonstrated 100% response rate with 10.7 times increase in mean dystrophin protein production from baseline in DMD patients in a phase I/II study. The data was reported in September 2017.We remind investors that Exondys 51 had achieved nearly three times increase in mean dystrophin protein production from baseline. The better efficacy shown by golodirsen in dystrophin production increased investors' hope about its potential approval as a new and better treatment option for DMD patients.Sarepta remains on track to complete a rolling submission of a new drug application for this DMD candidate by the end of this year. The company has announced that it will seek an accelerated approval for the candidate for an early approval in 2019.Earlier this month, Sarepta announced a partnership with Ohio-based Myonexus Therapeutics to develop five gene therapies for the treatment of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies. | BioMarin currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A couple of better-ranked stocks to consider in the pharma sector include Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc.  and ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  .

The regulatory decision on pegvaliase, a new treatment for phenylketonuria, or PKU, has big implications for the company and its investors, so let's take a closer look.PKU is a rare genetic disease caused by an inability to break down phenylalanine, an amino acid. Diagnosed in childhood, PKU patients can accumulate toxic levels of phenylalanine in the brain, especially if their diet includes protein-rich foods or foods containing aspartame, an artificial sweetener.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A buildup of phenyalanine can cause damage to nerve cells in the brain, resulting in irreversible brain damage, developmental delays, and neurological problems, including seizure.Typically, patients with PKU are identified at birth (all 50 states in the U.S. require PKU screening), and when cases are diagnosed, treatment involves dietary restriction and, sometimes, BioMarin's prescription drug, Kuvan -- a pharmaceutical version of a natural substance, BH4, that reduces phenyalanine levels in the blood by breaking it down.Approved in 2007, Kuvan generated $408 million in sales last year,  from 2016, and that was good enough to make it BioMarin's second-highest-selling drug behind Vimizim, an enzyme replacement therapy for Morquio A syndrome (MPS IVA) with $413 million in sales in 2017.Despite Kuvan's commercial success, it only works in between 30% to 50% of PKU patients, and only 1,900 of the roughly 50,000 people on the planet with PKU are taking it, most of whom are children. Pegvaliase is under consideration for use in adults, and according to BioMarin, that's an addressable patient population of 33,000, including about 12,000 patients in the United States.The company hasn't settled on pricing for pegvaliase yet, but they've said they expect it to cost moderately more than Kuvan, which costs $150,000 per year. The size of the addressable market, and a potential six-figure price tag, suggests pegvaliase peak sales could be above $1 billion someday.It may take time for it to become a blockbuster, though. A potent medicine, it will take between four to six months for patients to get titrated up to a full dose of pegvaliase.Pegvaliase may cannibalize some of Kuvan's sales, but Kuvan's use in children should still make it a top-seller for the company until generic competition arrives.So far, two companies have filed abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA) with the FDA indicating plans to launch generics. Initially, BioMarin responded with patent infringement lawsuits, but eventually, it agreed to licensing deals that allow generic Kuvan to become available as soon as October 2020.Ahead of that potential threat, BioMarin plans to initiate human trials next year for a gene therapy that may restore production of the enzyme that's missing in PKU patients. Currently, that gene therapy is in the pre-clinical stages, but management has said that its analysis has shown durability for the therapy that's stretched out to 53 weeks. The potential for a one-and-done gene therapy in this indication would undeniably be the Holy Grail for patients and the company.Although there's a need for additional treatment options in PKU, there's no guarantee that the FDA will approve pegvaliase. The FDA could decide it wants to see longer-term safety data first, or it could determine that the efficacy associated with reducing phenyalanine levels alone isn't sufficient. Given that a no-go vote from the FDA could weigh heavily on shares in the short term, risk-averse investors ought to play it conservative and wait and see what the FDA decides to do.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In fact, so far this year, Allergan's share price has declined 7.7%, compared with the  's decline of 5.8%.Despite a strong first-quarter performance and positive regulatory updates, shares of this pharma company continue to decline this year.We believe that this is because Allergan is facing loss of exclusivity for several of its key products and this will continue through 2018.This is what concerns analysts. While the first generic versions of Alzheimer's treatment Namenda XR and Estrace cream were launched in the first quarter, that of blockbuster dry-eye drug, Restasis, Allergan's second best-selling drug, is expected to be launched in the second quarter.A generic version of Delzicol is also expected to be launched in early second-quarter 2018.Allergan estimates that the products facing loss of exclusivity wereworth$3 billion in 2017. Sales of these products are expected to decline significantly in 2018 with the introduction of generics.On the first-quarter conference call, management addressed this disconnect between its business performance and stock value.

Fuchs also hedged his bets when he said, \"Of course, it ain't over till it's over.\"The company gave a little bit of information on pricing for pegvaliase, as well. \"We expect to price pegvaliase at a moderate premium to the average price of an adult Kuvan patient, which is currently about $150,000 a year annually,\" said BioMarin's chief financial officer Daniel Spiegelman, who was filling in for chief commercial officer Jeffrey Ajer, who had laryngitis.The approval of pegvaliase in the U.S. is the next big driver for BioMarin, although sales are likely to ramp slowly because the drug is titrated gradually, starting at weekly dosing before eventually increasing to daily dosing. European regulators accepted the application for pegvaliase last month, setting up a potential approval across the pond, too.Of course, the biggest opportunity for revenue growth comes from valrox, although the phase 3 data still is far away. Fortunately, investors will get to see updated data from the phase 2 trial next month at the World Federation of Hemophilia 2018 World Congress. The long-term data -- out to two years for the higher dose of the gene therapy -- is important because the longer the treatment lasts, the more valrox saves insurers on not having to pay for the current standard-of-care drugs, which increases the amount BioMarin can charge for the one-time treatment.That is, if it doesn't get  first.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This compares favorably with 9.1% decrease registered by the  during this period.Let's see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Key orphan disease drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, which drove BioMarin's top line in the past few quarters, are likely to maintain the trend this quarter too. Robust patient growth and penetration should propel the drugs' sales.Also, Naglazyme and Vimzin revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to inconsistent ordering patterns from some countries. On the fourth quarter 2017 conference call, the company had said that it is cautiously optimistic that sales in Brazil will be steady in 2018 but uneven buying patterns may be observed quarter to quarter.Nevertheless, the drugs continue to witness steady patient growth and we expect the trend to continue this quarter.We expect management to discuss how the pipeline is progressing on the conference call. Brineura, for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease - a form of Batten disease - was approved in both the United States and EU last year. Brineura generated sales of around $9 million in 2017. On the Q4 call, the company said that the focus on the initial stages of launch is on disease awareness and early diagnosis The company mentioned that new site readiness can take longer than expected, which suggests slower revenue ramp up.On the Q1 investor call, we also expect management to comment on the launch preparation for pegvaliase. Pegvaliase, developed for treating phenylketonuria (PKU), is under review in the United States with the FDA expected to give its decision in May.Regarding pegvaliase launch, on the Q4 call management had informed that the initial sales ramp-up of pegvaliase would be slow due to education on disease awareness and lower doses per patient in the induction titration phase. Also, the company mentioned that it expects to price pegvaliase at a modest premium to Kuvan (net annual treatment cost of about $150,000). An update is expected at the upcoming call.Our proven model does not conclusively show that BioMarin is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.

However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Biotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  , scheduled to release results on Apr 26, has an Earnings ESP of +2.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Notably, DMD is a genetic disease characterized by muscle degeneration and weakness. The company anticipates initial data from the study in the first half of 2019.The phase Ib study is an open-label, non-randomized, ascending dose assessment, to be conducted on approximately 12 boys with DMD. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06939926 and also assess muscle strength, quality and function in a given patient population.Shares of Pfizer were up almost 1.5% on Apr 12, following the above news release. However, the stock has gained 7.2% in the past year, marginally underperforming the  's increase of 7.4%.We remind investors that PF-06939926 is added to Pfizer's portfolio following the acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics in August 2016. The acquisition complements Pfizer's rare disease portfolio and enhanced its leadership position in gene therapy.Additionally, last year, Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement with other companies for advancing gene therapy programs. Notably, in May 2017, Pfizer inked agreement deal with Sangamo Therapeutics to develop and commercialize gene therapy programs for Hemophilia A. Meanwhile, last November, the company amended its contract with Spark Therapeutics  to advance a Hemophilia B gene therapy candidate, which is being evaluated in a phase I/II study.Nonetheless, this April 2018, Pfizer announced an alliance with private biotech, Allogene Therapeutics, to expedite the development of its allogeneic CAR-T candidate, UCART19, for the treatment of CD19-expressing hematological malignancies.Notably, DMD is one of the most common fatal genetic disorders affecting children around the world. It is a devastating and incurable muscle-wasting disease. Per data provided by the National Human Genome Research Institute, DMD is a devastating and debilitating disease affecting up to one in 3,500-5,000 male births globally. Thus, there is a significant unmet need for DMD treatments.At present, two approved therapies for the disease in the U.S. market are Serepta Therapeutics'  Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) and Marathon Pharmaceuticals' Emflaza (deflazacort), the first therapy approved for DMD in the country.Importantly, Pfizer is not the only company working on developing treatments for DMD.

While BioMarin's shares are down 8.6%, the industry has witnessed a decrease of 10.1%.Product revenues were $369.1 million in the quarter, up 22.1% year over year, supported by continued strong demand for BioMarin's marketed products. Royalty and other revenues were $4.3 million in the first quarter, compared with $1.6 million in the year-ago quarter.Kuvan revenues rose 7% to $99.1 million, reflecting patient growth in North America and continued uptake internationally. The number of patients on Kuvan therapy in the United States increased 9% year over year.Naglazyme sales fell 7% year over year to $75 million due to the timing of government orders in certain countries. However, the number of patients increased 4% year over year.Vimizim contributed $117.1 million to total revenues, up 11% year over year. The drug continued to witness steady patient growth as the number of patients on Vimizim therapy increased 16% in the quarter.Naglazyme and Vimzim revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from some countries, mainly Brazil.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties - totaling $66.1 million - from Sanofi's  Genzyme in the quarter. Royalties for Aldurazyme were $19.4 million in the year ago quarter.

Pegvaliase has been developed to treat phenylketonuria (\"PKU\"). The company said on the call that it is preparing for the launch in the United States.Moreover, BioMarin has selected another gene therapy candidate for the treatment of PKU. An Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") application to initiate studies on the candidate is expected to be filed next year in the United States.BioMarin launched two separate phase III studies on valoctocogene roxaparvovec, its investigational gene therapy for severe hemophilia A. While one of these (GENEr8-1 study) is evaluating 6e13 vg/kg dose, the other one (GENEr8-2 study) is evaluating 4e13 vg/kg dose.Another phase I/II study to evaluate a dose of 6e13 vg/kg of the candidate in patients producing neutralizing antibodies against AAV5 is likely to start this quarter.Meanwhile, the global phase III program on another candidate, vosoritide for the treatment of children (ages 5-14) with achondroplasia (the most common form of dwarfism) continues to enroll as planned with top-line data expected in the second half of 2019.In February 2018, the company presented interim data from a phase I/II study of BMN 250, evaluated for the treatment of Sanfilippo B syndrome or MPS IIIB. The data demonstrated normalization of an important biomarker and liver size, as well as suggested stabilization in cognitive decline.Meanwhile, BioMarin is expected to file an IND this year for BMN-290, which will be developed for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder.BioMarin continues to expects total revenues in the range of $1.47 \u2212$1.53 billion in 2018.

No drug can remain profitable forever. Patents expire and (much cheaper) competition arises. New, more effective drugs are developed to treat the same diseases better or with fewer side effects.So for a biotech stock to remain strong in the long term, drug companies need to consistently put out new, cutting-edge therapies. But developing a new drug takes years - that's why the most profitable companies have strong pipelines, or a series of drugs in various stages of development.As important (if not more important) is how novel these new drugs are. If a new drug is developed to treat a disease that is already well-managed by a series of pre-existing therapies, then many will not opt for a new, often more expensive, treatment. And it's usually difficult for investors to know what drugs will fill a need.So here are five biotech stocks with promising pipelines. All of these companies have drugs that should be receiving Food and Drug Administration approval soon and that appear to fill a strong need. What's more, each company on this list has treatments further up the pipeline to follow those that will enter the market soon. (NASDAQ:  ) is a leading biotech company with 16 drugs currently on the market and 38 drugs and biosimilars in development. Of the whopping eleven drugs currently in phase 3 trials, two are close to FDA approval.Aimovig is a treatment for the prevention of episodic migraines. Amgen has submitted Aimovig to the FDA for review. And the FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA)  Meaning that the FDA aims to complete its approval by this date (unless more information is needed from Amgen).Aimovig is a fully-human monoclonal antibody. Monocolonal antibodies are laboratory created cells designed to attach to specific receptors within the body. Aimovig was specifically designed to block the CGRP receptor - which plays a critical role in migraine activation.Other preventative migraine medications are often stopped due to lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects. Topamax, the top migraine prevention drug currently available has a long list of disruptive  .Aimovig, meanwhile, has shown much  .Blincyto, Amgen's other drug with a PDUFA date (  ), is already on the market.

Seattle Genetics does this using two unique technologies, ADC and SEA.ADC, or antibody-drug conjugates, technology combines the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the power of  . Monoclonal antibodies cut down on the widespread cell destruction that happens with many chemotherapies by targeting markers found only on cancer cells. Once the monoclonal antibodies bind to the cancer cells, the cytotoxic agents disrupt cell processes in order to kill the cells.SEA, or sugar-engineered antibody, technology increases the potency of monoclonal antibodies. The SEA technology also helps trigger the body's own immune response. Seattle Genetics' SEA technology is simpler and more cost-effective than previous methods used.Seattle Genetics combines these technologies in order to develop specified treatments. It's next drug, ADCETRIS, has a PDUFA date of May 1, 2018 and treats Hodgkin lymphoma with more specificity than current treatments (cutting down on chemotherapy risk and side effects).

The company plans to file a biologics license application (BLA) in the  . A BLA is a request for permission to  into interstate commerce.Rolontis is a drug that treats chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, which is a common, dangerous side effect for many cancer treatments. Neutropenia is low levels of white blood cells that make cancer patients more susceptible to infections and less able to fight them when they happen. These infections can kill patients or delay their chemotherapy treatments - making them less effective.Rolontis stimulates the production of white blood cells in the bone marrow of these patients. Spectrum calls the need for Rolontis a \"multibillion dollar worldwide market.\"Spectrum has a second drug, Qapzola, also in Stage 3 clinical trials. Quapzola is a treatment for bladder cancer which has thus far shown promising results. (NASDAQ:  ) has multiple drugs in phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials. Their pipeline is diversified in terms of disease as well. Gilead has phase 3 trials for drugs that treat HIV/AIDS, liver disease, different cancers and a range of respiratory and autoimmune diseases.Gilead's newest HIV drug, Biktarvy was recently  . Biktarvy is a combination of several antiretroviral drugs which inhibit the replication of HIV within the body  . Biktarvy is a single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV - a disease that often requires multiple drugs and doses a day to manage.Gilead expects Biktarvy to bring in  in sales this year, and that's just one drug. Gilead has many more in the pipeline. (NASDAQ:  ) is a smaller, more focused biotech company. BioMarin is BioMarin has one drug, Pegvaliase, awaiting FDA approval (with a PDUFA date of  ) and two more in phase 3 clinical trials.Pegvaliase treats Phenylketonuria, a rare genetic disease in which patients lack the enzyme PAH. PAH breaks down the amino acid Phenylalanine, which is in many foods, including chicken, other meat, eggs, dairy, nuts, grains and legumes. Without the ability to break Phe down, it builds up in the blood and causes a variety of physical, behavioral, neurological and mental symptoms. Pegvaliase introduces a substitute for PAH and will treat those who have trouble maintaining their Phe levels through other methods.Many have probably only seen the word Phenylketonuria on Diet Coke bottles. Only 50,000 people under 40 in developed nations are reported Phenylketonurics. Because of this, Pegvaliase has designated  status in the U.S. and E.U. (The FDA gives this designation to drugs which affect fewer than  in the U.S.) Along with this designation comes tax reductions and the exclusive rights to develop the cure for a period of seven years.So yes, the market for Pegvaliase is small but BioMarin has exclusive rights in that market. Pegvaliase was also given priority review designation by the FDA which means that its approval \"will provide a  of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.\"The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  . Shares have lost about 3.14 % in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BMRN due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.BioMarin reported wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 but beat estimates for sales.Fourth-quarter loss of 30 cents per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 24 cents. However, the loss included a gain of $125 million on sale of the Priority Review Voucher (PRV) in December 2017. BioMarin was awarded the PRV when it was granted FDA approval for Brineura.Excluding this one-time gain, provision for income taxes of $106 million and a contingent consideration expense, adjusted loss per share was 36 cents in the fourth quarter.Total revenues came in at $358.3 million, up 19% from the year-ago quarter driven by higher product revenues. Revenues also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $346 million.Product revenues were $353.5 million in the quarter, up 19% year over year, supported by continued strong demand for BioMarin's marketed products. Royalty and other revenues were $4.8 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $1.9 million in the year-ago quarter.Kuvan revenues rose 19% to $107.4 million, reflecting patient growth in North America and solid uptake internationally. The number of patients on Kuvan therapy in the United States increased 7% in 2017.Naglazyme sales rose 25% year over year to $93.8 million.Vimizim contributed $114 million to total revenues, up 22% year over year and 26.2% sequentially. The drug continued to witness steady patient growth as the number of patients on Vimizim therapy increased 20% in 2017.Naglazyme and Vimzim revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from some countries, mainly Brazil.A slowdown in federal purchasing orders in Brazil had hurt Naglazyme and Vimizim product revenues in the third quarter. However, BioMarin witnessed an uptick in Brazilian orders in the fourth quarter for both Naglazyme and Vimzim, which drove sales higher.The company mentioned on the call that it is cautiously optimistic that sales in Brazil will be steady in 2018 but uneven buying patterns may be observed quarter to quarter.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties - totalling $28.3 million (down 19%) - from Sanofi's Genzyme in the quarter.Brineura generated sales of $5.2 million in the fourth quarter compared with $3.1 million in the third quarter.On the call, the company said that at 2017 end, 40 patients across 22 sites and 7 countries were receiving Brineura. Management expects to increase the number of sites to 40 by mid-2018Management noted that the focus on the initial stages of launch is on disease awareness and early diagnosis The company mentioned that new site readiness can take longer than expected, which suggests slower revenue ramp up.Regarding pegvaliase launch, management suggested that the initial sales ramp-up would be slow due to education on disease awareness and lower doses per patient in the induction titration phase. Also, the company mentioned that it expects to price pegvaliase at a modest premium to Kuvan (net annual treatment cost of about $150,000).Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 3.2% while selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 14.6% in the quarter.At the end of the 2017, BioMarin had $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments compared with $1.4 billion at the end of the third quarter.Full-year 2017 sales of $1.31 slightly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 billion. Revenues were within the guidance of $1.29 \u2212$1.32 billion. Sales rose 18% year over year.Total revenues included a one-time upfront payment of $31.5 million received from Sarepta Therapeutics.Reported loss of 67 cents per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 63 cents.BioMarin expects total revenues in the range of $1.47 \u2212$1.53 billion in 2018. This represents year-over-year growth of 15% to 19%, excluding the one-time Sarepta upfront payment.The company mentioned on the call that though the guidance assumes the launch of pegvaliase in the United States in the second half of 2018, the range can still be met if pegvaliase launch is delayed.Vimizim sales are expected in the range of $460-$500 million. Kuvan sales are projected in the range of $440-$480 million, an increase of about 13% from 2017. Naglazyme sales are projected in the range of $325\u2212$355 million. Brineura sales are expected in the range of $35-$55 million.Expenses related to R&D are expected within $645-$685 million while SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $575-$615 million.The company expects adjusted net income in the range of $100 - $140 million, a 62% year-over-year improvement from the midpoint.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to four lower. | At this time, BMRN has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F.

The drug has suffered several delays and setbacks, thus making the latest development a big boost to BioMarin.In March 2016, BioMarin produced results from the phase III study, PRISM-2, on pegvaliase. The trial, despite meeting the primary endpoint, failed to achieve the secondary endpoint.BioMarin's shares have lost 10.6% in a year's time, wider than the 8.8% decline of its  .BioMarin hopes that pegvaliase, if approved, will supplement its phenylketonuria portfolio, which also includes the drug Kuvan. A potential acceptance of the candidate will likely strengthen the company's commercial leadership in the treatment of PKU and drive its top line.Kuvan generated revenues of $407.5 million for the trailing 12 months ending December 2017, up 17% year over year.However, BioMarin faces a generic threat for Kuvan, which had been performing well since its launch. Per settlements with Dr Reddy's  and Par Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Endo International  , Kuvan generics are expected to enter the U.S. market from October 2020. The approval of pegvaliase will help BioMarin offset any revenue loss from the drug.Per the company, approximately 50,000 people in the developed countries are diagnosed with PKU, which underlines a significant need for such therapies.We remind investors that in January 2016, BioMarin had acquired all global rights to pegvaliase and Kuvan from Merck Serono. Previously, the company had exclusive rights to Kuvan in the United States and Canada and to pegvaliase in the United States and Japan. With this transaction, BioMarin has gained exclusive worldwide rights to Kuvan and pegvaliase with the exception of Kuvan in Japan. The acquisition of PKU rights in these markets represents a significant opportunity for BioMarin to establish its commercial leadership for the treatment of the same, first with Kuvan and then with pegvaliase, upon regulatory developments.BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock from the same space is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Regeneron's earnings per share estimates have moved up from $18.65 to $18.68 for 2018 in the last 30 days. The company pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 9.15%.A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

BioMarin delivered a positive earnings surprise of 41.67% in the last quarter.BioMarin's earnings track record has been strong, with the company beating estimates in each of the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 84.71%. | BioMarin shares have declined 5.4% in the past year. This compares unfavorably with 2.4% decrease registered by the  during this period.Let's see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Key orphan disease drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, which have been driving BioMarin's top line for some time now, are likely to maintain the trend this quarter too. Robust patient growth and penetration are likely to propel sales of the drugs. The respective Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vimizim and Kuvan for the third quarter is $111 million and $107 million.However, Naglazyme and Vimzin revenues may vary on a quarterly basis due to inconsistent ordering patterns from some countries.A slowdown in federal purchasing orders in Brazil hurt Naglazyme and Vimizim product revenues in the third quarter. However, BioMarin expects improved sales from Brazil in the fourth quarter.Nevertheless, the drugs continue to witness steady patient growth and we expect the trend to continue this quarter.We expect management to discuss how the pipeline is progressing on the conference call. Brineura was approved in both the United States and EU in 2017 for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease - a form of Batten disease. Its commercial launch is underway in the United States and EU.Though Brineura generated sales of $3.1 million in the third quarter, we expect higher sales in the fourth quarter.On the Q4 investor call, we expect management to comment on Brineura's launch progress and also on the launch preparation for pegvaliase. Pegvaliase, developed for treating phenylketonuria (PKU), is under review in the United States with the FDA expected to give its decision in the first half of this year.Importantly, on the Q3 call, the company had said that due to the ramp up of BMN 270 and vosoritide programs, R&D spending will increase in the fourth quarter. This will result in lower adjusted net income compared to the first half of the year, similar to the trend seen in the third quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that BioMarin is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Its Earnings ESP is -0.38%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 24 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . BioMarin's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some biotech stocks with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Exelixis  is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter results on Feb 26.

Catalyst Pharma is looking to get Firdapse approved in the United States for treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).The company expects to resubmit the NDA to the FDA for Firdapse in the first quarter of 2018.Notably, Firdapse has already been approved in the EU for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS in adults.The positive feedback from the FDA came on the back of preliminary data package submitted by Catalyst Pharma for the proposed NDA resubmission. The data package includes positive top-line findings from a second confirmatory phase III trial (LMS-003) on Firdapse for the aforementioned indication reported in November 2017 and positive outcomes from abuse liability studies showing no abuse potential for Firdapse.We remind investors that in February 2016, Catalyst Pharma received a refusal-to-file letter from the FDA in connection with the NDA submitted for Firdapse to the regulatory body in December 2015. The FDA determined that the application was not sufficiently complete after a preliminary review and hence, the agency requires additional supporting information to review the application.Thereafter, the company conducted the LMS-003 study on the candidate with the analysis achieving a statistical significance for both its co-primary endpoints - quantitative myasthenia gravis score (QMG) and subject global impression (SGI) - and secondary endpoint. For the QMG endpoint, the data showed a clinically significant difference of 6.4 points between the Firdapse and placebo groups.The top-line results showed that Firdapse has a major magnitude of effect for treating the symptoms of LEMS. Additionally, it was well tolerated in the program and showed a similar safety profile like the earlier studies.Catalyst Pharma's shares have significantly outperformed the industry in a year's time. The stock has skyrocketed 199.1% versus the  's decrease of 0.8%.Notably, Firdapse enjoys an Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy status in the United States for the treatment of LEMS.Catalyst Pharma had in-licensed development and commercialization rights to Firdapse in the United States from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  .Also, the company is working on developing Firdapse for additional indications. It is evaluating the drug in another phase III study for treatment of congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2018. Positive results would allow Catalyst Pharma to add the CMS indication to Firdapse's label.The company's efforts to develop Firdapse appear encouraging, given its significant commercial potential. An approval for the same is likely to be a huge growth driver for Catalyst Pharma.Catalyst Pharma carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Two better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are XOMA Corporation  and Exelixis, Inc.  . While XOMA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Exelixis carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .XOMA's loss per share estimates have narrowed from 99 cents to 42 cents for 2018 over the last 60 days. The company came up with an average beat of 47.92%. The stock has skyrocketed 360.2% in the last 12 months.Exelixis' earnings per share estimates have been revised upward from 72 cents to 77 cents for 2018 over the last 60 days. The company pulled off a positive surprise in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 572.92%. Share price of the company has surged 30.8% in a year's time.The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

The M&A announcements relate to the acquisition of Ignyta  by Roche and Sucampo Pharmaceuticals  by Mallinckrodt. Celgene's shares were down on disappointing data on a combination evaluating the company's blockbuster cancer drug, Revlimid, in treatment-na\u00efve follicular lymphoma patients. The late-stage RELEVANCE study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared to the standard of care with Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance. The R2 treatment arm failed to achieve superiority in the co-primary endpoints of complete response or unconfirmed complete response (CR/CRu) at 120 weeks and progression-free survival (Read more:  ).Celgene's shares are down 7.6% year to date compared to the 3% gain recorded by the  it belongs to. A couple of acquisition deals were announced this week. The first agreement will see Ignyta being acquired by Swiss pharma giant Roche in an all-cash deal valued at $1.7 billion ($27 per share). Ignyta is focused on developing precisely targeted therapeutics guided by diagnostics for patients with rare cancers. With this acquisition, slated to close in the first half of 2018, Roche will add entrectinib to its portfolio - entrectinib is currently in mid-stage development.The second agreement will see Sucampo being acquired by Mallinckrodt for $18 per share or approximately $1.2 billion. With this acquisition, Mallinckrodt will get a source of near-term net sales and earnings accretion through Amitiza and will boost its rare diseases pipeline with VTS-270 and CPP-1X/sulindac. This deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. Sucampo is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see  . Biogen's shares declined 3.3% on data from an ongoing Alzheimer's disease study on BAN2401, which is being developed in collaboration with Eisai. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee said that BAN2401 did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint in the phase II study. With the study failing to show an early positive result, the companies said that the blinded study, which is being conducted in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease (collectively known as early Alzheimer's disease) will continue with a comprehensive final analysis to be conducted at 18 months. These results are expected to be obtained during the second half of 2018. The study data comes as a disappointment as positive data would have been a major boost. Moreover, the results have raised concerns about the candidate's chances of success given the high rate of failure experienced by other companies in bringing Alzheimer's disease treatments to market (Read more:  ). The FDA has extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (\"PDUFA\") Goal Date for BioMarin Pharmaceutical's  pegvaliase by three months to May 28, 2018.

This number compares favorably not only to 2016 when just 22 novel drugs were approved, but to earlier years as well.Other key approvals last year include Lilly's Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead's Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma's Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J's Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi's Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche's multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron  and Sanofi's eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro's PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin's  Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Many of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of February. AMAG Pharmaceuticals  is seeking FDA approval for a subcutaneous auto-injector version of Makena - the drug-device combination product, if approved on the PDUFA date of February 14, would offer the convenience of using a ready-to-administer subcutaneous auto-injector while providing patients with an alternative option to an intramuscular injection. Makena is currently available as an intramuscular injection for reducing the risk of preterm birth in women who are pregnant with one baby and who spontaneously delivered one preterm baby in the past.The approval of this product would help AMAG extend the patent life of Makena which is scheduled to lose orphan drug exclusivity on February 3. While AMAG is ready to launch an authorized generic along with a partner in February itself, the company does not expect a generic competitor to enter the market until later in 2018. If the drug-device combination product is approved, the company will apply for Orange Book listing of the patents for the device.Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to issue a decision regarding the label expansion of Feraheme on February 2. AMAG is looking to expand the label beyond the current chronic kidney disease (\"CKD\") indication to include all eligible adult patients with iron deficiency anemia (\"IDA\"). Gilead Sciences  is also awaiting a decision from the FDA this month for its new drug application (\"NDA\") for an investigational, fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (50 mg) (\"BIC\"), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (200/25 mg) (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The NDA is under priority review with a decision expected on February 12. With the company's hepatitis C virus (\"HCV\") franchise seeing declining sales, Gilead is focusing on its HIV franchise for growth. The company's HIV portfolio includes drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Descovy, Odefsey, Complera and Stribild which contributed approximately $9.5 billion to total sales in the first nine months of 2017. Gilead's TAF-based products like Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey remain key growth drivers. Vertex Pharmaceuticals  is a key player in the cystic fibrosis (\"CF\") market with two products, Orkambi and Kalydeco, in its CF portfolio. The company is looking to strengthen its position in this area further with the potential approval of a tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination treatment that is under priority review with a decision from the FDA expected on February 28. The combination treatment is under review for use in CF patients (12 years and older) who have two copies of the F508del mutation or one F508del mutation and one residual function mutation that is responsive to the treatment.The approval of this combination would be a major boost for Vertex's CF portfolio which is expected to deliver revenues in the range of $2.1 - $2.15 billion in 2017. Currently, about 31,000 patients are eligible for treatment under the company's CF portfolio with the number expected to grow to 44,000 in 2018 on the back of EU reimbursement for Orkambi, label expansion for the drug and the potential approval of the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination.Vertex's shares are up 94% over the last one year, outperforming the 10% rally of the  it belongs to. Vertex is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see  .Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.  also expects to hear from the FDA about the approval status of Plenvu, a bowel cleanser used in preparation for colonoscopies (FDA action date: February 13). Moreover, companies like KemPharm and Apricus expect a response from the FDA this month for their resubmitted NDAs. While KemPharm has a PDUFA date of February 23 for Apadaz (an immediate-release, abuse-deterrent hydrocodone/acetaminophen combination product candidate), Apricus will get to know the approval status of its resubmitted Vitaros (topically delivered treatment for erectile dysfunction) NDA on February 17.Meanwhile, the FDA's Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee will be meeting on February 14 to discuss Pacira Pharmaceuticals's  supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Exparel (bupivacaine liposomal injectable suspension), to produce local analgesia and as a nerve block to produce regional analgesia.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

(Symbol: BMRN) saw new options become available this week, for the October 19th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the BMRN options chain for the new October 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $74.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of BMRN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $81.90/share today.Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of BMRN stock at the current price level of $81.90/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.06% if the stock gets called away at the October 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BMRN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing BMRN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

In addition to $70 million up front, Pfizer will pay for development of SB-525.

Hemophilia A is characterized by an inability to produce an adequate amount of blood clotting factor VIII that in turn exposes patients to a risk of severe bleeds. It's a chronic condition requiring a lifetime of regular infusions of the missing clotting factor.At the American Society of Hematology conference in early December, both Spark Therapeutics and BioMarin reported  from ongoing hemophilia A trials evaluating one-and-done gene therapies that restore a patients' ability to produce factor VIII. Spark Therapeutics' SPK-8011 eliminated bleeding events and boosted factor VIII activity by between 9% and 37%, while BioMarin Pharmaceutical's BMN-270, or valoctocogene roxaparvovec, eliminated bleeding events and boosted activity by 49%.Given BioMarin's therapy appears to increase activity, investors fled from Spark Therapeutics shares on the fear that it wouldn't be able to win sales in what's likely to be a big market opportunity.The hemophilia A data wasn't the only news reported by Spark Therapeutics last month, though. Management also  for its hemophilia B drug, SPK-9001, and the FDA gave an  OK to the company's Luxturna, a gene therapy that can restore vision in patients with a rare genetic disease.BioMarin isn't developing a hemophilia B gene therapy and there aren't any drugs that can restore vision like Luxturna can. The hemophilia B market is smaller than the market for hemophilia A, with about 30,000 people globally, but it could still be a nine-figure source of sales someday. Similarly, while Luxturna can only help less than 2,000 people, it's $850,000 price tag still means  in sales over the next year or two.It may not be wise to count Spark Therapeutics out in the hemophilia A market, either. Management's still optimizing dosing, so future trials may produce data showing a bigger increase in factor VIII activity. Even if that's not the case, most doctors view activity greater than 12% as enough to significantly lower the risk of severe bleeds. Because of those two points, this race may not be over.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. For our last ASH update for the day, we're moving away from blood cancer and toward hemophilia. We want to talk about, as you phrased it, Todd, the showdown between two different companies -- Spark Therapeutics, their ticker is ONCE, and BioMarin, their ticker is BMRN. First off, I want to explain the ticker for Spark Therapeutics, because when this clicked in my mind, I was like, oh, that's pretty cool! [laughs] It's great, right? Brilliant marketing. Yeah. Their ticker is ONCE, and that, I presume, is because gene therapy, which is what they work on, only needs to happen once and the patient is cured for life. So, if you're thinking about something like hemophilia, a typical hemophilia patient will need to regularly get treatment their entire life, which is very expensive. But if you can treat the underlying cause of it at the genetic level, that happens just once. Pretty cool. It's potentially game-changing, what gene therapy may do for hemophilia patients. It's exciting news for patients, it's exciting news for caregivers, it's exciting news for investors. It really is a shift in paradigm and how we approach treatment of this disease. Just to give listeners a little bit of background, we have two types of hemophilia, hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Hemophilia A is much more common, affects about 150,000 people worldwide. B is less common, but still common enough -- 30,000 or so patients globally. Companies are developing gene therapies that can eliminate, based on trials so far, the likelihood of bleeds in these patients. And that's just amazing. In hemophilia A and B, patients can have spontaneous bleeds if they cut themselves. Their blood does not contain the coagulant clotting factor that's necessary to clot their blood. So, there are so many consequences to that which negatively impact their quality of life. If you have a surgery, you have to make sure that you do all sorts of prep work ahead of time. If you hurt yourself, cut yourself, you have to take that into consideration, too. There's also joint damage that occurs over time because of the spontaneous bleeds. So, like you mentioned, you have current treatment that's prophylactic, and you're receiving infusions of the missing clotting factor. And what these gene therapies aim to do is, using those viral vectors we talked about earlier, introduce a functional gene that can produce the missing factors for these patients in a one-and-done injection. And that could be quite remarkable. Yeah. When you're measuring the outcomes of these drugs, you have two things that you're looking at. First of all, you have the number of bleeding events per year. And that's really what matters most -- can we keep these patients out of the hospital for their bleeding events, can we improve their quality of life, everything that goes along with that. But then, you also have what's an intermediary endpoint, which is, is there an increase in this coagulant factor, the one that is defective or missing, deficient, in any way? The drug is supposed to work by making more of this coagulant factor, so it makes sense that you would measure it. But really, what matters more is the bleeding events. At ASH, Spark Therapeutics released data about their drug SPK-8011, which is in hemophilia A, and there was a huge sell-off. Not because it couldn't control bleeding, it did -- there was a 100% reduction in bleeding events -- but because of concern over the factor VIII production, which is the clotting factor that this drug is supposed to increase. Yeah. You have the activity of SPK-8011, it ranged very widely, from 9% up to 37%, depending on where you were looking at it -- Meaning 30% of those normal levels. Right. In a normal person, that's usually defined as 50% activity to 150%. It's kind of bizarre. Think of it this way: Most clinicians, if your activity is at 12% or higher, they're going to view you as not high-risk for bleeds. The people who are enrolling in these trials conducted by BioMarin and Spark, they have less than 1% activity. So, in BioMarin's case, you had activity levels jump to 49%. So, everybody looks at that and says, BioMarin's drug -- which I'm not even going to bother trying to pronounce, it's just ridiculous how many letters are in this [valoctocogene roxaparvovec]. You can go with the earlier clinical name, which is BMN 270. OK, perfect. We're going to go with BMN 270. That did eliminate bleeds, just like Spark's 8011. But the activity jumped to 49%. So, think about that. You have 49%, which is just below that 50% cutoff for what's considered normal. We already know that 12% means you're probably not at significant risk for bleeds. Well, 8011, being between 9% and 37%, that just raised question marks for people. They looked at it and said, yeah, it eliminated the bleeds, but is BMN 270 more robust? Is it the better drug? I think it's too early to say that. And the reason that I make that claim is, BioMarin is in the lead, their study has been going on, it's enrolled more patients, they're more advanced in developing their hemophilia A gene therapy than Spark is. Spark is still optimizing the dosing of its drug. And it believes that through that optimization, until the next data readout, they're going to be able to boost those activity levels. From a clinical standpoint, most clinicians aren't going to really care, because all they ultimately care about are the bleeding rates falling. So, I think this was investors digging into the data trying to figure out, is one drug better than another better than another. I think it's too early to say. As a result, my personal view is that the reaction in Spark Therapeutics' shares, which tumbled over 30% after the ASH presentation, was an overreaction, and maybe even creates a buying opportunity. The real winner, no matter what, though, Kristine, I'm sure you'll agree, is patients, because both these gene therapies show that we're getting much closer to a one-and-done treatment of this condition. It works. It's really incredible. I love what Spark is doing. This isn't their only drug, which also makes me very surprised, but they lost a third of their market cap just about this one small detail of one of their drugs. They're also, for example, working in hemophilia B with  (NYSE: PFE) on another drug that also had very promising results from their phase 1/2 trials with highly controlled bleeding, again. They're also working outside of hemophilia. They have a drug called Luxturna, which is for blindness, a cure for a genetically defined set of patients who are blind, and that's expecting approval by Jan. 12. Meanwhile, the advisory committee to the FDA unanimously recommended approval of that drug. So, I would be downright shocked if it didn't get approval. This is a drug that restored vision in 90% of patients for up to three years in trials, whereas previously there were no currently approved drugs for this treatment. So, I really do think that what they're doing is absolutely incredible. And with that 33% sell-off, I'm personally very interested in the stock. I think it's fascinating. I think you make a very good point about Luxturna. It's not a very common thing, but you could treat 1,000 patients, and people are saying this could be a $1 million one-and-done drug therapy. So, even if you take net pricing and you think, maybe not everybody gets treated with it, you're still talking hundreds of millions of potential dollars in revenue for Spark Therapeutics on approval, and it can then use that money to help fund other programs, like the program in hemophilia. Hemophilia B is really intriguing to me, as well, because BioMarin is not working on hemophilia B right now. You have to worry about  instead, which is another company developing a hemophilia B gene therapy. But I think Spark's relationship with Pfizer gives it an edge in that indication as well. I'm very intrigued by this stock as well, especially given the drop. Yeah. I think the point about Pfizer giving it its blessing is also very promising. We've said this before on the show, but that's a nice sign of faith, that a larger company is looking at a smaller company's pipeline and saying, yeah, I want a piece of that, what you're doing looks really promising. Kristine, don't forget, Pfizer markets BeneFix, which is one of the leading hemophilia B drugs right now. So, it already has the sales team in place. Exactly, it already has those relationships, it knows what it's doing, and its team understands the science. So, they are the best people equipped to look at a company that has a pipeline in the space and give it the thumbs-up.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" develops and commercializes pharmaceuticals for serious diseases and medical conditions that could be an interesting play for investors.

For the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund ETF (Symbol: FBT), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $155.11 per unit.With FBT trading at a recent price near $133.08 per unit, that means that analysts see 16.55% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FBT's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc (Symbol: ACAD), Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc (Symbol: RARE), and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN). Although ACAD has traded at a recent price of $26.92/share, the average analyst target is 85.74% higher at $50.00/share. Similarly, RARE has 40.63% upside from the recent share price of $49.16 if the average analyst target price of $69.13/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BMRN to reach a target price of $115.28/share, which is 29.35% above the recent price of $89.12.

Biopharmaceutical heavyweights  (NASDAQ: AMGN) ,  (NASDAQ: GILD) ,  (NYSE: JNJ) , and  (NYSE: PFE) , after all, each have  of cash overseas that could become available if this proposed tax reform becomes reality.Each of these cash-rich pharma giants also has a glaring weakness in their underlying product portfolio that could be shored up by additional M&A activity. Amgen is dealing with the loss of exclusivity for its blood-conditioning medicines Neupogen and Epogen, Gilead Sciences is experiencing a rapid decline in its hepatitis C franchise and facing new threats to its dominance in HIV, J&J's blockbuster arthritis drug Remicade is battling generic competition now, and Pfizer's top-selling pain medication, Lyrica, is near the end of its patent life as well.With the Republican tax bill and the strong demand for new growth products in mind, I think  (NASDAQ: BIIB) ,  (NASDAQ: BMRN) ,  (NASDAQ: BLUE) ,  (NASDAQ: GERN) , and  (NASDAQ: SAGE) are all likely to get taken out in 2018. Here's why.Image Source: Getty Images.While Biogen doesn't have the type of robust clinical pipeline that offers deep value to potential suitors, the biotech's market-leading multiple sclerosis franchise, and its new  drug, Spinraza, are two pretty good reasons to put it on a list of potential buyout candidates.Taken together, these two growth drivers would make Biogen an immediately accretive acquisition in most buyout scenarios, after all. Biogen's market cap of $69 billion is also arguably the perfect size for, say, a Pfizer that needs to bulk up first before eventually splitting into two separate companies -- a legacy products business, and an innovative healthcare company. Pfizer also doesn't necessarily need an influx of clinical candidates to make a deal worthwhile, making Biogen an ideal candidate.BioMarin is  perpetual buyout candidate -- only to never get bought out. The underlying reason is that this rare-drug specialist, that now has six products on the market, sports a rather weighty valuation, to put it mildly. With a price-to-sales ratio of 12.33, BioMarin is, in fact, one of the most expensive biotech stocks in the world today.However, BioMarin's top-notch clinical pipeline that's advancing high-value candidates for indications such as dwarfism and hemophilia A could tip the balance in favor of a buyout in a cash-rich environment. Biopharma giants like J&J, after all, have shown a willingness to pay  for promising acquisitions when they come with longer-term growth prospects. And BioMarin's present market cap of less than $16 billion wouldn't be much of a barrier for any of the aforementioned companies -- that is, if they wanted a top-tier orphan drug product portfolio and clinical pipeline.Of these five buyout candidates, I think Bluebird is the probably the strongest lock to get taken out in 2018. The company's newly unveiled CAR-T data in multiple myeloma, after all, is simply too compelling to ignore for companies like J&J, or Bluebird partner  . Long story short, bluebird's CAR-T candidate, bb2121, produced  in advanced multiple myeloma patients that could catapult this therapy to megablockbuster status in breakneck fashion.Adding fuel to the fire, bluebird also has two other high-value, late-stage clinical candidates in the works for the treatment of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia and cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, respectively. So with a price tag of only perhaps $15 billion to $18 billion in a buyout scenario, Bluebird comes across as a near surefire buyout candidate next year.I think Celgene will be the company that brings home this top prize in biotech. With all that's at stake in multiple myeloma, after all, Celgene simply can't afford to let Bluebird get away. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if Amgen, J&J, or Gilead also made a play for bluebird in 2018.Geron, a small-cap oncology company, is heading into 2018 with its very existence at stake. Bottom line: We should know whether the biotech's telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, is a viable blood cancer drug by the end of next year. If not, there's no realistic path for Geron to continue as a going concern.The bright side is that Geron, and its development partner J&J, recently released some rather intriguing early-stage data for imetelstat in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that support their thesis in this rare bone marrow disorder, as well as some other non-clinical data suggesting a broader utility in blood cancers in general.The short version of the story is that imetelstat may turn out be an important new drug for patients with a specific form of MDS, a treatment of last resort for patients with advanced myelofibrosis (MF), and a backbone therapy for other blood-based cancers. J&J, by virtue of its insider status, is the obvious potential suitor for Geron.What's the likelihood of a buyout? Provided imetelstat's overall efficacy profile in advanced MF are compelling enough to warrant further development, I'd imagine that J&J would begin negotiations, and that Geron would listen intently.Geron CEO  , after all, has a history of selling promising experimental-stage biotech companies well before their lead candidates begin to realize their commercial potential. And at 66 years of age, he probably isn't planning on seeing imetelstat through another five to perhaps 10 years of clinical development. So my view is that Geron is either going bankrupt or getting bought out in 2018.After hitting on both a late-stage trial for postpartum depression with its lead clinical candidate brexanolone, and a mid-stage trial for major depressive disorder with SAGE-217 this year, Sage Therapeutics is almost certainly on the radar of most Big Pharmas at this point. The anti-depression drug market, after all, is worth tens of billions in annual sales.The big ticket item is that SAGE-217 appears more than capable of producing approvable results in a forthcoming late-stage trial, based on its outstanding  results, where the drug proved to be both highly efficacious and well tolerated. In short, SAGE-217 may have what it takes to be a franchise-level anti-depression drug, which is a highly sought-after commodity in the pharmaceutical industry.Sage's $6.7 billion market cap is also no impediment whatsoever for top dogs like Pfizer that already have a global footprint in the psych medication space. The only question, therefore, is whether a suitor wants to take the risk to wait for SAGE-217's pivotal stage data. Another company, after all, could scoop it up in the interim.As buyout scenarios often fail to materialize, you should arguably never buy a stock simply for its potential as an acquisition target. That said, I'd be surprised if Bluebird or Sage made it all the way through 2018 without at least one offer. Both of these companies are developing products that could turn out to be disruptive forces in their respective indications, after all.Biogen and BioMarin, on the other hand, are probably only strong acquisition targets in the event that the Republican tax bill results in a sizable cash influx for the top players in the field. And Geron will have to prove itself with additional imetelstat data to become a bona fide takeover candidate.So while I do own a small position in Geron, I think Bluebird and Sage are the two most compelling buys of the bunch. These two emerging drugmakers should produce strong returns on capital regardless of their fate as buyout candidates, making them suitable growth vehicles for most types of investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here we analyze the factors that have led to this huge rally.Catalyst Pharma's key drug Firdapse is currently approved in the EU for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in adults. However, the drug is not yet approved in the United States.Notably, the company announced positive top-line results from a second phase III study of Firdapse for treatment of LEMS. The findings showed that Firdapse has a relieving effect of significant magnitude when it comes to treating the symptoms of LEMS. The company remains on track to resubmit a new drug application to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018.Catalyst Pharmais also working to develop Firdapse for additional indications. It initiated an investigator-sponsored phase II/III study on the drug in February 2016 for the symptomatic treatment of MuSK-antibody positive MG. In March, the company reported top-line data from the same trial. The company expects to initiate MuSK-MG phase III study in the first quarter of 2018.In October 2015, the company began a small blinded study on Firdapse for treating certain types of congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) in the pediatric population (ranging from two to 17 years of age). However, post discussions with the FDA, the study has been expanded beyond the purview of minors to include adult CMS patients and the enrollment size has grown to nearly 20 patients. Top-line data from the study is expected in the first half of 2018. Positive data would allow the company to add the CMS indication to Firdapse's label (either as part of the NDA resubmission for Firdapse for LEMS or as a supplement to the resubmission).Catalyst Pharma had acquired in-licensed rights to Firdapse from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  back in 2012 for development and commercialization of the product in the United States. The drug enjoys a Breakthrough Therapy status, granted by the FDA for treatment of LEMS. It also boasts an Orphan Drug designation, courtesy of the regulatory body, for both LEMS and CMS besides MG.It is to be noted that LEMS is an ultra-rare disease and therefore its market represents great potential despite drugs and treatments like steroids, azathioprine, other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin are currently in use. Additionally, guanidine HCl tablets are approved for treatment of LEMS. However, the drug is unrecognized as an effective therapeutic option due to significant side effects. This, in turn, has created ample space for introducing new therapies in the market for LEMS.Also, CMS is an ultra-rare disease affecting around 1,000 and 1,500 citizens across the United States. Moreover, approximately 5-8% of the MG patient population is estimated to be MuSK antibody-positive. Therefore, approval of Firdapse to administer for these diseases will be a huge boost to the company, driven by its promising commercial potential in the target markets.Further, Catalyst Pharma is on track to explore the possibility of developing CPP-115 (a GABA aminotransferase inhibitor) for addressing epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and treating other selected neurological indications namely, complex partial seizures and Tourette's disorder.Incidentally, CPP-115 is tagged with both an Orphan Drug status in the United States for treatment of infantile spasms as well as an Orphan Medicinal Product designation in the EU for West syndrome (a form of infantile spasms). | CatalystPharma carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Currently, the company is looking to get pegvaliase approved for lowering blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adults with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder, having uncontrolled blood Phe levels with existing treatment options.In August, the FDA accepted BioMarin's BLA and granted priority review status. However, the regulatory body requested additional information on chemistry, manufacturing and controls related to pegvaliase. The submission of the information to the FDA was classified as a major amendment that will extend the review process by three months.BioMarin's shares are up 9.2% so far this year, which compares favorably with an increase of 3.2% registered by the  during this period.BioMarin is hoping that pegvaliase, if approved, will supplement BioMarin's phenylketonuria portfolio, which also includes Kuvan. A potential approval will strengthen BioMarin's commercial leadership in the treatment of PKU and boost the top line.Kuvan generated revenues of $300.1 million in the first nine months of 2017, up 16% year over year.However, Kuvan is set to face generic competition from 2020. The approval of pegvaliase will help BioMarin to offset any loss of revenues from Kuvan.According to information provided by the company, approximately 50,000 individuals in the developed countries are diagnosed with PKU, thus reflecting a significant need for such therapies. | BioMarin has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Is this news good for patients and investors?Hemophilia A is caused by a deficiency of blood coagulation factor VIII and hemophilia B is caused by a deficiency of blood coagulation factor IX. In both cases, the low levels of clotting factor put patients at significant risk of bleeding and hemorrhages. It's estimated that there are about 150,000 patients with hemophilia A and 30,000 patients with hemophilia B, globally.Image source: Getty Images.Historically, patients with very low factor VIII and factor IX activity are prescribed lifelong prophylactic infusions of these factors. These infusions work, but they pose a significant burden on patient quality of life and they're extremely expensive. Infusions can be given multiple times per week and they can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.Fitusiran is a clinical-stage RNA therapy that reduces the production of a naturally occurring enzyme that prevents clotting and thus increases thrombin, another important enzyme involved in blood clotting. Unlike factor VIII and factor IX infusions that must be taken often, fitusiran is a once-monthly injection.In July, Alnylam and Sanofi reported post-hoc data from patients participating in its phase 2 trial. The results show that patients' median annual bleed rate fell from 20 to 1 prior to entering the fitusiran study. Furthermore, many patients were bleed free and 67% of patients experienced zero spontaneous bleeds.The study restart is good news for these companies because hemophilia is a blockbuster indication. Alnylam and Sanofi have previously said that they could get results from their phase 3 study of fitusiran in late 2019, suggesting its likely that it wouldn't reach the market until 2020.If it does eventually win approval, then Alnylam and Sanofi will co-commercialize it in the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe. Sanofi has agreed to pay Alnylam up to $75 million in development and regulatory milestones, and profits in the co-marketed territories will be shared equally between them.

The ABR was reduced by 100% at week four to 0 from 5.5 annualized bleeds before initiating administration of SPK-8011. Similarly, AIR was reduced to 1.2 annualized infusions from 57.8 before SPK-8011 administration, a reduction of 96%.However, factor VIII levels achieved were not impressive and also not consistent. Two patients infused with 5e11 vg/kg achieved mean factor VIII activity levels of 10% and 16% after 12 weeks. Moreover, two patients infused with a dose of 1e12 vg/kg of SPK-8011. One of them achieved mean factor VIII activity level of 13% after 14 weeks and another patient achieved 9% after 19 weeks.BioMarin's valoctocogene roxaparvovec achieved mean factor VIII activity levels of 49% and 89% for two tested doses of the candidate. However, BioMarin tested higher doses of its candidate - 4e13 vg/kg and 6e13 vg/kg.In a separate press release, Spark Therapeutics along with Pfizer Inc.  announced data from another phase I/II study evaluating SPK-9001 for the treatment of patients with hemophilia B. Data from this study showed impressive reduction in ABR and AIR. Moreover, patients who were administered SPK-9001 had discontinued their regular factor IX concentrates infusions. They also showed sustained steady-state factor IX activity levels.Hemophilia A is rare genetic disorder characterized by mutation in factor VIII gene, which is responsible for clotting of blood in the human body.

But the proverbial whale hunt for blockbuster drugs continues because some of these therapies can end up being worth tens of billions of dollars during their useful, patent-protected lives.No investor owns a crystal ball, of course. Ergo, no investor can truly predict how well a new drug may sell if it gains approval from the FDA or overseas regulatory bodies.But because it takes years to develop a drug - and because most pharmaceuticals are largely variations of previously approved therapies - analysts and industry experts have the time and means to figure out what kind of potential revenue a new drug may drive.Here's a run-down of the pharmaceutical market's top 10 prospects currently in late-stage testing. While their respective approvals aren't guaranteed, the pros feel pretty good about their odds. (Good enough to start creating revenue outlooks, anyway.) All are projected to become so-called blockbuster drugs, driving more than $1 billion in annual revenue at their projected peak sales and potentially providing a boost to their creators' stock prices.Company: Eli LillyTreats: Breast cancerVerzenio, a therapy from Eli Lilly (  , $84.96) that was developed under the name abemaciclib, was approved in October for certain types of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-negative) breast cancer.It's not done yet. While Verzenio recently failed a Phase 3 trial as a treatment for non-small lung cancer, Lilly announced in early November that the drug had been given a priority review status for other forms of metastatic breast cancer. Even more applications could be in the cards above and beyond the ones already on the table.Bernstein analysts expect Verzenio to generate $1.3 billion in sales by 2021. While some competition already exists in the drug's most plausible markets, Bernstein's Tim Anderson wrote earlier this year that the drug can \"produce more frequent and more durable tumor responses that translate to longer (progression-free survival).\"Now it's just a question of how well Eli Lilly markets that differentiation.Company: IncyteTreats: Lung cancerEpacadostat is a cancer drug currently being developed by Incyte (  , $95.96). In simplest terms, the treatment alters tumor cells in such a way that allows the body's own immune system to do what it's supposed to do, but can't do in some cases.It's not epacadostat by itself that's so promising, however. The oncology world - and investors - are buzzing about epacadostat when used in conjunction with cancer-fighting treatment Keytruda from Merck (  ) as a treatment for lung cancer. When used at the same time, the two drugs double the response rate of Keytruda by itself. Perhaps best of all, the response was consistent regardless of PD-L1 levels - one of the oncology drug industry's newest \"hot buttons.\"The flexibility and success bode well for all eight trials evaluating the drug, but it is worth noting that all trials are early-stage efforts. Still, analysts collectively think epacadostat could drive revenues of up to $1.6 billion per year if its most plausible approvals pan out.Company: Novo NordiskTreats: DiabetesSemaglutide may be difficult to pronounce, but its potential is easy to understand. The once-per-week injection invented by Novo Nordisk (  , $51.32) lowers blood sugar levels by increasing a body's production of insulin, which makes it a great prospect for the war against diabetes, and type 2 diabetes in particular. As Novo Nordisk's Chief Medical Officer Todd Hobbs explained last month, \"Semaglutide has the potential to impact the lives of people with type 2 diabetes by helping to meaningfully reduce A1c. This treatment option may also help people lose weight. We look forward to continuing to work with the FDA as they complete their review of semaglutide.\"The last leg of that review is underway. In October, an FDA advisory panel 16-0 (with one abstention) to recommend its approval. The agency is scheduled to make its final decision on semaglutide on Dec. 5.The treatment's estimated prospects vary widely, but Alm Brand Bank analyst Michael Friis Jorgensen's peak-sales estimate of between $4.6 billion and $5.3 billion seems to be right around the mean outlook.Semaglutide poses the biggest threat to Eli Lilly's Trulicity. Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal opined in August when the drug's final trial results were first disclosed, \"Novo will now be in a strong position when discussing semaglutide with payers, having demonstrated superiority vs. the competition and also the added CV (cardiovascular) benefit, which Lilly has yet to do.\"Company: Gilead SciencesTreats: Non-Hodgkin lymphomaWhen Gilead Sciences (  , $73.67) acquired Kite Pharma in October, it primarily was to get its hands on Kite's CAR-T cell cancer therapy pipeline, most of which essentially reprograms a patient's immune system to better fight cancer. Of particular interest was axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), which has shown incredibly efficacy as a therapy for aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. On average, analysts believe the drug could drive $1.7 billion worth of annual business by 2022. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams thinks peak sales could be $2.7 billion.Good news on that front. Axi-cel, which has since been renamed Yescarta, was approved by the FDA for that use on Oct. 18. It's the first CAR-T cell therapy to earn the green light for that indication.The drug's potential for that form of cancer bodes well for Gilead, but the excitement doesn't end there. The same drug is in trials as a treatment for mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In the meantime, Kite has similar CAR-T drugs in the pipeline that are relatively close cousins to Yescarta.Company: Gilead SciencesTreats: HIVAs compelling as Kite's Yescarta is, don't overlook some of Gilead's home-grown products. That includes Bictegravir - a treatment for HIV when it's used in conjunction with existing HIV treatments emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide. The combo treatment's name has been shortened to BIC/FTC/TAF.Bictegravir's development journey hasn't been an easy one. While hopes were high for the integrase inhibitor, in May the company released trial results suggesting it wasn't quite the threat to GlaxoSmithKline's (  ) Tivicay that it was alleged to be.Still, the drug is showing respectable and even superior efficacy for some segments of HIV-infected patients when used as part of a combination therapy. The analyst community projects peak annual sales potential of $5 billion for the combo.Company: CelgeneTreats: Multiple sclerosisThere's no other way to put it: Analysts love the potential of Celgene's (  , $103.12) multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod.Leerink Geoffrey Porges opined following the recent release of Phase 3 trial results, \"This product, along with luspatercept (an anemia treatment), has become the standard bearer for Celgene's late stage pipeline, and in our view the data at the meeting justify some recovery in sentiment about the company's portfolio and outlook.\" Jefferies analyst Michael Yee deemed it a \"best-in-class\" drug.Ozanimod may be more than just an MS treatment. It's also showing promise as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, and if approved for both indications, Porges thinks it could grow its annual revenue to as much as $2.9 billion by the year 2022.Celgene is expected to officially file an FDA approval request for ozanimod before the end of this year.Company: AbbVieTreats: Endometrosis, uterine fibroidsAbbVie's (  , $95.82) elagolix has not yet been approved as a treatment for endometriosis - a condition where the female uterus grows abnormally (and usually painfully). However, the FDA gave it a priority review timeline in October. That bodes well for AbbVie, as it indicates the regulator realizes there's nothing on the market right now that meaningfully treats the condition.Elagolix is not just a therapy for endometriosis, though. The drug also is in Phase 3 trials as a treatment for uterine fibroids, or noncancerous growths in and around the uterus.The fibroids opportunity may be bigger than the endometriosis opportunity. Investment research outfit Zacks is pegging peak sales of Elagolix as a treatment for uterine fibroids at $2.6 billion, while saying its annual sales as a therapy for endometriosis could reach $1.5 billion.Company: AstraZenecaTreats: LymphomaAstraZeneca (  , $33.32) is in desperate need of some growth, and lymphoma drug acalabrutinib may well provide some for the beleaguered company.Acalabrutinib, which has since been given the trade name Calquence, won FDA approval late last month as a means of treating mantle cell lymphoma patients who were not responding well to first-line treatment options. The BTK inhibitor demonstrated a complete response rate of 40% in trials of qualified test patients, while another 40% saw a partial response to Calquence.Calquence became part of the AstraZeneca family in 2015 when the company acquired a major stake in Acerta just to gain control of the drug. CEO Pascal Soriot believed then that the drug could generate as much as $5 billion in annual revenue, though after a few roadblocks, the market has since tempered its expectations.However, some analysts still expect Calquence to generate $1 billion in annual sales, qualifying it as a blockbuster drug.Company: Johnson & JohnsonTreats: Prostrate cancerJohnson & Johnson (  , $139.81) subsidiary Janssen submitted its new drug application for prostate cancer drug apalutamide in late October, which tentatively means a decision should be made around the middle of 2018.Prostate cancer treatments are a crowded $7.9 billion market, led by generic drugs like docetaxel, Jevtana from Sanofi-Aventis and Xtandi from Astellas, just to name a few. Apalutamide has something of an edge, however, when it comes to treating prostate cancer. The androgen receptor inhibitor is, as Janssen's Peter Lebowitz described, \"a new approach to treating men with prostate cancer earlier in the disease course.\" He added, \"We have demonstrated that treating patients before the disease has metastasized improves outcomes.\"Janssen has yet to share specific efficacy numbers of the latest stage of its testing, but that has not prevented EP Vantage analysts from predicting peak sales of $1.4 billion by 2022.Company: BioMarin PharmaceuticalTreats: HemophiliaIn 2016, when Evercore ISI clients were shown the results of trials of BioMarin Pharmaceutical (  , $83.27) hemophilia drug valoctocogene roxaparvovec (formerly BMN 270), Evercore analyst John Scotti observed, \"When they started presenting (the data), jaws just went to the floor. There was an audible gasp in the room.\"The description was a tad theatrical, to be sure, but the point stands: The treatment was the first successful gene therapy for the disease, and it worked very, very well. Indeed, there's nothing out there quite like it. Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz described it as a \"one and done\" treatment.The total hemophilia market will be worth an estimated $25.1 billion by 2024, as the understanding of the disease increases and the diagnosis of it improves.

It's giving a lot of its gains back today after the company released data that suggests a potential competitor from BioMarin might have the upper hand from this point forward.Image source: Getty Images.SPK-8011 is a one-time gene therapy that aims to help hemophiliacs produce necessary clotting factors. Although Spark's candidate, which it's developing in partnership with  (NYSE: PFE) , helped knock back dangerous uncontrolled bleeds to essentially zero, investors are troubled by a spotty clotting factor production benefit.In short, one patient receiving a  dose of Spark's SPK-8011 produced clotting factors as high as 12% of normal while a patient receiving a  dose produced clotting factors as high as 24% of normal.BioMarin's candidate hasn't been measured in a head-to-head trial against Spark's so we need to take any comparisons with a big grain of salt. That said, the differences look pretty big. BioMarin's valoctocogene roxaparvovec (formerly BMN 270) helped three patients with a 48-week observation produce clotting factors at an average of 49% of normal.While the future of Spark's fledgling hemophilia program seems even less certain now than it did a few days ago, the company could launch its first commercial-stage drug in the new year.

Top-line results from this randomized (1:  ), double-blind, 2-period, 2-treatment, crossover, outpatient proof-of-concept trial is expected in the first half of 2019.If the outcome is positive, the company plans to submit an application for orphan drug designation and pursue a clinical program required for the filing. According to some studies, animals or patients affected with SMA have shown that the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has significant structural and functional defects suggesting that impaired NMJ function might contribute to SMA pathogenesis and symptoms. Firdapse increases neuromuscular junction transmission and may therefore help to preserve the NMJ and motor neurons. The company thus feels that treatment with Firdapse will provide symptomatic relief to SMA Type 3 patients.So far this year, Catalyst Pharma's shares have outperformed the industry. The stock has surged 211.5% compared with the  's gain of 3%.Firdapse is the lead pipeline candidate for the company. Catalyst had in-licensed rights to Firdapse from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  for its development and commercialization in the United States. Currently, the candidate is approved in the EU for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in adults. Also, it enjoys Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy status in the United States for the treatment of LEMS.In December 2017, Catalyst expects to report top-line results from its second phase III study of Firdapse for the treatment of LEMS. Additionally, the company plans to resubmit a new drug application (NDA) before the end of the year.Meanwhile, Catalyst is also working on the development of Firdapse for additional indications. The company expects to initiate MuSK- myasthenia gravis (MG) phase III study in the first quarter of 2018.Earlier, the company had initiated a small blinded study on Firdapse for the treatment of certain types of congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) in pediatric population (2-17 years). However, following discussions with the FDA, the study has been expanded beyond pediatric patients to include adult CMS patients. Top-line data from the study are expected in the first half of 2018. Positive data would allow Catalyst to add the CMS indication to Firdapse's label (either as part of the NDA resubmission for Firdapse to treat LEMS or as a supplement to the resubmission).The company's efforts to develop Firdapse appear encouraging, given its significant commercial potential.

For the QMG endpoint, the data showed a clinically significant difference of 6.4 points between the Firdapse and placebo groupsThe top-line results showed that Firdapse has a significant magnitude of effect for treating the symptoms of LEMS. Additionally, it was well tolerated in the study and showed a similar safety profile as seen in the earlier studies.The company presented detailed results from the first phase III trial of Firdapse last year.

At the beginning of October, the biotech's share price was up 25% year to date. By the end of the month, Celgene stock was down more than 10% for the year.The huge plunge stemmed from a couple of negative developments. First, Celgene  from a late-stage study of GED-0301 in treating Crohn's disease. Second, the company missed revenue expectations in the third quarter and lowered its full-year 2017 guidance, as well as its long-term outlook.All of this bad news has some people questioning if Celgene should buy a biotech to improve its prospects. I think the answer is a definite \"yes.\" In fact, if Celgene buys the right biotech, I believe that investors should win big-time.Image source: Getty Images.What kind of biotech should Celgene look to buy? Several selection criteria rise to the top of the list. Most important, the target company should have a promising pipeline, preferably with one or more late-stage pipeline candidates that hold the potential to be blockbusters. Ideally, the biotech would be focused either on autoimmune diseases, hematology, or oncology.It certainly would be helpful, though, for Celgene to buy a company that already had at least one drug already on the market. After all, Celgene itself just found out that there's no guarantee of success with late-stage candidates. Buying a biotech that already has some financial stability would be a nice plus.Celgene needs a deal that provides a solid return on investment. Biotechs with strong pipelines and perhaps one or more existing products that are successful could provide the return, but don't forget about the investment part of the equation. Celgene needs to be able to afford whatever biotech it buys, and it shouldn't overpay. The perfect candidate would be at least priced attractively -- and, even better, priced at a discount.There aren't too many biotechs available that have promising pipelines and successful current drugs, and are also priced reasonably.  (NASDAQ: EXEL) meets at least one of the selection criteria. Cabometyx is already successful as a second-line treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The company hopes to soon win approval for the first-line RCC indication. Exelixis also plans to submit Cabometyx for approval in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in early 2018.Exelixis doesn't have a particularly deep pipeline, though. Other than two studies evaluating Cabometyx in RCC and HCC, Exelixis isn't sponsoring any other clinical trials on its own. To be fair, however,  is evaluating Cabometyx in combination with its immunotherapies, and the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program is supporting quite a few studies. In addition,  has studies underway for Exelixis' MEK inhibitor Cotellic. As for valuation, Exelixis stock trades at nearly 39 times expected earnings. That's certainly not a bargain price.Celgene could look within its partner network.  (NASDAQ: BLUE) , for example, has a couple of late-stage candidates in Lenti-D and LentiGlobin. Celgene liked the prospects for phase 1/2 CAR-T therapy bb2121 so much that it has licensed the drug. Bluebird doesn't have a product on the market yet, though. Also, with a market cap of around $6.4 billion and no sales at this point, a lot of Bluebird's potential is already baked into its stock price.If Celgene were willing to look outside of its core therapeutic areas,  (NASDAQ: BMRN) might be a good pick. The biotech already claims six rare-disease drugs on the market, and it's awaiting approval for another. BioMarin also has a late-stage candidate and another that isn't too far away from phase 3 testing. Its stock, however, is on the pricey side and would require Celgene to add to its debt.There is another biotech, though, that checks off all the boxes. This biotech has several successful drugs already on the market. It claims a robust pipeline with multiple potential blockbuster candidates. And the stock is a bargain right now, with shares trading at less than 11.5 times expected earnings. Which fantastic biotech could this be? It's Celgene.The company should take advantage of  and scoop up boatloads of its shares. I can't think of a better use for Celgene's $10 billion cash stockpile. Quite frankly, there's no better deal on the market. Executive chairman and former CEO Bob Hugin said during Celgene's third-quarter  that the company has \"an incredibly bright future,\" with a \"broad pipeline and market-leading top-line and bottom-line growth.\" He's right.Despite the setback with GED-0301, Celgene's pipeline still has multiple candidates that could be huge winners. Topping the list are ozanimod and luspatercept. Revlimid, Pomalyst, and Otezla (even with its headwinds), combined with late-stage pipeline assets, should drive earnings growth of close to 20% over the next few years.I wouldn't be opposed to Celgene buying any of the other biotechs mentioned earlier as potential candidates, but none of them can claim all of the positives that Celgene itself has. If Celgene buys back its own stock, I'm convinced that shareholders will win.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Valrox is about to enter two independent phase 3 trials at two different doses. BioMarin expects to complete enrollment by the end of 2018 and have data by the end of 2019. Well before then -- as in, next month -- investors will get to see updated data from the phase 2 trial for valrox at the American Society of Hematology meeting, which will hopefully induce confidence that the phase 3 trials will be successful.And even further back in the pipeline, BioMarin announced a new drug candidate, BMN 290, which should enter clinical trials next year to treat Friedreich's Ataxia, a neurologic and cardiac disorder.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In July 2016, the company announced positive top-line data from the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity.We remind investors that Ultragenyx submitted a biologics license application (\"BLA\") to the FDA and a marketing authorization application (\"MAA\") to the EU earlier in May.

Almost 200 patients across the world are afflicted with this disease, one of the rarest forms of MPS. Hence, the approval and successful commercialization of MEPSE VII will thus be a major boost to the company.Drugs approved for curing other MPS disorders include BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.'s  Aldurazyme (MPS I), Naglazyme (MPS VI) and Vimizim (Morquio A Syndrome (MPS IVA) and Shire plc's  Elaprase (Hunter syndrome (also called MPS-II).Ultragenyx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The biotech also raised its previously issued adjusted net income guidance for 2017.So far this year, BioMarin's shares have underperformed the industry. While BioMarin's shares are down 0.4%, the  has witnessed an increase of 3.7%.Third-quarter loss of 7 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 13 cents as well as the year-ago loss of 22 cents. A one-time upfront payment received from Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.  primarily led to the narrower loss in the quarter. In July, BioMarin entered into a license and settlement agreement with Sarepta resolving the exon-skipping patent litigation. Excluding this one-time upfront payment of $31.5 million and a contingent consideration gain, adjusted loss per share was 27 cents in the third quarter.Total revenue came in at $334.1 million, up 19% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $348 million.Product revenues were $298.8 million in the quarter, up 7% year over year.Kuvan revenues rose 16% to $105.8 million, reflecting patient growth in North America and continued growth in the ex-North American territories acquired in 2016. The number of patients on Kuvan therapy in the United States increased 9% in the third quarter.Naglazyme sales declined 7% year over year to $72.1 million.Vimizim contributed $90.3 million to total revenue, up 12% year over year. However, Vimizim sales declined 12.5% sequentially.Naglazyme and Vimzim revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from some countries, mainly Brazil.Earlier this month, at its R&D day, BioMarin had said that a slowdown in federal purchasing orders in Brazil have hurt Naglazyme and Vimizim product revenues in the third quarter.Moreover, at that time, BioMarin had said that if the slowdown continues in the fourth quarter, it will only be able to meet the lower end of the total product revenue guidance ($1.25 billion and $1.3 billion, not including milestone payment from Sarepta). However, in the earnings release, BioMarin said that since the R&D day, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has initiated a purchasing process and it expects 2017 revenues to be within the guidance.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties - totaling $22.4 million (down 5%) - from Sanofi's  Genzyme in the quarter.Brineura received approval for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease - a form of Batten disease - both in the United States and the EU in the second quarter. The newest drug in BioMarin's portfolio generated sales of $3.1 million in the third quarter compared to $0.3 million in the second quarter. The company said the worldwide launch of Brineura was in-line with expectations and it achieved sales in the United States and in the European countries of Germany, France, Italy and Argentina.Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 4.2% owning to lower spending on the Brineura program and the discontinuance of the Kyndrisa program last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.8% primarily due to increased expenses related to the acquisition of international Kuvan rights, costs associated with the Brineura launch and higher stock compensation expenses.Regarding pegvaliase, which has been developed to treat phenylketonuria (PKU), the company plans to submit a marketing application in Europe in the first quarter of 2018, slightly delayed from the end of 2017 as guided previously. In the United States, pegvaliase Biologics License Application (BLA) is currently under priority review. Last month, BioMarin announced that the FDA is not looking to hold an advisory panel meeting for the company's BLA for pegvaliase. Earlier this month, the company said the FDA is expected to give its decision in the first half of 2018.Meanwhile, two phase III studies (one in high dose (6e13 vg/kg) and one in mid dose (4e13 vg/kg)) on its hemophilia A candidate valoctocogene roxaparvovec (formerly BMN 270) are expected to be initiated before the end of the year. Concurrent with the earnings release, BioMarin announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to valoctocogene roxaparvovec based on positive data from phase I/II study.Earlier this month, BioMarin also announced that it has selected BMN 290, a small molecule drug, as its next development candidate. BMN 290 will be evaluated for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia (FA), a rare autosomal recessive disorder for which no disease modifying therapies are currently approved. An Investigational New Drug (IND) application to begin phase I studies is expected to be submitted in the second half of next year.The company tightened its previously issued 2017 sales guidance. However, it raised its adjusted earnings guidance while lowering its expectations for operating costs.BioMarin expects total revenue in the range of $1.29 \u2212$1.32 billion (including milestone payment from Sarepta) compared with $1.285 \u2212$1.335 billion previously. This represents year-over-year growth of 15.5% to 18.2%.Vimizim sales are expected in the range of $400-$420 million (previously $400-$430 million). Kuvan sales are projected in the range of $400-$420 million (previously $380\u2212$410 million). Naglazyme sales are projected in the range of $310\u2212$330 million (previously $300\u2212$330 million).Expenses related to R&D are expected within $600-$620 million, down from $610-$640 million while SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $530-$550 million, compared with $530-$560 million previously.The bottom line, on an adjusted basis, is expected to turn positive in 2017. The company raised its 2017 adjusted net income guidance from $30 - $70 million to $60 - $80 million. Meanwhile, management is committed to profitability improvements over the longer term.At the call, BioMarin also said it expects its present marketed products plus pegvaliase to drive the top line at a 15% compounded rate through 2020 while costs will rise at a lower level.BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The biotech also increased its 2017 sales outlook for Exondys 51, a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and its only marketed drug. Shares were up almost 3.4% in after-hours trading.So far this year, Sarepta's shares are up 76.3%. This compares favorably with 6.9% increase registered by the  during this period.Sarepta incurred a loss of 78 cents per share in the third quarter of 2017, narrower than the year-ago loss of $1.18 as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 86 cents.Sarepta's Exondys 51, the first DMD treatment to gain approval in the United States, has shown strong performance in the quarter. In the third quarter, Sarepta recorded revenues of $46 million, up 31.4% sequentially, primarily attributable to sales of Exondys 51. The drug is under review in the EU. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.7 million. In the prior-year quarter, Sarepta had recognized no revenues.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $34.2 million in the second quarter, almost flat year over year. Although the company incurred lower manufacturing expense, it was partly offset by increased expenses in preclinical studies on PPMO platform, other follow-on exons and increased patient enrollment in ongoing clinical studies.Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses were $28.2 million, up 28.2% year over year, due to increased legal fees and worldwide commercial initiatives, compensation and other personnel expenses.During the quarter, Sarepta incurred an expense of $25.6 million for settlement and license agreements related to a patent on exon-skipping technology used in DMD therapies. The settlement with BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  removed a major overhang on Sarepta.In July 2017, Sarepta launched a Managed Access Program along with UK-based Clinigen to ensure availability of Exondys 51 to DMD patients in certain geographic regions outside the United States. Moreover, it also signed a gene therapy research collaboration agreement with Genethon to jointly develop treatments for DMD.Subsequent to the quarter in September 2017, Sarepta announced positive results from a phase I/II study - 4053-101 - evaluating its Exon 53 skipping candidate, golodirsen, for the treatment of DMD patients. Golodirsen achieved a 100% response rate with 10.7 times increase in mean dystrophin protein from baseline, showing better efficiency than Exondys 51. The potential of golodirsen is impressive, and the company is planning a meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2018 to discuss the future course of action.Based on sales trends witnessed in the third quarter, Sarepta updated its guidance for Exondys 51 sales to $150 million to $155 million in 2017, higher than its prior guidance of $125 million to $130 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 sales is pegged at $135.16 million.Meanwhile Sarepta is looking to build its own DMD pipeline beyond Exondys 51 by developing other exon-skipping treatments. Sarepta will have seven exon-skipping candidates in its pipeline by the end of this year that could treat 75%-80% of the DMD population. | Sarepta Therapeutics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC  and Agenus Inc.  .

As such, the quarterly 13F filings of his namesake fund, Soros Fund Management, are must-read material for any serious investor.The latest 13F filings for the second-quarter of 2017, for example, reveal that the Soros Fund upped its stake in the antisense drugmaker  (NASDAQ: IONS) , and initiated positions in the rare disease specialists  (NASDAQ: ALNY) and  (NASDAQ: BMRN) over the three-month period. As the Soros Fund Management has a fairly strong track record of picking winning pharmaceutical stocks, I think it's worthwhile to consider if these three mid-cap biotech stocks might be particularly strong buys right now. Let's dig in to find out.Image source: Getty Images.After a murky period where Ionis' first commercial-stage drug Kynamro failed to live up to expectations and its RNA-targeted therapies appeared to be in deep trouble from a safety standpoint, the company has started to put these issues to rest following the FDA-approval of its spinal muscular atrophy medicine, Spinraza, last December. Developed in conjunction with biotech heavyweight  (NASDAQ: BIIB) , Spinraza has gotten off to a blistering start, hauling in a whopping  in sales in the second quarter. Ionis, for its part, netted a healthy $27.6 million in royalties for the three month period from Spinraza as part of its agreement with Biogen.Ionis, however, is anything but a one trick pony. Its vast antisense drug platform currently sports 37 ongoing clinical candidates, as well as multiple late stage drugs nearing pivotal top line readouts. The drugmaker's wholly owned subsidiary  (NASDAQ: AKCA) , for instance, recently filed for approval for the duo's high-value cardiovascular drug candidate, volanesorsen, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Although there are some safety issues revolving around low platelet counts that could delay volanesorsen's approval, Ionis should eventually transform into a multi-product company based on the sheer depth of its pipeline.Like Ionis, Alnylam's development platform uses RNA as its main therapeutic target, allowing it to build out a diverse pipeline of high-value drug candidates. Unfortunately, the similarities don't end there. Alnylam's RNA therapies have also produced some disconcerting side effects that have slowed its progress toward becoming a cash flow positive operation. Earlier this month, for example, the company was forced to halt trials for its experimental hemophilia A and B therapy, fitusiran, due to a patient death, and its former lead product candidate revusiran was derailed as a result of its unappealing risk-to-reward ratio for patients.The good news is that fitusiran's trials could resume shortly, and the company is racing toward a pivotal stage readout for its lead drug candidate, patisiran, in patients with hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis. In fact, investors have been bidding Alnylam's stock up in a  ahead of this binary event because patisiran could nearly triple the company's revenues next year if approved. Some analysts, though, have been far less bullish on patisiran's commercial potential due to their belief that the drug's late-stage clinical data won't live up to expectations -- especially in light of the company's recent safety woes  .The orphan drug specialist BioMarin is one of the most expensive  at the moment -- at least based on standard valuation metrics like price to sales or price to earnings ratios. However, the company's rich price tag shouldn't necessarily be a deal breaker for investors on the hunt for either value or growth opportunities. The reason being is that BioMarin has a strong track record at bringing important new medicines to market for so-called orphan indications -- or diseases with tiny patient populations, and quickly gobbling up market share thereafter.At present, BioMarin already has six products on the market, and another four candidates currently in late-stage trials. As a result, the drugmaker is on track to grow its top-line by nearly 18% this year, and by another 15% in 2018. BioMarin's late-stage dwarfism candidate, vosoritide, also has the potential to become a true franchise-level drug that could transform this company into a cash cow in the coming decade. Long story short, investors have piled into this stock because of the company's rocketing top-line and outstanding clinical pipeline that offers tremendous levels of deep value.The bottom line is that a lot of things need to go according to plan to justify these lofty valuations across the orphan drug space, and clinical trials rarely progress without a hitch. But if you truly want to own an orphan drug stock, BioMarin is probably your best bet, given the company's track record in the clinic, and host of products already on the market. The RNA drugmakers Alnylam and Ionis, by contrast, are still in prove it mode -- even though the market has largely turned a blind eye to their safety issues. Alnylam and Ionis, after all, both sport valuations that are easily among the highest in all of pharma.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The therapy is a one-time treatment for an inherited retinal disease.If approved, it will be the first treatment for the disease, which generally progresses to complete blindness. It would also be the first gene therapy approved in the U.S. to change genes while still inside the body, or in vivo.The therapy is set to go before the full FDA on Jan. 12. Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz sees the committee's productive tone on Thursday as a potential tailwind for Audentes, BioMarin,  (  ),  (QURE) and Ultragenyx, all of which are working in this arena.\"Panelists were receptive and flexible, which we believe sets a positive backdrop for other companies in gene therapy albeit in distinct therapeutic areas,\" Schwartz wrote in a note to clients.Luxturna is in a unique position of treating a patient population that lacks other options, Schwartz noted. That could have tipped the scale for Spark. Audentes' gene therapy for a skeletal muscular condition known as X-linked myotubular myopathy is in the same position.Others working in conditions like hemophilia and wet age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease, may face more scrutiny considering the number of treatment options with measured clinical efficiency that already exist, Schwartz said.\"It is formally possible that regulators set higher expectations or are less compromising on data requirements,\" he said. \"We believe the product profile of a curative agent may be scrutinized with a different lens compared to rare diseases that lack treatment options.\"\"As a result, we believe caution is warranted before making blanket extrapolations from the Luxturna experience to all of gene therapy,\" he added.The committee's main questions on Thursday centered on the narrow subset of data from patients with a rare type of the disease and the clinical meaningfulness of a newly devised test that converts light levels seen by patients into a numerical scoring system, Schwartz said.But multiple committee members argued the test is superior to other currently available methodologies, UBS analyst Carter Gould wrote in a note to clients. The committee noted the score intervals are uneven and the test doesn't capture the disease severity before treatment.Committee members also questioned the lower age limit in the label for Luxturna - set at age 3 - with some arguing starting as young as 8 months when retinal cells stop dividing. The committee found a 3-year-old eye is anatomically similar to an adult eye and doesn't pose additional surgical risk.The committee also questioned whether patients would need a second dose if efficiency diminishes over time. Further, the therapy only treats one-fifth of the retina when it's administered, justifying potential re-treatment down the line.In morning trading on the  , Spark initially lifted as much as 6.4% but ended the regular trading day down 2.3% to 84.23. Regenxbio lost 1.5% to 32.95, while Audentes and BioMarin were flat.

BioMarin delivered a positive earnings surprise of 168.18% in the last quarter.BioMarin's earnings track record has been strong, with the company beating estimates in each of the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 99.93%.BioMarin's shares are up 5.9% so far this year. This compares unfavorably with 10.2% increase registered by the  during this period.Let's see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Key orphan disease drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, which have been driving BioMarin's top line for some time now, are likely to maintain the trend this quarter too. Robust patient growth and penetration are likely to propel sales of the drugs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vimizim and Kuvan for the third quarter is $103 million and $102 million, respectively.However, Naglazyme and Vimzin revenues may vary on a quarterly basis due to inconsistent ordering patterns from some countries. Last week, at its R&D day, the company said that a slowdown in Federal purchasing orders in Brazil will hurt Naglazyme and Vimizim product revenues in the third quarter. Moreover, the company said that if the slowdown continues in the fourth quarter, it will only be able to meet the lower end of the total product revenue guidance ($1.25 billion and $1.3 billion, not including a $35 million milestone payment from Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. [  ]) for 2017. On the other hand, if orders in Brazil are as expected, it will meet the mid-point of the guidance.Nevertheless, the drugs continue to witness steady patient growth and we expect the trend to continue this quarter.We expect management to discuss how the pipeline is progressing at the conference call. Brineura was approved in both the U.S. and EU this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease - a form of Batten disease. Though Brineura generated sales of only $0.3 million in the second quarter, we expect higher sales this quarter.At the Q3 investor call, we also expect management to comment on Brineura's early launch progress and also on the launch preparation for pegvaliase. Pegvaliase, developed for treating phenylketonuria (PKU), is under review in the United States with the FDA expected to give its decision in the first half of next year.Importantly, at the Q2 call, the company had said that due to the ramp up of BMN 270 and vosoritide programs, R&D spending is expected to be higher in the third and the fourth quarters. This will result in lower adjusted net income in these quarters compared to the first and second.Our proven model does not conclusively show that BioMarin is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.

Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.79% if the stock gets called away at the December 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BMRN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing BMRN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $95.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.09% boost of extra return to the investor, or 25.08% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 38%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $94.34) to be 29%.

Other updates include important data presentations from companies like Nabriva Therapeutics  and AbbVie  . The FDA approved Amgen and Allergan's Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche's blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). Mvasi can be used for all eligible indications of the reference product. Approval was in line with expectations considering the favorable vote the biosimilar got from an FDA advisory panel recently. The approval is quite a boost for the companies as well as the effort to lower drug prices though so far biosimilars are yet to make a significant dent in referenced product sales in the United States. Mvasi is under review in the EU (Read more:  ). Nabriva got a major boost with the company posting positive top-line results on oral lefamulin in patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (\"CABP\"), the leading cause of infectious death in the United States. The LEAP 1 study, the first of two pivotal late-stage studies being conducted with lefamulin, met the FDA's primary endpoint of non-inferiority compared to moxifloxacin with or without adjunctive linezolid for early clinical response. The European Medicines Agency's ('EMA\") criteria were also met. Nabriva is looking to position lefamulin as a first-line empiric monotherapy. The second pivotal study is currently enrolling with topline results expected next year in spring. Positive results would allow the company to file for FDA approval in the second half of 2018. Nabriva has gained 54.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the  15.6% rally (Read more:  ). BioMarin Pharmaceutical  , known for its strong presence in the market for serious and life-threatening rare disorders, said that the FDA is not looking to hold an advisory panel meeting for the company's Biologics License Application (\"BLA\") for pegvaliase. BioMarin is looking to get pegvaliase approved for the reduction of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management. Pegvaliase is currently under priority review with a response from the FDA expected by Feb 28, 2018. However, this could well be pushed out by three months as the agency has asked BioMarin for additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (\"CMC\") information (Read more:  ). Cancer-focused TESARO  got some good news with the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issuing a positive opinion for Zejula (niraparib) as a monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Given the positive opinion, chances of gaining EU approval look high. Approval would make Zejula the first oral, once-daily PARP 1/2 inhibitor in Europe for use in patients regardless of BRCA mutation or biomarker status. Zejula is already approved in the United States (Read more:  ). AbbVie and partner Roche are looking to expand the label of their cancer therapy, Venclexta/Venclyxto and results from a late-stage study (MURANO) should help in these efforts. Venclexta plus Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (\"CLL\") in the MURANO study. An independent data monitoring committee has recommended the unblinding of the study based on the positive results.

However, we are positive on the FDA's current decision as it indicates the agency's comfort with the safety and efficacy data of pegvaliase submitted from completed clinical studies. Also, the preliminary evaluation of the FDA is in line with the company's expectations.Additionally, an application in the EU for pegvaliase is expected to be filed by the end of this year.BioMarin's shares are up 11% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the 15.5% rally of the  during the period.We remind investors that in August, the FDA accepted the BLA for pegvaliase under priority review. However, the regulatory body requested additional information on chemistry, manufacturing and controls related to pegvaliase. The company expects submission of this information to the FDA to be classified as a major amendment that will extend the review process by three months. As of now, a decision is expected on Feb 28, 2018.BioMarin is hoping that pegvaliase, if approved, will supplement the company's phenylketonuria portfolio, also including Kuvan. A potential approval will strengthen the company's commercial leadership in the treatment of PKU with potential to drive the company's revenues, going forward.However, Kuvan is set to face generic competition from 2020 onward. The approval of pegvaliase will help BioMarin offset any loss of revenues from Kuvan in the long term.Per the company provided information, approximately 50,000 individuals in the developed countries are diagnosed with PKU, representing a significant need for such therapies.We remind investors that in January last year, BioMarin acquired all global rights to Kuvan and pegvaliase from Merck Serono. Previously, the company had exclusive rights to Kuvan in the United States as well as Canada and to pegvaliase in the United States plus Japan.With this transaction, BioMarin has gained exclusive worldwide rights to Kuvan and pegvaliase with the exception of Kuvan in Japan. The acquisition of PKU rights in these markets represents a significant opportunity for BioMarin to establish commercial leadership for treatment of PKU, first with Kuvan and then with pegvaliase, upon regulatory developments.BioMarin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shares have added about 2.5% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Second-quarter earnings of 15 cents per share rose 50% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at a loss of 22 cents per share. Strong product sales and lower R&D costs pulled up profits in the quarter.Total revenue came in at $317.4 million in the quarter, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $309.0 million. The top line was aided by strong net product sales.Product revenues were $315.9 million in the quarter, up 6% year over year.Kuvan revenues rose 13% to $102 million, reflecting patient growth in North America and continued growth in the ex-North American territories acquired in 2016. The number of patients on Kuvan therapy in the U.S. increased 11% in the second quarter.Naglazyme sales rose 9% year over year to $85.7 million. The drug continued to witness steady patient growth with the number of commercial patients increasing 7% in the quarter.Vimizim contributed $103.2 million to total revenue, down 3% year over year and 2.8% sequentially due to unfavorable timing of government orders. However, the drug continued to witness steady patient growth as the number of patients on Vimizim therapy increased 24% year over year in the quarter.Naglazyme and Vimzim revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from some countries.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties - totaling $19.9 million (up 6%) - from Sanofi's Genzyme in the quarter.Brineura received FDA approval in Apr 2017 and was launched in mid-June. Also, Brineura received marketing approval in the EU in Jun 2017. Brineura generated sales of $0.3 million from two countries in the second quarter - U.S. and Argentina. Following the second quarter, the company said it has already recorded first sales in France and Germany.Adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses declined 16% to $122.2 million owning to lower spending on the Brineura program and the discontinuance of the Kyndrisa program last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 32.5% to $115.1 million primarily due to increased expenses related to the acquisition of international Kuvan rights, costs associated with the Brineura launch and higher legal costs.At the end of the second quarter, BioMarin had $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments.The company raised its previously issued 2017 sales guidance apparently due to the $35 million in milestone payment from Sarepta. The earnings guidance was kept intact. While it raised the previous expectations for selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs, it lowered the guidance for research and development (R&D).BioMarin expects total revenue in the range of $1.285 - $1.335 billion, up from $1.25 \u2212$1.30 billion previously.Vimizim sales are expected in the range of $400-$430 million, representing a year over year growth rate of 13% to 21%. Kuvan sales are projected in the range of $380\u2212$410 million, representing an increase of about 14% over 2016 at the mid-point. Naglazyme sales are projected in the range of $300\u2212$330 million.Expenses related to R&D are expected within $610-$640 million, down from $620-$650 million while SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $530-$560 million, up from $520-$550 million previously.Due to the ramp up of BMN 270 and vosoritide programs, the company expects R&D spending to increase in the second half of the year, which will result in lower adjusted net income in the second half compared to the first.Adjusted earnings are expected to turn positive in 2017. The company continues to expect adjusted net income of $30 - $70 million in 2017. Meanwhile, management is committed to continued profitability improvements over the longer term.Analysts were quiet during the last month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions. | At this time, BioMarin's stock has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

The stock has increased 8.5% compared with the industry's 15.7% rally during the period.The phase I/II (BMN 250-201) study (n=3) was conducted in two parts. While the part 1 portion is focused on safety and pharmacodynamic activity in patients treated with higher doses (30mg, 100mg, 300mg), the part 2 portion is concerned with observing cognitive function of patients treated with 300mg dose.Data from the trial demonstrated improvement in cognitive Development Quotient (DQ), a measure of cognitive function normalized to age, in two of the three patients compared with their pre-dose baselines. Additionally, data also showed rapid decreases in liver size to normal range from baseline in the same patients. Notably, patients with untreated Sanfilippo B usually show progressive decline in DQ.We remind investors that in January, the company presented positive, preliminary results from the part I portion of the phaseI/II study. Data from the research demonstrated that BMN 250 reduced heparan sulfate levels to normal range in cerebral spinal fluid of MPS IIIB patients.Significantly, BMN 250 enjoys an orphan drug status in both the U.S. and the EU for the given indication.Per the company's press release, approximately 2,000-3,000 patients are living with Sanfilippo B syndrome in territories where Biomarin operates. Hence, approval of the candidate will provide the company an access to the market, holding huge potential.Apart from BMN 250, other interesting candidates include pegvaliase and BMN 270. While pegvaliase is under review in the United States for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU), BMN 270 is being evaluated in phase I/II study for curing hemophilia A.

Moreover, the FDA approved Novartis' Kymriah yesterday, making it the first CAR-T therapy to gain approval in the U.S. Gilead has finally announced an M&A deal with the company saying that it will acquire Kite Pharma for $180 per share in cash or approximately $11.9 billion. Gilead has been under a lot of pressure to utilize its huge pile of cash for a major acquisition deal given the dwindling sales of its erstwhile top-selling hepatitis C virus (\"HCV\") franchise. The Kite acquisition, slated to close in the fourth quarter, will place Gilead among the top players in the emerging field of cell therapy.

A decision is expected on Feb 28, 2018.BioMarin is looking to get pegvaliase approved for lowering blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder, who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels with existing treatment options.However, the regulatory body has requested additional information onchemistry, manufacturing, and controls related to pegvaliase. The company expects the submission of the information to the FDA to be classified as a major amendment that will extend the review process by three months.An application in the EU is expected to be filed by the end of the year.BioMarin's shares are up 0.2% so far this year, which compares unfavorably with an increase of 9.7% registered by the  during this period.We remind investors that pegvaliase's development/regulatory process has not exactly been smooth. The drug has faced several delays and setbacks, which makes the latest announcement a big positive for BioMarin.BioMarin is hoping that pegvaliase, if approved, will supplement BioMarin's phenylketonuria portfolio, which also includes Kuvan. A potential approval will strengthen BioMarin's commercial leadership in the treatment of PKU, which can drive the company's revenues going forward.Kuvan generated revenues of $194 million in the first half of 2017, up 16.4% year over year.However, Kuvan is set to face generic competition from 2020. The approval of pegvaliase will help BioMarin to offset any loss of revenues from Kuvan.According to information provided by the company, approximately 50,000 individuals in the developed countries are diagnosed with PKU, which represents a significant need for such therapies. | BioMarin has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector include Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  and Aduro BioTech, Inc.  .

In fact, deep value can be tremendously difficult to quantify in many cases -- leading to some stocks being incorrectly viewed as expensive based on short-term valuation metrics.Armed with this insight, we asked three of our investors which stocks with rich valuations they think might be attractive long-term buys. They suggested  (NASDAQ: BMRN) ,  (NASDAQ: ATVI) , and  (NYSE: BLK) . Read on to find out more.Image source: Getty Images. Valuation metrics such as price to sales or price to earnings ratios can be extremely misleading when it comes to biotech stocks. The rare disease specialist BioMarin Pharmaceutical, for example, sports a stately price to sales ratio of 12 at the moment that might be rather off-putting for traditional value investors. The prevailing industry average, after all, tends to range from 3.5 to 4.0 under normal market conditions -- implying that BioMarin is indeed grossly overpriced relative to its peers.If we dig deeper into the biotech's value proposition, though, I think a far different picture emerges. BioMarin currently sports six approved products for a variety of rare conditions, and another four late-stage candidates with sky-high commercial potential. The company's late-stage treatment for achondroplasia (the most common form of dwarfism) dubbed vosoritide, for example, could easily generate  level sales if approved. In other words, the commercial potential of BioMarin's late-stage pipeline arguably isn't even reflected in its current valuation -- despite its relatively high price to sales ratio.As an added bonus, orphan drugs -- or drugs indicated for exceedingly small population sizes -- tend to come with extended periods of exclusivity and truncated development timelines. The net result is that BioMarin, and many of its orphan drugmaker peers, generally have substantially less leverage on their balance sheets, and are also able to overcome clinical setbacks far quicker than traditional biopharmas.BioMarin, for instance, has a debt to equity ratio of only 24.2, and the company has also averaged around five years to bring new experimental compounds to market. Putting these figures into context, it's fairly common for revenue-generating biopharmas to sport debt to equity ratios in excess of 70%, and most small molecule drugs take upwards of a decade to develop.All things considered, BioMarin may look expensive based on standard valuation metrics, but the company is actually cheap when you factor in its strong late-stage pipeline, low debt levels, and ability to bring new drugs to market in an expedited fashion. With its stock up more than 440% over the last five years and shares trading at roughly 30 times forward earnings estimates, it's not unreasonable to question whether Activision Blizzard is still a good buy at current prices. Yet, despite trading near all-time highs, I think the video game publisher still looks cheap and has the potential to deliver substantial returns for long-term investors.Much of Activision Blizzard's impressive capital appreciation in recent years is connected to the growth of full-game downloads and in-game content sales -- trends which appear to be on track to continue and create ongoing sales and earnings momentum. The company enjoys a leadership position in one of the biggest growth segments in entertainment, and its emerging businesses like e-sports, film production, and consumer products create avenues for explosive growth down the line.Taking a closer look at its opportunity in e-sports, the company currently has four of the top-10-most-watched games on  's Twitch streaming service, recently sold rights to the first seven teams in its  for $20 million a piece, and has its own competitive organization and streaming platform with Major League Gaming. Research firm Newzoo estimates that e-sports revenue will grow from roughly $700 million in 2017 to $1.5 billion in 2020, and growth in gaming as a spectator sport should also have the effect of bringing new attention to Activision's games.Shifting gears, the company's push into consumer products looks to be a relatively low-risk, high-reward venture, and, if its film-production efforts prove successful, Activision will reap the rewards of being a true cross-medium powerhouse. So, while the publisher's stock might look expensive by some metrics, there's good reason to think its growth story is just getting started. At more than $400 per share, many would consider BlackRock stock to be expensive. By that standard, that's a fair assessment, as the investment management giant has one of the costliest share prices you'll find. Yet the $68 billion company has become a leader in managing people's money, and the rise of exchange-traded funds is largely responsible for BlackRock's success. As the company behind the  , BlackRock has reaped huge rewards from the move toward passive investing. Even the relatively modest percentages that BlackRock is able to collect from its funds through management fees are enough to generate a lot of revenue, and the suitability of ETFs as long-term investments makes most of those revenues recurring year after year.BlackRock doesn't necessarily look at first glance like the perfect value stock, trading at nearly 17 times forward earnings estimates. Yet the thing you have to remember about BlackRock is that the ETF revolution shows few signs of stopping. Total ETF assets under management recently topped the $3 trillion mark, and iShares continues to draw more than its fair share of assets coming into the market. BlackRock's primary risk is a bear market that throws investor confidence for a loop, but until that happens, the manager's growth has the potential to carry its shares still higher in the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That could be the case. Gilead CEO John Milligan reportedly told Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges that the company \"might end up doing nothing in oncology.\"Just a few months ago, Milligan and other Gilead executives were  to bolster its oncology portfolio. What's changed? And what could this mean for Gilead?Image source: Getty Images.It's not that Gilead Sciences doesn't want to make a deal. CFO Robin Washington stated in the company's second-quarter conference call that Gilead is still prioritizing its use of capital for partnerships and acquisitions to grow the business over the long term.According to Geoffrey Porges, the problem seems to be that Gilead wants to make a \"transformative\" acquisition -- but can't find the right candidate in oncology. Milligan doesn't want to buy a smaller biotech that won't be able to contribute significantly to growth until several years from now.There aren't many smaller biotechs that have a solid oncology portfolio that would be big enough to move the needle for Gilead.  (NASDAQ: INCY) is probably the best fit. Jakafi is already a winner in treating myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Late-stage pipeline candidate epacadostat is one of the most eagerly anticipated immunotherapies in development.Milligan also told Porges that Gilead is looking for a company with \"substantial data, value, and scale.\" Incyte arguably has the data, with promising clinical results for epacadostat and Jakafi. It also has scale, with a pipeline that includes several other experimental cancer drugs. Value is another matter altogether. Incyte's market cap currently stands at close to $26.5 billion, but the biotech only posted revenue of $1.1 billion last year.It's a big gap between Incyte and the next tier of smaller biotechs focused on oncology.  (NASDAQ: EXEL) also has a solid cancer lineup with Cabometyx, Cometriq, and Cotellic. Its market cap is around $8 billion. There should be a lot for Gilead to like about Exelixis, but the big biotech might not think an acquisition of the company would be transformative enough. Buying any of the many cancer-focused biotechs smaller than Exelixis wouldn't be all that transformative, either.Milligan's comments to Porges could indicate that Gilead is seriously looking at making an acquisition outside of oncology. That wouldn't be a huge surprise. Milligan has said several times that Gilead is interested in inflammation and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in addition to oncology. However, the reality is that there aren't many acquisition targets with current products or late-stage pipelines that seem to fit Gilead's criteria in those areas, either.Incyte has rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib in addition to its cancer portfolio. But the drug failed to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier this year and probably will have to undergo another clinical study. Gilead probably isn't very interested in baricitib, anyway, since  licensed the drug from Incyte in 2009.Image source: Getty Images.Perhaps the best bet for Gilead would be to target a smaller biotech focused on rare diseases. Two solid prospects stand out:  (NASDAQ: VRTX) and  (NASDAQ: BMRN) . Vertex specializes in developing drugs to treat cystic fibrosis (CF), while BioMarin has six drugs on the market that treat rare genetic diseases.BioMarin would be the least costly deal for Gilead, with its current market cap of less than $15 billion. However, Vertex would arguably be the more tranformative acquisition. Despite its market cap of around $39 billion, Vertex's  make it a reasonable value, as well.Incyte would be a great match for Gilead. If Gilead is open to going in a totally different direction, Vertex would be a nice pickup. I can understand reluctance to pull the trigger on such large deals, though. However, if Gilead wants to do something transformative, it will take spending a lot.It's possible that Milligan's remarks are something of a head fake. Maybe Gilead is pursuing Incyte after all. Or perhaps the company is looking at making multiple acquisitions of smaller biotechs -- the so-called \"string of pearls\" strategy.Whatever happens, Gilead Sciences  . With its falling hepatitis C sales, Gilead's other drugs and current pipeline simply won't be enough to turn things around for the once high-flying biotech. The company might end up doing nothing in oncology, but doing nothing at all isn't an option that Gilead's investors will accept.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Golodirsen's better efficacy in terms of dystrophin production than Exondys 51 raised investor skeptism that golodirsen could prove to be a new and better treatment option for DMD patientsIt is also anticipated that golodirsen may receive an earlier-than-expected approval, further strengthening Sarepta's DMD franchise.

The newest drug in BioMarin's portfolio generated sales of $0.3 million in the U.S. and Argentina in the second quarter.Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 16% to $122.2 million (excluding stock-based compensation expense) owning to lower spending on the Brineura program and the discontinuance of the Kyndrisa program last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 32.5% to $115.1 million (excluding stock-based compensation expense), primarily due to increased expenses related to the acquisition of international Kuvan rights, costs associated with the Brineura launch and higher legal costs.BioMarin announced updated data from the 4e13 vg/kg dose arm of an open-label phase 1/2 study of BMN 270 in patients with severe hemophilia A.For the cohort of three patients who were given the 4e13 vg/kg dose in December, at week 32, the company said that all were in or near the normal range of Factor VIII activity levels with both median and mean Factor VIII levels at about 51% with a range between 48% and 54%. For the three patients who were given the 4e13 vg/kg dose in Mar/Apr this year, at week 20, their Factor VIII activity levels had moved into the mild range The company also said that two of the three patients were continuing to trend upward.For all six patients in the 4e13 vg/kg dose cohort, median Factor VIII levels were 34% and mean was 31% at week 20.Last month, the company announced updated data from the study for the 6e13 vg/kg dose, which demonstrated clinical benefit of steady-state Factor VIII levels in a normal range.Based on the robust data, BioMarin plans to initiate two separate phase III studies for the 4e13 vg/kg and the 6e13 vg/kg doses as soon as possible. The company plans to invest more resources and manufacturing capabilities to maximize the BMN 270 development program.Last month, BioMarin announced a settlement of its ongoing global patent litigation with Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.  regarding the exclusive license on a patent pertaining to exon skipping technology used in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD therapies). Per the deal, BioMarin has licensed the global exclusive rights to its DMD patent estate for Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products to Sarepta Therapeutics. Sarepta will make a one-time payment of $35 million to BioMarin in relation to license and settlement agreements. Sarepta will also be entitled to pay potential commercial milestone payments and sales royalties (on exons 51, 45, 53 and possibly on future exon-skipping products) to BioMarin, per the agreement.Meanwhile, BioMarin has a robust pipeline with several data readouts lined up for the coming quarters. The most important candidate in its pipeline is vosoritide, which is currently in a phase III study for the treatment of children with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism.In June, BioMarin filed a biologics license application (BLA) with the FDA for its pipeline candidate, pegvaliase for phenylketonuria (PKU). A decision from the FDA is expected in early September. An application in the EU is expected to be filed by the end of the year.The company raised its previously issued 2017 sales guidance only to include the $35 million in milestone payment from Sarepta. The earnings guidance was kept intact. While it raised the previous expectations for selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs, it lowered the guidance for research and development (R&D).BioMarin expects total revenue in the range of $1.29 - $1.36 billion, up from $1.25 \u2212$1.30 billion previously.Vimizim sales are expected in the range of $400-$430 million while Kuvan sales are projected in the range of $380\u2212$410 million, representing an increase of about 14% over 2016 at the mid-point. Naglazyme sales are projected in the range of $300\u2212$330 million.Expenses related to R&D are expected within $610-$640 million, down from $620-$650 million while SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $530-$560 million, up from $520-$550 million previously.Due to the ramp up of BMN 270 and vosoritide programs, the company expects R&D spending to increase in the second half of the year, which will result in lower profits.Adjusted earnings are expected to turn positive in 2017.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Horizon's shares have declined 24.9% in the year so far, underperforming the Zacks classified  's gain of 10.5%. | Concurrent with the first-quarter earnings, the company trimmed its annual guidance and projected sales in the range of $1.0-$1.035 billion, down from its prior expectation of $1.240-$1.290 billion. However, due to the divestiture of Procysbi, the company further reduced its earnings guidance and now expects sales in 2017 be in the range of $985-$1.020 billion. During the quarter, Horizon sold off the marketing rights to Procysbi delayed-release capsules and Quinsair in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions for an upfront payment of $72.2 million, with additional potential milestone payments based on sales targets.Meanwhile, Horizon Pharma's primary care business unit results were significantly below expectations due to the implementation of a new commercial model, where the company is teaming up with pharmacy benefit managers and payers to help patients obtain access to its medicines. The company plans to overcome this underperformance by reducing costs in the primary care business unit in order to align its cost structure with the lower- than-expected sales. In this context, the company reduced its outlook for 2017.During the second-quarter , focus will be on the performance of the business units, along with that of products like Actimmune and Krystexxa. Both orphan and rheumatology businesses are expected to report solid growth, driven primarily by strong patient growth in Krystexxa and Ravicti. Furthermore, Horizon Pharma is significantly increasing investments in one its key growth drivers, Krystexxa. Thus, the company raised its estimate of net sales for Krystexxa to more than $400 million from $250 million for the full year.On Apr 28, the company received approval for its supplemental New Drug Application from the FDA for Ravicti. The approval allowed to expand the age range for chronic management of urea cycle disorders in patients to two months and older from two years and older.

While the stock has rallied 23.5%, the broader industry witnessed a gain of 8.8%.BioMarin is entitled to receive 5% royalty on U.S. sales (through 2023) of Exondys 51 and both exons 45 and 53 skipping compounds, which use the exon skipping technology, and 8% royalty on European sales of the products (through Sep 2024).Per the agreement, Sarepta will make a one-time payment of $35 million to Biomarin plus unspecified regulatory and commercial milestone payments for exons 51, 45, 53, and on future exon-skipping products. Additionally, the company will pay BioMarin royalties for compounds skipping exons 51, 45, and 53, and possibly on future exon-skipping products.BioMarin, however, has held back the right to convert the license to a co-exclusive right in case it decides to proceed with an exon-skipping therapy for DMD.If Sarepta had not made the settlement with BioMarin, the latter could preclude Sarepta from commercializing Exondys 51 in several jurisdictions.

In the prior-year quarter, Sarepta had recognized no revenues.Adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses were $34.6 million in the second quarter, down 16.4% year over year, due to lower manufacturing expenses owing to the capitalization of inventory following the approval of Exondys 51 by the FDA. This was partly offset by increased expenses in preclinical studies on PPMO platform and other follow-on exons and increased patient enrollment in ongoing clinical studies. However, it excludes a one-time payment of $22 million to Summit Therapeutics plc  for completing enrolment in a phase II study evaluating utrophin modulator, ezutromid.Adjusted selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses were $25.4 million, up 92.1% year over year, due to increased legal fees and commercial initiatives, compensation and other personnel expenses.Both R&D and SG&A expenses exclude the impact of restructuring costs and share-based compensation expenses.Subsequent to the quarter in Jul 2017, Sarepta launched a Managed Access Program along with UK-based Clinigen to ensure availability of Exondys 51 to DMD patients in certain geographies outside the U.S. The company also appointed Douglas S. Ingram as its new President and CEO. Moreover, it also signed a gene therapy research collaboration agreement with Genethon to jointly develop treatments for DMD.Earlier this week, the company announced that it hassettled a global patent litigation with BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  regarding the exclusive license on a patent pertaining to exon skipping technology used in DMD therapies. If Sarepta hadn't settled with BioMarin, the latter could have prevented Sarepta from commercializing Exondys 51 in several jurisdictions.Based on sales trends witnessed in the second quarter, Sarepta updated its guidance for Exondys 51 sales to $125 million to $130 million in 2017, higher than its prior guidance of $95 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 sales is pegged at $103.51 million.The biotech company raised its outlook for Exondys 51 for 2017 based on increasing market penetration, start forms from physicians and additional new patients in the second quarter.Meanwhile Sarepta is looking to build its own DMD pipeline beyond Exondys 51 by developing other exon-skipping treatments. Sarepta has about seven exon-skipping candidates in its pipeline that could treat 75%-80% of the DMD population. The company expects to present dystrophin data from 4053-101 study by the end of 2017. | Sarepta Therapeutics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This outperformance was mainly due to strong sales from Sarepta's Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug, Exondys 51.The company also incurred a narrower-than-expected loss in Q2, reporting earnings of a loss of 65 cents per share and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 92 cents per share.

If Sarepta hadn't settled with BioMarin, the latter could have prevented Sarepta from commercializing Exondys 51 in several new areas.Looking ahead, Sarepta updated its guidance for Exondys 51, and now expects sales for the therapy to range from $125 million to $130 million in 2017, higher than its previous forecast of $95 million. The company raised its outlook primarily because of increasing market penetration, start forms from physicians, and additional new patients in the second quarter.

After all, a deal to buy Vertex would easily fall within Gilead's price range, and it likely would be accretive to earnings within two years. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that a handful of analysts revisited this idea yet again last week.Still, while there's little doubt that Gilead needs to do something to compensate for its faltering hepatitis C franchise, a Vertex buyout doesn't appear to be a particularly compelling solution. Here are three key reasons why such a deal isn't in the best interests of either Gilead or its shareholders.Image Source: Getty Images.While it's fairly common for orphan drugmakers to sport sky-high premiums, Vertex arguably takes the cake with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 41.3 and a price-to-sales ratio of 15.9. Putting these numbers into context, Vertex is markedly more expensive that either of its orphan drugmaker peers  or  on a price-to-sales ratio basis. Both of these companies also have far more diversified pipelines and comparable  .So if Gilead wanted to stray from its core strength in infectious diseases and wade into the realm of rare diseases, it could arguably do better than Vertex. Either Alexion and BioMarin, for instance, would likely produce more favorable returns on investment, and at a cheaper price to boot. Beyond that, analysts think that a Vertex buyout bid would come at an 80% premium relative to today's already-bloated share price. That's just not a good value for a potential suitor no matter how you slice it -- especially since there are better acquisition options in the rare disease space.One of the most important questions in any potential merger or acquisition involves fit, and these two companies go together like oil and water. Gilead, at its heart, is an infectious disease specialist, though it has growing interests in inflammatory diseases and oncology. While it does have some irons in the fire for rare diseases -- including experimental cystic fibrosis drug candidate andecaliximab -- there's simply not enough overlap with Vertex's businesses to create any major value-creating synergies.Vertex is a cystic fibrosis specialist. As such, the company's highly specialized sales force and R&D staff would largely need to be retained following a merger with the likes of Gilead -- which, after all, has zero experience when it comes to developing late-stage cystic fibrosis drugs or marketing them. That means Gilead wouldn't be able to institute any major cost-saving measures such as a workforce reduction by buying Vertex. And that's a huge minus in the growth-by-acquisition game.Gilead's  has been characterized by its ability to take promising early-stage candidates, shepherd them through the clinical trials process, and churn out blockbuster products. Vertex, by contrast, presently lacks any super-intriguing early-stage drug candidates that aren't already licensed out to other biopharmas. In fact, Vertex's pipeline doesn't have a single drug candidate among the top 20 most-valuable research projects, according to EvaluatePharma.If Gilead is going to pay a monstrous premium -- and perhaps empty its coffers in the process -- to acquire a pricey target like Vertex, management ought to be seeing a fair amount of deep value in the form of multiple early-stage drug candidates with blockbuster potential. Vertex doesn't check that particular box, and it arguably pales in comparison on this critical factor compared to several of its large-cap pharma peers.Wall Street is eager for Gilead to open up its massive war chest to buy revenue -- that much is clear. But a Vertex acquisition doesn't fit the biotech's past M&A behavior, nor does it meet management's  for a largish acquisition. So, despite the allure of this idea to some analysts, this is one deal that Gilead almost certainly won't pursue. In fact, investors can probably bank on the biotech remaining cautious in its approach to M&A. Gilead, after all, still has a strong HIV franchise and its pipeline does have some noteworthy mid-stage assets that could revive its growth engine in a few years time.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the BMRN options chain for the new August 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $90.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of BMRN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $95.61/share today.Because the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of BMRN stock at the current price level of $95.61/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $100.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.94% if the stock gets called away at the August 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BMRN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing BMRN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $100.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

However, the drug is not yet approved in the U.S. However, Catalyst Pharma has reached an agreement with the FDA on a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for its second phase III study on Firdapse for the treatment of LEMS. Positive data would allow the company to resubmit the regulatory application for Firdapse in the second half of 2017.In Mar 2017, the company announced positive top-line results from the study assessing Firdapse for another indication - myasthenia gravis patients who are MuSK antibody positive (MuSK-MG). Data from the study showed statistically significant results and showed a large clinical benefit to patients. Both of the co-primary efficacy endpoints of change from baseline (CFB) in total Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score (p=0.0003) and CFB in total Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score (p=0.0006) were statistically and clinically significant in the seven patient trial.Shares of the company have been consistently rising after this data readout.Catalyst had in-licensed rights to Firdapse from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  in 2012 for the development and commercialization of the product in the U.S.. Also, Firdapse enjoys Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy status in the U.S. for the treatment of LEMS. Firdapse received Orphan Drug status in the U.S. for the treatment of congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) and for the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) as well.Also, it expects top-line results from LEMS and congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) studies on Firdapse, and looks forward to submit the new drug application (NDA) for the same in the second half of this year.It is to be noted that LEMS is an ultra-rare disease, and therefore its market represents significant potential even though drugs and treatments like steroids, azathioprine, other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin are currently in use. Additionally, guanidine HCl tablets are approved for the treatment of LEMS. However, due to significant side effects, the drug is not viewed as an effective treatment. This, in turn, has created ample space for introducing new therapies for LEMS.Also, CMS is an ultra-rare disease with a prevalence of between 1,000 and 1,500 in the U.S. Moreover, approximately 5% to 8% of the MG patient population is estimated to be MuSK antibody-positive.Therefore, approval of Firdapse in these indications will be a huge boost for the company given its commercial potential in the target markets. | Catalyst Pharma currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The second half of the year, however, promises to be just as interesting as the first. Source: ShutterstockA number of pharmaceutical, biotech and other medical companies are set to kick off pivotal trials in their efforts to bring a drug to market that has the potential to be a game-changer in its target indication.Which is why investors need to be on the watch.Trial successes and treatment approvals are rocket fuel for the companies behind them. Especially when it comes to biotechs and pharma firms with just a handful of prospective drugs (or especially just one), good news can light shares ablaze, quickly delivering double-digit gains and even doublers depending on the significance of the latest results.Here are three drugs to watch - and the companies behind them - that are each set to move into a pivotal study near-term. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Acute Hepatic Porphyrias (AHP).Givosiran, by  (NASDAQ:  ), treats an indication of what's called acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP). Chances are that many reading are unfamiliar with AHP, and that can be forgiven - it's an ultra-rare condition that affects somewhere in the region of 5 out of every 100,000 individuals in the U.S. and Europe.This doesn't make it worthless as a target population, however.The FDA set up the Orphan Drug Designation system to incentivize the development of drugs for conditions exactly like this one, with companies not only set to draw benefit from various designation-associated perks but also from the ability to charge a premium price tag if and when the drug hits shelves.AHP is one of a family of conditions called the porphyrias, each of which is predominantly caused by a genetic mutation in one of the eight enzymes responsible for heme biosynthesis (a heme is the nonprotein part of hemoglobin that contains the iron). It's a pretty complicated condition, but more simply put: The fact that the hemes aren't getting synthesized results in a number of the construction inputs of these hemes building up in the body. This buildup is toxic and results in attacks, characterized by abdominal pain, which can in some instances be fatal.Givosiran works by inhibiting an enzyme called ALAS1, which is responsible for kick-starting the process of heme synthesis.The drug has performed promisingly in a bunch of early to mid-stage trials, and Alnylam is set to build on these early data with a pivotal Phase III study this year. The trial will likely follow a similar protocol to the Phase II that preceded it, in that it will seek to demonstrate the silencing of the above-mentioned enzyme (ALAS1) as a sort of surrogate, biomarker type endpoint and, in parallel, try to demonstrate the lowering of two key inputs - aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), both of which are toxic heme intermediates that cause the attacks associated with the condition.This one is set to kick off during late 2017 and, based on previous investigations, should run for 12 months once enrollment completes. Bear in mind that enrollment in this sort of ultra-rare condition can be slow (as patients are difficult to come across). Thus, enrollment completion becomes a major catalyst, alongside the more standard trial completion and data readouts. BioMarin Pharmaceutical HemophiliaThis one is a little less complicated and has a much wider target population. The drug is called BMN 270, and as might be expected from  (NASDAQ:  ) - king of blood drugs - it's being developed as a potential therapy for patients that have a deficiency of what's called Factor VIII, a blood-clotting factor.In healthy patients, Factor VIII is produced in the liver and circulates in the blood in an inactive form, bound to what's colorfully called the von Willebrand factor, a glycoprotein named after its discoverer. When an individual suffers a wound that causes them to bleed, Factor VIII disconnects from the von Willebrand factor and binds to what's called Factor XI - another factor key to the blood clotting process. Once the VIII and XI Factors bind together, a process starts that results in coagulation and, by proxy, clotting at the site of the bleed.Nothing is available to bind to Factor XI in patients with a Factor VIII deficiency, and this translates to an inability to effectively form blood clots. In turn, this results in the condition known as hemophilia, where patients can bleed profusely (and very dangerously) from small cuts.Standard of care therapies in this space basically revolve around trying to introduce blood clotting agents into a patient through ongoing therapy (one of which is set up to introduce Factor VIII to varying degrees), but the necessity for chronic administration and the overarching lack of long-term efficacy mean there's a distinct unmet need for another therapy type to hit shelves.BMN 270 is a gene therapy drug designed to replace the faulty gene responsible for the lack of sufficient Factor VIII production with a sort of synthetic alternative. The replacement gene performs the function that the faulty one should, coding for the VIII protein and overcoming the deficiency. With an approach like this, the treatment targets the underlying cause of the condition as opposed to just trying to pump a patient full of clotting agents, meaning (if it works) BioMarin could be set to pull in a large portion of the hemophilia market on approval.This one's a pivotal trial, but it's a Phase IIb as opposed to a Phase III, and data from earlier stage studies have demonstrated to the agency in the US that the phase IIb will be enough to underpin registration (assuming BioMarin can replicate the numbers as part of an expanded population).BMRN is already well underway with construction of the manufacturing facility that's going to create the study drug. It expects to initiate the trial during Q3 2017. VBI Vaccines HepatitisClosing out the list is  (NASDAQ:  ) with its asset, Sci-B-Vac. This hepatitis B vaccine is already approved in a number of global markets but has yet to earn regulatory green lights in the three major markets for this sort of preventative vaccine-type asset - the U.S., Canada and Europe.Just as with BioMarin's asset, the science behind the mechanism of action is pretty neat. In their current form, there are two generations of vaccines.The first introduces a bit of a virus (usually deactivated to a degree for safety reasons) to the immune system, with the goal of inducing the creation of antibodies specific to the virus in question. These antibodies then lay dormant until a live infection happens, at which point they are already in place to overcome the infection.The second uses an antigen, which is the part of a virus that the immune system recognizes as foreign and introduces only this antigen to the patient's system (usually in combination with some sort of adjuvant). This is much safer than adding live (even deactivated) virus to a patient's body as there's basically no risk of infection. But it has drawbacks in the sense that it is sometimes unable to induce an immune response sufficient to be classed as seroprotection. Many of the current standard of care vaccines in hepatitis B, including  (NYSE:  ) Engerix-B (which is perhaps the most well known of the bunch) is a second generation type vaccine.The third generation, of which Sci-B-Vac is one, is similar to the second in that it uses antigens to stimulate antibody creation. It differs in that it presents two or more antigens to the immune system as opposed to just one. In the case of Sci-B-Vac, the vaccine contains three antigens associated with the HBV virus - the one that second generation vaccines use and two others that have yet to be used in commercial vaccination.The extra antigens should translate to an improved rate of seroprotection and a quicker time to effectiveness. Additionally, it has the potential to induce immunity in an immunosuppressed subset of patients (overweight, diabetes, kidney disease and more) that, right now, don't respond to the current SOCs.VBI just announced the outcome of a pre-IND meeting with the FDA, and the agency seems happy to allow one global Phase III trial to cover registration applications not just domestically, but also in Canada and Europe. The authorities in these two aforementioned regions also suggested similar earlier this year, and VBI is set to submit trial applications to each in the coming months.Once these applications are green-lit, the company will kick off the global Phase III study, with likely initiation in late 2017 or early 2018.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" recently announced that it has filed an investigational new drug (IND) application with the FDA, seeking approval for its recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) gene therapy candidate, SHP654, for the treatment of patients with Hemophilia A.The bleeding disorder disease affects the clotting of blood and causes longer-than-normal bleeding in patients due to lack of clotting FVIII in the blood. It is also the most common form of hemophilia.Shares have underperformed the Zacks classified  industry so far this year. The stock declined 2% while the industry registered an increase of 5.9%.Coming back to the latest news, the IND was supported by data from pre-clinical and phase 1 studies, which showed the potential utility of the candidate.The company will present additional data on the candidate at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) 26th Biennial Congress in Berlin, Germany.The gene therapy developed by the company treats hemophilia A by selectively targeting the liver. The candidate delivers a functional copy of FVIII to the liver. This in turn activates the body's immune system to generate FVIII in the liver. The production of FVIII will help in stopping the bleeding.The company plans to initiate a global multi-center study to evaluate the safety of and examine SHP654 doses to boost FVIII activity levels and reduce hemophilic bleeding, following acceptance of the NDA.We remind investors that with the acquisition of Baxalta in 2016, Shire added key products to its hematology, oncology and immunology franchises, which also included hemophilia A drug, Advate.

While that's slower growth than the 5.2% year-over-year increase experienced in 2015, spending is still headed in the wrong direction. Using data from 2014, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) -- the trade group for health insurers -- estimates that over 22% of health insurance premium goes to paying for prescription drugs.Here are seven reasons why prescription drugs are so expensive.Image source: Getty Images.Researching drugs isn't cheap, but it's the development costs once a drug candidate is discovered that really rack up the bills. The Food and Drug Administration generally requires companies to run at least one phase 1 and phase 2 trial, and then requires at least two independent phase 3 trials (except in cases where the drug treats a disease with a high unmet need).For many diseases where drugs are making modest improvements, companies have to run many large phase 3 trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety in different types of patients. For example,  's (NYSE: ABBV) phase 3 program for its rheumatoid arthritis drug upadacitinib is testing the drug in more than 4,000 patients.Equally important, the drugs that work have to indirectly pay for all the drug candidates that fail to show an effect or have side effects that keep them from being approvable. Companies will only invest in development if they know the potential rewards justify the sunk costs if the drug fails.Image source: Getty Images.Unlike most countries, the U.S. allows drugmakers to market directly to consumers. Nielsen estimates that drugmakers spent a whopping $5.6 billion hawking their drugs to patients in 2016, a 9% increase over the previous year.  (NYSE: PFE) was the biggest spender, shelling out $1.19 billion.  (NYSE: BMY) ,  (NYSE: ABBV) , and  (NYSE: LLY) rounded out the top four with spending of $458 million, $433 million, and $414 million, respectively.Those marketing costs are recouped by -- you guessed it -- higher drug prices.The marketing also results in increased use of the drugs, which can allow companies to increase prices through the standard economic principle of supply and demand.Image source: Getty Images.Generic drugs can reduce drug costs dramatically through increased competition, but most drugs gain regulatory approval with a decade or more left on their patents. And companies can extend their exclusivity by an additional six months for running clinical trials to see if their drugs work on children.Once patents expire, the speed at which the FDA approves generic competitors greatly affects the price. An FDA study found that when a drug has three generic manufacturers, the average price was 44% of the branded drug price, but that drops to 23% when there are seven manufacturers and all the way down to 6% of the branded price if there are 19 generic manufacturers.Exclusivity can also be broken when other branded drugs are approved with essentially the same efficacy and safety profiles. We've seen this recently with insulin and hepatitis C drugs, where insurers have been able to demand lower prices for them to stay on the insurers' lists of preferred drugs.Image source: Getty Images.Drugmakers try to earn a certain amount of revenue from each drug. For mass-market drugs, such as statins that lower cholesterol, companies can offer reasonable prices and make up for it with volume. Conversely, when drugmakers develop drugs that treat orphan diseases that affect a relatively small number of Americans, they have to charge more to generate the same revenue from the drug. (NASDAQ: BMRN) , for example, priced its recently approved drug Brineura, which treats Batten disease, an ultra-rare pediatric brain disorder, at $702,000 per year. BioMarin estimates that about 20 infants are born with the disease each year.Because a small number of patients are affected, insurers can afford to pay the high price, which is ultimately shared by all the insured members. And government programs, such as Medicaid, typically get substantial discounts off the list price. In the case of BioMarin's Brineura, the price drops to a-still-quite-staggering $486,000 per year.Image source: Getty Images.Insurers try to negotiate lower costs to reduce member premiums as they compete with each other, but unless an insurer wants to refuse to cover a drug, it has limited negotiating power. When there aren't equivalent drugs on the market, drugmakers can offer a price and say: take it or leave it.And the price of prescription drugs doesn't actually matter for health insurance companies' profits since they're really just middlemen that are agnostic to the price. They add up all the expected costs for their members, tack on a little for profit, and divide the cost by the members to get the premium they charge. The high price of drugs is just passed on to members.Image source: Getty Images.Other countries have lower costs for prescription drugs because their governments institute price controls or because they have single-payer systems that refuse to pay for medications that they believe aren't worth the costs. For the most part, drugmakers are still willing to sell their drugs in those countries at the lower costs because some revenue is better than no revenue at all.But imagine an alternative universe where patients in every country paid the same amount for any given drug; U.S. patients could pay less, others could pay more, and drugmakers would generate the same revenue. Since decisions about whether to develop a drug or not are based on expected revenue, the same drugs would be developed in this alternate universe with the rest of the world picking up their fair share.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Meanwhile, major players like Regeneron  and BioMarin  reported 1Q results -- while Regeneron posted a mixed quarter (Read more:  ), BioMarin surpassed expectations (Read more:  ). Kite Pharma's 1Q17 results were totally overshadowed by the company's revelation about a cerebral edema-related death in a safety expansion cohort evaluating its lead pipeline candidate, CAR-T therapy, KTE-C19 (axicabtagene ciloleucel). Although Kite said that patient recruitment in ongoing studies was not paused or put on hold, investors got spooked by the update sending the shares down 13.2% (Read more:  ). While the news has left investors jittery, the general view is that the news will not dent the candidate's chances of gaining FDA approval later this year. Regeneron is tying up with Inovio for a clinical study deal that will see the companies evaluating Regeneron's PD-1 inhibitor, REGN2810 in combination with Inovio's INO-5401 T cell activating immunotherapy encoding multiple antigens and INO-9012, an immune activator encoding IL-12 for newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).A phase Ib/IIa immuno-oncology study is slated to commence later this year with safety and tolerability being the primary endpoints. Immunological impact, progression-free survival and overall survival will also be evaluated.GBM is the most common and aggressive type of brain cancer with an extremely poor prognosis even though a limited number of new therapies was approved over the last ten years. While the median overall survival for patients on standard of care therapy is about 15 months, the average five-year survival rate is less than 3%.Regeneron has also signed up with South Korean biotech company SillaJen for a phase Ib dose-escalation study in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or kidney cancer. This agreement will see REGN2810 being evaluated in combination with SillaJen's oncolytic vaccinia virus, Pexa-Vec, in patients with previously treated metastatic or unresectable kidney cancer. The study will commence later this year.Regeneron is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see  . Year-to-date, the company has performed better than the Zacks-categorized  industry with shares gaining 16.3% compared to the industry gain of 7.5%. Biotech major Amgen is teaming up with Elasmogen Ltd and Feldan Therapeutics for the development and delivery of novel intracellular biologics. Feldan's Shuttle platform and Elasmogen's soloMER technology will be used under the deal for two undisclosed intracellular targets. AbbVie  presented promising results from a mid-stage study on its investigational oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494), for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. The company said that the results support the advancement of the candidate into late-stage studies for the indication -- a phase III program is scheduled to commence later this year. Upadacitinib is one of the key candidates in the company's immunology pipeline and is in a mid-stage study for atopic dermatitis while another study for ulcerative colitis is scheduled to start shortly. Meanwhile, data from the first of six late-stage studies for rheumatoid arthritis should be out in the coming months. Array  announced positive top-line results from Part 2 of a late-stage study evaluating binimetinib, a MEK inhibitor, and encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, in patients with BRAF-mutant advanced, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for patients on binimetinib plus encorafenib was 12.9 months compared to 9.2 months for patients on encorafenib. Array plans to file for FDA approval in June or July this year. According to information provided by Array, currently marketed MEK/BRAF combination agents have a run rate approaching $1 billion in annual worldwide sales.Array also entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Merck under which a combination of binimetinib and Merck's Keytruda (anti-PD-1 therapy) will be evaluated in colorectal cancer patients with microsatellite stable tumors. The study is scheduled to commence in the second half of the year. Conatus'  partner Novartis has decided to exercise its option to an exclusive license for the global development and commercialization of emricasan, a first-in-class, orally-active pan-caspase inhibitor being developed for chronic liver disease including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis. Emricasan is in a phase IIb study in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis caused by NASH.Conatus stands to receive a $7 million option exercise payment in mid-2017. So far, the company has received a $50 million upfront payment plus $15 million in exchange for a convertible promissory note issued to Novartis under the Dec 2016 agreement.NASH is an increasingly common, progressive form of fatty-liver disease which is becoming a significant and growing health issue given the rising obesity epidemic. With no treatments currently approved for this disease, the market opportunity is significant. Several companies are working on developing treatments for NASH -- the market could be worth billions of dollars and many companies are hoping to cash in on this opportunity.Data readouts from the emricasan phase IIb clinical development program are expected in the first half of 2018.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 1.8% over the last five trading sessions.

In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents. The company has a mixed earnings surprise history with two beats and a miss in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.3%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Stericycle is focused on increasing its SQ customer base, as it generates higher gross margins than the LQ customers. In addition, Stericycle offers multiple service offerings to its customers, which add to the value of each account. For its SQ customers, the services include Steri-Safe and clinical compliance offerings and for LQ customers services comprise Bio Systems and Rx Waste Compliance. The company earlier inked a definitive agreement to acquire information destruction services provider, Shred-it International for $2.3 billion in cash. With Shred-it on board, Stericycle is expected to enhance its core compliance solutions portfolio and offer specialized services, thereby augmenting its value proposition to clients. These efforts are likely to improve the company's profitability.A significant portion of Stericycle's historical growth was due to the successful integration of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will grow its market share and expand its geographic base. The acquisition pool of the company remains robust in multiple geographies and lines of business. International growth rates are expected to accelerate due to increasing customer adoption of multiple services and expansion into new lines of business. The global acquisition strategy increases Stericycle's customer base by providing a long-term growth platform for selling multiple services. Whether the customer is a large hospital system or a retail chain, Stericycle provides multiple services to help them improve their operations and achieve their goals. As customers adopt these multiple services, they can almost triple their revenues going forward.However, Stericycle operates in a highly-competitive market. The barriers to entry into the regulated waste collection and disposal business and the pharmaceutical returns business are very low. Competitors may also resort to aggressive pricing to gain market share. In the past, the company was forced to reduce prices for LQ customers due to competitive pressures, which could be repeated in the future. This forces us to be bearish on the stock to some extent.High operating costs continue to be a headwind for Stericycle. In addition, a challenging macroeconomic environment and volatility in foreign exchange are affecting margins and the bottom line.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Stericycle is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Stericycle has an Earnings ESP -0.96%. This is because Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.03 and Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.04. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  Stericycle has a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.Note, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +20% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Incyte and partner Lilly were in for a major disappointment with the FDA issuing a CRL for their experimental RA treatment, baricitinib. The agency told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA, in its current form. What is concerning is that the agency has asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms. This means delayed approval timelines and additional costs depending on the studies that may need to be conducted. Lilly and Incyte said that they were not in agreement with the FDA and the timing for resubmission would be based on further discussions with the agency.We note that baricitinib was approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant in Feb 2017. Incyte's shares were down on the CRL. The company is evaluating the impact of the CRL on its previously-issued milestone and R&D expense guidance for 2017 and will provide an update on its first quarter call to be held on May 4 (Read more:  ). There seems to be no end to OncoMed's woes with the company now reporting disappointing top-line data on yet another pipeline candidate. The company announced that its experimental lung-cancer treatment, tarextumab, failed to meet the primary endpoint or secondary endpoints in a mid-stage study. The company also announced its intention to discontinue patient enrolment in a phase Ib study evaluating brontictuzumab plus Lonsurf in third-line colorectal cancer patients as the combination of brontictuzumab plus chemotherapy was not tolerable in this patient population. Shares were down on the news and hit a new 52-week low.The latest setbacks come just a week after the company announced demcizumab's failure in a mid-stage study in treatment-na\u00efve metastatic pancreatic cancer patients and Bayer Pharma's decision to not exercise its option to license OncoMed's Wnt pathway inhibitors vantictumab and ipafricept for strategic reasons (Read more:  ). Not surprisingly, OncoMed said that it intends to conduct a comprehensive portfolio prioritization review.So far in 2017, OncoMed's shares are down 49.9%, significantly lagging the Zacks-categorized  industry which is up 3% year-to-date YTD). Biogen  , which is looking to strengthen its Alzheimer's disease (AD) pipeline, announced a licensing agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb for exclusive rights to BMS-986168, an anti-tau candidate. BMS-986168 is phase II-ready with potential in AD as well as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Biogen's AD pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau and anti-amyloid candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor program (Read more:  ). BioMarin  entered into a settlement agreement with Par Pharmaceutical related to a patent infringement lawsuit for BioMarin's phenylketonuria (PKU) drug, Kuvan (tablets and powder). With this agreement, Kuvan should not face generic competition from Par until Oct 1, 2020. The company had earlier entered into a settlement agreement with Dr. Reddy's for Kuvan tablets in Sep 2015. The settlement agreement removes an overhang on the shares -- Kuvan brought in sales of $348 million in 2016 and is expected to generate sales in the range of $380 - $410 million in 2017. Ionis  is reaching out to the highly lucrative Chinese pharma market through a collaboration with Suzhou Ribo Life Science Co., Ltd. The licensing deal is focused on the development and commercialization of RNA-targeted therapeutics in China. Under the agreement, Ribo will get to commercialize two Ionis Generation 2+ antisense drugs in metabolic disease and cancer as well as an option to license a third pre-specified Generation 2+ antisense drug in China. Moreover, Ribo will be responsible for conducting a multi-year research and drug discovery program to identify drugs that utilize Ionis' ssRNAi technology.

Shares have lost nearly 8% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.BioMarin reported earnings of $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2017 (including stock-based compensation expense), significantly better than the year-ago loss of $0.36 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.30 per share. Strong product sales and lower R&D costs pulled up profits in the quarter.Total revenue came in at $304 million in the quarter, up 28% from the year-ago quarter. The top line was aided by strong net product sales. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $292 million by 3.9%. Fx did not have any significant effect in sales in the quarterVimizim contributed $106 million to total revenue, up 45% year over year and 13% sequentially attributable to the 31% growth in new patients on Vimizim therapy.The company expects continued growth in 2017 as the franchise continues to benefit from robust underlying patient demand.Kuvan revenues rose 19% to $92 million, reflecting patient growth in North America and the completion of the transition of the ex-North American territories acquired in 2016. The number of patients on Kuvan therapy in North America increased by 8% in the first quarter.Naglazyme sales rose 25% year over year to $81 million benefitting from forward purchases from the Middle East markets and booking an order from Brazil in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the absence of the same in the first quarter of 2016. The drug continued to witness steady patient growth with the number of commercial patients increasing 9% in the quarter.Naglazyme and Vimzim revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from Latin America.Though the company booked orders for each of Vimizim and Naglazyme in Q1 from Brazil, it still warned about inconsistent order patterns likely to persist from Brazil in 2017.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties - totaling $19 million (up 19%) - from Sanofi's Genzyme in the quarter.Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 8.6% to $127.0 million (excluding stock-based compensation expense) owning to the discontinuance of the Kyndrisa and reveglucosidase alfa programs last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 15.5% to $97.0 million (excluding stock-based compensation expense).At the end of the first quarter, BioMarin had $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments.The company re-affirmed its previously issued 2017 sales and earnings guidance.BioMarin expects a total revenue in the range of $1.25 \u2212$1.30 billion, representing double-digit revenue growth. The revenue guidance assumes the launch of Brineura in 2017.Vimizim sales are expected in the range of $400-$430 million while Kuvan sales are projected in the range of $380\u2212$410 million, representing an increase of about 14% over 2016 at the mid-point. Naglazyme sales are projected in the range of $300\u2212$330 million.R&D expenses are expected within $620-$650 million while SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $520-$550 million.Due to the ramp up of BMN 270 and vosoritide programs and the Brineura launch and pegvaliase pre-commercialization activities, the company expects R&D and SG&A spending to increase in the later quarters of the year which will result in lower profits. At the call, the company mentioned that it expects to bring a new product candidate into clinical development in 2017.Adjusted earnings are expected to turn positive. The company expects an adjusted net income of $30 - $70 million in 2017. Meanwhile, management is committed to continued profitability improvements over the longer term.Analysts were quiet during the last one month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions. | At this time, BioMarin's stock has a subpar Growth score of 'D' on both growth and the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of 'F' on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of 'F'.

Cystic fibrosis focused Vertex also topped earnings and revenue expectations (Read more:  ).Amgen's shares were down after the earnings report mainly due to concerns regarding the slowdown in sales of legacy brands as well as Enbrel's performance. Meanwhile, Gilead topped earnings estimates but missed on sales with hepatitis C virus (HCV) market dynamics once again weighing on the company's performance. Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see  . Sunesis'  shares plunged on news that the company will be withdrawing its European Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for vosaroxin as a treatment for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients aged 60 years and above. The company's decision was based on interactions with the European Medicine Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) -- although a CHMP opinion was not provided, the company learned that the committee was likely to formally adopt a negative opinion for the MAA.We note that the company had faced a similar setback for vosaroxin in the U.S. in Jul 2015 when Sunesis was informed by the FDA that it did not support a filing and encouraged the company to provide additional clinical evidence to support a future regulatory submission.With vosaroxin facing a similar fate in the EU, Sunesis has decided to significantly cut down its investment in the AML program and shift more of its resources to its kinase inhibitor pipeline. Sunesis, however, has not given up totally on vosaroxin -- the company said the development of vosaroxin will continue through a modest investment in investigator-sponsored group studies though it will carefully evaluate business development alternatives before another pivotal study is conducted to support regulatory approval of the drug.Year-to-date, Sunesis has underperformed the Zacks-categorized  industry with shares declining 18% compared to the industry gain of 5.5%. Regeneron  and partner Sanofi announced that their BLA resubmission for their experimental rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Kevzara (sarilumab) has been accepted for review by the FDA with a response now expected on May 22, 2017. The companies had got a complete response letter (CRL) for the IL-6R antibody in Oct 2016 with the agency citing certain deficiencies observed during a routine good manufacturing practice inspection of the Sanofi Le Trait facility in France where sarilumab is filled and finished. bluebird bio  announced a couple of licensing agreements for its proprietary lentiviral vector platform -- one with Glaxo and the other with Novartis. Under the Glaxo deal, the company will non-exclusively license certain bluebird patent rights related to lentiviral vector technology for the development and commercialization of gene therapies for two rare genetic diseases -- Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome and metachromatic leukodystrophy. The Novartis deal also provides the company with a non-exclusive license to certain bluebird patent rights related to lentiviral vector technology for the development and commercialization of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapies for oncology, including CTL019, Novartis's anti-CD19 CAR T investigational therapy.Financial terms for both deals include an upfront payment to bluebird as well as milestone and royalty payments.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was up slightly (0.9%) over the last five trading sessions.

It sold its first one for $67.5 million a few years ago, so naturally an analyst asked about what the company was going to do with this one. But Jean-Jacques Bienaime, BioMarin's chairman and CEO, played it close to the vest, presumably to not tip off potential buyers about how much value BioMarin places on using the voucher for one of its own drugs:Management stuck by its 2017 revenue guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, and the company thinks bottom-line earnings will also hit their mark with a profit of $30 million to $70 million on an adjusted basis.On the pipeline front, the FDA marketing application for pegvaliase should be submitted by the end of the quarter, setting up a potential approval late this year or next year depending on whether the drug gets a priority review.

Higher gross margins from net product sales and lower R&D costs pulled up profits in the quarter.Total revenue came in at $304 million in the quarter, up 28% from the year-ago quarter. The top line was aided by strong net product sales. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $292 million by 3.9%Shares of BioMarin were up more than 2% in after-market hours on Thursday in response to the strong financial results. In fact, so far this year, BioMarin's shares are up 18.1%, which compares favorably with an increase of 4.7% registered by the Zacks classified  industry during this period.Vimizim contributed $106 million to total revenue, up 45% year over year and 13% sequentially attributable to 31% growth in new patients on Vimizim therapy.The company expects continued growth in 2017 as the franchise continues to benefit from robust underlying patient demand.Kuvan revenues rose 19% to $92 million, reflecting patient growth in North America and the addition of new patients in the international markets.Naglazyme sales rose 25% year over year to $81 million. Naglazyme revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from Latin America. Nevertheless, the drug continued to witness steady patient growth with the number of commercial patients increasing 9% in the quarter.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties - totaling $19 million (up 19%) - from Sanofi's  Genzyme in the quarter.Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 8.6% to $127.0 million (excluding stock-based compensation expense) owning to the discontinuance of the Kyndrisa and reveglucosidase alfa programs last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 15.5% to $97.0 million (excluding stock-based compensation expense).Last month, BioMarin announced that it has received approval from the FDA for Brineura for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease, which is a form of Batten disease. With this approval, Brineura is now the first approved treatment for children with CLN2. The company has begun the commercial launch of Brineura in the U.S.Brineura is also under review in the EU, where a decision should be out by the second quarter of 2017. Last month, BioMarin received positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommending approval of Brineura in EU.Last month, BioMarin entered into a settlement agreement with Par Pharmaceutical, subsidiary of Endo International plc  related to a patent infringement lawsuit for Kuvan (tablets and powder). With this agreement, Kuvan should not face generic competition from Par until Oct 1, 2020. The company had earlier entered into a settlement agreement with Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited  for Kuvan tablets in Sep 2015. The settlement agreement removes an overhang on the shares.BioMarin has a robust pipeline with several data readouts lined up for the coming quarters. The most important candidate in its pipeline is vosoritide, which is currently in a phase III study for the treatment of children with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism. This will be followed by an open-label extension study with the lower dose (15 \u00b5g/kg/day). In addition, BioMarin is planning a separate phase II study to evaluate the effect of vosoritide in infants and toddlers.The company plans to submit a regulatory application to the FDA for another important pipeline candidate, pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria in the second quarter of 2017.The company re-affirmed its previously issued 2017 sales and earnings guidance.BioMarin expects total revenue in the range of $1.25 \u2212$1.30 billion, representing double-digit revenue growth. The revenue guidance assumes the launch of Brineura in 2017. Vimizim sales are expected in the range of $400-$430 million while Kuvan sales are projected in the range of $380\u2212$410 million, representing an increase of about 14% over 2016 at the mid-point. Naglazyme sales are projected in the range of $300\u2212$330 million.R&D expenses are expected within $620-$650 million while SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $520-$550 million.Adjusted earnings are expected to turn positive. The company expects adjusted net income of $30 - $70 million in 2017.

While focus remained on Biogen's results, companies like Gilead  were also in the news on the presentation of pipeline data. Biogen's shares were up 3.6% on strong first quarter results with both revenues and earnings surpassing expectations. Recently launched Spinraza (spinal muscular atrophy) is off to a promising start with the company working on expanding access to all patients. Spinraza got a positive opinion in Europe this week -- Biogen is working on pre-launch activities and intends to file for approval in at least 10 additional countries this year. On the Alzheimer's disease front, Biogen said that it expects both the ENGAGE and EMERGE studies on aducanumab to be 50% enrolled by mid-May (Read more:  ). Biogen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see  . Regeneron  and partner Sanofi are facing a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Amgen's  Immunex Corporation related to their recently approved eczema treatment, Dupixent. We note that Sanofi and Regeneron had already filed a lawsuit prior to the approval of Dupixent seeking a court order that their drug does not infringe a patent held by Amgen. The lawsuit was a proactive move by the companies to prevent Amgen from initiating a patent infringement lawsuit like it had related to Sanofi and Regeneron's PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent. We note that the FDA recently gave its nod for a once-monthly formulation of Praluent.The companies also announced that they got a positive opinion from the European Medicine Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for the approval of their experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug, Kevzara (sarilumab). A final decision regarding approvability should be out in the coming months. Gilead presented promising data from an open-label, proof-of-concept study evaluating GS-0976, an investigational inhibitor of ACC, in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Although a small study, the data showed statistically significant improvements in liver fat content and noninvasive markers of fibrosis. The candidate is currently in a mid-stage, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.Gilead is among the many companies developing treatments for NASH. The company is currently planning or conducting mid- as well as late-stage studies evaluating single-agent and combination therapy approaches against multiple core pathways associated with NASH. NASH is an increasingly common, progressive form of fatty-liver disease which is becoming a significant and growing health issue given the rising obesity epidemic. With no treatments currently approved for this disease, the market opportunity is significant. Amgen expanded its commercial collaboration with Novartis for experimental migraine drug, erenumab. The companies' initial collaboration dates back to 2015 covering Alzheimer's disease and migraine. The companies have now agreed to combine capabilities to co-commercialize erenumab in the U.S. while Amgen retains exclusive commercialization rights in Japan. Novartis, which retains its existing commercialization rights in rest of the world, gains exclusive rights to commercialize erenumab in Canada under the expanded deal. Amgen and Novartis hope to file for approval in the second quarter of 2017. Achillion's shares touched a 52-week low on the presentation of additional phase II data on its experimental hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, JNJ-4178. Updated results from the ongoing study were presented at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2017 International Liver Congress.Although data showed that JNJ-4178, a three-drug combination of simeprevir, odalasvir and AL-335, was highly effective in treatment na\u00efve patients with HCV genotype 1 infection without cirrhosis, results for the three-drug regimen in HCV genotype 3 patients without cirrhosis were not promising enough to warrant continued development for this category. The regimen will be investigated further for HCV genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Meanwhile, a two-drug regimen of odalasvir and AL-335 will also not be moving forward in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis.

Even so, it can be tricky to identify which stocks can truly stand the test of time.With this question in mind, we asked three of our contributors which stocks they recommend to buy and hold for the next 20 years. They suggested  (NASDAQ: BMRN) ,  (NYSE: EPD) , and  (NYSE: LMT) . Below, they discuss why they chose these particular stocks, and why investors with a long-term outlook may want to consider adding them to their portfolios right now.Image source: Getty Images. Despite the political blowback over the jaw-dropping prices of some of the newly approved medicines for rare diseases, the orphan drug market, as a whole, is on solid ground from a growth standpoint. In fact, EvaluatePharma's latest industry report has orphan drugs grabbing over 20% of the total prescription drug market by 2022. So, it's probably a good idea to add a top orphan drugmaker like BioMarin to your portfolio for the long haul.I think BioMarin is an especially strong pick in the orphan drug space because it already has five products on the market, and could add a sixth before the end of this month. Specifically, the FDA is expected to announce its decision on BioMarin's experimental CLN2 disease drug, Brineura, by  . CLN2 disease is a form of the rare but deadly childhood ailment known as Batten disease, and characterized by visual problems and seizures, among other symptoms.Although the drug's commercial opportunity is tough to nail down because of the rarity of the condition and the fact that orphan drug prices have been all over the map lately, it should add at least several hundred million to BioMarin's top line within a few short years if approved. As a prime example, some analysts are already forecasting BioMarin's top line to grow by as much as 16% next year if Brineura does get a green light from the FDA this month.So while BioMarin isn't exactly cheap with a price-to-sales ratio of 13.34, this company is operating within one of the fastest-growing segments of the pharma industry, and it has a proven track record of bringing innovative new medicines to market. I have been a unit holder in Enterprise Products Partners for a decade already and hope to continue holding it for at least the next 20 years. One reason I've stuck with the pipeline and processing company for so long is due to the stability of its business, which yields steady results in good times and in bad. Driving that stability is a focus on operating fee-based assets, which often deliver relatively consistent cash flow for decades. That's why the company has been able to increase its payout 59 times since going public nearly 20 years ago, including the past 50 consecutive quarters.There's a real good chance Enterprise Products Partners keeps that streak alive for at least the next several years. Fueling that growth will be the $7.1 billion of expansion projects it currently has in the backlog, which should enter service through 2019. In addition to that, the company has several other projects under development that should keep it growing well into the early 2020s.Enterprise Products Partners should have no shortage of opportunities to continue expanding well beyond its current pipeline. That's because global energy demand is expected to keep growing through 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. Furthermore, the IEA sees natural gas demand, in particular, growing at a healthy rate, pushing the cleaner-burning fuel past coal as the global energy champion. That bodes well for the gas-focused Enterprise, which should have ample opportunity to build and buy additional infrastructure assets to support this growth in the decades ahead. That's why this is one company I'd have no problem holding for a couple more decades. I've said it before and I'll say it again: If you want a stock to buy and hold for the next 20 years (  , or even  ), look no further than Lockheed Martin.The king of military contracting, Lockheed Martin is the largest pure-play defense contractor in the United States, bar none. Lockheed builds the world's  , the world's most popular  , too, and -- since the acquisition of Sikorsky and its Black Hawk line -- even  .But that's just the start of the story. Lockheed Martin is also one of two primary shipbuilders producing the U.S. Navy's line of Littoral Combat Ships, and a force to be reckoned with in laser technology. (Oh, and did I mention Lockheed Martin also builds space ships? This is the dictionary definition of a stock with a future.)Now I admit that picking the right time to buy Lockheed Martin stock may be a little tricky. Priced north of 15 times earnings, but with a projected earnings growth rate of just 9%, the stock is not an obvious bargain today. Lockheed Martin's price-to-sales ratio, currently at 1.65, also sits significantly above its long-term average. At some point in the next few years, that ratio will have to revert to something closer to its norm, and probably through a steep decline in stock price.Keep an eye out for when that decline arrives, however. Because that will be your cue to buy Lockheed Martin stock -- and hold it for the next 20 years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Overall, Agios has an average positive surprise of 0.59%.In the last reported quarter, the company posted a positive surprise of 13.55%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter. | Agios, a development-stage biopharmaceutical company, is focused on the formulation of treatments for cancer and rare genetic metabolic disorders. As a development-stage company, Agios does not have approved products in its portfolio yet. Investors are thus expected to keep an eye on pipeline updates at the .In this regard it is worth mentioning that the company has several interesting candidates in its pipeline. Its cancer pipeline comprises enasidenib (IDH2 mutant inhibitor), AG-120 (IDH1 mutant inhibitor) and AG-881 (pan-IDH mutant inhibitor). We note that Agios is developing enasidenib and AG-881 in collaboration with Celgene Corporation  , which should bring in collaboration revenues.Moreover, during the quarter (ended Mar 2017) Agios announced that the FDA has accepted its new drug application (NDA) for enasidenib for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. Also, FDA granted priority review to the NDA with PDUFA date of Aug 30, 2017.Meanwhile, enasidenib is being evaluated in several phase I dose-escalation studies evaluating both hematological and solid tumor cancers with IDH2 mutations. Agios and Celgene intend to initiate a high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome study on enasidenib in 2017.Agios is also planning to initiate a phase III study evaluating AG-120 in front-line AML patients with an IDH1 mutation in the first half of 2017. The company plans to explore a similar regulatory path for AG-120, which could lead to an NDA submission in the U.S. in 2017.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Agios is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

Anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, is under priority review for use in combination with chemotherapy for the first line treatment of a specific type of lung cancer with a response expected by May 10, 2017. Approval for this patient population would be a major boost for Merck given the commercial potential in this market. Keytruda is already approved for first-line use in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients that have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%. Label expansion into the new indication would open up the non-squamous lung market and cover patients irrespective of PD-L1 expression.

Similarly, BMRN has 29.23% upside from the recent share price of $87.78 if the average analyst target price of $113.44/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ACAD to reach a target price of $43.67/share, which is 27.01% above the recent price of $34.38. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ENDP, BMRN, and ACAD:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n  \nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is expected to report fourth-quarter 2016 results this month. The company incurred wider-than-expected loss in the last quarter.In the last one year, Inovio's shares have underperformed the Zacks classified  industry. Specifically, the company's stock lost 8.1% during the period, while the industry recorded a decrease of 2.6%.Inovio's performance has been mixed so far. The company beat expectations in one of the last four quarters, posted in-line results in one and missed estimates in the other quarter. The average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 3.23%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Given that Inovio does not have any revenue-generating product in its portfolio yet, investor focus will remain on pipeline and regulatory updates.VGX-3100 is the most advanced candidate in the company's pipeline. In Oct 2016, Inovio suffered a setback with the FDA placing a clinical hold on its late-stage program for VGX-3100. The company was looking to move VGX-3100 into phase III development in the fourth quarter. However, with the clinical hold in place, it now expects the program to be delayed until the first half of 2017, pending resolution of the FDA's requests.At the third-quarter earnings update, Inovio had said that it is looking to evaluate VGX-3100 for the treatment of HPV-16/18-related high grade cervical dysplasia. The FDA has asked the company to provide additional data to support the shelf-life of the newly designed and manufactured disposable parts of the Cellectra 5PSP immunotherapy delivery device.Apart from VGX-3100, Inovio has several other candidates in its pipeline in early- to mid-stage development. Meanwhile, the company is working on the development of Ebola, Zika and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus vaccines. In August, Inovio announced that it has initiated the second study on Zika vaccine, GLS-5700, in Puerto Rico. In Dec 2016, the company announced positive results from the study which demonstrated Zika antigen-specific antibody responses after one or two vaccinations. The vaccine was well tolerated with no significant safety concerns noted at week 14. This will allow Inovio to meet regulators in 2017 to determine the path forward for the Zika vaccine.Inovio has collaborations with several companies and institutes for the development of its pipeline candidates. With no approved product in its portfolio, Inovio depends largely on collaborations, grants and other payments for revenues as well as for the development of its pipeline candidates. Therefore, the top line of the company varies on a quarterly basis depending on the timing of such events.Investor focus should remain on pipeline updates as many such events are lined up along with the company's plans related to the development of its Ebola and Zika vaccines.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Inovio is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.

However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that this have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter.AbbVie Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.79% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Last quarter, the company's loss was wider than expected.Year to date, BioDelivery's shares have outperformed the Zacks classified  industry. Specifically, the stock gained 17.1% during the period, while the industry recorded an increase of 10.3%.BioDelivery's recent performance has been disappointing as it missed expectations in two of the last four quarters and met in the other two. The average negative earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 19.76%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.BioDelivery's key products include Belbuca (chronic pain) and Bunavail (opioid-dependence).Bunavail's sales performance have been lackluster so far. BioDelivery reduced spending on the drug. BioDelivery therefore cut the size of its sales force. It has reduced the number of sales territories and is focusing on the most growth-oriented territories. In the third quarter, BioDelivery completed the sales force restructuring. Current sales force now covers 85% of the overall market.Nonetheless, BioDelivery is working on improving Bunavail's performance. Apart from restructuring Bunavail's sales territories, the company is working on securing new or improved positioning on other managed care contracts either on an exclusive or preferred status. BioDelivery is also running a highly targeted Bunavail-focused, direct-to-patient digital advertising campaign in four cities. With a reduced cost structure combined with growth opportunities, BioDelivery expects Bunavail to reach profitability by the end of 2017.Meanwhile Belbuca's start has been slower than expected due to pain market pressures. The company launched Belbuca in U.S. in Feb 2016.Meanwhile, in the quarter, BioDelivery announced that its phase IIb clinical study assessing the efficacy and safety of Clonidine Topical Gel for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy failed to show a statistically significant difference in pain relief between clonidine topical gel and placebo. As a result, is BioDelivery discontinued further development of the product. We expect the company to shed light on the issue at the conference call.Our proven model does not conclusively show that BioDelivery is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.

Some might say that April brings April showers. Others eyeing the calendar with dread might say that April brings tax day.But for four drugmakers, April brings big news that could be catalysts for their stocks. Here's what's coming up this month for  (NASDAQ: NBIX) ,  (NASDAQ: INCY) ,  (NYSE: LLY) , and  (NASDAQ: BMRN) .Image source: Getty Images.Neurocrine Biosciences doesn't have an approved product yet. That could change within a matter of days. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is scheduled to make its decision on whether to approve Ingrezza for treating tardive dyskinesia by April 11.The timeline for Ingrezza is accelerated because the experimental drug received the FDA's priority review designation. This designation was granted because tardive dyskinesia, a disorder in which individuals have involuntary, repetitive movements of the face, trunk, or extremities, has no approved FDA treatment.Neurocrine experienced a disappointment with Ingrezza earlier this year when the drug failed to meet the primary endpoint in a phase 2 clinical study targeting adults with Tourette syndrome. The biotech has another phase 2 study under way evaluating Ingrezza in treating pediatric Tourette syndrome.Lilly and Incyte had hoped to already know the fate for experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib. The FDA was originally scheduled to make its decision in January 2017. However, that date was pushed back by three months to give the agency additional time to review more data. The FDA should announce the verdict for baricitinib by April 14.Does the delay hint at problems? Not necessarily. Baricitinib looked great in late-stage clinical studies, even beating top-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira in a head-to-head comparison. Also, the drug already won European approval in February.Incyte initially developed baricitinib but licensed the JAK inhibitor to Lilly in 2009. The two companies are also evaluating baricitinib in treating three other autoimmune diseases: psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.BioMarin already has five approved drugs on the market for treating rare diseases. The biotech hopes to soon add another drug for treating another rare disease. The FDA is scheduled to announce its decision for Brineura in treating CLN2 disease by April 27.CLN2 disease is a form of Batten disease. Symptoms typically show up in children between the ages of 2 and 4, and include language delay and seizures, followed by movement disorders, motor deterioration, dementia, and blindness. Most patients die between the ages of 10 and 16. There is no approved treatment for CLN2 disease currently.Late-stage study results showed significant improvement in the rate of clinical decline for children receiving Brineura. Even incremental improvement can mean the difference between children being able to walk and talk -- or not. It's impossible to know for sure what the FDA will do, but I expect there would be a firestorm from Batten disease patient advocates if the agency doesn't approve Brineura.Approval for baricitinib would be welcomed by Lilly's and Incyte's shareholders. I wouldn't expect to see tremendous jumps in either stock, though. BioMarin's share price would likely get a nice bump if Brineura wins approval, though.But the biggest boost of all would probably go to Neurocrine if Ingrezza wins approval. The transition from clinical-stage biotech to a company in position to actually generate product sales is huge. If April brings good news from the FDA, it could also bring sizable returns for Neurocrine investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It also enjoys Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy status in the U.S. for the treatment of LEMS. However, Firdapse is not yet approved in the U.S. In 2016, the company had received a refusal to file letter from the FDA in connection with the NDA for Firdapse. The agency had determined that the company's NDA was insufficient after a preliminary review. Consequently, Catalyst is required to conduct additional studies as per the agency's requirements.The company is conducting a second phase III study (LMS-003) on Firdapse for LEMS (LMS-003) in order to gain approval in the U.S. It reached an agreement with the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for protocol design, clinical endpoints and statistical analysis in Oct 2016. Top-line data from the study is anticipated in the second half of 2017. A positive outcome from the study is expected to allow the company to resubmit the new drug application (NDA) for Firdapse for the treatment of LEMS in the second half of 2017. Moving ahead, we believe that this approval will give a huge boost to the company.Furthermore, Catalyst is working on developing Firdapse for additional indications. It is conducting an investigator-sponsored phase II/III study on Firdapse for the symptomatic treatment of MuSK-antibody positive MG. In Mar 2017, the company reported top-line data from the phase II/III trial that showed statistically significant results. According to the investigators, this showed a large clinical benefit to patients. Catalyst's efforts to develop Firdapse appear encouraging given the significant commercial potential in the target markets.In addition, the company has an early-stage candidate, CPP-115 (infantile spasms and other neurological indications), in its pipeline. Further, it is also working on a generic version of Sabril (vigabatrin), which is marketed by Lundbeck Inc.in the U.S. for the treatment of infantile spasms and complex partial seizures.However, the number of candidates in Catalyst's pipeline is limited. In fact, the company is highly dependent on Firdapse for growth and therefore its U.S. approval is important for the company's success. Any further delays might prove be detrimental to the company's growth prospects.Also, Catalyst is looking to develop CPP-115 for the treatment of epilepsy. We note that the market for epilepsy treatments is highly competitive and crowded, with products like Pfizer Inc.'s  Neurontin and Lyrica, Johnson & Johnson's  Topamax, UCB's Keppra, AbbVie's Depakote and Novartis' Trileptal. | Catalyst currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Key approvals this year include Roche's  multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron  and Sanofi's eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro's  PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and Amgen's Parsabiv (treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis) among others. Some of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of April. , which holds a strong position in the rare disease market, has an important regulatory date coming up later this month with the FDA expected to decide on the approval status of Brineura. BioMarin is looking to get Brineura approved for the treatment of CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease. The PDUFA date for Brineura was extended by the FDA in Sep 2016 by three months to Apr 27, 2017 following the submission of updated efficacy data cut from an ongoing extension study. There are no approved treatments for this rapidly progressing, fatal neurodegenerative disease -- BioMarin estimates the incidence of CLN2 disease in its commercial territories to be approximately 1,200 - 1,600 children.Year-to-date (YTD) BioMarin, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has outperformed the Zacks-categorized  industry with shares gaining 6% compared to the industry gain of almost 4%. also has a FDA action date coming up this month with the agency expected to decide on the approval status of the company's investigational oral ALK inhibitor, brigatinib. Brigatinib became a part of Takeda's pipeline following the Feb 2017 acquisition of ARIAD. Brigatinib is under FDA review for ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a response expected by Apr 29, 2017. Brigatinib has blockbuster potential.Takeda has performed better than the Zacks categorized  industry YTD with the company gaining 13.7% compared to the industry gain of 2.5%.Swiss pharma giant,  is looking to expand the label of its first cancer immunotherapy Tecentriq for an additional type of advanced bladder cancer. Tecentriq, which gained FDA approval last year, is under review for the treatment (first-line as well as in patients whose disease has progressed at least 12 months after receiving chemotherapy before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant)) of people with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy.

Olumiant gained approval in the EU in Feb 2017 making it the first JAK inhibitor to be approved to treat RA in the EU. However, Olumiant has been facing a delay in the U.S. with the PDUFA date being extended by the agency following the submission of additional data analyses by Lilly in response to the FDA's information requests. The FDA extended the action date by 3 months and a response could be out this month.Both Lilly and Incyte are Zacks Rank #3 stocks.

Kite, which reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter, saw its shares shoot up on positive topline data from a key study on its investigational CAR-T therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel. Results from the primary analysis of the study in patients with chemorefractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) showed that 41% of patients achieved a response including 36% who were in complete response (CR) at month 6. Kite said that the median overall survival (OS) has not been reached yet. The key takeaway from the data was the durability of response compared to data presented for month 3.Kite expects to finish submitting its rolling BLA for axicabtagene ciloleucel in aggressive NHL by the end of this quarter while the EU application will be submitted this year. According to the company, the recently released data indicates that more than a third of patients with refractory aggressive NHL could be cured after a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel.Kite's shares were up 24.5% on the data. Year to date (YTD), the company has outperformed the Zacks-categorized  industry with shares shooting up 57.6% compared to the industry gain of 8.6%. Several companies like BioMarin, The Medicines Co., Sarepta and Exelixis  reported fourth quarter results over the last few days. Both Exelixis (Read more:  ) and BioMarin (Read more:  ) topped estimates. Sarepta's loss was narrower-than-expected while revenues were in line with expectations. However, the company's revenue guidance fell short of expectations. Exelixis entered into a couple of clinical trial collaborations with Roche and Bristol-Myers. While the Roche collaboration will see the companies evaluating Exelixis' TKI, Cabometyx, with Roche's anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, atezolizumab, in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, the Bristol-Myers deal will see the companies evaluating Cabometyx plus Bristol-Myers' PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo alone or in combination with Yervoy in first-line renal cell carcinoma. There could be additional studies in bladder cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. With these deals, Exelixis is looking to expand the Cabometyx franchise through immuno-oncology (IO) combinations. Amgen  announced data from the head-to-head ENDEAVOR study which showed that patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma lived 7.6 months longer when treated with Amgen's Kyprolis and dexamethasone compared to those treated with Velcade and dexamethasone. While Kyprolis is already approved for this patient population, this overall survival data should help drive usage and boost sales. Kyprolis is one of the key products in Amgen's portfolio that is expected to drive long term growth. The product brought in sales of $692 million in 2016. The multiple myeloma market is a growing but highly competitive market given the presence of new treatment options. Celgene's  key revenue generator, Revlimid, can now be used in the EU as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The label expansion makes Revlimid the first and only licensed maintenance treatment available for this patient population. The U.S. label for this patient population was expanded last week. Label expansion into this indication will be a significant driver of Revlimid sales. Revlimid sales, which came in at $6.974 billion in 2016, are expected in the range of $8 - $8.3 billion in 2017. Celgene is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see  .The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was up 1.5% over the last five trading sessions.

Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 16.67%. The company beat expectations in all of the last four quarters with average positive earnings surprise of 10.42%.Catalyst's share price has increased 7.6% year to date, in line with the Zacks classified  industry gain.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Given that Catalyst does not have any revenue-generating product in its portfolio yet, investor focus will remain on pipeline and regulatory updates. At present, Catalyst has three candidates under development - Firdapse, CPP-115 and CPP-109.Its lead pipeline candidate Firdapse is being evaluated for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). However, the company was handed a \"refusal-to-file\" letter from the FDA in Feb 2016 in connection with its New Drug Application (NDA) for the product. The agency determined that the company's NDA was insufficient after a preliminary review.In June, Catalyst reached an agreement with the FDA for a confirmatory phase III study protocol on Firdapse. In October, Catalyst received a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) from the FDA on the protocol of the confirmatory phase III study. It was determined that the confirmatory study will have the same co-primary endpoints as Catalyst's first phase III trial evaluating Firdapse for the treatment of LEMS and not a cross-over design as management previously expected. Catalyst is also working on developing Firdapse for additional indications. The company is evaluating it for the treatment of certain types of congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) and for a specific type of myasthenia gravis (MG). The company initiated an investigator-sponsored phase II/III study on Firdapse for the symptomatic treatment of MuSK-antibody positive MG (MuSK-MG) in Feb 2016 and top-line results from this study are expected in first half of 2017. Positive data would allow the company to add the CMS indication to Firdapse's label (either as part of the NDA resubmission for Firdapse for LEMS or as a supplement to the resubmission).Apart from Firdapse, the company is looking to develop CPP-115 for the treatment of epilepsy (initially infantile spasms), and other selected neurological indications such as complex partial seizures and Tourette's disorder. Catalyst is also working on a generic version of Sabril (vigabatrin), which is marketed by Lundbeck, for the treatment of infantile spasms and complex partial seizures.Consequently, its R&D spending is expected to go up due to clinical development efforts taken toward Firdapse in the pediatric CMS population and MuSK-MG.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Catalystis likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 7 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Catalyst's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +50% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Shares have lost about 2.2% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.BioMarin reported a loss of $0.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 (including stock-based compensation expense), narrower than the year-ago loss of $0.57 as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.39 per share.Total revenue came in at $300 million in the quarter, up 32% from the year-ago quarter. The top line was aided by strong net product sales. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $297 million by 1%.Vimizim contributed $94 million to total revenue, up 59% year over year and 16% sequentially attributable to growth in new patients on Vimizim therapy.In 2016, Vimizim patients on commercial therapy grew 40%, backed by further penetration in existing markets and addition of eight new markets. The company expects continued growth in 2017 as the franchise continues to benefit from robust underlying patient demand.Last quarter, the company witnessed risk associated with order patterns in Brazil and Turkey. At the fourth quarter conference call, management said that though risks remain in Brazil, the company expects conditions in Turkey to stabilize.Kuvan revenues soared 38% to $90 million, reflecting strong contribution from North America and the addition of new patients in the international markets. The number of patients on Kuvan therapy in North America increased by 15% in the fourth quarter.Naglazyme sales rose 25% year over year to $75 million. Naglazyme revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from Latin America. Nevertheless, the drug continued to witness steady patient growth in 2016 with the number of commercial patients increasing 9% in the year.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties - totalling $35 million (down 10%) - from Sanofi's Genzyme in the fourth quarter.Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 3.8% to $152.0 million (excluding stock-based compensation expense) while selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 25.5% to $118.0 million (excluding stock-based compensation expense).Full-year sales improved 26% to $1.12 million, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also within the guidance range of $1.10\u2212$1.15 billion.Adjusted loss per share was $1.03 in 2016, narrower than the year-ago loss of $1.61 per share.BioMarin expects total revenue in a range of $1.25 \u2212$1.30 billion, representing double-digit revenue growth. The revenue guidance assumes the launch of Brineura in 2017. Beyond 2017, the company expects annual sales to grow approximately 15% throughout the rest of the decade.Vimizim sales are expected in a range of $400-$430 million while Kuvan sales are projected in a range of $380\u2212$410 million, representing an increase of about 14% over 2016 at the mid-point. Naglazyme sales are projected in a range of $300\u2212$330 million.R&D expenses are expected within $620-$650 million while SG&A expenses are projected in a range of $520-$550 million.Adjusted earnings are expected to turn positive. The company expects adjusted net income of $30 - $70 million in 2017. Meanwhile, management committed to continued profitability improvements over the longer term.Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three upward revisions for the current quarter compared to two downward. However, in the past month, the consensus estimate shifted downward by 9.1% due to these changes. | At this time, BioMarin's stock has a nice Growth Score of 'B', though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an 'F'. Also, the stock was allocated a grade of 'F' on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of 'D'. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is suitable solely for growth investors.While estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are looking for an inline return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: BMRN) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $91.32/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $70 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $5.70. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 8.1% return against the $70 commitment, or a 4.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to BMRN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $70 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. sees its shares decline 23.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $64.30 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $5.70 from $70), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.4% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., and highlighting in green where the $70 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put at the $70 strike for the 4.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $91.32) to be 40%.

Of course, that's combined sales of its four drugs, but it's still a mighty accomplishment that many drugmakers never reach.Data source: BioMarin Pharmaceutical.Image source: Getty Images.BioMarin CFO Dan Spiegelman painted a bright future for growing revenue, saying:While the company isn't giving earnings goals beyond this year, Spiegelman noted that it is \"committed to having [growth of operation expenses] be less than revenue growth.\" He added, \"The magnitude of the difference in 2017 is almost, by definition, as big as it can be.\"Management is guiding for revenue of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, which as Spiegelman noted, would be a solid double-digit increase over the $1.12 billion seen in 2016. Vimizim continues to drive growth with Kuvan also expected to experience double-digit growth.On the bottom line, management expects a loss of $140 million to $180 million on a GAAP basis, but on an adjusted basis, management is looking for a profit between $30 million and $70 million.Looking toward the next growth driver, the Food and Drug Administration has a goal of making a decision on Brineura by April 27, 2017.

On Mar 2, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued a positive Final Appraisal Determination (FAD) recommending the routine National Health Service (NHS) for the use of Erbitux in combination with either Folfiri or Folfox as a first-line treatment for patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This is a positive as now the patients can have access to this effective first-line treatment.The Life Science division had witnessed solid organic sales growth last quarter driven by strong organic growth and synergies, and the integration of the Sigma-Aldrich business. This trend should continue in the fourth quarter as well.For the Healthcare sector, the company is counting on its pharmaceutical pipeline and starting in 2017, aims to gain approval of one medicine or new indication every year.Meanwhile, we expect management to shed light on Merck KGaA's pipeline at the conference call.Merck KGaA, in collaboration with Pfizer Inc.  , is evaluating avelumab in several phase III studies for indications such as gastric cancer, platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer, bladder cancer and advanced renal cell carcinoma. In Feb 2017, the companies announced that FDA accepted avelumab for Priority Review the Biologics License Application (BLA) as a treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.

Last quarter, the company recorded a negative earnings surprise of 15.71%. In fact, Aerie's performance over the last four quarters has been disappointing. The company reported a wider-than-expected loss in all the four trailing quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 19.36%.Aerie's share price has increased 25.1% year to date, while the Zacks classified  industry gained 5.5%.With no approved product in its portfolio, Aerie depends heavily on its late-stage candidates.

However, the company resubmitted the NDA for Rhopressa in Mar 2017, after notification by its contract drug product manufacturer that the vendor's Tampa, Florida facility is now ready for pre-approval inspection by the FDA.

This compares unfavorably with a 10.4% increase registered by the Zacks classified  industry during this period.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Celldex, a development-stage biopharmaceutical company, is focused on the development and commercialization of immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and other difficult-to-treat diseases.With no approved product in its portfolio, investor focus will remain on pipeline development at the company.The company's most advanced pipeline candidate is glembatumumab vedotin, currently being evaluated for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (phase IIb) and metastatic melanoma (phase II). It is also being evaluated for the treatment of other cancers (squamous cell lung cancer, uveal melanoma and pediatric osteosarcoma) in which glycoprotein NMB is expressed.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, Celldex has several promising candidates in its pipeline, including varlilumab (several phase I/II combination studies across multiple types of cancer) and CDX-1401 (phase II - multiple solid tumors) among others.Celldex earns revenues entirely from product development and licensing agreements, and contracts and grants. The company recognizes revenues under its clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company  for varlilumab. We believe the company will continue to record revenues from these sources in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well.In Nov 2016, the company acquired Kolltan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held, clinical-stage company. Following the acquisition, Celldex gained rights to two of Kolltan's pipeline candidates - CDX-0158 and CDX-3379. Celldex also acquired Kolltan's multi-faceted TAM program.

Alexion's fourth quarter results were mixed with the company reporting in-line earnings while revenues were just shy of expectations (Read more:  ). Alexion's guidance for 2017 also fell short of expectations. Although flagship drug, Soliris, is expected to continue benefiting from a steady number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS) across the world, sales will nevertheless be impacted by patient recruitment for the company's ongoing and planned ALXN1210 studies as well as other studies -- this will impact Soliris revenues by $70 million to $110 million during the year. Moreover, access challenges in Latin America will remain an issue. Within the metabolics franchise, growth will remain moderate with Strensiq revenue per patient expected to be less compared to 2016 as younger patients start treatment. Celgene's experimental MS disease drug, ozanimod, met the primary endpoints in a phase III study compared to Biogen's Avonex. The candidate's safety and tolerability were consistent with that observed in mid-stage studies. The next step for the company is to report data from a confirmatory study in the second quarter. If all goes well, the company should be in a position to submit regulatory filings by year end.While MS affects about 400,000 people in the U.S. and approximately 2.5 million people across the world, several treatments like Tysabri, Tecfidera, Gilenya and Aubagio are available. A favorable safety profile could help ozanimod pick share once launched and the drug could bring in sales of more than a billion dollars. Ozanimod has potential not just in MS but also in other lucrative disease areas like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Celgene is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see  . Cidara's shares plunged 38.5% on disappointing mid-stage data on CD101 topical which was being evaluated for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). The company has decided to stop further development of the topical formulation for VVC and will instead focus its resources towards the development of the IV formulation of CD101, as well as the expansion and acceleration of the Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform. CD101 IV is currently in a mid-stage study for candidemia with results expected in the fourth quarter. Sarepta  , which was in the news last year for gaining FDA approval for Exondys 51, the first drug approved to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), said that it has entered into a deal with biotech giant Gilead  to sell off its Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV). Sarepta had received the PRV at the time of gaining approval for Exondys 51. Once the deal closes, Gilead will make a payment of $125 million.While the sale of the PRV will provide Sarepta with a non-dilutive source of funds which the company intends to use to advance the development of its follow on exon skipping candidates and next generation RNA targeted antisense platform, the price tag has given rise to concerns regarding the declining value of PRVs. Earlier, companies like United Therapeutics have sold PRVs for as much as $350 million. The FDA has granted priority review to The Medicines Co.'s  experimental IV antibiotic, Carbavance. The company is looking to get the antibiotic approved for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). At present, the agency does not plan to hold an advisory panel meeting for the drug. Meanwhile, results from an ongoing late-stage study are expected in the third quarter. Carbavance has fast track status in the U.S. for the cUTI indication and is also a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) under the GAIN Act.Over the last one year, The Medicines Co. has significantly outperformed the Zacks-categorized  industry with shares shooting up 58.1% compared to the industry decline of 3.3%. Amgen  gained EU approval for its single dose administration option for its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. This makes Repatha the first PCSK9 inhibitor in Europe to offer a monthly single-dose delivery option. This dosing option was approved in the U.S. last year in July.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was up 1% over the last five trading sessions.

Probably no one. What happens as a result is that usually only the biggest biotechs (or the small biotechs getting bought by the biggest biotechs) get a lot of coverage. But sometimes those aren't the stocks to watch most closely.You might not have heard too much about  (NASDAQ: AKBA) ,  (NASDAQ: BMRN) , and  (NASDAQ: IDRA) . These are three biotech stocks that you could be overlooking -- but deserve your attention. Here's why.Image source: Getty Images.If you've ever gone mountain climbing, you probably noticed some effects on your body as you ascended. Akebia's niche is developing drugs that mimic those effects by inhibiting hypoxia inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH). HIF-PH inhibitors can increase red blood cell (RBC) production and improve stabilization of the bone marrow's iron supply.Akebia's lead candidate, vadadustat, is in two late-stage clinical studies targeting treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD). One study is focused on dialysis-dependent CKD patients, while the other targets non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients. Results from a phase 2 study for vadaustat were encouraging.Although potential regulatory approval for vadadustat is still a few years away, Akebia already has lined up two big partners. Otsuka will market the drug in the U.S. if approved. Another Japanese drugmaker, Mitsubishi Tanabe, will market vadadustat in Japan and other Asian countries except China.Akebia's market cap currently stands around $400 million. The tremendous potential for vadadustat could drive this biotech stock much higher.Many investors are at least somewhat aware of BioMarin. The biotech claims five products on the market treating rare diseases. However, I think some still overlook BioMarin's considerable prospects for growth.The biotech is already experiencing solid growth from its current product lineup. Vimizim, Naglazyme, and Kuvan led the way to drive BioMarin's revenue to around $1.1 billion. Morquio A syndrome drug Vimizim particularly has bright prospects. BioMarin thinks sales for the drug could reach $700 million annually.BioMarin expects to obtain even more growth from two of its late-stage pipeline candidates. Regulatory approval for Brineura in treating CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease, could be on the way in 2017 for both the U.S. and Europe. Pegvaliase, a potential treatment for genetic condition phenylketonuria (PKU), could win regulatory approval in 2018.Although BioMarin already claims a market cap of more than $15 billion, the biotech should be able to become even larger with its growing rare-disease franchise. The company isn't profitable yet, but BioMarin thinks it will reach break-even on a non-GAAP basis this year.Idera doesn't have any products on the market like BioMarin does. And the company doesn't even have a late-stage candidate like Akebia does. However, Idera's pipeline makes this small biotech one to keep your eyes on.IMO-8400 is Idera's most advanced candidate. The experimental drug is currently being evaluated in a phase 2 study for treating dermatomyositis, a rare inflammatory disease affecting skin and muscle. Although there are treatments for this disease, they aren't tremendously effective and can produce serious side effects. Idera expects to report results from the phase 2 study of IMO-8400 in 2018.Another promising candidate for Idera is IMO-2125. Like IMO-8400, the experimental drug is a toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist. The biotech is targeting PD-1 refractory melanoma as the first potential indication in an early stage study of IMO-2125. Idera is also exploring use of the drug in treating other forms of cancer.Idera is still tiny, with a market cap of less than $300 million. However, Wall Street analysts think the stock could be a big winner. I suspect they could be right. Idera just might be the biotech equivalent of a diamond in the rough.Because it's the smallest of the three biotechs, Idera probably has the greatest upside potential. However, with a pipeline that isn't as far along, it also has the most risk.I think the best pick of the bunch is BioMarin. Everything seems to be going right for the biotech. It wouldn't be surprising to see BioMarin on the radar screen of a bigger company. Even if not, the company's current products and new drugs that are likely on the way should propel the stock higher. Don't overlook any of these biotech stocks, but especially watch BioMarin.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Meanwhile, plenty of clinical-stage programs at  (NASDAQ: BMRN) have been chugging along without much drama, but the stock is looking mighty expensive lately.Both companies are developing drugs to treat rare diseases, but their similarities don't go much further. Let's see how these two biotech stocks stack up to each other to figure out which one is the better pick today.Image source: Getty Images.This clinical-stage biotech has a proprietary technology that uses RNA interference to silence troublesome genes. It's discovered quite a few new drug candidates over the years, but it hasn't carried any over the clinical- to commercial-stage threshold yet.Alnylam's stock price was nearly cut  last October after safety concerns led it to end development of a lead candidate, revusiran, which was being studied as a treatment for heart damage caused by mutated transthyretin, a protein that transports a thyroid hormone and vitamin A around the body.A related candidate for the prevention of nerve damage, patisiran, is still winding its way through late-stage trials. With a bit of luck, its safety profile might hold up better than revusiran's and allow Alnylam to submit its first new drug application to the FDA. If successfully commercialized by Alnylam's partner,  , yearly patisiran sales could top out around $750 million, triggering milestone and royalty payments from the French pharma.It will be easier to pin a value on patisiran once a late-stage trial with the candidate wraps up about halfway through the year, but that's not the only potential catalyst for Alnylam coming up. Early results from another Sanofi-partnered hemophilia candidate, named fitusiran, informed the design of a larger clinical trial slated to start early this year.Soon, Alnylam expects to report mid-stage data from another experimental drug for treatment of an inherited condition that leads to super-high cholesterol. Inclisiran is under development in partnership with India's  , and the pair intends to begin a late-stage study around the middle of the year.Jittery investors will appreciate a key advantage BioMarin has over Alnylam. The rare-disease drug developer has a handful of commercial-stage drugs generating sales right now. When the company last reported its numbers, revenue during the first nine months of 2016 rose a sprightly 23% over the prior-year period to $816.8 million.Despite growing its top line at an impressive rate, BioMarin's operations are still deep in the red. The company expects to post a loss of between $600 million and $630 million for 2016 when it reports full-year earnings, but a few products and clinical-stage hopefuls could push it into profitability during the years to come.Image source: Getty Images.Since earning FDA approval in 2014, sales of Vimizim for the treatment of an ultra-rare metabolic deficiency known as Morquio A syndrome have taken off. Although there are perhaps just 800 children affected by the disease in the U.S., global sales of the drug are expected to total $350 million for full-year 2016.At the moment, regulators in the U.S. and EU are mulling applications for BioMarin's Batten disease candidate, brineura. In the U.S., perhaps 1,500 patients could benefit greatly from the enzyme replacement therapy, leading to peak annual sales north of $500 million, if approved.BioMarin's phenylketonuria drug, Kuvan, lost exclusivity in the U.S., but the company recently purchased rights to its sales in Europe, where it's protected from generic competition for a few more years. The company has a longer-lasting follow-up version of the enzyme replacement therapy on deck that significantly reduced the buildup of phenylalanine in a late-stage study. The positive results will support applications that BioMarin intends to file during the current quarter.With late-stage candidates close to the goal line and a successful history of new drug commercialization, there's a lot to like about BioMarin. Unfortunately, its recent $15.6 billion market cap is around 14.9 times trailing sales. If any unexpected events lead investors to assume profitability is further into the future, the shares have a long way to fall.Alnylam's recent market cap of about $4 billion also includes a large slice of optimism. In its nearly 20-year history, it has yet to move a drug from clinical trials to pharmacy shelves, which means the RNA interference technology that spawned its pipeline still carries a lot of question marks.The science behind BioMarin's candidates isn't nearly as interesting, but enzyme replacement is a generally successful approach. That's why I'm calling the bigger biotech the better buy right now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Recently, LabCorp completed the acquisition of Sequenom, Inc. with the aim to expand its presence in both domestic and international levels. The addition of Sequenom has positioned the company as the market leader in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), women's health and reproductive genetics. While the integration process is going on, we expect to see top-line contribution coming from Sequenom in the fourth quarter itself. | Meanwhile, the company continues to focus on expanding its testing capabilities beyond the conventional health care setting. Earlier, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of testing for Zika virus using the Zika Immunoglobulin M (IgM) Antibody Capture Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Zika MAC-ELISA). We believe this will help the company meet the growing health care needs in the days ahead.Management also intends to continue the company's expansion drive in the food safety test space by making the best use of its expertise. The company also wants to emphasize on innovation through commercialization of new technologies that allow faster pathogen detection. LabCorp is also developing innovative solutions and expanding therapeutic expertise in critical areas of drug development to come up with ground-breaking medicines. We believe these recent developments will contribute to the company's top line in the fourth quarter as well.In this regard we note that, including Sequenom, for full-year 2016, the company expects net revenue growth in the range of 10\u221211% over 2015. Adjusted EPS (earnings per share) guidance for 2016 is expected in the range of $8.70\u2212$8.90 (earlier expectation: $8.60\u2212$8.95).However, foreign exchange woes and intense competition from major commercial laboratories and hospitals may act as headwinds. For the full year, the company projects a 60 basis points impact from foreign exchange risks due to the strengthening of dollar. We are also highly disappointed with the CMS proposal related to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA).Our proven model does not conclusively show that LabCorp is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. LabCorp has an Earnings ESP of -0.47%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $2.12 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $2.13. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . LabCorp has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a few companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +7.5% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Robust patient growth and penetration should propel the drugs' sales.Meanwhile, last quarter, the company experienced significant unevenness in orders, particularly in Brazil and the Middle East, where political and economic instability had an impact on results. We expect these factors to hurt international revenues in the fourth quarter as well.Naglazyme revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from Latin America.

Over the past three months, Wright Medical returned almost 15.54%, which is higher than the Zacks categorized  sub-industry's gain of roughly 5.38%. Also, Wright Medical has a decent earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below. | Wright Medical's innovative products are expected to expand its customer base that will eventually drive revenues in the fourth quarter. High incidence of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, obesity and an aging population is increasingly causing the global orthopedic market to grow each passing day. Thus, Wright Medical is expected to benefit from the developing trends of the industry. Also, the company has significant presence in key emerging markets like Asia, which further boosts its long-term prospects.The company continues to witness flat pricing, due to price discounting in larger accounts, limited product offerings and international price cuts. The advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) is also keeping prices under pressure. Also, Wright Medical derives a significant part of its total revenues from international operations, which is being affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.However, overall activities of Wright Medical during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts' confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported fell 2 cents to a loss of 11 cents per share in the last 90 days.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Wright Medical is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

For the Biotech ETF (Symbol: BBH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $134.11 per unit.With BBH trading at a recent price near $121.84 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.07% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of BBH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Symbol: REGN), and Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc (Symbol: ACAD). Although BMRN has traded at a recent price of $93.81/share, the average analyst target is 20.02% higher at $112.59/share. Similarly, REGN has 12.99% upside from the recent share price of $379.05 if the average analyst target price of $428.29/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ACAD to reach a target price of $41.38/share, which is 12.95% above the recent price of $36.63. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of BMRN, REGN, and ACAD:Combined, BMRN, REGN, and ACAD represent 9.92% of the Biotech ETF.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

The soft performance of pharma companies as evidenced this earnings season prevailed last week as well with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  delivering in-line earnings while missing revenue estimates.

Let's see how things are shaping up at the company this quarter.According to the company, price erosion and changing market dynamics across the Prescription Pharmaceuticals (Rx) business will continue to hurt its performance. The company anticipates the pricing environment to impact the Rx segment's performance in the fourth quarter. Ongoing focus on drug pricing is another concern.In the Branded Consumer Healthcare (BCH) segment, Perrigo continues to implement transformational changes and improvements in products and processes. The BCH segment is projected to underperform due to lower-than-expected revenues from certain high-margin products. Moreover, delay in new product launches and softness in pricing in the Consumer Healthcare segment are expected to continue hurting the performance of the segment.However, the OTC business and the infant nutrition category within the CHC segment and product acquisitions and new products in the Rx segment are expected to boost sales in the coming quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Perrigo is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

ImmunoGen's track record has been disappointing with the company missing expectations in each of the last four reported quarters. Overall, the company has posted an average negative surprise of 19.34%.However, ImmunoGen's shares outperformed the Zacks classified  industry by gaining 20.6% so far this year, while the industry witnessed an increase of 5%.In the last reported quarter, ImmunoGen recorded a negative surprise of 21.05%. Will ImmunoGen disappoint again? Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.ImmunoGen is a development-stage biotech company that focuses on the development of targeted anticancer therapeutics using its antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology. On Oct 2016 the company updated its guidance for the six months ended Dec 2016. The company lowered its revenue guidance to the range of $25-$30 million (previous projection: $40-$45 million).Net loss is projected in the range of $70-$75 million (old guidance: $95-$100 million) for the six months ended Dec 2016. Given that ImmunoGen does not have any approved product in its portfolio yet, investor focus should remain on the company's progress with its lead pipeline candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine and other programs.In the quarter (Dec 2016), ImmunoGen made significant progress with regard to mirvetuximab soravtansine. ImmunoGen announced positive data from a 46-patient phase I cohort evaluating the efficacy and safety of mirvetuximab soravtansine as a single-agent therapy for platinum-resistant, FR\u03b1-positive ovarian cancer. On the basis of these data, the company has initiated the phase III study, FORWARD I. The study will evaluate mirvetuximab soravtansine as single-agent therapy in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who previously received up to three treatment regimens and whose cancer has a medium or high FR alpha expression.Meanwhile, combination regimens with mirvetuximab soravtansine in ovarian cancer are in the phase Ib/II FORWARD II study, which aim to expand the eligible patient population.

Even as the S&P 500 gained around 50% from 2013 up to that point, the likes of the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index and the SPDR S&P Biotech nearly tripled in value.However, this amazing run for biotech stocks came to a halt in Jul 2015, post which both these ETFs had lost nearly 40% by Feb 2016. Even now, they remain around 30% below the peak attained a few years ago.Several investors remain wary of the biotech category, having lost substantially when the recent slide occurred. However, others recognize that biotechs have stabilized and still offer the potential to deliver substantial returns. Investing in biotech stocks makes for a lucrative option now as well as later this year.Ever since the Presidential election campaign began, biotechs have been subjected to severe pressure, primarily due to allegations of overpricing. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was the first to raise the issue through a tweet and the election of a Republican candidate came as welcome news to the industry.However, upon his election, Donald Trump has once again raised the issue of overpricing. But fears from such utterances may be overstated, since the statement has not and likely will not result in concrete policy actions. Instead, Trump has offered out the hope of a faster approval process and deregulation.Meanwhile, even as other sectors are being unable to sustain a steady pace of growth, biotechs are regularly posting strong gains. For instance, Celgene Corp.  posted a substantial fourth quarter sales growth of 16%, riding on its blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid. Though growth for the sector remains well below the pace registered in its heydays, it is still high enough to outperform several other categories in the current scenario.Biotech stocks are viewed as inherently risky options since companies from the sector face numerous challenges related to approvals and the patenting process. However, once a drug is successfully developed, companies often develop unassailable positions in specific domains.Additionally, the development of treatments such as orphans gives companies like BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  virtual monopolies for a long period of time. Since expenditure on such treatments is not discretionary in nature, this also guarantees a steady revenue stream which is largely free of uncertainty.Additionally, the sector has witnessed heated M&A activity in the past. Last year saw deals worth nearly $1.7 trillion being conducted. Of these 80% were strategic in nature, a trend which is likely to continue unhindered given the regulatory stance of the current administration. With large companies holding significant cash reserves and small stocks available at attractive prices, this may be the year when the sector witnesses a substantial degree of consolidation.Biotechs have recovered substantially from the losses they suffered up to early last year. Despite the risk associated with them, they remain good options for investors looking for steady growth, largely unaffected by the fortunes of the broader economy.Adding biotech stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point.

Do you own the stocks most likely to benefit?In this clip from The Motley Fool's  podcast, analyst Kristine Harjes and contributor Todd Campbell share the stocks they think are poised to benefit most from the Cures Act. On their list are top medical device stocks, such as  (NYSE: MDT) , and drugmakers, such as  (NASDAQ: BIIB) ,  (NYSE: JNJ) , and  (NASDAQ: BMRN) . Tune in to learn out more about these stocks and whether they're right for your portfolio.A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! The next segment of our show is inspired by a listener question that came in through Twitter. If you guys aren't already following us, our handle is @MFIndustryFocus. This question comes from Harris Arshad. He asks us, if we were to create our own ETF based on the 21st Century Cures Act, what would be included? There's some background necessary before we dive in and actually answer this question. Todd, do you want to give an elevator pitch? We probably need to describe both the Cures Act really quickly, and also what an ETF is. I'll start with the Cures Act. We'll keep it very high level here. The Cures Act was passed by Congress and signed by the president. What it's designed to do is to reduce the regulatory burden on drug and medical device discovery and development, to increase the speed of reviewing those products that have been researched through the FDA, and to get them into patients' hands more quickly. So, they're doing that through a lot of various different carrots, including billions of dollars of additional spending that they're going to be sending to both the National Institute of Health and the FDA. And if you're curious about more, we did an entire half of an episode on the 7th of December. If you missed that episode, be sure to go back and check it out. Meanwhile, the second piece of background necessary for answering this question is: What is an ETF? An ETF is an exchange-traded fund. It's essentially a basket of stocks that trade for a single price. It's kind of similar to a mutual fund, but instead of having its value determined by the underlying assets once per day like a mutual fund does, an ETF is traded like a common stock, so its price will go up and down throughout the day. Basically, all you need to know if you're not super familiar with ETFs is, it's a handful of stocks that we're looking at here. Right. We have plenty of coverage on The Motley Fool's website if anybody is interested in looking more into different ETFs. It was a fascinating question to me, and it really got me thinking about who's going to benefit most, potentially, from the Cures Act. Yeah, absolutely. For me, the first one that came to mind were drugmakers. I'm not going to pick every single drugmaker, but I would pick a couple of them to throw into this basket. One that I would throw out there is BioMarin. This is a company that's focused on rare-disease drugs. One of the things that came up in the Cures Act is that now, the FDA is allowed to consider real-world evidence about a drug's efficacy. So, outside of trials, do we see this drug working? And that could lead to expedited approval, especially for patients with an unmet need. So, your patients that are looking at receiving rare-disease drugs. So, I could definitely see them benefiting from this act. I totally agree with you. I'm actually going to cheat with one name that I would like to include in there. It's going to be an ETF of ETFs. I think people should look at the medical device ETF, the  -- symbol is IHI -- and that's because one of the most vocal lobbyists involved in creating this act was the medical device lobby. There are lots of different things in this act that help to increase everything from breakthrough designation to the ability to use new devices in more rare diseases. There's a lot of goodies in this act that could help prop up medical device stocks. If you wanted one in particular, I guess Medtronic is kind of the grand-daddy of medical devices. If you think we're cheating by choosing the IHI, then the biggest holding -- this is a guess, but I think it's a pretty strong guess -- is Medtronic. It is. Medtronic is No. 1 at 12%.  at 7.7%, and  at 7.7%. Yeah, that sounds right. So at Medtronic, they make cardiac devices, diabetes devices, and more. They're a huge company. They're very diversified. They're a Dividend Aristocrat. If you're only looking for one medical device company, that would be my pick. Yep. And if you want to go with a bigger basket, just go with the IHI. Indeed. Another company that I'll throw into our broader ETF is Johnson & Johnson. That's because it has devices and it also has drugs, so you're getting two for one there. Yeah, that's a good pick, and it's a Goliath within both of those areas. I guess I would toss in the ring Biogen, because Biogen is doing a tremendous amount of research and development on neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Specifically in the Act, there's a lot of money that's being set aside for the Brain Initiative, and also for the Precision Medicine Initiative, both of which could increase the number of drugs that end up in the clinic targeting cognitive decline. Right. There's a lot of money in here going toward those initiatives, which are trying to harness the power of data to create personalized treatments. Basically, what precision medicine is doing is taking into account the individual variability in your environment and your lifestyle and your genes. You can even see there some genetic companies getting into the mix. Maybe something like an  that does gene sequencing. Absolutely. And they're saying one of the biggest advances, potentially, in Alzheimer's research could come from deep sequencing, which is something relatively new. We have finally gotten the technology now to really dive even deeper than we ever have before into the genome. Perhaps, in doing that, we'll find some more of these common threads that connect different patients who are suffering from this devastating disease.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["aking bold predictions actually isn't too hard to do. Having them come true is another story altogether. Nevertheless, a new year is now upon us, and I can't resist the urge to make a few bold predictions about the world of biotech investing in 2017. A handful of biotechs showed up in my crystal ball:  (NASDAQ: INCY) ,  (NASDAQ: BIIB) ,  (NASDAQ: BMRN) ,  (NASDAQ: GILD) , and  (NASDAQ: ILMN) . Here are my bold predictions for what's going to happen to these biotechs in the new year.Image source: Getty Images.A few months ago, the good folks at investment bank Evercore ISI surveyed industry observers to find out which biotechs they thought were most likely to be acquired. Three companies  : Incyte, Biogen, and Biomarin. I predict none of these three top acquisition favorites will actually get bought in 2017.It wouldn't surprise me one bit if some larger company made a play for Incyte. The biotech's JAK inhibitor program is definitely attractive. However, my hunch is that Incyte's management and shareholders will demand a price tag higher than anyone is willing to pay.Because of its market cap of over $60 billion, an acquisition of Biogen would require a megadeal. I don't think 2017 will be the year for megadeals. If President-elect Donald Trump gets his tax proposals enacted, big biotechs should have more cash on their hands beginning in 2018, which could change the dynamics then.I suspect my prediction could be on the shakiest ground with Biomarin. The biotech's market cap isn't so high that it would scare off would-be acquirers. Biomarin also has a couple of promising new drugs on the verge of approval. Still, I'll stick to my guns: Biomarin will stay on its own for at least the next 12 months.Just because industry observers' top acquisition picks won't get bought doesn't mean that I think there won't be plenty of acquisition activity this year. On the contrary, I predict that Gilead Sciences will go on a major buying spree, picking up not one, not two, but three smaller biotechs in 2017.Gilead certainly possesses the cash and the cash flow to pull off multiple deals. It also has ample motivation to do so. With its hepatitis C franchise struggling and several painful clinical setbacks in 2016, the big biotech could use a boost.Why do I think Gilead will buy several smaller biotechs? The company's management team knows that shareholders are anxiously awaiting an acquisition that will make an impact. However, my impression is that CEO John Milligan isn't convinced that a huge bet is worth the risk. This means that several smaller acquisitions, perhaps in the $1 billion to $5 billion range, would make more sense if my take is right.Last year was a disaster for Illumina. Shares of the genomic-sequencing company sank close to 30% in 2016. A big part of the problem was that Illumina set expectations that it didn't meet. I predict that the company will roar back in 2017.There are a couple of factors that should help Illumina rebound. First, the company appears to be on track to get its act together on forecasting quarterly results more accurately. A major project is in progress to accomplish this. I expect Illumina will set realistic forecasts that it can deliver on in the next several quarters.Second, I think that Illumina will be able to largely overcome the headwinds experienced late last year related to changes in how the U.S. government funds projects. Around 35 HiSeq sequencing system sales that the company expected in the second half of 2016 were pushed back. lllumina might not get all of these sales this year, but my hunch is that it will score enough of them to give shareholders something to smile about again.I also have one final not-so-bold prediction: Biotech stocks in general will enjoy better performance in 2017 than they did 2016. The biggest anchor for the industry last year was the worry of political changes that restricting the ability of biotechs to price their drugs. I don't expect this threat to totally go away this year, but it probably won't be as significant of a concern as it was in 2016.If I'm right, 2017 will be more about what biotechs actually do. Climbing sales for Jakafi should drive Incyte's earnings -- and its stock -- higher. Biogen should enjoy a successful launch of Spinraza. Biomarin should launch its promising rare-disease drugs. Gilead should use its cash to rejuvenate its stock. Illumina should ride the wave of precision medicine's need for genomic sequencing.The thing about bold predictions is that most of them don't come true.

In fact, the stock has gained 42.2% during this period, in comparison to a drop of 4.3% for the industryConcurrent with the third-quarter results, Zoetis updated its outlook for 2016 buoyed by a strong performance through the first nine months of the year, continued strength in the company's business model and an upbeat view for the rest of the year.Zoetis now expects earnings in the range of $1.91 to $1.96 per share (old guidance: $1.86-$1.93). It has updated the low end of the revenue guidance for 2016 and now expects revenues of $4.85 billion to $4.9 billion (old guidance: $4.8-$4.9 billion).The company expects companion animal business to be the main contributor to growth in the fourth-quarter 2016. Zoetis' companion animal business has been performing well in both the U.S. and international markets, and should continue to do so in the to-be-reported quarter. The business should be driven by higher sales of Apoquel, several new product launches, including Simparica, and market expansion of key product lines. The company is also working on expanding its market share for Apoquel further.However, the swine business is under pressure in the U.S. due to increased competition. Performance of Zoetis' livestock business has been disappointing. Poultry business is also declining globally due to market conditions and competitive pressure.On the fourth-quarter call, investor focus will be on the company's performance, guidance update for 2017 and its business development plans.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Zoetis will beat earnings this quarter.

Overall, Agios has an average negative surprise of 77.80%.In the last reported quarter, the company posted a negative surprise of 7.95%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Agios, a development-stage biopharmaceutical company, is focused on the formulation of treatments for cancer and rare genetic metabolic disorders. As a development-stage company, Agios does not have approved products in its portfolio yet. Investors are thus expected to keep an eye on pipeline updates at the company.In this regard it is worth mentioning that the company has several interesting candidates in its pipeline. Its cancer pipeline comprises enasidenib (IDH2 mutant inhibitor), AG-120 (IDH1 mutant inhibitor) and AG-881 (pan-IDH mutant inhibitor). We note that Agios is developing enasidenib and AG-881 in collaboration with Celgene, which should bring in collaboration revenues.Moreover, during the quarter (ended Dec 2016) Agios reported positive clinical data from the ongoing phase I study evaluating single agent AG-120 in advanced hematologic malignancies.However, during the same period, Agios announced that it is has decided to discontinue the development of one of its PKR activator, AG-519. The decision was taken after the verbal notification of a clinical hold by the FDA, which led the company to withdraw its investigational new drug application for the candidate.Notably, Agios has assured investors that the decision will not affect its ongoing open-label safety and efficacy phase II study (DRIVE PK) on its second PKR activator, AG-348, being conducted in transfusion-independent adult patients with PK deficiency.The company is currently working on a registration path for AG-348 for the treatment of adult PK deficiency patients and plans to discuss this strategy with regulators.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Agios is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is -2.58%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of $1.59 per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.55 per share.

Vimizim sales continue to be driven by robust patient growth and penetration in additional markets. The product should perform well with existing and new patient referrals converting to commercial therapy. Products like Kuvan are also performing well and its North American sales continue to propel on the back of increase in new patients and high levels of adherence. Internationally, uptake has been solid and the acquisition of the drug's global rights has opened a stream of orders directly from the majority of the top markets to the company. BioMarin continues to see growth in both Vimizim and Kuvan in 2017.The company has a robust pipeline with several data readouts lined up in the coming quarters. The candidates include pegvaliase (PKU, regulatory application in the U.S. planned for the second quarter of 2017) and vosoritide (achondroplasia,). Also, BioMarin has several early-stage and mid-stage candidates in its pipeline like Brineura (treatment of children with CLN2 disease, response from the FDA is expected by Apr 27, 2017 and a decision in the EU anticipated in the third quarter of 2017), BMN 270 (hemophilia A) and NAGLU (Sanfilippo B syndrome or MPS IIIB).Successful development and commercialization of these candidates in its pipeline will help drive long-term growth at BioMarin.However, BioMarin is facing generic threat for Kuvan. The company acquired all global rights to Kuvan, excluding Japan and pegvaliase from Merck Serono-the biopharma business of Merck KGaA  , in Jan 2016. Kuvan is one of the most promising drugs at BioMarin and has been performing well since its launch. As a result, the earlier-than-expected entry of generics would be a huge blow for the company. In Feb 2016, BioMarin filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Endo International plc's  Par Pharmaceutical for Kuvan.BioMarin has suffered quite a few regulatory setbacks related to its pipeline candidates, Brineura and Kyndrisa. Delayed approvals or development setbacks could have a negative impact on the stock. Also, the company's top line is under pressure due to political and macroeconomic instability in Brazil and the Middle East. However, BioMarin expects the situation to improve in 2017 with break-even or better results.In Jan 2015, BioMarin acquired a Dutch biotech company Prosensa, in an all-cash transaction valued at $751.5 million, to boost its rare disease pipeline. The acquisition was assumed to be a strategic move. The acquisition added a late-stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) candidate Kyndrisa, which was considered to be a synergistic fit for BioMarin's rare disease pipeline. Nevertheless, BioMarin failed to clear regulatory hurdles related to Kyndrisa and ultimately decided to drop development of the candidate. However, biopharmaceutical company Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.  , ceived a boost with the FDA approval of Exondys 51 for DMD. The FDA approval makes Exondys 51 the first DMD treatment to gain approval in the U.S. Also, a marketing application is under review in the EU.In addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades\u2026 from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

For a candidate to be accepted under PRIME, it has to demonstrate the potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data.BioMarin's share price has gained 23.3% in the past one year, while the Zacks classified  industry fell 6.2%.As mentioned earlier, PRIME is an initiative undertaken by the EMA, which aims to provide better scientific guidance and support accelerated review of investigational therapies that address high unmet medical need. The initiative also offers early and enhanced regulatory support to optimize regulatory applications. This will help patients benefit as early as possible from therapies that might significantly improve their quality of life.In Mar 2016, BioMarin announced that both the FDA and the European Commission granted Orphan Drug designation to BMN 270 for the treatment of patients with hemophilia A. The candidate is currently in phase I/II for hemophilia A. We remind investors that the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had approved the resumption of enrollment in the open-label phase I/II study for BMN 270 in Oct 2016. The regulatory agency has also approved the company's proposed amendments in the study, including elimination of the requirement for prophylactic corticosteroids and increasing additional enrollment from up to three patients to a maximum of six patients. The company expects to enroll patients in the study in the third quarter of 2017.BioMarin had suspended the dosing of patients in the study after enrolling the first nine patients. This was due to increases in alanine aminotransferase levels that were observed to exceed the pre-specified threshold set by the company. Subsequent to the suspension of the study, the company reviewed safety and efficacy data on the nine patients with MHRA, on the basis of which it approved the continuation of the study.BioMarin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector include Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  , Enzo Biochem, Inc.  and Anika Therapeutics Inc.  . All of them carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Enz Biochem's loss estimates for 2017 narrowed 5.88% over the past 60 days.

Its share price was up 48.7% in the past one year.Anika's earnings estimates for 2016 and 2017 were up 3.9% and 0.5%, respectively, over the last 60 days.

The segment would remain under pressure due to pricing erosion as well as the absence of important product launches. Delays in product approvals and IP decisions as well as quality challenges experienced by third-party suppliers led to the lack of product launches in the third quarter. At the third quarter conference call, management had mentioned that these delays can hurt fourth-quarter sales, pushing some of the key generic product launches to the 2017-2018 timeframe.Last quarter, U.S. legacy generics revenues declined due to lower sales of the generic versions of Pulmicort, Nexium and Xeloda, which resulted from loss of exclusivity and intense competition. We do not expect any improvement in the segment in the fourth quarter either.In the fourth quarter, important launches included the generic versions of hypertension drugs Tribenzor, Azor and Beyaz (an oral contraceptive) in the U.S., which should provide some support to sales.The EU generics segment will also remain under pressure with sales being affected by macro-economic conditions and healthcare reforms.Meanwhile, in the branded segment, sales of both specialty products and blockbuster multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment Copaxone declined in the third quarter. It remains to be seen if sales pick up in the fourth quarter.Investors will remain focused on Copaxone's performance. We expect management to comment on the setback it suffered last week with the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware invalidating all asserted claims of the '250, '413, '776 and '302 patents for Copaxone 40 mg.Teva continues to focus on its cost reduction program which should give its profits a boost.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Teva is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

The long and short of it is that Biogen will need to either hit a home run with its moonshot Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab, or turn to the M&A scene to stave off a marked decline in its top line in the next year or so.When it comes to biotechs with rich valuations, the orphan drug specialist BioMarin is nearly always close to the top of the list. The underlying reason is that orphan drugs confer a number of highly coveted benefits for their manufacturers, such as premium pricing schemes that tend to fly under the radar of payers. Moreover, BioMarin is easily one of the top orphan drug companies in the world with five products on the market and a rich clinical pipeline that sports potential blockbusters like vosoritide for achondroplasia (a form of short-limbed dwarfism).Although the biotech did make a fairly large error by acquiring fledgling company Prosensa for its experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug Kyndrisa that was subsequently rejected by the FDA, BioMarin does have an overall strong track record of rapidly developing novel therapies for rare diseases. So, if you're looking for exposure to this niche pharma market, BioMarin should probably be on your list, despite its  relative to the broader biotech landscape.Opko Health is a highly diversified healthcare company with multiple irons in the fire. But the company's near-term value proposition can arguably be distilled down the success -- or failure -- of its newly approved vitamin D prohormone, Rayaldee, indicated as a treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism.The big picture issue at play here is that Rayaldee's addressable market has been estimated to be as large as $12 billion per year -- although some skeptics have suggested otherwise, predicting that the drug's sales will peak at around $500 million. Regardless, this new drug should turn out to be a key growth driver for the company moving forward. The Street, after all, is forecasting Opko's top line to rise by nearly 16% in 2017, based primarily on Rayaldee's projected commercial performance.Having said that, Opko Health will probably remain cash-flow-negative next year and may even need to raise capital sometime soon to fund its ongoing operations. While cash flow problems shouldn't necessarily be a deal breaker for investors in this case, this issue is likely a big reason why the company's shares are only trading at four times its 2017 estimated revenue.Amgen, BioMarin, and Opko Health are all arguably worth a deeper dive based on their longer-term value propositions. But Acadia and Biogen still have some serious work to do to lower their risk profiles moving forward.

The pharma/biotech sector faced several headwinds last year including slow product launches, fewer drug approvals, pipeline setbacks and increasing competition including the presence of biosimilars. And of course, there was the political rhetoric about drug pricing that weighed on the sector for almost the whole of 2016. Although there is not much clarity right now about the steps that will be taken to address the drug pricing issue, it is clear that drug pricing will remain in focus in 2017 as well.On the other hand, strong pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending should support growth in this sector. Moreover, President-elect Donald Trump's pro-business stand is also expected to benefit the sector. Major biotech and pharma companies should gain from Trump's proposed tax plan and proposal to repatriate corporate profits held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10%.

Rockville, MD-based Sucampo's key areas of focus include gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and oncology-related disorders. Amitiza continues to perform well and the resolution of the patent litigation with Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited  regarding a generic version of Amitiza has removed an overhang. Amitiza sales should be driven by key formulary wins as well as a highly targeted direct-to-consumer (DTC) TV campaign in select key markets and performance in Japan. The company's preliminary guidance for 2017 surpassed expectations and earnings estimates for 2017 are up 10% over the past 4 weeks.

You can see  . San Rafael, CA-based BioMarin is focused on the development and commercialization of drugs for serious diseases and medical conditions. The biotech company is well known for its treatments for rare diseases and has five commercialized products in its portfolio. BioMarin has an interesting pipeline as well which addresses diseases like hemophilia, achondroplasia, CLN2 (a late-infantile form of Batten disease) and phenylketonuria (PKU).This Zacks Rank #2 stock may not have been making too many headlines over the past few weeks but the company's rare disease portfolio makes it an attractive acquisition target. EPS estimates for 2017 are up 13.8% over the past 4 weeks. BioMarin's earnings track record is also strong with the company surpassing expectations in each of the first three quarters of 2016. A look at BioMarin's performance last year shows that the company outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry with the company declining 21% compared to the industry decline of 24.7%. Waltham, MA-based Repligen is focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of products used to manufacture biologic drugs. The company sells its bioprocessing products to life sciences companies, biopharmaceutical development companies and contract manufacturing organizations across the world. Earnings estimates for Repligen, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, are up 2.5% for 2017. The TangenX Technology acquisition is expected to be earnings accretive in 2017.

This could lead to a surge in mergers and acquisitions (M&A).As we start the New Year, here is a look at 3 drug stocks that have not been in the news much but have been witnessing upward estimate revisions and sport a strong Zacks Rank -- #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). -  Rockville, MD-based Sucampo's key areas of focus include gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and oncology-related disorders. Amitiza continues to perform well and the resolution of the patent litigation with Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (NYSE:  -  ) regarding a generic version of Amitiza has removed an overhang. Amitiza sales should be driven by key formulary wins as well as a highly targeted direct-to-consumer (DTC) TV campaign in select key markets and performance in Japan. The company's preliminary guidance for 2017 surpassed expectations and earnings estimates for 2017 are up 10% over the past 4 weeks. Sucampo also beat expectations in each of the first three quarters of 2016. Sucampo, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, boasts of a  of \"A\" -- our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of \"A\" or \"B\" when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. You can see  . -  San Rafael, CA-based BioMarin is focused on the development and commercialization of drugs for serious diseases and medical conditions. The biotech company is well known for its treatments for rare diseases and has five commercialized products in its portfolio. BioMarin has an interesting pipeline as well which addresses diseases like hemophilia, achondroplasia, CLN2 (a late-infantile form of Batten disease) and phenylketonuria (PKU).This Zacks Rank #2 stock may not have been making too many headlines over the past few weeks but the company's rare disease portfolio makes it an attractive acquisition target. EPS estimates for 2017 are up 13.8% over the past 4 weeks. BioMarin's earnings track record is also strong with the company surpassing expectations in each of the first three quarters of 2016. A look at BioMarin's performance last year shows that the company outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry with the company declining 21% compared to the industry decline of 24.7%. -  Waltham, MA-based Repligen is focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of products used to manufacture biologic drugs. The company sells its bioprocessing products to life sciences companies, biopharmaceutical development companies and contract manufacturing organizations across the world. Earnings estimates for Repligen, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, are up 2.5% for 2017. The TangenX Technology acquisition is expected to be earnings accretive in 2017. Repligen's performance in 2016 was better than that of the industry with the company gaining 9.7% during the year.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Moreover, its year-to-date share price movement shows that the stock has outperformed the Zacks classified  industry. In fact, it has lost 19.7% during this period, compared with a drop of 25.3% for the industry.Backed by its strong presence in the orphan disease drug market, BioMarin's key drugs - Vimizim and Kuvan - continued to gain traction. While, Vimizim sales were driven by robust patient growth and penetration in additional markets, Kuvan witnesses robust sales in North American on the back of growth in new patients and high levels of adherence. BioMarin expects Vimizim and Kuvan to each generate sales of $340-$360 million.With the Jan 2016 acquisition of global rights to Kuvan and pegvaliase from Merck KGaA's  Merck Serono, the company fortified its leadership position in the phenylketonuria (PKU) market.Moreover, on its third-quarter call, BioMarin narrowed its loss guidance to the range of $10-$30 million from $30-$50 million, buoyed by strong top-line growth in the quarter and operating expense discipline. On the other hand, total revenue is still expected in the range of $1.10\u2212$1.15 billion for 2016.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has narrowed from a loss of 28 cents to 25 cents for 2016 and from $1.16 to $1.11 for 2017 over the last 60 days.BioMarin continues to progress with its pipeline candidates. Recently, the company initiated a global phase III study on vosoritide for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. The company plans to conduct a separate phase II study to evaluate the effect of vosoritide in infants and toddlers. | A couple of other favorably placed stocks in the health care sector include Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.  and MannKind Corporation  . Both of them sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Vanda's loss estimates for 2016 narrowed from 62 cents to 45 cents over the last 60 days. The company posted a positive earnings surprise in three of the four trailing quarters with an average beat of 56.65%.MannKind's estimates narrowed from loss of 24 cents to earnings of 12 cents for 2016 over the last 60 days. For 2017, its loss estimates narrowed from 14 cents to 9 cents over this period.

The term might sound futuristic, but the future has arrived.The National Institutes of Health defines precision medicine as \"an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person.\" For several companies, this approach is already a reality -- and it has created opportunities for investors. Here's why  (NASDAQ: ILMN) ,  (NASDAQ: BMRN) , and  (NASDAQ: VRTX) are great precision medicine stocks to buy in January.Image source: Getty Images.Back in the gold rush days, it was said that the people selling shovels prospered more than the gold miners themselves. Which company is the leader in selling \"shovels\" for precision medicine? I'd put Illumina at the top of the list.To tailor healthcare to an individual's genetic makeup, companies need the appropriate tools and technology to make it possible. Illumina develops and markets next-generation sequencing systems that enable researchers to perform genomic analysis quickly and cost effectively.Illumina's stock is down more than 30% in 2016 after missing Wall Street's expectations and the company's own forecasts several times during the year. However, I think this steep drop in Illumina's share price presents a buying opportunity for investors with a long-term perspective.There is at least one major concern that could hold Illumina back, though. It's possible that the incoming Trump administration could cut funding for the National Institutes for Health (NIH), which ranks as the world's top public funding source for biomedical research.However, one of President-elect Donald Trump's primary advisers, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, has advocated in the past for the NIH's budget to be doubled. If Gingrich retains a great deal of influence over the soon-to-be president, Illumina could prosper like the gold rush shovel sellers of yesteryear.Biomarin has four products on the market in the U.S. that fit in the category of precision medicine. The biotech's top-selling drug Vimizim treats rare genetic disorder Morquio A syndrome. Kuvan is the first and only drug approved in the U.S. for treating another rare genetic disease, phenylketonuria (PKU). Naglazyme and Aldurazyme treat different types of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), an often-fatal genetic disorder.More precision medicines could be on the way. Biomarin expects a Food and Drug Administration decision by April 27, 2017, for Brineura in treating CLN2 disease, an extremely rare genetic neurological disorder that occurs in children. The biotech also has a late-stage study underway evaluating pegvaliase in treating PKU.Biomarin's stock is down nearly 20% this year. However, that decline masks a major rebound for Biomarin after its announcement in January that the FDA had turned down approval of Kyndrisa in treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy.In a survey conducted by Evercore ISI, biotech industry observers ranked Biomarin as the  over the next year. With quite a few larger biopharmaceutical companies sitting on a plenty of cash, I wouldn't be surprised if Biomarin indeed does find itself an acquisition candidate in 2017.Vertex could be a poster child for precision medicine. The company currently has two products on the market. Orkambi is approved for treating cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age six years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. Kalydeco is also approved for treating CF, but in patients age two years and older who have one of nine specific mutations in the CFTR gene.There's good news and bad for Vertex. The bad news is that its stock price has been clobbered in 2016, with shares down more than 40%. Patient compliance rates for Orkambi were lower than expected, impacting revenue. Kalydeco failed to win FDA approval earlier in the year for treating CF patients with another mutation in the CFTR gene. Vertex canceled a late-stage clinical study in August of experimental drug VX-661 in combination with Kalydeco.What's the good news? Vertex's stock should be primed for a rebound. Despite some challenges in 2016, the biotech could be in store for better days ahead. Vertex is still finalizing reimbursement agreements for Orkambi with several European countries and recently completed an agreement with Germany.The company also recently announced positive results from a late-stage study of Orkambi in treating CF patients ages six through 11 who have two copies of the F508del mutation. Vertex will submit for regulatory approval in Europe in the first half of 2017 based on these results.I wouldn't worry too much about the fate of President Barack Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative announced in his 2015 State of the Union address. Bipartisan support for precision medicine dates back to the George W. Bush presidency.Even if the federal government tightens purse strings on funding precision medicine, the push to develop new drugs using the approach won't go away. There's too much potential to ignore. Regardless of what happens in Washington, D.C., the future of precision medicine looks bright.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Although a  /Merrill Lynch study found that value stocks have outperformed growth stocks over the past 90 years with an average annual gain of 17% versus 12.6%, the low-interest-rate environment over the past eight years has allowed growth stocks access to cheap and bountiful capital to rapidly grow their business.But just because low interest rates favor growth stocks, it doesn't mean you can throw a dart and land a winner. Some growth stocks are better off avoided in 2017. Here are three such growth stocks that I'd suggest keeping you distance from next year.One high-profile growth stock that I'd strongly suggest investors leave parked on the sidelines in 2017 is electric vehicle manufacturer  (NASDAQ: TSLA) .This isn't to say Tesla isn't without its positives. Tesla obliterated Wall Street's earnings estimates in its third-quarter report, it wound up paying off about $600 million in debt, and its Model S sedan continues to gain market share. Perhaps most importantly, Tesla's production levels were a record of 25,185 vehicles, a 92% year-over-year increase and a 37% improvement from the sequential second quarter. Yet, in spite of an expected quadrupling in sales between 2015 and 2019, I'd advocate keeping your distance from Tesla because of three major risks.Image source: Getty Images.However, there are also two drawbacks to BioMarin. To begin with, incoming president Donald Trump in his latest interview with  suggested that he would lower drug prices in the United States, which is a point he previously stated on the campaign trail. Trump's only policy mention related to drug prices, thus far, was outlined in his seven-point healthcare reform. Within his proposal, Trump opines that consumers should be able to look overseas for their medicines, since similar drugs in overseas markets are typically priced lower than the U.S. It's unclear if Trump's call for lower drug prices will have any traction in Congress, but rare disease drugmakers like BioMarin that have drugs exceeding the $300,000 annual cost barrier are clearly on Trump's radar.An even more immediate issue could be BioMarin's ongoing losses. To some extent the company's steep full-year losses can be forgiven since it's reinvesting back into its pipeline. Then again, waiting until 2019 to see a full-year profit doesn't seem worthwhile for a company with a $14 billion market cap when you can go out and open a position in a number of rare-disease drugmakers that are already healthfully profitable, such as  or  .There appear to be far better options in biotech in 2017 than BioMarin Pharmaceutical.Finally, investors would probably be wise to step away from fashionable growth story  (NYSE: FIT) as we head into 2017.Like the growth stocks above, Fitbit does have positives that can be taken away. For example, Fitbit announced in its third-quarter earnings report that new products accounted for an amazing 79% of its quarterly revenue. Furthermore, total revenue increased 23% year over year, 60% of its customers were new, and 20% of its customers reactivated after being inactive for 90 or more days. This would imply strong new traffic to the brand.Image source: Fitbit.But I'll also admit that I was wrong advocating that Fitbit  back in October. Despite heavily reinvesting in its new products, the launches of those product, and marketing, all Fitbit got out of it was significantly lower margins and a reduced profit forecast. There's no denying that revenue rose 23% in Q3 2016 from Q3 2015, but just 11% of that was an increase in units sold. The remainder was comprised of price increases on its products. This would suggest that interest in Fitbit's products could be ebbing, even with a lot of extra money being spent on innovation and marketing. The company's lowered fourth-quarter guidance could imply a year-over-year decline in units sold, with a higher average selling price of those units leading to growth.Fitbit will also need to overcome the stigma of wearable technology that it's nothing more than a fad. In other words, can Fitbit get customers to continually upgrade their device in the same fashion that consumers upgrade their smartphones every year or two? Based on the data released during the third quarter, it doesn't look as if Fitbit's products are resonating enough with existing customers yet. That could change, but I wouldn't look for 2017 to be the year we see this ramp up in upgrades.Though Fitbit is on track to see its sales climb by more than 50% between 2015 and 2019, I'd suggest keeping your distance from this growth stock in 2017.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Organic sales growth was 0.9% driven by the Life Science segment. However, unfavorable foreign exchange impacted sales by 0.6%.The company reports results under three segments - Healthcare, Life Science and Performance Materials.The Healthcare division recorded sales of \u20ac1.7 billion, down 1.1% year over year primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations in Latin America and the return of Kuvan rights to BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  . However, organically, sales at the segment were up 1.3%.Erbitux's sales were down 1.8% from the year-ago period to \u20ac219 million while Rebif sales came in at \u20ac436 million, down 6.8% due to continued competitive pressures and negative currency impact. Gonal-f sales were up almost 9% to \u20ac182 million driven by favorable competition in the U.S.Sales at the Life Science segment amounted to \u20ac1.4 billion, up 83.1% primarily on the back of the Sigma-Aldrich acquisition which contributed 77.4% to sales. On an organic basis too, the segment witnessed strong sales growth (up 5.7%). The Process Solutions business recorded organic sales growth of 10.1%, while organic sales at Applied Solutions improved 3.3%.Performance Materials sales dipped 1.3% to \u20ac645 million. Organically, the segment witnessed a 5.8% decline in sales due to destocking by display industry customers. However, inclusion of Sigma-Aldrich's SAFC Hitech business contributed 3.5% to sales.Merck KGaA has reiterated its guidance for 2016. The company continues to expect net sales in the range of \u20ac14.9-\u20ac 15.1 billion. On an organic basis, sales are anticipated to grow moderately from the previous year. The Healthcare segment is expected to witness solid organic sales growth, while organic sales at Life Science are projected to grow in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage range. Performance Materials will, however, witness a moderate decline in 2016. Nevertheless, backed by the Sigma-Aldrich acquisition, the company continues to foresee a positive portfolio effect on sales in the low double-digit percentage range.Sales are, however, expected to be hurt by foreign exchange impact of 3-5% due to continued devaluation of the Latin American currencies.Merck KGaA is evaluating avelumab in a number of phase III studies for several cancer indications under its partnership with Pfizer Inc.  . In the reported quarter, the company initiated a phase III study - JAVELIN Ovarian 100 - on avelumab as a first-line treatment for ovarian cancer.Meanwhile, in October, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted to review a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for avelumab for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).The EMA has also accepted a regulatory application for Cladribine tablets for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.Merck KGaA's third-quarter earnings were encouraging with the company reporting a year-over-year improvement in both earnings and sales. Backed by the acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich, the company witnessed an encouraging performance at the Life Science segment in the quarter.Going ahead, we believe that the Sigma-Aldrich acquisition, in addition to the collaboration with Pfizer in the field of immuno-oncology, will pave the way for future growth. However, we remain concerned about the impact of negative foreign exchange fluctuations on sales in the coming quarters. | Investors looking for a favorably placed stock in the health care sector may consider Anika Therapeutics Inc.  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Methods that work well in normal times may break down under this stress. Traders and investors must ask:When trading based upon scientifically developed models, these questions are somewhat easier to answer. We have solid expectations for behavior and performance, because of extensive testing on a generous helping of out-of-sample data. Most importantly, the human managers know and understand the model inputs.We have great respect for our group of models, but we retain human control. This week, for example, Oscar liked our solar sector. We knew something that Oscar didn't - the likely effect of Trump policy on solar stocks. What appeared to be a buying opportunity, might be an illusion. The trade might still work, but there are other, safer choices that are nearly as good.Technical analysts can always be tempted by confirmation bias and their knowledge of events. When using models, you very sparingly use exceptions. If you view every trade as a suggestion, you wind up doing your own trading, with your model advice used only for (biased) confirmation.The Stock Exchange provides an expert-level debate on technical and fundamental analysis. I have placed more background at the end of the article. Comments, dissent, and specific stock questions are welcome!This week's featured expert is Athena. Vince (our  ) designed Athena to be very aggressive in finding new positions, but swift to exit those that were not working. These are not \"stops\" as we normally think of them. Exits are not based upon specific downside limits. Instead, there is an increased risk warning ((IRW)) that signals a change of behavior in how the stock is trading. The result is exceptionally good risk control both for individual positions and the overall portfolio. While we have not told the other models, Athena is Vince's favorite.Here are the ideas for this week, beginning with Athena, our featured expert.I love to make a quick buck finding trends. An insider secret: There's nothing trendier than the baseless speculation following a big election. My pick this week is Amgen (  ), one of many biotech stocks rocketing skyward since this week's big news. It's still attractive at this price, but I'll dump it in a heartbeat, maybe by Inauguration Day.You actually know about the election?  Yes, but don't tell the other models. They already resent my wisdom. I do not use fundamental information, but I am aware of it. This choice does seem logical on an earnings basis, as you can see from this chart. The stock trades at a discount and has a nice 2.7% dividend yield as well.It is nice to see that you finally agree with me on a choice. My other picks have also done well. I look for long-term themes. Oil and gas stocks have been a very long-term holding. We are picking up and I still am adding to the sector. I am going to pick Eclipse Resources (  ) as the example this week. This is a fairly small company with modest revenue but the chart reflects that of the big boys. That is a good sign and something that I like immensely.You have been early (a euphemism for \"wrong\" on energy and mining).  I sold some miners, as I will do when necessary. The energy investments will prove out in the long run. I have suggested a ceiling on energy prices in the low 50s, mostly due to more supply returning. That is a short-sighted, I mean short-term viewpoint. You will see.From Seeking Alpha Those were not comments for me - or for you.

My favorite sector this week is Diversified REITs, demonstrated here by Capstead Mortgage (  ). This area was already looking up at the beginning of October, and now we're seeing gains as a part of the broad-based post-election rally. Grab the rebound, make an easy layup, and move on to the next play.I thought that Holmes was our rebound specialist.  Sometimes the dog and I agree. This one has fundamental appeal as well. The dividend of 9.5% is great. The P/E is 12.3, above the average level of the last nine years, 7.9. What will happen as interest rates rise?  excellent tools help us out on that question. This chart shows the P/E versus interest rates over the last nine years.This week I'm picking Tractor Supply (TSCO), a specialty consumer cyclical stock. After a sharp decline in September, this stock has proceeded to consolidate and back-fill making a low of 61.62 on October 28th. This is a logical place for a stop. I bought this stock a few days ago at 65.91, so it is slightly higher now. I am looking for a nice rebound to the low-80s. If we start to rally, I'll be moving up my stop aggressively. Risking $4.30 to make $15.00 is the sort of Risk/Reward scenario I like. If I'm right just half the time, I can still be a big winner. There are plenty of these  . It is not just tractors.

(NASDAQ: JUNO) ,  (NASDAQ: VRTX) ,  (NASDAQ: BMRN) , and  (NASDAQ: CELG) were all up at least 10% as of 2:58 p.m., after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election yesterday.Hilary Clinton had been quite vocal about high drug prices and her plans to do something about them, including spurring competition. Now that it's clear she won't be in the White House, investors have taken the risk of lower drug prices out of their valuations.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' cystic fibrosis drugs and BioMarin Pharmaceuticals' orphan drugs have quite high prices, since they aren't used by very many patients. The prices of Celgene's cancer drugs are also pretty steep, but that's generally true of most cancer drugs. Juno Therapeutics doesn't have any therapies on the market yet, but since its cancer treatment is complex -- involving taking cells from patients, activating them, and then putting them back into the patient -- most investors expect it'll be quite expensive, likely priced higher than most cancer drugs.Interestingly, both Celgene's and BioMarin's managements noted on their recent earnings conference calls that very little of their revenue growth came from price hikes. \"Consistent with prior periods, our growth was predominantly volume-driven, as product volume grew 25%,\" noted Celgene's CFO Peter Kellogg of the 28% year-over-year growth in revenue.\"If there were any kind of regulation or policy around limiting the number or the amount of price increase one can implement every year or so, that would have zero impact on our business today, because that's not what we've been doing,\" said BioMarin's chairman and CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime.Based on today's move, investors clearly didn't buy Bienaime's zero-impact argument, perhaps because they were worried about other potential Clinton-sponsored mechanisms to lower drug prices beyond limiting further price hikes.While a Trump presidency might be good for drugmakers, their long-term growth in revenue will come from increasing sales of their current drugs and developing new ones, no matter who is president. That's what investors should be focused on now that the election is over.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After all, nearly all biotechs took a step back last month, as illustrated by the double-digit drop in the  (NASDAQ: IBB) : data by  .That being said, BioMarin did report somewhat disappointing Q3 results at the end of the month, where the company missed the Street's revenue estimate by roughly $10 million, or 3%. Although the drugmaker did post a healthy 34% rise in year-over-year revenue and slashed its net loss per diluted share by 56% for the three-month period, the market has been looking for any reason -- however slight -- to thrash biotech stocks lately.Apart from its improving cash flow situation, BioMarin's Q3 results highlighted the company's stellar progress on the clinical front. Of particular note, BioMarin's experimental treatment for achondroplasia (a form of short-limbed dwarfism), vosoritide, is reportedly now barreling toward a pivotal-stage trial by year's end. If approved, vosoritide has the potential to generate blockbuster-type sales figures, making it a key clinical asset to keep an eye on going forward.Turning to the question of whether BioMarin's shares are a buy after this steep pullback: My take is that it all depends on how you value the company's overall pipeline of drugs for rare diseases. The heart of the matter is that BioMarin's stock is still trading at around 14 times its 2017 estimated revenue. That's not exactly a bargain. However, there's something to be said about a company that's repeatedly been able to advance high-value drug candidates all the way from the lab to the market. Personally, though, I'd like to see this stock move a little lower before grabbing shares due to the downside risk associated with any potential clinical or regulatory setbacks over the next year or so.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, the figure failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $51.4 billion.All growth rates given below are on a year-over-year basis.McKesson operates through two segments - Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions.At Distribution Solutions, revenues grew 2.6% to $49.3 billion. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services reported sales of $41.4 billion, up 1.9%, reflecting market growth and acquisitions. Revenues were, however, hit by customer losses.Revenues from International pharmaceutical distribution and services were up 6.9% to $6.3 billion driven by acquisitions and market growth. Medical-Surgical distribution and services generated sales of $1.6 billion, up 3.8%, primarily on the back of market growth.However, revenues from the Technology Solutions business dropped 5.7% to $680 million in anticipation of a decline in the hospital software business.Note that in Jun 2016, McKesson inked an agreement with Change Healthcare Holdings to create a new healthcare information technology company.

Nevertheless, reported revenues were up on a sequential basisDr. Reddy's reports revenues under three segments - Global Generics, Pharmaceutical Services & Active Ingredients (PSAI), and Proprietary Products and Others.Global Generics revenues fell almost 12% year over year to $435 million, due to lower contribution from North America and loss of sales in Venezuela. Like the previous quarters, the company recorded negligible revenues in Venezuela. On a sequential basis, however, revenues were up 9%.Revenues in North America declined 13% (in local currency) due to increased competition for Valcyte, Vidaza and the injectable franchise, pricing pressure, and moderation in volume uptake.In the Emerging Markets, the company recorded a 27% (in local currency) decline in revenues.However, India continued to perform well. Revenues from the region grew 14% year over year on the back of the integration of the portfolio acquired from UCB S.A.  in the company's supply chain.Meanwhile, sales in Europe declined 16% in local currency.PSAI revenues were down 2% to $87 million. However, revenues were surged 23% from the prior quarter on the back of improved order flow and supply situations.Revenues at the Proprietary Products and Others segment came in at $16 million, down 10% year over year but up 6% sequentially.

This increase was due to expenses associated with the IPR&D assets in-licensed from Xenoport and Eisai.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $177 million, up 6.6%, primarily due to higher employee costs and marketing expenses for events in the quarter.As of Sep 30, the company has 85 generic filings pending FDA approval (83 abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and 2 NDAs filed under the 505(b)(2) route), of which 56 were Para IV filings and 19 had \"first-to-file\" status.Dr. Reddy's witnessed year-over-year declines in both the top line and the bottom line in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

However revenues rose 38% from the year-ago period.Vertex's third-quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis (CF) products Kalydeco ($175.6 million), Orkambi ($234.0 million), collaborative ($0.03 million) and royalty revenues ($3.8 million).The company reported a 6% increase in Kalydeco sales in the third quarter from the year-ago period.Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor), approved for the treatment of CF in people aged 12 and above with two copies of the F508del mutation, delivered sales of $234.0 million, up 79% year over year.Adjusted (including stock-based compensation expense) research and development expenses increased 3.2% to $254 million. Third-quarter adjusted (including stock-based compensation expense) selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 12.4% to $105.2 million.Vertex maintained its guidance for Kalydeco and Orkambi revenues for the full year 2016. While Kalydeco revenues are expected in the range of $685-$705 million, Orkambi revenues are expected in the range of $950 million-$990 million.We remind investors that last month, Vertex lowered its 2016 guidance for Orkambi sales to the range of $950-$990 million from the previously expected $1.0-$1.1 billion. The revision was primarily due to slower-than-anticipated launch of Orkambi in Germany, the close to peak penetration for the approved indication in the U.S., and less-than-expected refills in the months of July and August.Orkambi was approved for use in children (6-11 years old) by the FDA last month. About 2,400 children with CF in the U.S. fall in this category. This marketed drug is expected to drive sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in 2017.A six-month phase III efficacy study in this patient population is currently ongoing to support EU approval where a regulatory application is slated to be submitted in the first half of 2017. Orkambi is also in a late-stage study in children belonging to the 2-5 years age group.The company said that pricing and reimbursement approvals for patients qualified for Orkambi outside of the U.S. are expected to drive significant growth in sales in 2017.Vertex continues to expect operating expenses in the range of $1.18-$1.23 billion in 2016. In addition to working on expanding Kalydeco's and Orkambi's labels, Vertex is developing VX-661, VX-371 and its next-generation correctors - VX-152 and VX-440. | The company issued a separate press release announcing its plan to start two phase II studies to examine the next-generation correctors VX-440 and VX-152 in people with cystic fibrosis (CF).Vertex is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock.

Reported earnings were able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80.Total sales in the third quarter improved 2.3% to \u20ac11.3 billion (approximately $13 billion) on a reported basis. Adjusted for currency and portfolio effects related to the Pharmaceuticals business, the figure was up 3.5%. Quarterly sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.4 billion.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and after adjusting for currency and portfolio changes.Effective from the first quarter, Bayer reports results under five divisions - Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health, Crop Science, Animal Health and Covestro.Revenues at the Pharmaceuticals segment increased 7.6% backed by a persistently strong performance of the recently launched products Xarelto, Eylea, Xofigo, Stivarga and Adempas. Performance of the established product portfolio was mixed in the third quarter of 2016. While Mirena, Glucobay and Avalox/Avelox witnessed an impressive upside, sales of Kogenate/Kovaltry, Nexavar and Betaferon/Betaseron declined. Overall, the company successfully expanded the Pharmaceuticals business in all the regions.Consumer Health sales were up 3.6% to \u20ac1.4 billion driven by improvement across all regions including Latin America/Africa/Middle East, Asia/Pacific regions and North America, except Europe. Products like Aleve, Alka-Seltzer and Elevit recorded encouraging sales growth. However, Coppertone witnessed a decline in the U.S. due to lower sales.Crop Science sales were flat at \u20ac2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2016 due to the ongoing market weakness. While fungicides registered growth, insecticides and herbicides were down.Sales of the Animal Health business came in at \u20ac360 million, up 2.5%. Sales in the Asia/Pacific region and Europe reflected growth, while the North American business declined slightly.Covestro garnered sales of approximately \u20ac3 billion in the quarter, up 1%. Overall, volumes were up, particularly at the Polycarbonates and Polyurethanes units.Although Bayer reiterated its sales outlook, the company has raised its expectations for core earnings per share.The company continues to expect sales of \u20ac46 billion to \u20ac47 billion, including contribution from Covestro. This represents growth in the low-single-digit percentage range.The Life Science businesses are still anticipated to rake in sales of approximately \u20ac35 billion, excluding the contribution from Covestro. This corresponds to growth in the mid single-digit percentage range.At Pharmaceuticals, Bayer continues to projects sales to be above \u20ac16 billion, reflecting a high single-digit improvement. Bayer plans to make efforts to ramp up sales of recently launched products to around \u20ac5.5 billion.In the Consumer Health Division, sales are still anticipated to be approximately \u20ac6 billion, indicating low-to-mid single-digit growth.Bayer continues to expect Crop Science sales are estimated to be about \u20ac10 billion, flat year over year, thanks to the persistently challenging market environment.At Animal Health, Bayer continues to expect sales to increase in the low-to-mid single-digit percentage range. For 2016, Bayer continues to expect a sales decline for Covestro.Bayer now projects core earnings, which include the company's remaining stake in Covestro, to improve in the high-single-digit percentage range (previous expectations: mid-to-high single-digit percentage range). | Bayer delivered better-than-expected third-quarter 2016 results, wherein both the top and the bottom line surpassed expectations. The Life Science businesses generated impressive sales growth, particularly Pharmaceuticals. Moreover, newly launched products at the Pharmaceuticals segment performed impressively during the quarter and should continue to do so in the upcoming quarters. The company's raised outlook for core earnings for 2016 is also encouraging.Meanwhile, Bayer is looking to acquire Monsanto Company  in a deal worth approximately $66 billion.

Reported revenues included an estimated benefit of about $150 million of additional sales in Japan resulting from the timing of shipments in anticipation of a resource planning system that the company will implement in the fourth quarter of 2016.Currency movement negatively impacted revenues by 1%.Merck's Pharmaceutical segment posted revenues of $9.4 billion, up 6% year over year. Products like Keytruda, Gardasil/Gardasil 9 and ProQuad performed well. Keytruda brought in sales of $356 million in the third quarter of 2016, up from $314 million in the second quarter of 2016. Sales continued to be driven by new indications and geographical expansion.Zetia/Vytorin sales inched up 1% to $944 million, reflecting higher sales in Japan due to the timing of shipments. Zetia is expected to lose market exclusivity in the U.S. in Dec 2016 and sales are expected to decline significantly thereafter.Gardasil/Gardasil 9 sales surged 38% to $860 million, indicating the timing of public sector purchases, and higher pricing and demand in the U.S.Recently launched hepatitis C virus treatment, Zepatier, brought in sales of $164 million, up from $112 million in the second quarter of 2016.Meanwhile, sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Nasonex (generic version launched in the U.S. in Mar 2016), Cubicin (lost patent protection in the U.S. in Jun 2016), Januvia/Janumet and Isentress recorded a decline.Merck's Animal Health segment posted revenues of $865 million, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.Marketing and administrative (M&A) expenses declined 3% to $2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting lower selling costs and promotional spending due to prioritizing investments in key brands and the favorable foreign exchange movement.Research and development (R&D) spend increased 5% to $1.6 billion in the quarter, reflecting higher clinical development spending.Merck narrowed and raised its 2016 guidance for both earnings and revenues. The company now expects earnings in the range of $3.71 to $3.78 per share, including approximately 1% negative foreign exchange impact. At the time of releasing second-quarter 2016 results, the company had guided earnings of $3.67-$3.77 per share, including around 1% negative foreign exchange impact.Merck now expects revenue in the range of $39.7-$40.2 billion, including negative currency impact of approximately 2%. At the time of releasing second-quarter 2016 results, the company had guided revenues of $39.1-$40.1 billion, including negative foreign exchange impact of approximately 2%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $3.74 on revenues of $39.65 billion, respectively.Meanwhile, Merck continues to expect a year-over-year decline in M&A spend and an increase in R&D spend. The company had spent $6.6 billion and $9.8 billion on R&D and M&A, respectively, in 2015. | Merck delivered better-than-expected third-quarter 2016 results with both the top and the bottom line surpassing expectations. The top line will, however, remain under pressure mainly due to increased competition as well as generic entry. The company will thus continue to pursue cost-cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line.Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the company's efforts to expand its pipeline and focus on core areas of expertise. The company has made significant progress with its pipeline and is working on bringing new products to market.

Shares declined 1% in  .Third-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents by 8.3%.Earnings also declined 1% from the year-ago quarter. A softer top-line performance, higher operating costs and lower other income hurt earnings in the quarter.Reported earnings (including special items) declined 3% to 73 cents per share in the third quarter.Third-quarter revenues grew 5% to $5.19 billion. However, sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.35 billion by almost 3%.Lower outside U.S. sales, sluggish sales of blockbuster diabetes drug Humalog and a weak performance by animal health products offset a strong performance of the recently-launched drugs.Higher volumes and a slightly favorable impact of foreign currency (1%) were partially offset by lower realized prices.Volumes rose 4% as higher volumes of new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz and Jardiance was offset by lower volumes of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta and Cialis as well as the Animal Health division.U.S. revenues grew 12% to $2.84 billion reflecting higher volume for newer products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz and Jardiance, as well as Erbitux and Humalog. However, the Animal Health business and drugs like Zyprexa and Cialis recorded lower volumes in the quarter. Moreover, lower realized prices for Humalog restricted sales growth.Ex-U.S. revenues declined 3% to $2.35 billion, mainly due to lower volumes and realized prices. Higher volumes of newer products like Cyramza and Trulicity were partially offset lower volumes of Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Alimta due to the loss of exclusivity of these drugs. Exclusivity has been lost by Cymbalta in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries.Erbitux sales increased 115% to $184.6 million in the quarter.Other products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo (up 12% to $391.2 million), Humulin (up 2% to $322.0 million), Strattera (up 1% to $198.8 million) and Cymbalta (up 29% to $313.5 million).However, Humalog's sales decreased 9% to $640.8 million in the quarter reflecting lower realized prices in the U.S. (which offset higher demand) and lower outside U.S. sales.Though erectile dysfunction medicine Cialis' sales increased 4% to $588.2 million backed by higher realized prices in the U.S, the drug witnessed lower demand. Moreover, outside U.S. sales of Cialis also declined due to decreased volumes.Alimta sales declined 9% to $570.4 million, reflecting lower demand in the U.S. due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents. Outside U.S. sales of Alimta were hurt by loss of exclusivity in several countries.Zyprexa sales declined 37% to $148.9 million. Loss of exclusivity is affecting sales of Zyprexa.Lilly's Animal Health segment sales declined 9% to $706.2 million. Unfavorable wholesaler buying patterns for companion animal products and decreased revenues for food animal products in the U.S. and lower food animal products' sales outside U.S. following unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in Latin America hurt the segment's sales.Among new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $243.6 million with U.S. revenues benefiting from the acceleration in growth of the GLP-1 market and increased market share. Cyramza revenues were $159 million, up 43% year over year with U.S. revenues being negatively impacted by competition in the non-small cell lung cancer indication. Ex-U.S. revenues benefited from a strong uptake for the gastric cancer indication in Japan.Jardiance sales ($47.5 million) were driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class.

Merck expects to launch Zinplava in the first quarter of 2017.Note that Zinplava can only be used in combination with an antibacterial drug treatment for the disease.Zinplava was approved on the basis of two global, double-blind, phase III studies, MODIFY I and MODIFY II. These studies evaluated the use of bezlotoxumab alone or in combination with actoxumab, in comparison to placebo, for the prevention of recurrent CDI in patients receiving standard-of-care antibiotics.We remind investors that earlier this year, an FDA advisory panel had voted (10 to 5 with one abstention) that the company has provided substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of Zinplava for the prevention of C. difficile infection recurrence in patients aged 18 years and older.The FDA was initially expected to respond on Jul 23, 2016; however, the PDUFA date was extended by three months as the company was asked to submit new data and analyses MODIFY I and MODIFY II that were a part of the Biologics Licensing Application (BLA).Both the studies met the primary efficacy endpoints. They showed that a single, one-time infusion of bezlotoxumab, along with the standard-of-care CDI antibiotic treatment, significantly reduced the recurrence of the infection compared to the standard of care alone. Bezlotoxumab showed this benefit for more than a 12-week period.Zinplava was developed jointly by researchers at University of Massachusetts Medical School's MassBiologics Laboratory and Medarex, a biopharmaceutical company which is now part of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company  .

We remind investors that Opdivo was granted Breakthrough Therapy status in the U.S. for mUC in Jun 2016.The regulatory application included data from a single-arm phase II study - CheckMate -275 - on Opdivo. | Notably, Opdivo was accepted for review in the EU last month for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable or mUC in adults after a failure of prior platinum-containing therapy.Earlier this month, Bristol-Myers presented data from the CheckMate -275 study at European Society for Medical Oncology Congress. The data showed that Opdivo had a confirmed objective response rate, the primary endpoint, of 19.6% in platinum-refractory patients with mUC.Per the company's press release, bladder cancer is the ninth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, accounting for an estimated 430,000 new cases per year resulting in 165,000 deaths annually. UC is the most common type of bladder cancer, which accounts for roughly 90% of the cases.We note that Opdivo is already approved in both the U.S. and the EU for various cancer indications. Bristol-Myers is working on expanding the drug's label even further. Opdivo is currently under priority review in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. A response from the FDA is expected by Nov 11. The drug is also under review in the EU for the same indication.Opdivo had generated worldwide sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2016.

Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 8.6% return against the $65 commitment, or a 6.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to BMRN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $65 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. sees its shares fall 21.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $59.40 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $5.60 from $65), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6.9% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., and highlighting in green where the $65 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $65 strike for the 6.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $83.08) to be 46%.

For the SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactors ETF (Symbol: QUS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $68.57 per unit.With QUS trading at a recent price near $62.16 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.31% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QUS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN), lululemon athletica inc (Symbol: LULU), and (Symbol: LSXMA). Although BMRN has traded at a recent price of $84.20/share, the average analyst target is 41.25% higher at $118.93/share. Similarly, LULU has 27.94% upside from the recent share price of $57.77 if the average analyst target price of $73.91/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LSXMA to reach a target price of $42.05/share, which is 25.90% above the recent price of $33.40.

It is also first monoclonal antibody to be approved for STS. Note that Lartruvo received Fast Track, Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy designations from the FDA for this indication.However, Lartruvo has only been approved under accelerated approval. It was based on data from the phase II JGDG study. Under this program, Eli Lilly has to provide results from an ongoing confirmatory phase III study, ANNOUNCE, which is fully enrolled, for continued approval.JGDG is an open-label, randomized, active-controlled study that evaluated 133 STS patients. The study compared Lartruvo, in combination with doxorubicin chemotherapy, with doxorubicin alone. The study demonstrated encouraging results with median overall survival (OS) improving by 11.8 months in patients on the Lartruvo arm.Median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with Lartruvo and doxorubicin was 8.2 months, compared to 4.4 months for doxorubicin alone.We remind investors that last month, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion for a conditional marketing authorization of olaratumab for the same indication.According to the American Cancer Society, around 12,000 new cases of STS were diagnosed in 2015, resulting in nearly 5000 deaths in the U.S. alone. Hence, Lartruvo will be able to cater to significant unmet medical need worldwide.Eli Lilly has been working on building its pipeline and has a wide range of compounds in different stages of development. Notable pipeline agents include baricitinib (rheumatoid arthritis), abemaciclib (metastatic breast cancer and NSCLC), galcanezumab (cluster headache and migraine prevention) and AZD3293 (Alzheimer's disease).

The company is evaluating ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies. We expect investors to react positively to the news.The randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel- comparison design study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two dose levels of ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg and 1mg/1mg). Data from the study showed that ALKS 5461 2mg/2mg met the pre-specified primary endpoint of significantly reducing the symptoms of depression in patients with MDD in comparison to placebo. Though the 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS 5461 led to improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, it did not vary significantly from placebo.On the safety front, ALKS 5461 was found to be well tolerated and the most commonly reported adverse events were consistent with those observed in the previously reported studies on the candidate.Alkermes intends to present detailed data from the FORWARD-5 study at a forthcoming medical meeting.On the basis of these data as well as considerable amount of data collected to date on the efficacy and safety of ALKS 5461 for the treatment of MDD, the company plans to request a meeting with the FDA's Division of Psychiatric Products on the regulatory path ahead for the candidate.We note that the FORWARD-5 is one of the phase III efficacy study that was conducted under the FORWARD program on ALKS 5461. Results from FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 were announced earlier in Jan 2016.We are encouraged by the latest study results. As per Alkermes' press release, MDD affects an estimated 17 million people in the U.S. in any given year, the majority of whom may not adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy.

It compares and evaluates the effect of various doses of single or multiple subcutaneous injections of PCSK9si. The study is being conducted in a total of 501 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk equivalents (hypercholesterolemia).The interim data demonstrated that PCSK9si led to a significant and durable reduction of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol upto day 90. PCSK9si was well tolerated throughout the study, with infrequent and mild or moderate injection site reactions.Further results from the ORION-1 study, including the Day 180 follow-up for up to 200 patients, are expected to be presented at an American Heart Association meeting scheduled for Nov 15, 2016.The Medicines Company is developing PCSK9si under a collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  , which was inked in early 2013.

The reported figure, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.88 billion by a whisker.Roche reports results under two divisions - Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Sales at the Pharmaceuticals division increased 2% year over year at constant exchange rates (CER), driven by the performance of oncology and immunology products in the quarter.Diagnostics division sales climbed 8% primarily on the back of immunodiagnostic products.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.In the nine months of 2016, sales were up 4%. Growth was primarily aided by sales growth in both Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics due to newly launched products.Sales at the Pharmaceuticals division increased 4% on the back of strong demand for breast cancer drugs Perjeta and Herceptin as well as for rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra/RoActemra.While Herceptin sales improved 5% mainly due to rising demand in the U.S. and Europe, and expanded reimbursement in additional provinces in China, Perjeta sales surged 31% largely due to uptake in the neo-adjuvant setting and continually strong growth in the metastatic setting.Meanwhile, sales of Avastin continued to witness strong growth in the international region (19%), especially China where sales were driven by improved access in the lung cancer setting. However, sales in the U.S. slipped 4%. Robust sales of Rituxan/MabThera (3%) also contributed significantly to the top line. Growth in Gazyva/Gazyvaro (54%) was seen in the U.S. and Europe despite increasing competition in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Recently launched drugs, Tecentriq for bladder cancer and Alecensa for lung cancer are off to an encouraging start. Initial uptake in the U.S. has been strong.Performance of the immunology franchise was driven by increased sales of Actemra/RoActemra (17%), and strong uptake of Esbriet (45%) and Xolair (17%). Increasing use of Actemra/RoActemra as a single agent and in the subcutaneous formulation were the key growth drivers globally.Sales of Valcyte/Cymevene (-15%) and Xeloda (-10%) were hit by generic competition.Revenues at the Diagnostics division climbed 7% on the back of solid performance of the Professional Diagnostics (9%) unit, which was in turn, propelled by Immunodiagnostics (14%). Tissue Diagnostics (13%) and Molecular Diagnostics (7%) also performed impressively.However, Diabetes Care sales declined 2% due to continued pricing pressure in the U.S. Sales continue to be impacted by challenging market conditions, particularly in North America.Roche continues to expect sales to grow in the low-to-mid single digits. The company expects core earnings to grow ahead of sales.The company intends to further increase its dividend in 2016 in local currency.Meanwhile, Roche continues to progress with its pipeline. Regulatory applications for Ocrevus for the treatment of both relapsing and primary progressive multiple sclerosis are under review in both the EU and the U.S. (priority review with a response expected by Dec 28, 2016).Earlier this week, Tecentriq became the first and only anti-PDL1 cancer immunotherapy to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. | Although third-quarter 2016 sales fell marginally short of expectations, performance of both the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics divisions were encouraging. New drug launches, such as Tecentriq, Cotellic and Alecensa, boosted sales and should continue to do so in the upcoming quarters.However, headwinds in the form of generic competition for Xeloda and Valcyte may continue to hurt sales. Going forward, we expect investors to focus on new drug approvals, as the top line could be marred by the entry of biosimilars (expected in the second half of 2017 in Europe) for key drugs like Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin.Roche currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Contributions aren't deductible, but that money grows tax-free, potentially for decades, and withdrawals after reaching the required age are free and clear of any taxes or penalties.Both capital gains and dividends can accumulate tax-free in a Roth IRA, a fact that makes some stocks better than others. We asked three of our contributors to discuss a stock that would be a perfect fit for a Roth IRA due to their growth potential. Here's what they had to say. I guess there is no better way to suggest a company for a Roth IRA than to say that it is a holding in my own Roth IRA:  (NYSE: WM) . What makes Waste Management a compelling stock to own in a Roth is two fold. The first is that it is a business that is likely to be around for a long time. The waste handling business is extremely difficult to disrupt because of the amount of capital needed to get a business large enough to compete. Then, there is the tricky regulatory and slightly political aspect that gives established business a big advantage -- think trying to get the permits for a new landfill. With that competitive advantage platform, Waste Management has built a business that generates high rates of return and uses those returns to reward shareholders.So Waste Management's business certainly has the qualities you want for a long-term holding in a retirement account. The other reason this one is worth adding to a Roth IRA is you get to use the tax advantages of the account to benefit even more from the company's dividend. While the company's 2.6% dividend yield today won't wow anyone, the company has grown its payout at a decent clip of 6.5% annually over the past 12 years and has bought back 24% of all shares outstanding over that time frame. The efforts from the company to increase shareholder value through these means and the  in a tax advantaged account can do wonders for your retirement portfolio. That's why I own it in my Roth IRA, and why you should consider it as well. Novel drugs or therapies that target rare diseases are perhaps the most coveted types of assets within the high growth pharmaceutical industry. The basic issue at play is that so-called \"orphan\" drugs, or drugs indicated for diseases that afflict fewer than 200,000 people, come with a variety of benefits for their manufacturers, including premium prices, little to no push back from payers, extended periods of exclusivity, tax breaks, and arguably less competition, depending on the indication. Orphan drugs, on balance, also tend to require far less capital to bring to market, enabling their manufacturers to avoid taking on the unsightly amount of debt that frequently plagues small to mid-sized biopharmas.With these advantages in mind, I think the mid-cap orphan drug specialist  (NASDAQ: BMRN) would be a great stock to sock away in a Roth IRA. BioMarin presently has five drugs on the market for orphan indications, such as the carbohydrate processing disorder Morquio A, as well as for Phenylketonuria, a condition characterized by a person's inability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine. BioMarin also sports an exciting clinical pipeline of high-value orphan drug candidates for conditions like short-limbed dwarfism and hemophilia A.Aside from BioMarin's diverse product portfolio and clinical pipeline, the company is also set to post some of the highest levels of revenue growth within the pharmaceutical industry. Specifically, the drugmaker's top line is forecast to grow by over 26% this year, and by more than 18% in 2017. And if you throw in the fact that BioMarin has relatively little leverage on its balance sheet, with a modest debt to equity ratio of 34.9%, this stock looks, like a superb growth vehicle to hold for the long haul. The ideal stock for a Roth IRA is one that pays a hearty dividend and has the potential to appreciate in value over the long run.  (NASDAQ: CSCO) , the dominant leader in the networking hardware market, checks both boxes.Cisco is undergoing a transformation, shifting away from being a seller of hardware and toward being a provider of solutions.  will be the key to the company's growth going forward, with areas like security and collaboration offsetting slow growth in the switching and routing businesses. In fiscal year 2016, while the switching business was flat and the routing business suffered a small revenue decline, security and collaboration grew by 13% and 9%, respectively.What makes  enticing is a pessimistic valuation and a nice dividend. Analysts expect Cisco to produce adjusted EPS of $2.43 in fiscal year 2017, putting the forward P/E ratio at just 12.5. If you value the net cash on Cisco's balance sheet fully and back it out, that ratio drops to just 9.5. Add to that low valuation a dividend yield of 3.4%, and the result is a stock that deserves a place in your Roth IRA.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

This was due to increases in alanine aminotransferase levels that were observed to exceed the pre-specified threshold set by the company. Subsequent to the suspension of the study, the company reviewed safety and efficacy data on the nine patients with the MHRA. On the basis of the review, the MHRA approved the continuation of the study.BioMarin plans to resume enrollment in the study before the end of 2016.

Earlier this March, BMN 270 received orphan drug status in the EU for the treatment of hemophilia A.Current prescribed treatments for hemophilia A include Biogen Inc.'s  Eloctate and Shire plc's  Adynovate among others.Apart from BMN 270, BioMarin has a robust pipeline of candidates targeting orphan diseases.

Other growth drivers include Stelara, Invega Sustenna, Remicade and Simponi.Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment Olysio continued to feel the impact of additional competition with sales declining 73.4% from the year-ago quarter. Invega sales also declined due to generic competition. Invokana/Invokamet sales declined 3.5% in the quarter.J&J's pharma segment also achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including label expansion for products like Invokamet and Stelara.The Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.2 billion, up 1.1% from the year-ago period, comprising an operational increase of 0.7% and positive currency movement of 0.4%.Sales in the domestic market grew 1.4% year over year to $3.05 billion. International market sales inched up 0.7% year over year to $3.11 billion.Operational growth was driven by endocutters and energy in the Advanced Surgery business; electrophysiology products in the Cardiovascular business; Acuvue contact lenses in the Vision Care business; and joint reconstruction and trauma products in the Orthopedics business.The company is working on driving growth in the Medical Devices segment through new product launches and by transforming its commercial models.The Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.3 billion in the reported quarter, down 1.6% from the third quarter of 2015. Foreign currency movement negatively impacted sales in the segment by 1.7%.

Lower trade inventory levels, primarily in the U.S., however hurt sales to an extent.Johnson & Johnson raised the lower end of the 2016 earnings guidance. It now expects earnings per share in the range of $6.68 - $6.73 compared with $6.63 - $6.73 expected earlier. We remind investors that J&J had raised its 2016 earnings guidance at the second quarter call as well.The revenue guidance was maintained in the range of $71.5 billion - $72.2 billion. | The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Johnson & Johnson delivered another strong quarter with both earnings and revenues surpassing expectations. The Pharmaceutical segment continues to perform well despite challenges like generic competition for a few products, negative currency impact and lower HCV revenues. In this regard, we would like to mention that Pfizer Inc.  announced on Monday that its Inflectra injection, a biosimilar version of J&J's blockbuster drug Remicade, will be available in the U.S. in late November. This should pose strong competition to Remicade.The company also raised its earnings outlook for the year.

(  ) during the third quarter. TreeHouse is the largest private label food manufacturer and distributor in North America. An aphorism in the private label industry is that \"a grocer is only as good as their private label.\" As such, private label food has been growing its share of the North American food industry over the past several years, as consumers have sought value in comparison with branded food, and as grocery retailers and other food vendors have pursued the greater profitability to themselves of private label products. This trend primarily began in national-brand equivalents, in which TreeHouse and other private label manufacturers offer products of comparable quality to brand names but at better prices. However, much of TreeHouse's growth in recent years has come from premium products, which often might be natural/organic/healthy choices and possibly of even greater quality or featuring greater innovation (flavors/recipes) than competing branded products. Having evolved from simply offering retail customers a \"good/better/best\" option of national brand equivalents, the Company has begun to offer deeper category segmentation and insights, while developing and manufacturing multi-tiered pricing assortments, so their retail customers can better compete under the pricing umbrella typically created by higher priced national brands. Many of TreeHouse's best customers, including large, growing retailers such as Trader Joe's, Aldi's, Amazon, and Kroger, have embraced this more complete portfolio strategy of private label products, which offers the retailers not only improved profitability but also better sales opportunities, as well. In addition, TreeHouse's scale and presence in over -\u2026 food categories, enhances its value proposition, which is to help grocery customers hone in on this secular trend towards customized store brands.The Company has been growing successfully through acquisition since its formation in -\u2026\u20265. TreeHouse has driven value in its acquired businesses by bringing to bear greater operational capabilities and expertise, greater resources behind innovation and customer research, much greater scale and buying power, and an extensive existing customer list into which the acquired businesses could sell. In early -\u2026-6, TreeHouse completed the transformational acquisition of the Private Brands business of ConAgra Foods, effectively doubling TreeHouse's revenue base and operating footprint while removing its only private label competitor of any meaningful size, all at what we view as an attractive purchase price. The acquired business had struggled under the ownership of ConAgra, which historically had been a branded player and which had not understood the different skill set required to operate a private label business. We believe that TreeHouse comprehensively understands these operational issues and already has begun to remedy them. Better execution at the acquired business, which will drive improving revenue growth and margins, combined with significant cost savings opportunities as a result of the combined companies' greatly enhanced scale, will allow TreeHouse to deliver roughly 7\u2026% earnings growth from the time of the acquisition to the completion of its integration in -\u2026-8. During this integration, we likely will see smaller tuck-in acquisitions, as the company's capital structure still allows it to be active in consolidating the industry. We estimate that the company has less than -\u2026% market share in North America, with plenty of room to expand organically and through acquisition, both within its current -\u2026+ product categories and in adjacent and new categories.We think TreeHouse's dominant scale and attractive growth opportunity are unique enough to warrant an initial position in portfolios. As the company executes its strategy, we expect strong operating earnings growth to drive the performance of the stock, which we think currently trades at an attractive price to growth multiple.From Wedgewood Partners' third quarter -\u2026-6  .Read More: About GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

In the U.S. and Canada, Belkyra is marketed under the trade name Kybella. It is also licensed in 10 other countries across the globe.Belkyra was granted the Swedish Marketing Authorisation following an approval by the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA).Belkyra is the first and only FDA-approved non-surgical injectable treatment for the reduction of moderate-to-severe submental fullness.Note that Belkyra was evaluated in four phase III clinical studies involving more than 2,600 patients worldwide, two each in North America and Europe. Results from the studies demonstrated a high overall efficacy rate, as shown by a 1-grade improvement in fullness under the chin at 12 weeks after the last treatment. While European studies recorded a 63.8% improvement, North American trials witnessed a 78.5% improvement. Moreover, both the studies saw better improvement in the psychological impact caused by the fullness when treated with Belkyra compared to placebo.According to data provided by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS), 67% of people with a double chin are bothered by the condition. Assuming further approvals in other European countries in the coming months, Allergan expects Belkyra to generate substantial revenues. Allergan's prospects are quite impressive as well.

Several big buyouts have taken place this year, and it's only a matter of time before the industry is abuzz over the next one.But which biotech stocks are most likely to be acquired? Investment bank Evercore ISI polled 244 industry observers on that very question. Here are the three biotechs that survey respondents thought would be the most likely buyout targets over the next year. (NASDAQ: INCY) snagged the most votes in the Evercore ISI survey -- 14% of participants in the survey thought that the biotech would likely be scooped up by a bigger player over the next 12 months.The big attraction for Incyte is its JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor Jakafi, which is approved in the U.S. as a treatment for the bone-marrow diseases myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Incyte received $391.4 million in revenue from U.S. sales of Jakafi in the first half of 2016, and made another $47.9 million in royalties from sales outside of the U.S. by  . Peak annual sales for Jakafi in the U.S. are expected to reach over $1.5 billion.Incyte's pipeline could also interest prospective buyers. The biotech licensed another JAK inhibitor, baricitinib, to  . Baricitinib is currently awaiting regulatory approval as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. While Lilly stands to receive the lion's share of revenue if the drug wins approval, Incyte could eventually see revenue as high as $1 billion annually from baricitinib if all goes well.Another pipeline candidate with plenty of potential, epacadostat, is in a late-stage study targeting treatment of melanoma. Analysts think epacadostat might generate peak annual sales of over $3 billion if approved.Perhaps the biggest hurdle for potential buyers to overcome is Incyte's valuation: The biotech's market cap currently stands at $18 billion, and Incyte would fetch even more in a buyout. Any larger company looking to make this acquisition would need to feel very good about the prospects of Incyte's pipeline candidates. (NASDAQ: BIIB) ranked second on the Evercore ISI survey of biotechs most likely to be acquired, with 12% of respondents voting for the company. These industry observers must be itching for a megadeal: Biogen's current market cap is well over $67 billion.There's definitely a lot to like about the biotech. Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise is impressive, led by Tecfidera, with Plegridy growing sales quickly. But is Biogen more likely to buy smaller companies than sell to a larger player? Maybe not.In a few months, Biogen will be smaller than it is now. In early 2017 the company plans to spin off its hemophilia business into a new company, to be called Bioverativ. Biogen expects this spinoff to increase value for shareholders. I think they're on the right track -- and the move could make Biogen a more attractive acquisition target.Biogen's pipeline is intriguing. Nusinersen, which targets treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, awaits FDA approval. Aducanumab, which has the potential to be the first effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease, is in a late-stage study. If Biogen can successfully get these drugs across the finish line, today's price will look like a steal.The Evercore ISI survey identified  (NASDAQ: BMRN) as the third most likely biotech buyout over the next year. BioMarin narrowly trailed Biogen by garnering 10% of the vote.BioMarin's market cap of under $16 billion is the lowest of the top three acquisition targets in the survey. The company's product lineup includes four approved drugs: Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan, and Aldurazyme. All four drugs target rare genetic diseases.Vimizim, which treats Morquio A syndrome, is BioMarin's top-seller, generating $179.4 million in the first half of 2016; the drug could eventually reach peak annual sales of $800 million. Peak annual sales for the biotech's other three approved drugs are expected to be between $400 million and $500 million.Two drugs in BioMarin's pipeline should be quite appealing to potential buyers. An FDA decision on Batten disease drug Brineura is expected by Jan. 27, 2017. BioMarin anticipates filing for regulatory approval of pegvaliase, which targets treatment of rare genetic blood disease phenylketonuria (PKU), in fourth-quarter 2016 or first-quarter 2017.I suspect bigger companies could be drawn to BioMarin largely because the company develops drugs for indications that few other biotechs are targeting. With this competitive moat, BioMarin, in my view, is a very likely takeover target.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Sunesis is looking to get Qinprezo approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients aged 60 years and older.Sunesis expects to receive the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues from the EMA before the end of 2016. A decision on the approval status of Qinprezo should be out in 2017.In Oct 2014, Sunesis had reported disappointing data from the phase III VALOR study on Qinprezo, in combination with cytarabine, in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. The study had failed to meet the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. In Jul 2015, the company met with the FDA to discuss a potential regulatory filing in the U.S. Based upon the meeting, the FDA recommended the company to provide additional data prior to any regulatory filing in the U.S.Currently, Sunesis is exploring regulatory and clinical strategies to seek approval in the U.S.We note that Qinprezo enjoys orphan drug status in both the U.S. and the EU.Meanwhile, Sunesis is working on the progress of its novel kinase inhibitor pipeline, which includes proprietary non-covalent BTK-inhibitor, SNS-062.Sunesis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

SPN-812 is being developed as a novel non-stimulant treatment for ADHD.The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated children aged 6 to 12 years diagnosed with ADHD. Data showed that the candidate's 400 mg, 300 mg and 200 mg doses led to a statistically significant reduction in ADHD symptoms in comparison to placebo.

Check. Increase the company's market cap by over 120% in a matter of days? Check.  (NASDAQ: SRPT) managed to do both, thanks to a stunning regulatory win for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug Exondys 51. Removed risk for investors? Check back later.The reality is that there's still significant risk for Sarepta and its shareholders. How can that be with Exondys 51 cleared to go to market?Buried in the midst of the great news about the FDA's accelerated approval of Exondys 51 were these two sentences: \"A clinical benefit of Exondys 51 has not been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.\" That's no ringing endorsement for the DMD drug.The FDA advisory committee that reviewed Exondys 51 didn't endorse it, period. The Peripheral and Central Nervous System Advisory Committee voted six to seven against the finding that Exondys 51 induces production of dystrophin to a level that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The committee voted three to seven against the finding that Sarepta's drug is effective for treatment of DMD.Exondys 51 still obtained accelerated approval, though, thanks to intense lobbying from the DMD patient community and support from the FDA's Dr. Janet Woodcock. That approval came with the asterisk of more confirmatory testing needed. Sarepta is working with the FDA to define the testing protocols required to obtain a full-blown approval. Although the biotech has a couple of clinical studies in the works already, the FDA could require even more testing.To say that there are serious doubts about Sarepta's drug is an understatement. In his objection to the approval of Exondys 51, the FDA's Dr. Ellis Unger called the drug \"essentially a scientifically elegant placebo.\" Unger went on to warn that accelerated approval would give patients \"a false perception\" that Exondys 51 is effective.And skepticism isn't just reserved to the efficacy of Exondys 51. Only a few dozen patients have been treated with the drug so far. As a result, its safety profile isn't well defined. There is a possibility that toxicity could be identified as more patients take Exondys 51.Dr. Unger's concerns go beyond this one drug approval. He maintained that \"accelerated approval [of Exondys 51] would lower the evidentiary standard for effectiveness to an unprecedented nadir.\" This stance stemmed from Unger's view that the scientific grounds for approving Sarepta's DMD drug were so weak that if the same level of evidence was used in the future, many totally ineffective drugs would be approved by the FDA.There is also another threat for Sarepta unrelated to whether or not Exondys 51 should have been approved.  (NASDAQ: BMRN) isn't giving up on laying claim to part of its rival's profits.Biomarin attempted to win FDA approval of its own DMD drug, Kyndrisa, earlier this year. The company also recently lost a patent trial to Sarepta. That didn't end the biotech's quest to become a winner in the DMD market, though. Biomarin plans to appeal the ruling of the of the United States Patent and Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board rulings in favor of Sarepta.The good news for Biomarin is that it already won a prior U.S. patent skirmish with Sarepta over the method of use of exon 51 skipping antisense oligonucleotides to treat DMD. Biomarin has also won a patent decision in Europe.Edward Kaye, Sarepta's interim CEO and chief medical officer, said he thinks his company will ultimately prevail and preserve its patent protection for Exondys 51. Biomarin begs to differ. The final decision from its appeal should be handed down in late 2017 or early 2018. If Sarepta loses, some of the dollars that the company is counting on making will go to its rival.Many DMD patient advocates worked hard to lobby the FDA to approve Exondys 51. I don't blame them. After all, DMD is a horrible disease with no cure. Any hope is better than none for those who are suffering and for their loved ones.Investing in Sarepta is a separate matter altogether, though. Granted, everything could go fine. Further testing could demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Exondys 51. Biomarin could lose its patent appeal. However, Sarepta still has significant risks ahead.

In addition, continued treatment with the drug led to a rapid and sustained reduction in alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a marker of liver injury) in 97% of patients, including higher proportion of the same achieving ALT normalization at 52 weeks compared with the initial 20-week period. Moreover, safety profile of Kanuma during the extended open-label period was found to be consistent with that observed in the double-blind period.Updated data from the ongoing, open-label, phase II/III VITAL study on Kanuma in infants were also presented. Results showed that five out of nine infants, when treated with the drug, survived beyond three years of age, with the oldest patient now more than five years old. All five patients continue to receive treatment.Alexion also intends to present data from the first global LAL-D registry. We note that the registry collects long-term, real-world data on the epidemiology of LAL-D, as well as patient outcomes data.The reported long-term data are encouraging and continue to highlight the benefits of ongoing treatment with Kanuma.

Meanwhile, the company expects launches outside Germany in the second half of the year with additional launches to follow in 2017. Geographical expansion would boost the drug's commercial potential.We remind investors that Kanuma became part of Alexion's portfolio following the Jun 2015 acquisition of Synageva BioPharma.

However, Sarepta has set the annual price of Exondys 51 at roughly $300,000 per year, so if it can capture the majority of that small market, then sales could easily reach into the mid-nine figures. It might even reach blockbuster status if it can go on to win approval in other countries.The only potential wrinkle here is that Exondys 51's approval came with the caveat that Sarepta must conduct follow-on studies that confirm the drug's clinical efficacy. Given the drug's history, that's not exactly a slam dunk, so investors need to be aware that the FDA could later withdraw its approval if it doesn't see evidence that Exondys 51 is effective enough.While I see reasons to be bullish on both of these companies right now, I think BioMarin is the better bet. Its shares are trading at a much more attractive price-to-sales ratio now that they've declined so much, and BioMarin's diversified product portfolio helps to lower the company's risk profile.Sarepta, on the other hand, largely remains a one-drug company -- and that drug also faces the very real risk that it could ultimately be pulled from the market.

Shares were also up almost 6% during the  session on Tuesday.Exondys 51 (30 mg/kg) has been approved as a once-weekly intravenous infusion, specifically indicated for patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping.The approval was based on an increase in dystrophin in skeletal muscles, which was observed in some Exondys 51-treated patients in pivotal studies. However, a clinical benefit of the drug, including improved motor function, could not be established.The FDA stated that Sarepta needs to conduct a study to evaluate whether the drug improves motor function in DMD patients with a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping, to confirm the drug's clinical benefit. Any failure to do this may lead to the withdrawal of the FDA approval.Expectations of an FDA approval of the drug were already high last week when one of the chief critics of the drug, Dr. Ron Farkas, left his job at the FDA. We remind investors that in Apr 2016, an FDA advisory committee voted against approving eteplirsen for the treatment of DMD. Dr. Ronald Farkas had led the panel and has reportedly been critical of the drug. Shares had then gained around 27%. | DMD, a devastating and debilitating disease, is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 3,500 boys born across the world. In addition, up to 13% of DMD patients have mutations addressable by Exondys 51. There is thus significant unmet need for treatments in this indication. Exondys 51's approval makes it the first therapy for this indication, which should enable it to capture a major share of this orphan disease market.Note that DMD drugs have not witnessed much success on the regulatory front. For instance, earlier this year, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  received a Complete Response Letter for its DMD drug, Kyndrisa, in the U.S.Sarepta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shares have  on the news, and since this is the first and only treatment for DMD to reach the market in the U.S., expectations are running high.So is right now a good time to consider buying shares?Patients with DMD have a rare genetic abnormality that prevents them from properly producing a protein called dystrophin, which is crucial to keeping muscle cells intact. Without proper levels of dystrophin, a patient's muscles start to waste away, eventually causing them to lose the ability to perform basic activities. Over time the disease can become life-threatening, and many patients with DMD don't live past age 30.The huge unmet medical need for a DMD treatment led several different companies to have a go at developing one, and in the last 12 months, several of them have gone under the FDA's microscope.Late last year,  (NASDAQ: BMRN) filed a new drug application with the FDA for drisapersen. Unfortunately for that company's shareholders, the FDA wound up rejecting it outright in January. (NASDAQ: PTCT) also made an attempt in early 2016 with a drug called Translarna. Many believed thatTranslarna stood a better-than-average chance of winning U.S. approval since it was approved for sale in the EU. However, those hopes were dashed when the FDA sent the company a \"refuse to file\" letter stating the the application wasn't complete enough to perform a review.With BioMarin Pharmaceutical and PTC Therapeutics out of the way, Sarepta Therapeutics' eteplirsen was the last drug standing. However, during the drug's FDA advisory committee review in April, the panel of experts voted against recommending an approval by a margin of 7 to 6. In response, the agency delayed its approval decision, and asked the company for more clinical data.Image source: Getty Images.The FDA had never officially set an updated target decision date, so patients and investors were left in the dark about when an official ruling might come. Thus, when the agency issued its ruling, it truly took the markets by surprise.The agency officially approved the sale of eteplirsen -- to be marketed as Exondys 51 -- for use in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. It is estimated that about 13% of patients with DMD fit that description, which is about 1,400 patients in the U.S.Better yet, in addition to giving the drug a thumbs up, the FDA also issued Sarepta a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, which allows Sarepta to cut the FDA review time of another one of its drugs to six months from the standard 10 month period. The company also could sell the voucher on the open market, a potentially profitable option; last year, such a voucher sold for $350 million.Of course, it's worth pointing out that this FDA's approval requires Sarepta to conduct a follow-on study to confirm that Exondys 51 does improve motor function in patients with DMD. If the company fails to do so, then the FDA retains the right to remove Exondys 51 from the market.In response to the news, Sarepta announced that it will launching Exondys 51 for sale \"immediately.\"Management has stated that Exondys 51 will sell for roughly $300,000 per year. Based on that price level, Exondys 51 should generate global peak annual sales of over $1 billion. If that figure proves to be accurate, then Sarepta's current share price in the neighborhood of $56, giving it a market cap of around $2.7 billion, still looks to be an attractive entry point.However, while I'm thrilled for Sarepta's shareholders and the DMD community at large, I continue to believe that there's still too much risk to warrant an investment. After all, the phase 2 data that was used to win approval was  , so there's a very real risk that the FDA will reverse its decision down the road.Thus, while I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Exondys 51 proves to be the real deal, I continue to believe that the smart plan is to cheer Sarepta on from the sidelines.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

A pummeling of biotechnology stocks over the past year means that gutsy investors can get in on a formerly high-flying sector at discounted prices. From its peak in July 2015, following a torrid four-year run, the S&P Biotechnology index lost almost 50% in just seven months.Even though the sector started its decline in July 2015, its real woes began last fall, as media outlets shined a spotlight on off-the-chart prices that companies such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals (  ) and Turing Pharmaceuticals (which isn't publicly traded) were charging for their medicines. That led to calls for tighter regulation of drug pricing, which was the final pinprick to the biotech bubble.The conversation about lowering the price of prescription drugs hasn't gone away, but biotech shares have recovered some. Since hitting bottom in February, the S&P Biotechnology index has rebounded by 33%. Even so, many stocks remain 20% to 30% below their summer 2015 peaks. We sifted through the carnage to find a few good bargains. Our list includes a mix of undervalued companies with modest growth prospects; faster-growing firms with higher valuations; and one speculative play that doesn't have a product on the market yet.(All prices and returns are through August 11. Price-earnings ratios are based on estimated earnings over the next four quarters.)Symbol: Share price: $172.43Market capitalization: $129 billionEstimated three-year earnings growth rate: 9%Price-earnings ratio: 15Decline from 2015 peak: 5%Shares of Amgen, one of the biggest and oldest biotech companies, didn't fall as far as the rest of the group and have recovered most of their losses. Still, sales are slowing for two of its top-selling drugs. Analysts project declines in sales of 22% and 6%, respectively, over the next five years for Neulasta (which stimulates white blood cell growth to fight infections) and Enbrel (which treats rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile arthritis, among other disorders).But a slew of recently launched drugs and a rich pipeline of new medicines in late-stage trials, combined with cost cutting, could boost Amgen's share price. Analysts expect total company revenues to rise by 5% this year and 4% in 2017, and earnings to increase by 9% each year.At the current price, Amgen isn't the bargain it was when the stock fell to $130 last October. But at 15 times estimated year-ahead profits, the stock seems reasonably well priced. Plus, it sports a dividend yield of 2.3%, a bit more than the overall stock market's yield. Amgen has raised its payout by at least 25% every year since it began paying a dividend in 2011Symbol: Share price: $92.01Market capitalization: $15.0 billionEstimated three-year earnings growth rate: Not meaningfulPrice-earnings ratio: Not meaningfulDecline from 52-week high: 39%BioMarin is losing money. Analysts estimate that this year's shortfall--$2 per share, or $326 million--will be twice the size of last year's loss.So why are many analysts so upbeat about the stock? Because the firm has a unique portfolio of treatments for rare, so-called orphan, diseases. These illnesses typically afflict only a few thousand patients around the world. But BioMarin's drugs are difficult to engineer, which means the firm faces little competition for the five medicines it currently sells. And the drugs are high priced (for now), which means that BioMarin is generating a lot of revenues. Analysts expect 27% sales growth this year, to $1.1 billion, and 19% growth in 2017. But profits haven't materialized yet because of the firm's research endeavors, says Value Line analyst Nira Maharaj.The decline in BioMarin's stock partly reflects the sector's selloff, but it is also due to the failure of its drug to treat a type of muscular dystrophy to win the Food and Drug Administration's approval last January. That setback aside, Maharaj says, BioMarin has a promising pipeline of new products, with two drugs in late-stage trials and four others further back in the testing process. Although the company is expected to continue to spill red ink over the next few years, Maharaj says the stock is attractive for long-term investors with ample risk tolerance.Symbol: Share price: $113.81Market capitalization: $88.2 billionEstimated three-year earnings growth rate: 22%Price-earnings ratio: 18Decline from 52-week high: 19%Celgene, a maker of cancer-fighting drugs, has a lot going for it. For starters, sales are strong for Revlimid, its best-selling drug, which treats the blood cancer multiple myeloma. Zacks  expects the medicine to chalk up $6.7 billion in sales this year and $8 billion in 2017.And plenty of other drugs may be coming. Between now and 2018, Celgene expects results from at least 18 late-stage trials, for medicine to treat pancreatic cancer, multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease, among other conditions. The results of the trials, the company says, will help Celgene achieve its goal of doubling sales and earnings by 2020.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young says Celgene has the best growth prospects among large biotech companies. Analysts, on average, forecast annual revenue growth of 20% and earnings gains of 22% over the next three years. Relative to expected growth, the stock, at 18 times estimated year-ahead earnings, looks compelling.Symbol: Share price: $79.57Market capitalization: $105 billionEstimated three-year earnings growth rate: Not meaningfulPrice-earnings ratio: 7Decline from 52-week high: 32%For the shares of an innovative biotech leader such as Gilead Sciences to trade at 7 times earnings is almost unheard of. For sheer cheapness, it puts Gilead's stock in the company of automakers and life insurers.To some extent, the stocks' recent travails simply represent surrender of its enormous gains. From the beginning of 2011 until Gilead's peak in mid 2015, the stock gained 576% (an annualized 53%), besting the 305% gain (37% annualized) of the S&P Biotechnology index. And then there's the issue of the high price of Gilead's hepatitis-C drugs. The cost in the U.S. for a full course of Harvoni, for instance, is nearly $100,000.In response, the firm has discounted its prices in some cases, and that has crimped sales and sales expectations. But other burdens include a lower-than-expected patient adoption rate of those drugs, as well as competition from a new Merck hep-C drug that is less costly. Finally, some analysts are tepid about the lineup of drugs in Gilead's pipeline. Put everything together, and analysts see Gilead's revenues and earnings falling 7% in 2016, and they see flat earnings in 2017.On the plus side, Gilead still dominates the hep-C market, which has plenty of additional growth potential: Only 1 million of the 6.6 million hep-C patients in the U.S. and Europe have taken its drugs. What's more, Gilead is sitting on a whopping $24.6 billion in cash that it could use to make an acquisition, boost its share-buyback program or lift its dividend, which it began paying in 2015 and has already raised once. S&P Global analyst Jeffrey Loo has a 12-month price target on the stock of $125, based on his belief that Gilead should trade at 10 times estimated 2017 earnings.Symbol: Share price: $58.70Market capitalization: $2.9 billionEstimated three-year earnings growth rate: Not meaningfulPrice-earnings ratio: Not meaningfulDecline from 52-week high: 35%Kite is the most speculative stock on our list. Aside from being the smallest company, it has one other thing going against it: It doesn't own any products that have been approved for sale.Kite is on the cutting edge of new cancer treatments. It is a leader in developing a kind of immuno-oncology remedy that could revolutionize the way cancer is treated. Kite's technology aims to re-engineer the body's cancer fighting T cells to target and destroy cancer cells. It's a highly innovative but unproven approach. And Kite isn't the only firm with this kind of technology. Others with similar immuno-therapy procedures, including Novartis, are hot on the trail. Finally, given that Kite's most-advanced drug candidate, KTE-C19, for a type of lymphoma and leukemia, is in mid-stage trials, it could take several years before its first drug reaches the market and the company begins to generate revenues, let alone profits.Kite has an impressive management team. Arie Belldegrun, a doctor with 20 years of experience in oncology research, is the CEO. His top lieutenant, chief operating officer Cynthia Butitta, was at biotech start-up NextWave, which Pfizer acquired in 2012. Unless Kite, too, gets bought out, the stock will probably move up and down with news about KTE-C19's trial results. Expect a bumpy ride.Symbol: Share price: $421.35Market capitalization: $45.2 billionEstimated three-year earnings growth rate: 15%Price-earnings ratio: 33Decline from 52-week high: 30%A biotech darling, Regeneron's shares have soared more than 2,800%, or about 41% annualized, over the past 10 years. But that doesn't mean its best days are behind it. The firm has a big backer: French drug giant Sanofi owns more than 20% of the company. And the two are collaborating on monoclonal antibody technology--a cutting-edge process for drug development--to create treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and cancer, among other maladies.As a result of the stock's scintillating performance, Regeneron, at 33 times earnings, is no bargain. But the truth is, Regeneron merits its premium price. Its best-selling drug, Eylea, commands 60% of the market for drugs to treat macular degeneration, an eye disease. And Praluent, a cholesterol inhibitor that won approval in the U.S. and Europe in late 2015 for patients who can't use statins, such as Lipitor, is expected to be an epic seller, too.Symbol: Share price: $101.21Market capitalization: $25.1 billionEstimated three-year earnings growth rate: 66%Price-earnings ratio: 45Decline from 52-week high: 29%Vertex Pharmaceuticals lost money last year, but analysts expect the firm, which focuses on cystic fibrosis drugs, to post earnings of about $1 a share in 2016. And they see profits soaring to more than $3 a share in 2017.The main driver is Orkambi, a drug to treat the underlying causes of the most common type of cystic fibrosis. S&P analyst Loo expects sales of the drug, which was approved by the FDA in mid 2015, to climb to $1.1 billion in 2016, up from $351 million in 2015.Things aren't entirely rosy, however. Orkambi sales haven't been as strong as expected--some patients have had to stop taking the drug because of respiratory issues--and that's weighing on the stock price.

An $8,000 investment in  (NASDAQ: AXGN) 10 years ago, for example, would be worth about $258,400 today.The biggest long-term biotech winner of the past decade, though, is  's latest splurge,  (NASDAQ: MDVN) . Eight grand invested in the developer of prostate cancer therapy Xtandi would be worth about $620,800 today.Let's look at what's caused these stocks to put up outstanding gains, and measure their chances of further success.Each year in the U.S. alone, an estimated 1.4 million people suffer peripheral nerve damage, resulting in roughly 700,000 surgical procedures. AxoGen's products have become increasingly popular by addressing drawbacks to traditional surgical nerve repair methods. For example, to bridge long gaps between severed nerves, surgeons generally harvest nerve tissue from a second site on the patient, frequently causing the loss of use of the secondary site. The company's Avance Nerve Graft is an off-the-shelf solution that makes second site harvesting, and the complications it can lead to, unnecessary. data by Last month the company reported record quarterly revenue of $10.4 million, marking its 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth compared to previous year periods. The company's bottom line hasn't followed the same trajectory as the top, but with an estimated market about $1.6 billion in the U.S. alone, it's easy to see why investors are willing to absorb years of losses as the medical community becomes more familiar with the company's products.Considering the size of the space it operates in, and its rapid growth, the stock's recent price of about 7.5 times trailing sales isn't outrageous, but long-term success is far from certain. The Avance Nerve Graft is derived from donated human cadavers, which brings its ability to rapidly increase supply to meet growing demand into question.Another potential hurdle is Avance Nerve Graft's odd regulatory status. It's a biological product, but AxoGen hasn't submitted a biologic license application to the FDA yet. The Agency currently permits its distribution while AxoGen conducts a large clinical trial comparing outcomes among patients treated with its Avance Nerve Graft to nerve cuffs derived from cows.The trial is still enrolling patients, with results expected in December 2018. If successful, the stock could continue soaring. If not, however, AxoGen's less popular AxoGuard products probably won't carry the company to profitability on their own. This would make repaying a $25 million loan due in 2020 extremely difficult.Xtandi, Medivation's only commercial-stage product, earned its first FDA approval in 2012. It is used to treat which treats advanced prostate cancer and has become a popular therapy for this large patient population. In the first half of the year, worldwide sales rose 35% over the previous year period, putting it on pace to reach about $2.28 billion this year.If Medivation were entitled to  of that Xtandi revenue, Pfizer's $14 billion buyout offer would seem like a great value, but it isn't. Medivation has to split half of U.S. profits with  , and receives a royalty percentage in the low teens to the low twenties on ex-U.S. sales.Until recently, collaboration revenue from Astellas was enough to outpace Medivation's operating expenses. In 2015 Medivation acquired worldwide rights to talazoparib from  , and a recent reevaluation of potential milestone and royalty payments related to the promissing oncology candidate tacked a non-cash charge of $674.0 million to Medivation's operating expenses in the second quarter. data by In April, an investigator-sponsored phase 1 trial with talazoparib in a group of heavily pre-treated patients suggests the PARP inhibitor has interesting potential. Among 40 patients with a variety of cancers (a majority of whom had progressed after six or more different treatments), 23 showed a clinical benefit.Pfizer has a long track record of making big acquisitions, without delivering much bottom-line growth. Pfizer's earnings over the past twelve months of $1.13 per share is less than half of 2006's reported earnings of $2.66 per share.Although Xtandi should add $0.05 per share to Pfizer's bottom-line immediately following the acquisition of Medivation, I'm afraid this stock rocket is out of fuel. The offer of $81.50 per share, expected to close before the end of the year, might pique the interest of an M&A arbitrageur, but buying Pfizer stock in hopes of Medivation-esque gains would be ill advised.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Meanwhile, among other major updates, AbbVie  filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Amgen  . Amgen is seeking FDA approval for its biosimilar version of Humira.1. First a look at earnings results of companies like BioMarin and Regeneron. BioMarin once again reported better-than-expected results and raised its revenue guidance with both Kuvan and Vimizim performing well (Read more:  ). Regeneron's earnings also surpassed expectations with Eylea continuing to perform well (Read more:  ).2. Medivation  also reported second quarter results this week. While revenues just fell short of expectations, earnings were better-than-expected. Investor focus remains on the performance of prostate cancer drug, Xtandi. The company reported that the mean duration of treatment for Xtandi based on patient discontinuation, which is a retrospective analysis, reached an all-time high of nine months. Xtandi is in several studies for additional indications.3. Biogen's  partner Eisai said that their experimental treatment for early Alzheimer's disease, BACE inhibitor E2609, has got the green signal from the FDA for advancement into phase III studies. Biogen also announced the name of the new hemophilia-focused company that will be created through the spin-off of the company's hemophilia franchise currently comprising marketed products like Eloctate and Alprolix. The company will be named Bioverativ and will trade under the symbol BIVV on the NASDAQ Stock Market. The spin-off is scheduled to be completed early next year.Meanwhile, rumors surfaced last week that Biogen could be acquired by companies like Allergan or Merck. But, according to sources, the biotech company is not interested in a takeover.4. AbbVie has initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Amgen to protect its flagship product, Humira, from biosimilar competition. The move was largely expected considering Humira accounts for a major part of AbbVie's sales (61.4% of total sales in 2015) and the earlier-than-expected entry of biosimilars would have a huge impact on the company's financials. Amgen's biosimilar version got the support of an FDA advisory panel. A final decision regarding the approval status of the product is expected by Sep 25, 2016.5. Momenta  announced that it has stopped enrolling patients in a phase II study evaluating necuparanib in combination with Abraxane and Gemzar (gemcitabine) in patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer. The decision was taken following an interim futility analysis - while no new safety signals were observed and the toxicity profile was considered manageable, the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board determined that the treatment did not show a sufficient level of efficacy to warrant continued enrollment.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was down 3% over the last five trading days. While all the major biotechs declined during this period, Regeneron lost 5.9% over the last five trading days.

In the absence of major market-moving news, market participants reverted to their water-treading tendencies, shaking off a more than 3% decline in crude  that took the energy market below the $47.50 per barrel level. Many investors will be on hold until the next central bank monetary policy meeting in late September, but a pickup in merger and acquisition activity today helped establish the idea that investors can still profit even during periods of uncertainty. Among the best performers were  (NYSE: SYT) ,  (NYSE: VRX) , and  (NASDAQ: BMRN) .Syngenta gained 10% after would-be acquirer  received clearance from U.S. officials to move forward with its planned takeover of the agricultural chemicals giant, which is valued at about $44 billion. Some investors had been concerned that the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment might balk at ChemChina's proposed bid for the Swiss maker of pesticides and agricultural seed products, even though only about 25% of its sales actually have ties to North America. The deal isn't set in stone just yet because Syngenta will still need to have approval from other regulatory agencies in Europe. For now, though, investors seem more confident that the buyout will move forward as planned.Valeant Pharmaceuticals climbed 9% in the wake of its decision to appoint a new chief financial officer. Paul Herendeen took over the job, coming over from animal health specialist  . The move allows former CFO Rob Rosiello to focus on corporate development as executive vice president in that role, and it also puts Valeant in an even stronger position to put allegations of accounting issues that led to financial restatements behind the company. Valeant still faces plenty of substantive challenges, but just the awareness that having new people in leadership roles could make it easier for the company to move forward with a new strategy shows that the drugmaker is doing its best to recover from its poor performance recently.Finally, BioMarin Pharmaceutical rose 7%. The biotech was one of several companies in the industry to benefit from merger and acquisition activity in the space on Monday, after big pharma giant  agreed to purchase  for $14 billion, or $81.50 per share. The move by Pfizer accentuates the need to pay high prices in order to acquire promising drugs, with Medivation's Xtandi prostate cancer drug seen by many as a blockbuster in the oncology space. The bid is higher by more than half compared to a previous bid that Medivation received from  , and that has investors in BioMarin and other peers in the space excited that even companies that miss out on Medivation might seek other buyout candidates.

The company is looking to get Brineura approved for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease.BioMarin announced that the FDA had requested an updated efficacy data cut from the ongoing extension study during its initial review of the BLA. The company has submitted additional data as part of its BLA for Brineura and the FDA has designated this submission as a major amendment to the application. Owing to this, the regulatory body will now announce its decision by Apr 27, 2017, instead of the previous date of Jan 27, 2017.Approximately 8 months of additional data (81-week data) continued to show that motor-language scores of the majority of patients, when treated with Brineura, were stable, representing a considerable reduction in disease progression, compared to natural history. The additional data were consistent with the previously submitted 48-week data, thereby showing durable and consistent treatment response with Brineura.However, in its press release, BioMarin stated that the FDA has not revealed its basis for designating this submission as a major amendment. The regulatory agency plans to hold an advisory committee meeting in the future.We note that the company has submitted a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Brineura. The filing is presently undergoing validation, with an update expected shortly. The EMA has granted BioMarin's request for accelerated assessment, which will shorten the candidate's review period.However, the latest development on the regulatory front is disappointing. Per BioMarin's press release, CLN2 disease is a rapidly progressing, fatal neurodegenerative disease that impairs the ability to walk and talk in the majority of affected children by approximately six years of age.The company estimates CLN2 disease to affect approximately one in 200,000, with nearly 1,200 to 1,600 children in the company's commercial territories. | Considering that there is no approved product to prevent, stop, or reverse this disease, a timely approval will be a huge boost for the company. We note that Brineura enjoys Orphan Drug status in both the U.S. and the EU.Meanwhile, BioMarin has implemented an early access (compassionate use) program as planned to offer Brineura to additional CLN2 patients, before gaining approval. This program, which is being conducted under a protocol, began last month.BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector include Anika Therapeutics Inc.  , Geron Corporation  and Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated  .

First a look at earnings results of companies like BioMarin and Regeneron. BioMarin once again reported better-than-expected results and raised its revenue guidance with both Kuvan and Vimizim performing well (Read more:  ). Regeneron's earnings also surpassed expectations with Eylea continuing to perform well (Read more:  ).2. Biogen's (  ) partner Eisai said that their experimental treatment for early Alzheimer's disease, BACE inhibitor E2609, has got the green signal from the FDA for advancement into phase III studies. Biogen also announced the name of the new hemophilia-focused company that will be created through the spin-off of the company's hemophilia franchise currently comprising marketed products like Eloctate and Alprolix. The company will be named Bioverativ and will trade under the symbol BIVV on the NASDAQ Stock Market. The spin-off is scheduled to be completed early next year.Meanwhile, rumors surfaced last week that Biogen could be acquired by companies like Allergan or Merck. But, according to sources, the biotech company is not interested in a takeover.4. AbbVie has initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Amgen to protect its flagship product, Humira, from biosimilar competition. The move was largely expected considering Humira accounts for a major part of AbbVie's sales (61.4% of total sales in 2015) and the earlier-than-expected entry of biosimilars would have a huge impact on the company's financials. Amgen's biosimilar version got the support of an FDA advisory panel.

(NASDAQ: BMRN) reported second-quarter earnings last week. While the biotech's current drugs are still growing at a nice pace, it's BioMarin's pipeline, including two drugs that have already read out positive phase 3 data, that has the potential to accelerate growth in the coming years.Data source: Company press release. YOY = year over year.With limited but very promising data for BMN270, Hank Fuchs, Biomarin's chief medical officer, noted that the company might see if a higher dose would work better while not causing more side effects, \"We're considering whether a second dose level would be a wise thing to incorporate into that phase 2B trial.\"While the large buying patterns of some countries cause lumpy sales, BioMarin has factored that into guidance. \"Due to the unevenness of order timing, we recommend that you follow full-year guidance as the best measure of anticipated performance for Vimizim,\" said Jeff Ajer, Biomarin's chief commercial officer.Management increased 2016 guidance for sales of Vimizim and Kuvan and also bumped overall revenue guidance to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion, an increase over the previous guidance, which topped out at $1.1 billion.In addition to designing the aforementioned phase 2b study for BMN270, BioMarin also plans to start a phase 3 trial for vosoritide that treats achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism, by the end of the year.After getting positive phase 3 data for pegvaliase for PKU -- the same disease Kuvan treats -- BioMarin is working on its FDA marketing application. But it's a large data package, in part because pegvaliase is a nonhuman biologic, so it will take until the fourth quarter, or possibly the first quarter of next year to file the application.Finally, looking to next year, BioMarin will start the year off with a decision on the marketing application for Brineura on or before January 27, if the FDA sticks to its goal.

For the PowerShares DWA Healthcare Momentum Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PTH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $53.91 per unit.With PTH trading at a recent price near $48.35 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.49% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PTH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN), Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc (Symbol: LGND), and Prestige Brands Holdings Inc (Symbol: PBH). Although BMRN has traded at a recent price of $91.74/share, the average analyst target is 30.34% higher at $119.57/share. Similarly, LGND has 27.12% upside from the recent share price of $110.92 if the average analyst target price of $141.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting PBH to reach a target price of $59.50/share, which is 23.34% above the recent price of $48.24.

Shares of  (NASDAQ: BMRN) , a biopharmaceutical company focused on diseases with unmet need, gained 22.2% in July, according to data from  . BioMarin finished July by announcing the FDA accepted its application for a rare-disease drug and presenting positive data for its hemophilia therapy. These developments have kept the stock rising into August, but rumors of a  buyout provided most of the lift earlier in the month. data by  . This isn't the first time rumors of an offer from the big pharma have boosted shares of BioMarin. About three years ago, Roche's CEO, Severin Schwan, was quick to dispel the notion, but this time around he hasn't had much to say.Rumors aside, BioMarin's outlook perked up last month when the FDA accepted Brineura's (formerly known as cerliponase alfa) application for treatment of children with a rare form of Batten disease. If approved, it will be the first disease-modifying treatment for this debilitating, and ultimately fatal, condition that affects approximately one of every 200,000 newborn babies.On the same day it announced Brineura's application, BioMarin also touted positive results from an early study with hemophilia A gene-therapy candidate, BMN 270. The company intends to enroll up to 12 patients, but at the interim six of seven patients given the high dose showed a critical blood clotting factor at a level above 50% (the seventh patient's level was above 10%) at between 12 and 28 weeks after receiving a single dose. Purchasing, then scuttling, a handful of candidates for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy took a toll on BioMarin's finances, reputation, and stock price. With the stock down about 31% over the past year, a deflated market cap of about $16.2 billion puts an acquisition of BioMarin within Roche's, or another big pharma's, means.BioMarin's rapidly growing top line and management's prediction of positive cash flows beginning next year are stoking the rumors. Total revenue has nearly doubled since the first round of Roche buyout rumors began circulating in 2013, but so has BioMarin's research and development budget. data by  .This year, BioMarin expects total revenue of at least $1.05 billion to lead to a net loss between $355 million and $385 million. Ending its muscular dystrophy program will cut down on costs, and potential approval of Brineura would certainly help the company reach profitability.In addition, phase 3 results released in March show pegvaliase significantly lowers circulating phenylalanine in phenylketonuria patients, and the company plans to file applications for the drug's approval by the end of the year. Approximately 50,000 diagnosed patients across the developed world suffer this disease marked by an inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. It's currently managed with strict low-protein diets. Unfortunately, compliance is problematic, and phenylalanine buildup in the brain frequently leads to severe intellectual disability.Whether the buyout rumors are true or not, investors would do well to remain focused on BioMarin's pipeline progress and competitive threats. Over the next several years, generic competition for Kuvan, a drug responsible for about a third of the company's product revenue, will begin pressuring its sales.With a bit of luck, pegvaliase and Brineura could more than offset the losses. Further out, BioMarin intends to begin a trial designed to support an application for BMN 270 about halfway through next year. The therapy's potential success in hemophilia A could provide another important revenue stream.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

(NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) were all deep in the red, albeit for understandable reasons.Here's what you need to know.Late last week, BioMarin Pharmaceutical looked like it was on top of the world. The company posted an operating profit of 9 cents per share on $300 million worth of revenue, handily topping estimates for a loss of 51 cents per share of BMRN and sales of $280.4 million. Better still, the company reeled in the range for its expected loss in 2016, from between $75 million and $100 million to only a loss of between $30 million and $50 million.The bullish response to the news added another 6% to the 24% gain BMRN had logged since late June, and shares have continued to edge higher in the meantime, further cementing the new rally in place.So what is the cause of today's near-4% dip? The company announced that after Monday's close it would be raising funds through a secondary offering, diluting current BMRN shareholders.The offering will be for 7.5 million shares of BMRN, versus a current float of 162.25 million \u2026 or roughly the same 4% the stock fell today.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings cautioned its shareholders today that its 2016 may not look as good as previously thought, sending NCLH down nearly 12% as a result.Neither of the company's concerns are surprising. Between the adverse economic impact that the Brexit may bring with it, as well as a resurgence of terrorist activity in Europe, demand for luxury travel is crimped, and could be for a while.Given the new headwinds, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings now believes it will only earn between $3.35 and $3.45 per share of NCLH this year, versus analyst's estimates of $3.72.Last but not least, the good news is that Wayfair saw strong sales growth last quarter. The bad news is, despite rising revenue, the company's loss got bigger.In its second fiscal quarter of the year, online shopping venue Wayfair reported a loss of 43 cents per share on revenue of $786.93 million. The top line grew 60% from last year's $491.75 million, but the loss widened from the loss of 23 cents per share of W posted in the same quarter a year earlier. Analysts were only looking for a loss of 41 cents per share.The disparate moves not only surprised investors, but also left them wondering if Wayfair can only grow the top line by taking larger losses.

Organic sales growth was 5.1% driven by the Life Science and Healthcare segments.The company reports results under three segments - Healthcare, Life Science and Performance Materials.Sales at the Healthcare division were down 2.7% year over year to \u20ac1.8 billion. The decrease was primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations in Latin America and the return of Kuvan rights to BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  . However, organically, sales at this segment improved 7.3%. Erbitux's sales were stable compared to year ago period at \u20ac233 million, while Rebif sales dipped to \u20ac441 million due to continued competitive pressures and negative currency impact.Life Science recorded sales of \u20ac1.4 billion, up 85%, primarily backed by the acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich which boosted sales by 79.7%. The segment witnessed strong organic sales growth (up 8.1%). The Process Solutions business recorded organic growth of 13.5%, while Applied Solutions posted organic sales of 3.9%.Performance Materials sales were down 3.4% to \u20ac621 million. Organically, this segment witnessed a 2.4% decline in sales due to destocking by display industry customers. However, inclusion of Sigma-Aldrich's SAFC Hitech business contributed 3.1% to sales.Under its partnership with Pfizer Inc.  , Merck KGaA is evaluating avelumab in a number of phase III studies for several cancer indications. In the reported quarter, the company initiated a phase III study (JAVELIN Renal 101) on avelumab in an advanced renal cell carcinoma setting. The study is evaluating the candidate, in combination with Inlyta, in comparison with Sutent (sunitinib malate) monotherapy in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic RCC with clear cell component.In July, another phase III study (JAVELIN Renal 100) was initiated on the candidate, in combination with, and/or as follow-on treatment to, platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease (Stage III or Stage IV) with previously untreated epithelial ovarian cancer.Backed by a strong performance in the first half of the year, the company has lifted its guidance for 2016. Sales are now expected in the range of \u20ac14.9-\u20ac15.1 billion (previous projection: \u20ac14.8-\u20ac15 billion).On an organic basis, sales are anticipated to grow moderately (previous forecast: slight growth). The Healthcare segment is expected to witness solid organic growth sales, while organic sales at Life Science are expected in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage range. Performance Materials segment will, however, witness moderate decline in 2016. Nevertheless, backed by the Sigma-Aldrich acquisition, the company continues to expect a positive portfolio effect on sales in the low double-digit percentage range.Sales are, however, expected to be hurt by foreign exchange impact of 3-5% due to continued devaluation of the Latin American currencies.Merck KGaA' second-quarter earnings were encouraging with the company reporting a year-over-year growth in sales. Earnings were, however, down on a year-over-year basis. Backed by the acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich, the company witnessed an encouraging performance at the Life Science segment in the second quarter of 2016. Going ahead, we believe that the Sigma-Aldrich acquisition, along with the company's collaboration with Pfizer in the field of immuno-oncology, will pave the way for future growth. However, we remain concerned about the impact of negative foreign exchange fluctuations that are expected to hamper sales in 2016. | Investors looking for a well-placed stock in the health care sector may consider Anika Therapeutics Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because BioMarin Pharmaceutical is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BMRN in this report. | In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at loss of 48 cents per share for BMRN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 50 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BMRN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 4.00% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that BMRN has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

AVEO has an impressive track record over the last four reported quarters. While the company has beaten estimates on three occasions, it met expectations in one. Overall, the company has posted an average positive surprise of 64.73%.In the last reported quarter, AVEO's results were in line with expectations. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.AVEO, a development-stage biopharmaceutical company, is focused on the development of treatments targeting cancer and other areas of unmet medical need. The company has an interesting pipeline with the most advanced candidate being tivozanib. Regulatory applications seeking approval for tivozanib for the first-line treatment ofrenal cell carcinoma (RCC) are currently under review in Europe and Russia. We note that these applications were submitted by AVEO's partners, EUSA Pharma and Pharmstandard, in their respective territories.During the quarter, AVEO announced the dosing of the first patient in a randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label pivotal phase III study (TIVO-3) comparing tivozanib to Nexavar for the treatment of refractory advanced RCC. Top-line data from the study is anticipated in the first quarter of 2018. Results from the TIVO-3 study, along with the previously completed TIVO-1 study on tivozanib for the first-line treatment of RCC, are expected to support a first- and third-line indication for tivozanib in the U.S.Apart from tivozanib, AVEO has several early- and mid-stage candidates in its pipeline including ficlatuzumab (phase II - non-small cell lung cancer) and AV-203 (phase I completed - advanced solid tumors) among others. AVEO has collaborations with several companies for the development of its pipeline candidates.With no approved product in AVEO's portfolio at the moment, the company depends entirely on license fees, collaboration revenues, and milestone and other payments for its top line. Therefore, the top line may vary on a quarterly basis depending mainly on the timing of these payments.Investor focus should remain on tivozanib's progress and other pipeline-related updates.Our proven model does not conclusively show that AVEO is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 14 cents per share. Though AVEO has a favorable Zacks Rank #2, an ESP of 0.00% makes a surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. | Here are some health care stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Strong uptake, launches in additional countries and expansion into additional indications should drive Keytruda sales.Investors will also be focused on the performance of Merck's DPP-4 inhibitor, Januvia, including the impact of pricing pressure and whether it is losing any share to SGLT2.Meanwhile, Remicade will continue to feel the pressure of biosimilar competition in Europe with sales expected to decline at a rapid pace through 2016.

The reported figure was also narrower than the year-ago loss of 22 cents.The company's revenues came in at $300.1 million in the quarter, up 20% from the year-ago quarter, driven by strong sales of Vimizim and Kuvan. Revenues also came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $280.5 million.Vimizim contributed $106.8 million to the total revenue, shot up 98.1% year over year, primarily driven by robust patient growth and in part by the timing of large orders from Latin America and the Middle East.Kuvan revenues soared 50.1% to $90.2 million driven by patient increases in North America and strong sales in international territories.Naglazyme sales plunged 29.4% year over year to $78.4 million primarily due to the timing of central government orders from Latin America in 2015.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties - totalling $18.7 million (down 7.4%) - from Sanofi's  Genzyme.Meanwhile, Firdapse revenues increased 21.6% year over year to $4.5 million.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased 5.8% to $167 million while selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were up 7.9 % to $109.6 million.Encouraged by the strong performance of Vimizim and Kuvan, BioMarin raised its total revenue outlook for 2016.

Vimizim and Kuvan drove top-line growth, which is encouraging. The company's raised outlook for revenues for 2016 is also encouraging.

While new patient adoption and repeat injections should drive Prolia, Xgeva should benefit from its superior clinical profile versus competition.Vectibix continues to make solid inroads into earlier lines of therapy in the U.S. as well as Europe.However, year-over-year comparisons for Enbrel are likely to be unfavorable given the significant inventory build in the second quarter of 2015. Enbrel is also facing increasing competition in the dermatology segment.Kyprolis looks well-positioned to gain share with both the ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data in its U.S. label. The product is also off to a strong start in its first markets in Europe.Meanwhile, Epogen will continue to be impacted by further share declines at Fresenius Medical Care  and the potential for additional switching to Aranesp. The second quarter will also see some inventory burn off to the tune of $30 million - $50 million reflecting the impact of large customer end user purchases for Xgeva and Neulasta in the first quarter.The bottom line will continue to be driven by the company's overall cost-cutting efforts and share buybacks.

BioMarin's track record has been so far decent with the company beating estimates in three of the last four quarters. Yet, the company has recorded an average negative miss of 7.48% over the trailing four quarters.In the last reported quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 58.82%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Key drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, which drove BioMarin's top line in the first quarter of 2016, should continue to boost the company's performance this quarter as well.On the first-quarter call, BioMarin noted that Vimizim's sales performance was particularly strong in the EMEA region, as clinical trial patients in the UK converted to commercial therapy. The company has also benefited from penetration in additional markets. Due to increased patient penetration as well as contribution from new smaller markets, BioMarin raised the 2016 Vimizim sales guidance to $315-$340 million (old guidance: $300-$330 million) at the time of announcing first-quarter 2016 results. Meanwhile, the product should continue to perform well with existing and new patient referrals converting to commercial therapy.While Kuvan's North American sales continued to benefit from growth in new patients coupled with high levels of adherence, the company has started receiving orders directly from the majority of top international markets across the world following the drug's global acquisition rights.On the flip side, Naglazyme revenues vary on a quarterly basis primarily due to the timing of central government orders from Latin America. Nevertheless, the drug's patient growth increased 8.5% year over year in the first quarter of 2016 and is expected to demonstrate steady growth.Operating expenses at the company are expected to rise sequentially.During the quarter, BioMarin announced that it has decided to discontinue the clinical and regulatory development of Kyndrisa for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to exon 51 skipping. The decision followed the company's discussions with the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, which hinted at the issuance of a negative opinion. The FDA had also issued a complete response letter for Kyndrisa in Jan 2016.On the second-quarter call, focus will be on the company's performance along with that of the marketed products. Updates regarding the company's pipeline will be another area of key focus.For the second quarter of 2016, our proven model shows that BioMarin is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +4.00%.

The company has been seen to consistently beat earnings expectations. The company's earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 12.80%.In the last reported quarter, Pfizer posted a positive earnings surprise of 21.82%. Will this pharma giant be able to beat estimates this time around as well? Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.At the time of announcing first-quarter 2016 results, Pfizer raised both the earnings and revenue outlook for 2016 reflecting strong performance. For 2016, Pfizer expects earnings in the range of $2.38 to $2.48 per share on revenues of $51 billion and $53 billion. Previously, the company guided toward earnings of $2.20-$2.30 per share on revenues of $49 billion-$51 billion in 2016.While new products like Eliquis, Xalkori, Xeljanz, Ibrance and Prevnar 13 should contribute to the top line meaningfully, the bottom line should be driven by cost savings and share buybacks.Ibrance has already earned broad patient and physician acceptance with an encouraging feedback while Eliquis continues to perform well due to market penetration and market share gains in the U.S. and Japan. Prevnar 13 uptake continues to be strong among adults reflecting the success of commercial programs, as well as the timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication.Meanwhile, the Hospira acquisition should be an important growth driver as well with sterile injectables, biosimilars, and infusion system segments performing well. With the integration efforts currently on, Pfizer expects to achieve approximately $1 billion in annual cost savings by 2018, up from an original synergy target of $800 million.However, Pfizer will continue to face headwinds in the form of genericization and the expiration of a few co-promotion agreements, which will continue to hamper top-line growth. On the first quarter call the company mentioned that it expects the loss of exclusivity impact from Lyrica, Rebif and Enbrel to be more pronounced in the remaining quarters of the year as compared to the first quarter. Moreover, new product launch expenses and R&D investments are also phased higher for the remainder of the year.On the second-quarter call, investor focus is expected to remain on the company's performance along with the performance of new products and the company's pipeline progress including biosimilars and immuno-oncology. The company's business development plans will be another area of focus as its decision regarding the splitting of its business is expected by year end. We note that Pfizer acquired Anacor for approximately $5.2 billion in Jun 2016.For the second quarter of 2016, our proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.61%.

ImmunoGen's track record has been disappointing with the company consistently missing expectations in all of the four reported quarters. Overall, the company has posted an average negative miss of 14.18%.In the last reported quarter, ImmunoGen recorded a negative surprise of 23.33%. Will ImmunoGen disappoint again? Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.ImmunoGen, a development-stage biotech company, is focused on the development of targeted anticancer therapeutics using its antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology. At the time of announcing third-quarter fiscal 2016 results, the company had updated its guidance for fiscal 2016. The company expects revenues in the range of $60-$70 million (previous projection: $70-$80 million). The revised guidance included the effect of changes in the expected timing of partner events.Net loss is projected in the range of $135-$140 million (old guidance: $120-$125 million) for fiscal 2016. On the other hand, cash and cash equivalents (as of Jun 30, 2016) are expected to be between $155 million and $160 million (old guidance: $165 million to $170 million), reflecting the cash impact of less partner upfront and milestone payments.We note that ImmunoGen earns revenues in the form of license and milestone fees, royalties, clinical materials revenue and research and development support fees paid by partners that use its ADC technology. The company has partnership agreements with several big health care companies such as Bayer AG  and Roche Holding AG  among others.Operating expenses are expected in the range of $180 million to $185 million (previous projection: $175 million to $180 million), reflecting greater clinical trial costs among other things.Given that ImmunoGen does not have any approved product in its portfolio yet, investor focus should remain on the company's progress with its lead pipeline candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine and other programs.During the quarter (May 2016), ImmunoGen announced data from a 46-patient phase I cohort evaluating the efficacy and safety of mirvetuximab soravtansine as a single-agent therapy for platinum-resistant, FR\u03b1-positive ovarian cancer. The company plans to initiate a phase III study (FORWARD I) on mirvetuximab soravtansine, pending discussions with the FDA. The candidate is also in phase Ib/II development in combination with other regimens for the treatment of ovarian cancer.Our proven model does not conclusively show that ImmunoGen is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 41 cents per share. ImmunoGen currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. | Here is a health care stock that you may want to consider instead, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

An active health care investor, Isaly seeks long-term capital growth in health care companies that have potential for high growth and increased market share. The portfolio manager generally has 80% of his assets in health sciences industries, including biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.The ETHSX portfolio manager made three new buys during the second quarter:  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). Among these three stocks, Isaly made the largest investment in Biomarin: during the second quarter, the manager purchased 370,500 shares at an average price of $85.12. Additionally, Isaly purchased 292,900 shares of Medivation at an average price of $49.98 and 177,300 shares of UnitedHealth at an average price of $129.10.With a  rating of 5 and a profitability rank of 4, Biomarin likely has a weak financial outlook. The commercial pharmaceutical company currently has a Piotroski F-score of 2, implying a weak business operation. Additionally, the company has negative returns on invested capital , operating margin and Greenblatt earnings yield . These financial metrics suggest that Biomarin could potentially go into distress in the short term.On the other hand, UnitedHealth has a strong business outlook with a predictability rank of five stars. The health care plans company currently has a profitability rank of 7, likely due to one good sign : consistent per share revenue growth. Since the companyAAAs ROIC is greater than its WACC, UnitedHealth generates value as it grows. Additionally, the companyAAAs Greenblatt return on capital is currently 252.28%, which outperforms 74% of global health care companies.On the sell side, Islay eliminated his positions in ( ), ( ) and (IRWD).

Currently, most of the companyAAAs margins and returns underperform at least 70% of global medical devices companies. Additionally, Wright Medical has a Piotroski F-score of 3 and an Altman Z-score of 0.81, suggesting moderate to severe distress.Islay sold out Impax Laboratories and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals likely due to declining operating and gross margins . Among these two companies, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals experienced a worse margin decline during the past 10 years.

Conatus' performance so far has been mixed with the company surpassing expectations on two occasions, while posting in-line results in the other two. Overall, the company has posted an average beat of 9.72%.In the last reported quarter, Conatus' results came in line with the expectations. Let's see how things are shaping up for the second quarter of 2016.Conatus, a development-stage biotech company, is focused on the development and commercialization of treatments targeting liver disease. The company's lead candidate, emricasan, a first-in-class, orally active pan-caspase protease inhibitor, is being developed for the treatment of patients suffering from chronic liver disease.Currently, two phase II studies on emricasan are underway. This includes the POLT-HCV-SVR study (phase IIb) evaluating potential improvements in Ishak fibrosis score in post-orthotropic liver transplant (POLT) recipients with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis post-transplant caused by recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in those who have successfully achieved a sustained viral response (SVR) following HCV antiviral therapy and the ENCORE-NF study (phase IIb) evaluating potential improvements in fibrosis and steatohepatitis in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) fibrosis.During the quarter (May 2016), Conatus announced positive top-line data from the three-month, open-label, second stage of the phase II liver cirrhosis study on emricasan. The company intends to discuss these results with regulatory authorities in the second half of 2016 and thereafter plans to commence the ENCORE-LF study in patients with NASH cirrhosis.Conatus also plans to initiate other additional studies on emricasan. Meanwhile, operating expenses at the company are expected to rise, particularly research and development expenses, due to continued investment toward the development of emricasan.With no approved product in Conatus' portfolio at the moment, investor focus is expected to remain on the company's progress with emricasan.For the second quarter of 2016, our proven model shows that Conatus is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +5.41%.

The average earnings surprise over the last four quarters is -77.02%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Vertex, known for its strong presence in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market, has two key CF products in its portfolio - Kalydeco and Orkambi.Kalydeco revenues should continue growing reflecting continued increase in the number of patients initiating treatment with Kalydeco globally as well as a reduced impact from the VX-661 program.Meanwhile, Orkambi revenues should grow sequentially in the second quarter. Vertex's 2016 sales guidance for Orkambi assumes that 15% of patients on Orkambi discontinued treatment within the first three months of initiation. The company estimates that about 70% - 80% of patients will remain on treatment. Meanwhile, the overall compliance rate (reflects the number of pills actually taken by a patient in a given month), is expected to be 70% - 80%.Operating expenses will also shoot up as Vertex develops its pipeline and works on expanding Kalydeco's and Orkambi's labels and continues to invest in the Orkambi launch.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Vertex is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

While its analysts estimate the company will post a loss of 52 cents per share for 2016, BioMarin is expected to report operating EPS of 42 cents in 2017.Despite the FDA's rejection of one of BioMarin's drugs in January, which sparked a sell-off in BMRN stock, Capital IQ has a positive outlook on the company's drug portfolio after positive data on drugs used to treat children with a fatal neurodegenerative disease and adults with inadequately controlled blood Phe levels. Capital IQ rates BMRN stock a \"Buy\" with a 12-month price target of $125.Turning to the chart, we see that BMRN stock dropped from around $110 in late 2015, which was due in part to the FDA rejection. But prior to establishing a bottom below $70 in early 2016, the stock flashed three buy signals from my proprietary internal indicator, the Collins-Bollinger Reversal (CBR), and rallied to its downtrend line.BMRN stock broke from that resistance line in April and consolidated around its 50-day moving average until early this month, when it executed a triple-top breakout through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages on high volume.Traders should look to buy BMRN stock at $94 or lower for a target of $120 by December, which would result in a gain of more than 25%. Investors who seek speculative purchases that could deliver long-term, high-percentage returns should also consider purchasing this stock at the market price as a cornerstone holding in their biotech portfolio.Click to EnlargeThe post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: Getty Images.Investors have been taken for quite the wild ride in 2016. Stocks opened the year with the worst two-week start in recorded history and followed it with the most voracious intra-quarter rally since 1933. However, the biotech sector has missed out on the stock market's march to all-time highs.The  (NYSEMKT: XBI) is down 18% year to date, while the broad-based  is up nearly 6%. That's a pretty awful performance from an industry that should be benefiting from low yields and access to cheap and plentiful capital.The fact that biotech stocks are down for the year could signal that investors simply aren't willing to pay as much of a premium for the potential reward that biotech stocks offer. The vast majority of biotech stocks have pipelines that show promise, but most are also losing money. In many cases, biotech stocks are reliant on just one or two experimental therapies -- and when the stock market begins to get volatile, investors lose their willingness to take on the risks associated with holding these narrow pipelines.However, we're also seeing weakness in some of biotech's biggest stalwarts:  (NASDAQ: GILD) ,  (NASDAQ: ALXN) , and  (NASDAQ: BMRN) .Both Gilead and Alexion are healthfully profitable companies. Meanwhile, though BioMarin is losing money, it does have five rare-disease drugs on pharmacy shelves that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Unfortunately, I suspect the earnings estimates for all three of these biotech giants could be pushed lower for the remainder of 2016, and perhaps for 2017.Image source: Getty Images.Why, you ask? Look no further than Britain's decision to the leave the European Union, commonly known as \"Brexit.\" While the possibility of Brexit was always on the table, few pundits actually believed British citizens would opt to leave the EU. The reaction in global markets was swift, but stock markets have since recovered. Yet the British pound and the euro, which are now viewed as weaker currencies, have not enjoyed such a recovery.Of the largest biotech companies you can buy that also disclose their financial exposure to Europe, Alexion, BioMarin, and Gilead have the highest European sales exposure. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, Alexion gets 32% of its sales from Europe, BioMarin gets 27%, and Gilead Sciences gets about 21%. Because all three of these companies report their revenue and profits in U.S. dollars, it means they have to convert a considerably devalued British pound, or a modestly devalued euro, back into a stronger dollar. In other words, Alexion, BioMarin, and Gilead will lose sales and profits in the currency translation process.If there is some solace here, it's that Britain doesn't comprise a huge percentage of sales for any of these three companies, so the nearly 15% decline in the value of the pound versus the dollar since Brexit won't be a huge factor. But a roughly 2.5% move lower in the euro against the dollar, coupled with the small percentage of revenue these companies derive from the U.K., could easily result in a low- to mid-single-digit drop in 2016 full-year EPS for all three companies.Image source: Alexion Pharmaceuticals.Though earnings revisions seem likely for Gilead, Alexion, and BioMarin, smart investors should be able to look past the smoke-and-mirrors adjustments that currency translation can cause and instead focus on the meat and potatoes of these biotech giants' business models. In other words, investors should be focused on operating results -- and they shouldn't be disappointed.For instance, even though Alexion disappointed investors by reporting in early June that its late-stage REGAIN study -- which examined Soliris as a treatment for patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis -- failed to meet its primary endpoint, this hasn't slowed Soliris' growth one iota. Approved as a treatment for the rare diseases paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, Soliris, along with Kanuma, should help push Alexion's sales higher by 20% annually over the next four years. On an operating basis, Alexion is in great shape.Image source: Gilead Sciences.Gilead Sciences may no longer be knocking the socks off growth investors, but it's still delivering incredible cash flow on account of its hepatitis C and HIV product portfolio. Gilead currently maintains more than 90% market share in hepatitis C, and that could expand further with the recent approval of Epclusa, the first pan-genomic HCV treatment. Gilead genuinely looks capable of generating $15 billion or more in free cash flow every year. A small decrease in EPS from currency translation can easily be overlooked by smart value investors.Even BioMarin, which is forecast to lose money through 2018, should be able to fight through the challenges of a weaker pound and euro. Because BioMarin focuses on extremely rare diseases (like Alexion), it tends to avoid competition and has excellent pricing power. Wall Street is currently forecasting that BioMarin's sales will double from the $890 million it reported in 2015 to an estimated $1.9 billion in 2019. With another six unique therapies in clinical trials, BioMarin could still reward investors.Long story short, prepare for likely earnings revisions but remember to focus on the far more important operating performance of these biotech giants.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of XBI, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, XBI's low point in its 52 week range is $44.16 per share, with $87.15 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $60.68. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors certainly have to be happy with  and its short term performance.

The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 3.45% in the first quarter. Let's see how things are shaping up for the second quarter.Leukemia drug, Iclusig, is the company's sole marketed product. ARIAD expects Iclusig product and royalty revenues of $170 million - $180 million in 2016. Sales should be driven by continued demand and new patient additions and launch in additional territories. Early in the second quarter, ARIAD divested its EU operations to Incyte Corporation  and also out-licensed Iclusig for the region (EU countries plus others, including Russia, Turkey). As a result, ARIAD will be earning royalties on Iclusig sales in these regions.Sequential growth in Iclusig sales should be driven by expanded footprint, both on the commercial and medical side in the U.S., as well as the conversion of PACE study patients to commercial drug.ARIAD is currently working on expanding Iclusig's label especially into earlier lines of treatment which will expand the market potential significantly.In addition to being focused on Iclusig's performance, investors will also be keen to know about the company's launch plans for brigatinib - a rolling NDA submission for the candidate was initiated in the second quarter. Approval would allow the company to launch the experimental cancer treatment in the U.S. in 2017.ARIAD is also working on achieving cost efficiencies and resource reallocation to areas of business that bring the most value. In late Mar 2016, the company announced a restructuring program under which 25% of its headquarter positions will be cut. The divestment of the EU operations is expected to cut 2017 operating costs by about $65 million.ARIAD's performance has been mostly disappointing with the company missing expectations in three of the last four quarters with an average negative surprise of -17.41%. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that ARIAD is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) to be able to beat earnings. That is not the case here as you will see below. :  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +10.00%. : Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks of #1, #2 and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Here are a few health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for Amgen Inc.  is +1.10% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company will release second-quarter results on Jul 27.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

After failing to win over regulators in January,  (NASDAQ: BMRN) discontinued development of four drugs in its pipeline targeting Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD. The shuttering of research into exon-skipping therapies for DMD more than offset rumors that  (NYSE: SNY) could be considering a bid to buy the company, and as a result, BioMarin's shares slipped by 11% last month, according to  . BioMarin acquired exon-skipping therapies in 2014 and filed for approval of the first of its exon-skipping drugs, Kyndrisa (drisapersen), shortly thereafter. Management had hoped that a big need for new therapies to treat this muscle-wasting disease could result in an FDA approval in spite of shaky efficacy in trials. However, the FDA ultimately opted against approval in January. On May 31, BioMarin threw in the towel on Kyndrisa and three other exon-skipping therapies in development, opting to focus its attention on other, more promising drugs in its rare-disease drug pipeline.The news was disappointing to investors because many industry watchers thought that an approval of Kyndrisa could lead to annualized sales in the hundreds of millions of dollars and catapult BioMarin to profitability in 2017. Additionally, if Kyndrisa had been approved, it would have qualified BioMarin to receive a fast-track voucher that could be used to accelerate review times on other drugs in development. Alternatively, the company could have sold the voucher on the open market. In the past, similar vouchers have fetched more than $300 million.As shares pulled back in June, rumors surfaced that Sanofi was mulling a bid to buy BioMarin. Sanofi is on the hunt to bulk up its product lineup, and drugs sold by BioMarin to treat rare diseases would conceivably complement Sanofi's rare-disease drug portfolio. In the first quarter, BioMarin's rare-disease drugs produced $237 million in revenue, while Sanofi's rare-disease drugs generated sales of $715 million, at current exchange rates.Image source: BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc. DMD was far from the only rare-disease indication being targeted by BioMarin, so while the discontinuation of development of exon-skipping drugs in its pipeline is a blow, it's not a deal-breaker. Exiting Q1, BioMarin's full-year sales guidance remains $1 billion, and even without tailwinds from Kyndrisa, management still hopes to turn a profit next year for the first time.Among catalysts that could reignite BioMarin's shares are the potential filing for approval of pegvaliase for use in patients with phenylketonuria, or PKU. PKU is caused by a buildup of phenylalanine, an amino acid found in many foods, especially those high in protein. When phenylalanine builds up, it can cause mental, behavioral, neurological, and physical problems. About 50,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with PKU, and BioMarin expects to file for pegvaliase's approval before the end of this year.As for the rumored mergers and acquisitions, it's unclear if there's any truth to the talk regarding Sanofi's interest. The likelihood that Sanofi could bid for BioMarin may have declined this week since it entered into a confidentiality agreement to kick the tires of  , a cancer drug company. Earlier this week, new rumors emerged that  may be interested in buying BioMarin, but it's not clear if there's any truth to that rumor either.Overall, BioMarin is an intriguing company with a slate of valuable drugs that target uncommon diseases. With its chance for profitability next year and new drugs making their way to market, investors ought to consider adding this company to their portfolios.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The Dow finished down 23 points, with most market commentators looking at the nearly 5% decline in the  as a significant factor in the downbeat mood among investors.Nervousness about whether Friday's employment report will rebound from a poor showing last month also weighed on sentiment, but some stocks still managed to post substantial gains. Among the best performers were  (NYSE: AVG) ,  (NASDAQ: EZPW) , and  (NASDAQ: BMRN) .AVG Technologies soared more than 30% after the maker of internet security products agreed to a buyout offer from competitor  . The deal values AVG at $1.3 billion, and will give shareholders $25 per share in cash for their stock.For Avast, the acquisition is intended to boost its scale by giving it more technological expertise and geographical reach in its business. As AVG CEO Gary Kovacs explained, \"Our new scale will allow us to accelerate investments in growing markets and continue to focus on providing comprehensive and simple-to-use solutions for consumers and businesses.\" The deal will take place through a tender offer, and although the details are somewhat complicated, Avast should be able to move forward with the acquisition as long as 80% of shares are tendered.EZCorp jumped 16% in the wake of its announcement Wednesday afternoon that it had agreed to sell off its Grupo Finmart business to consumer-lending specialist AlphaCredit. EZCorp currently owns 94% of Grupo Finmart, which makes consumer loans to employees of Mexican government agencies. The deal should give EZCorp $50 million in cash, less any adjustments related to cash and short-term debt within the company at the time the sale closes.As CEO Stuart Grimshaw noted, \"We have been consistently executing the three-year strategic program we announced in July 2015 to focus on meeting our customers' need for cash better than anyone else in the industry, optimizing our pawn businesses, and achieving record returns on investment above our cost of equity.\" The move will focus nearly all of EZCorp's business on the pawn market in the U.S. and Mexico.Finally, BioMarin rose 9%. Reports suggested that  might be interested in buying the biotech company. The report made it clear that, although people at Roche were looking at a potential deal, there was no confirmation that any formal bid had been made, or that discussions had taken place.Given how far BioMarin has fallen, even the thinnest of rumors was enough to send the stock higher. For investors who have been disappointed by the rejection earlier this year of its Kyndrisa treatment for muscular dystrophy, the idea of a buyout might make the perfect exit for BioMarin shareholders.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

In fact, the top biotechnology ETF (  ) has seen a loss of roughly 25.5% in the past 52 weeks, making for a massive underperformance when compared to the broad markets in the same time frame.And while there has been a bit of a comeback lately, the last few trading days have certainly put an end to that, as IBB has lost nearly five percent in the past five trading sessions.But which stocks in particular have been driving this horrendous return as of late for this popular ETF? The following stocks are definitely the culprits as they have all lost more than the overall ETF with several slumping more than 10% in the time frame. Let's take a quick look at a few of the biggest contributors to IBB's underperformance as of late below:Biogen shares have been in trouble lately thanks to a weak report on its MS drug results. The Phase 2 trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints and shares of BIIB plunged as a result (see  ).The stock remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while it has a VGM Score of 'A,' so fundamentals are still looking promising for this stock despite the recent drop.More poor drug trial news to report back on, as ALXN suffered from a Phrase III letdown in its Soliris drug, as this missed its primary efficacy endpoint. Shares sold off significantly as a result of this release, and it is especially disappointing since it comes in Phase III (see  ).The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (sell) while it has Value and Growth Style Scores of 'D' so there are definitely better prospects out there in the biotechnology world right now.And BioMarin struggled as its main competitor in the Muscular Dystrophy market, Sarepta, saw some somewhat promising news from the FDA. This hope for SRPT along with BioMarin's woes in the space, lead many investors to continue their exodus out of BMRN shares which was to IBB investors' detriment yet again (see  ).This stock is also a Zacks Rank #3 (hold), but the quarterly Earnings ESP is plunging, coming in at -13.5%. This suggests that the most recent estimates have been pretty weak for BMRN and that a downgrade may be on the horizon if this trend continues.This was a bit of a surprise addition to the list of biggest losers on the week, as REGN actually reported positive results from a Phase III trial. However, the perception of the broader space has swung negative and REGN was unable to escape the downturn, falling more than 7% on the week (See  for more info).Arguably shares had run up a bit too high in the preceding month and this was just a bit of a snap back to reality. Still, this remains a decent choice in the space thanks to solid EPS growth projections and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). And unlike others on the list, it has been seeing some relatively positive news lately.The four components listed above make up roughly one-fifth of the total exposure in IBB so they are bound to have a big impact on its overall performance. Investors in IBB will definitely need to see a turnaround here before the fund can make a comeback, and return to its storied past.However, you could easily argue that the boom is starting to fade in the biotech sector, and especially so given the coming political headwinds for the space.

But they weren't much easier to hold in early 2016 either. Source: But a light started to shine at the end of the tunnel a few weeks ago.Some are doing better than others, of course, but it's increasingly clear the industry as a whole isn't inevitably doomed. Now rather than later may be an ideal time to get into one or more of the underappreciated names in the group.With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at ten of the better stocks to buy among the market's rebounding biotech names. Some are well-established, while others simply have catalysts on the near-term calendar. All of them, however, are worthy of consideration.Revlimid, from ( ), won't lose its key patent protection until 2020, and the market\nis already beating it down (by virtue of traders discussing it and , for example). To be fair, the drug industry's proverbial falling off the so-called \"patent cliff\" a few years back was indeed disruptive. Intent on never being caught off-guard again, however, investors are thinking a little too defensively/pessimistically now.Revlimid, from  (  ), won't lose its key patent protection until 2020, and the market is already beating it down (by virtue of traders discussing it  and  , for example).Once traders realize it's a tad too soon to punish the company, the recent tumble from CELG should turn around.The kicker: While investors have been focused on what might happen to Revlimid in the relatively distant future, they've overlooked one of the biggest reasons CELG should be on a list of biotech stocks to buy: Otezla, for psoriasis, is just starting to take off after a slow start following its 2014 approval.It already controls more than 40% of the U.S. market, and its projected revenue of $1 billion this year is expected to  next year.( ) is an exception to that norm, and has earned a spot on the top\nten list of hot biopharma stocks; because not only is it\nprofitable, it's also reasonably priced.

ANIK sports a trailing price-earnings ratio of 21 and a forward-looking P/E of 25, and it's got the growth rates to justify this above-average valuations.Last quarter - the company's first fiscal quarter of 2016 -  , and earnings of 45 cents per share handily topped estimates of 28 cents. It wasn't the first time Anika has posted stellar numbers.Osteoarthritis drugs Orthovisc and Monovisc have been doing the bulk of the growth so far, but  (not to mention is being tried in conjunction with other drugs for new indications), Anika Therapeutics remains on a growth path.The news knocked off $8 billion worth of the market capitalization Biogen stock was sporting as of Monday's close. A little over a year ago,  (  ) was a biotech hero. Its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera was a smash hit, and BIIB was a must-have. But last April, shareholders had a bomb dropped on them - it was recognized that one of the key components of the drug  .By mid-year the sales for an already slowing Tecfidera were  . Unable to shake their worries, BIIB shares lost nearly 50% from their March-2015 peak to this March's low.The punishment doesn't fit the actual crime, though.

This was\u00a0partially because Gilead started charging more\npalatable prices to distributors, and also because new HCV\ncompetition from ( ), called, Zepatier, . To be fair, investors had to know it was only a matter of time before the stunningly high cost of ballyhooed hepatitis-C drug came back to haunt their maker,  (  ).The  , with expectations for Harvoni and Sovaldi combined  . This was partially because Gilead started charging more palatable prices to distributors, and also because new HCV competition from  (  ), called, Zepatier,  .The 30% tumble since last June, however - with much of it rematerializing after last quarter's Sovaldi and Harvoni numbers were unveiled - is a punishment that doesn't fit the crime.Gilead  , and its pipeline is being bolstered again. (  ) shareholders are still feeling the sting of the FDA's rejection of Kyndrisa as a muscular dystrophy drug. Rather than wallowing in their own pity, they and any other would-be investors may want to put BMRN on their list of biotech stocks to buy. Another drug - BMN 270, for the treatment of hemophilia - was stunningly impressive during early trials.In short, of the eight patients tested as part of the phase 1/2 trial,  . Two of the eight saw drastic improvements.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum  :\"While the data presented today were small numbers and of relatively limited follow-up the data were encouraging (though looks like significant variability from patient to patient) and (1) suggest a path forward for BMN 270 in hemophilia A (and potentially for hemo A gene therapy in general) and (2) set a reasonably high bar for competition that will follow.\"It's a big deal, as the underserved hemophilia market will  over the next nine years.Although it will be a long while before BioMarin can tap into it, the milestones BMN 270 could reach along the way will help push the stock upward in the meantime.

Last quarter, the company's top line  , and it grew (on a year-over-year basis) for a fifteenth straight quarter. Companies don't grow that consistently without doing something right.Better yet, unlike many of its small cap peers in the biotech industry, BEAT is reliably profitable, and has been since late-2014. (  ) isn't for the faint of heart, but traders who can stomach the risk/volatility may want to add to this small cap to a list of biotech stocks to buy sooner than later.Cempra primarily develops differentiated antibiotics to treat the growing number of antibiotic-resistant infections. It has a couple of drugs on the market, but any bullish thesis on CEMP is mostly going to be based on its pipeline,  , which is a treatment for moderately-severe community acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).The antibiotic  , and though CEMP has been all over the map since then, the stock should straighten up headed into a  .The flagship of that pipeline is CD19 - a , and being tested in multiple phase-1 and phase-2 trials at this\ntime.

That's an awful lot of money for the drug not to be the real deal.The company continues to find new indications for the drug -\nalso known as eculizumab - .

Soliris is  , with updates slated throughout the remainder of the year.Throw in the fact that the company is  that could generate $180 million in new sales between them, and the new lineup puts ALXN on a short list of biotech stocks to own sooner than later. Between a portfolio with just one true \"blockbuster\" drug so far, a trailing P/E of more than 60 and a stock priced at a psychologically challenging $396 per share (the price level shouldn't matter, but it does),  (  ) is a tough stock to justify buying right now.The REGN you know and see now, however, isn't the same REGN you'll see and know five years from now.

While the market mustered a modest rebound, owners of  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) weren't so lucky. These three stocks were among the worst of the worst.Here's a closer look at why none of them could buy a friend on Thursday.Already down 8% since this weekend's mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch fanned the bearish flames for American Airlines Group today by downgrading AAL from \"Neutral\" to \"Sell.\" However, the downgrade of AAL didn't stem from the likely quelling of travel plans in the shadow of rekindled terrorism fear. Rather,  .That said, Didora did acknowledge the potential impact the terrorist attack may have, as well as the volatility that a \"Brexit\" could create.Bank of America/Merrill Lynch also  , with today's 4% dip bringing it one step closer to that mark.Some say it's an overreaction. Others disagree with that assessment. Whichever it is, it doesn't change the fact that BioMarin Pharmaceutical fell nearly 4% on Thursday following reports that the company had suspended recruitment for a trial of its hemophilia drug BMN 270.There was no official statement on the matter from the company; one may or may not come at a later time. Rather,  . More often than not though, such a suspension is a sign that a trial had encountered unexpected problems, or failed to produce the hoped-for results. In fact, BMRN had already suggested at one point there may be some safety issues with BMN 270.That's the point Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum made today,  :\"We spoke with the company, who confirmed that today's news on clinicaltrials.gov is not new and that the posting of this update to the website just took a few weeks. Recall, BioMarin has said that they will need to speak with EU regulators prior to dosing the last 3 gene therapy patients in the trial (expected by around August) because one patient (#3) had an ALT elevation slightly above his ULN (47 vs ULN of 41). This discussion with regulators prior to dosing the last patients was meant to be an early safety precaution and was self-imposed as part of BioMarin's protocol for a first-in-human hemophilia A gene therapy.\"Traders weren't sympathetic, however.Last but not least, semiconductor maker Cavium saw its stock plunge more than 17% after announcing it  (NASDAQ:  ) for a cool $1.4 billion. QLGC shares, conversely, gained more than 9% on the heels of the healthy offer.The premise of the acquisition wasn't received well by analysts either, with at least four of them downgrading CAVM following the news. Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Ramsay  :\"While we believe this acquisition could prove technologically prudent long term and adds important new elements to Cavium's product portfolio, the deal brings with it a stark shift in anticipated strategy given Cavium is just ahead of several new product ramps and potentially lowers the long-term growth rate of the company \u2026 given our anticipation of a more compressed valuation until closer to realized merger synergies and given our ongoing near-term concerns about lumpiness in the MIPS-based business, we are downgrading Cavium shares from Buy to HOLD until catalysts grow closer, and lowering our price target from $61 to $48.\"Still, a handful of analysts are bullish on CAVM in the wake of the buyout.

For the Biotech ETF (Symbol: BBH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $136.73 per unit.With BBH trading at a recent price near $109.41 per unit, that means that analysts see 24.97% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.

Nevertheless, the company intends to work on the development of a transition plan for the patients who are currently being treated with these candidates.Meanwhile, the company stated that it will continue to develop next generation oligonucleotides for the treatment of DMD.Despite the fact that a MAA was withdrawn from the EU, BioMarin continues to expect to achieve break-even or better results in 2017.We remind investors that in Jan 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) related to the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for Kyndrisa for the same indication. The agency rejected the application, citing that Kyndrisa had failed to meet the standard of substantial evidence of effectiveness in treating DMD.DMD, a devastating and debilitating disease, is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 3,500-5,000 boys born across the world, indicating significant unmet need for treatments in this space.We note that Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.  is also looking to get its DMD drug approved.

Johnson & Johnson  kick-started the season on a positive note, wherein its earnings surpassed expectations and the company raised its outlook for the year, followed by the announcement of better-than-expected earnings by biotech player, Biogen Inc.  . Swiss oncology major, Novartis'  earnings, on the other hand, failed to meet expectations.Let's find out what's in store for the companies scheduled to report results later this week.Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.  is scheduled to report first-quarter 2016 results on Apr 28. Keryx currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and 0.00% Earnings ESP. Moreover, Keryx's track record has been disappointing so far. Over the four trailing quarters, the company has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 16.50%, having met earnings expectations in two quarters and missed the same in the other two. In addition, the company's top line solely comprises revenues generated by Auryxia (ferric citrate) and it does not expect sales in the first quarter of 2016 to grow at the 40%-plus rate that it recorded last quarter.

The agency informed the company that it continues to review the NDA and will try to reach a decision as early as possible.We remind investors that DMD drugs have not witnessed much success on the regulatory front so far. Last week, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  announced that it does not intend to continue with the development of Kyndrisa. The company withdrew its marketing application in the EU following discussions with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), which indicated that the drug would receive a negative opinion from the committee. Kyndrisa had also received a complete response letter (CRL) earlier this year.DMD, a devastating and debilitating disease, is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 3,500-5,000 boys born across the world, indicating significant unmet need for treatments in this space.Investor focus is expected to remain on the outcome of the approval status of eteplirsen.Sarepta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This decrease was primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations in Latin America and the return of Kuvan rights to BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  . Organically, sales at this segment improved 5.4%. Erbitux's sales increased to \u20ac207 million, while Rebif sales were slightly down to \u20ac422 million due to continued competitive pressures and negative currency impact.Life Science recorded sales of \u20ac1.4 billion, up 89.3%, primarily due to the acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich in late 2015. Organic sales at the segment climbed 8.9%. The Process Solutions business generated organic growth of 15.9%, while Applied Solutions posted organic sales of 3.6%.Performance Materials sales inched up 0.9% to \u20ac622 million backed by the inclusion of Sigma-Aldrich's SAFC Hitech business and a positive currency impact. However, organically, this segment witnessed a 2.4% decline in sales.Under its partnership with Pfizer Inc.  , Merck KGaA initiated a phase III study (JAVELIN Renal 101) on avelumab, in an advanced renal cell setting. The candidate is also being evaluated in a number of phase III studies for several cancer indications.Sales in 2016 are expected in the range of \u20ac14.8 billion to \u20ac15 billion. On an organic basis, sales are anticipated to grow slightly. The Healthcare segment is expected to witness a slight increase in organic sales, while organic sales of Life Science are expected in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Performance Materials segment is expected to be organically stable in 2016. Backed by the Sigma-Aldrich acquisition, the company expects a positive portfolio effect on sales in the low double-digit percentage range.Sales are, however, expected to be hurt by foreign exchange impact of 3-5% due to continued devaluation of Latin American currencies.Merck KGaA' first-quarter earnings were impressive, with the company reporting a year-over-year growth in both earnings and sales. Backed by the acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA recorded impressive performance at all three business segments in the first quarter of 2016.Going ahead, we believe that the Sigma-Aldrich acquisition, along with the company's collaboration with Pfizer in the field of immuno-oncology, will pave the way for future growth. However, we remain concerned about the impact of negative foreign exchange fluctuations that are expected to hamper sales in 2016.Investors looking for a well-ranked stock in the health care sector may consider Bristol-Myers Squibb Company  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Some of the immediately pressing concerns are a possible recession in the UK, unemployment woes, a plunging pound, and uncertainty regarding M&A deals in the UK among others.A big question is how will Brexit impact drug companies?The first thing that comes to mind is the impact of Brexit on the drug approval process in the UK and EU. Currently, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) looks into the approval process under a centralized authorization procedure which allows drug companies to submit a single marketing authorization application to the EMA. Under this process, the companies are able to market their medicines throughout the EU on the basis of a single marketing authorization thereby saving cost and time.But with Brexit, a lot now depends on whether the UK will remain within the ambit of the EMA the way countries like Norway are or whether the UK will set up its own regulatory authority for drug approval. If the first scenario prevails, the approval process will continue as it is. However, if the UK sets up its own regulatory agency, the approval process could end up being lengthier as well as more expensive for companies seeking UK and EU approval for their drugs.Meanwhile, the EMA, which is based in London, will now have to look for new headquarters.Another factor that could be impacted by Brexit is the flow of research funds into the UK from the EU. With Britain exiting the EU, more of these funds could be diverted to other countries or research hubs.On the other hand, the falling pound should prove to be a tailwind for companies like GlaxoSmithKline plc  . Moreover, most of the drug companies generate a major part of their revenues from the U.S. though companies like Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  , Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  , Celgene Corporation  and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  among others do generate quite a bit of revenues from Europe. Nevertheless, that should not be a cause for concern in the long-term as factors like an aging population, growing medical needs, and easier access to medical products will continue driving demand for healthcare products.While Brexit does create economic uncertainty and there could be some near-term volatility in the sector, the general verdict is that Brexit's impact on drug stocks will be limited. What could end up being more concerning is the exit of additional countries from the EU.Glaxo, Celgene and BioMarin are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, while Alexion is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock and Vertex a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.96%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.At the time of reporting fourth-quarter 2015 results, Celgene guided 2016 earnings in the range of $5.50 to $5.70 per share with first-quarter 2016 earnings expected in the range of $1.27 to $1.30 per share. Net product sales for 2016 are expected to be $10.5-$11 billion including a negative impact from currency movement of approximately $120 million.Key drug, Revlimid, should remain the main growth driver in the first quarter of 2016 as well. Market share gains in the U.S., ongoing launches in the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma indication in the U.S. and EU and favorable clinical data should help the drug contribute significantly to the top line. Reimbursement in additional EU countries should further aid revenues. Celgene expects Revlimid net sales in the range of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion in 2016.Meanwhile, other products including Abraxane, Pomalyst/Imnovid and the newly launched Otezla should also continue to perform well in the first quarter of 2016 on the back of increased demand, label expansion and global launches.We note that Celgene is facing generic competition for Vidaza. Moreover, in Mar 2016, the company received a paragraph IV certification notice letter from Allergan plc  . Allergan is looking to get its generic version of Abraxane approved in the U.S.On the first-quarter call, investor focus is expected to remain on the company's performance and label expansion efforts along with pipeline updates.Celgene's performance has been decent with the company beating earnings estimates on two occasions, while posting in line results in one. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 0.74%.    Our proven model does not conclusively show that Celgene is likely to beat estimates. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as elaborated below. The Earnings ESP for Celgene is 0.00% since the Most Accurate estimate stands in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05. Celgene carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with an ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  is +22.35% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release first-quarter results on Apr 28.Amgen Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.52% and a Zacks Rank #3.

For the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $46.02 per unit.With QQXT trading at a recent price near $38.60 per unit, that means that analysts see 19.21% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQXT's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN), Dish Network Corp (Symbol: DISH), and Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Symbol: ALXN). Although BMRN has traded at a recent price of $80.80/share, the average analyst target is 41.17% higher at $114.07/share. Similarly, DISH has 40.87% upside from the recent share price of $46.70 if the average analyst target price of $65.78/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ALXN to reach a target price of $198.21/share, which is 40.59% above the recent price of $140.99.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments?

The company reported a narrower-than-expected loss in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 8.98%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Vimizim and Kuvan, which boosted sales in the previous quarter, are likely to have generated higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter as well. In addition, the launch of Vimizim in new markets should contribute to the top line.The company's efforts on expanding Vimizim's reach in established markets to bring new patients onto therapy at a faster pace and introducing the drug in new markets in each quarter should drive revenues. For the full year, Vimizim sales are expected to be $300-$330 million.Meanwhile, adoption of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics practice guidelines to raise awareness on the benefits of Kuvan and its importance in the life-long treatment of phenylketonuria, which had increased the utilization of the drug in both adolescents and adults, should continue to accelerate growth.Having regained the rights to Kuvan, the company is now focused on transferring marketing authorizations and licenses in each country and undertaking order-to-cash activities. Also, with Kuvan's market exclusivity in the EU slated to expire in 2024. BioMarin should get ample time to maximize its efforts on driving top-line growth.On the flip side, negative currency movements and unpredictable order patterns of Naglazyme in Latin America are causes of concern. Naglazyme has also been experiencing historically uneven order patterns in Latin America. Nevertheless, the drug is expected to generate stable or increasing revenues in 2016.With a number of data readouts lined up for the upcoming quarters, we expect investor focus to remain on further updates regarding the company's pipeline during the first-quarter call.Our proven model shows that BioMarin is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +22.35%. BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with the company's positive ESP, makes us fairly confident of an earnings beat this season.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision momentum.Biomarin is not the only company looking up this earnings season.

Let's see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Products like Enbrel, Xgeva, Vectibix, Sensipar, Prolia and Kyprolis should continue performing well. Kyprolis looks well-positioned to gain share with both the ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data in its U.S. label.The on-body injector for Neulasta should also do well considering the positive feedback from healthcare providers. Neulasta is expected to grow modestly in 2016 with a biosimilar launch in the U.S. not expected until year end at the earliest. Meanwhile, continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe should boost Prolia growth.The bottom line will continue to be driven by the company's overall cost-cutting efforts and share buybacks. The company's restructuring plan should make it leaner and more cost efficient.However, Epogen will continue to be impacted by further share declines at  and the potential for additional switching to Aranesp.Investor focus will primarily remain on the performance of the company's PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, its acceptance in the physician community and the formulary scenario for the product. We expect Repatha sales to pick up once positive outcomes data is available and added to the label. The impact of the launch of Zarxio (biosimilar) on Neupogen sales will also be in focus.Amgen's track record is pretty impressive with the company beating earnings estimates consistently. The average earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 13.71%.Our proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. : Earnings Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +3.52%.

The start of 2016 was mired by macroeconomic issues like wildly swinging  and a slowdown in China.The volatility which was sparked off in the second half of 2015 by Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's price gouging tweet continued to plague the biotech sector in 2016 as well. The NYSE ARCA Biotech Index (^BTK) and NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (^NBI) have declined 11.6% and 12.0%, respectively, so far this year.Notwithstanding the decline, things surely look far better now than they did a couple of months back. Last week, Biogen Inc. (BIIB) reported better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter of 2016 even though revenues fell short of expectations.It has been a busy year so far for the biotech sector. M&A and licensing deals continue to be a key area of focus with Shire (SHPG) announcing the acquisition of Baxalta Inc. (BXLT) for $32 billion right at the onset of 2016. The acquisition is expected to close by mid-year. And last week, rumors of AstraZeneca (AZN) making a bid for Xtandi maker Medivation (MDVN) surfaced.Meanwhile, new product approvals along with label expansion of existing drugs and regular pipeline updates for key drugs kept investors' attention glued to the sector. Earlier in the month, the FDA's Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee voted unanimously in favor of Intercept Pharmaceuticals' (ICPT) lead pipeline candidate, Ocaliva (obeticholic acid) while AbbVie along with partner Roche (RHHBY) received accelerated approval for oncology drug Venclexta (venetoclax) for previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia with a 17p deletion.On the other hand, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN) was dealt a blow when the company received a Complete Response Letter for Kyndrisa for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) amenable to exon 51 skipping. Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SCMP) too slumped recently when a phase II study on pipeline candidate, cobiprostone, failed to meet the primary endpoint in a trial on patients with non-erosive reflux disease or symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease.Nevertheless, given the strong fundamentals, healthy pipelines and the drive to find innovative treatments for rare diseases, the happening biotech sector should be a good bet for investors. Here we help you to identify some companies in the biotech sector that have the potential to beat earnings in their upcoming releases. These stocks are well positioned in today's market environment, and could see considerable upside riding on the aforementioned trends. An earnings beat should help these stocks gain investor confidence and show a favorable price movement.Given a large number of industry participants, pinpointing stocks that have the potential to beat estimates could appear to be a daunting task. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) - and a positive  .Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Below are five biotech stocks we believe are best positioned to stand out as we take a stand in the ongoing earnings season:Biotech bigwig,  (  ) carries a Zacks Rank #2 with an Earnings ESP of +1.65%. Gilead's key areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, cardiovascular, hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory. The company is a leader in the HCV market with key drugs like Sovaldi and Harvoni.The company has an excellent track record and registered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.8%. The company is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 28. . (  ) is also looking up this season with a Zacks Rank #3 with an Earnings ESP of +63.64%. Seattle Genetics primarily focuses on the development and commercialization of therapies targeted for the treatment of cancer. The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, is approved for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The company is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 28. . (  ) carries a Zacks Rank #3 with an Earnings ESP of +22.35%.

Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 35.71%. Will Bristol-Myers be able to beat estimates this time around as well? Let us see how things have shaped up for this quarter.Bristol-Myers' high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, should continue to contribute to top-line growth on the back of label as well as geographical expansions. Pricing and reimbursement in additional EU countries should further aid revenues. Other oncology drugs like Yervoy and Sprycel should also continue to perform well in the first quarter of 2016.Apart from oncology drugs, anticoagulant Eliquis' performance should continue to accelerate growth across the key markets where its uptake has been strong, while rheumatoid arthritis drug, Orencia, contributes significantly to revenues.However, the top line could be under pressure due to the transfer of North American rights for Erbitux and the expiration of commercialization rights of Abilify in the U.S. and the EU. Moreover, the company's HIV and HCV businesses are expected to remain under competitive pressure.We note that Bristol-Myers divested its HIV pipeline to ViiV Healthcare (an HIV-focused company) in Feb 2016. Meanwhile, unfavorable currency movement will continue to hurt both top- and bottom-line growth.During the first quarter, Bristol-Myers continued to actively build its partnership portfolio and pursue strategic acquisitions. In a bid to strengthen and accelerate the development of its immunoscience pipeline, last month, the company announced its intention to acquire a privately held MA-based biotech company, Padlock Therapeutics, Inc. The acquisition, which was completed early this month, gave Bristol-Myers the rights to Padlock's protein/peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD) inhibitor discovery program focused on autoimmune diseases.But it's not just immunoscience; the company plans to continue striking acquisitions/deals in other therapeutic areas such as oncology, fibrosis and genetically defined diseases.On the first-quarter call, investor focus is expected to be on the performance of recently launched multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti, along with that of other marketed products.Bristol-Myers has an impressive track record, with earnings. The company's earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters, with average positive surprise of 35.14%.For the first quarter, our proven model does not conclusively show that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat estimates. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as elaborated below. The Earnings ESP for Bristol-Myers is 0.00% since the Most Accurate estimate stands in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents. Bristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #2.

The average earnings surprise over the last four quarters is +25.57%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Vertex, known for its strong presence in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market, has two key CF products in its portfolio - Kalydeco and Orkambi.While Kalydeco revenues should continue growing, the growth rate in patients on Kalydeco will be tempered by enrollment in the VX-661 program.First quarter sales will also be impacted by inventory stocking of about $6 million in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, patient starts for recently launched Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor), approved for the treatment of CF in people ages 12 and older with two copies of the F508del mutation, are expected to decline sequentially, in line with the company's prior statements regarding expectations for the rate of uptake for Orkambi. Vertex expects this trend to continue through the end of 2016, by which time the vast majority of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. should have initiated treatment with Orkambi.Orkambi sales in 2016 will comprise primarily of revenues generated in the U.S. and Germany.Operating expenses will also shoot up as Vertex develops its pipeline and works on expanding Kalydeco's and Orkambi's labels and continues to invest in the Orkambi launch.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Vertex is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

The average earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 4.85%. On its fourth quarter call, AbbVie had said that it expects first quarter revenues to grow just above 20% on an operational basis with currency expected to negatively impact revenues by about 4%. Key drug, Humira, should remain the main growth driver in the first quarter - growing awareness, strong underlying demand, favorable clinical data, additional indications and market share gains should help the product to continue contributing significantly to the top line.However, first quarter ex-U.S. Humira sales are expected to grow 3% on an operational basis reflecting difficult year-over-year comparisons due to the timing of shipments. Another factor to be considered for international Humira sales is the impact of Remicade and Enbrel biosimilars.We also expect investor focus to remain on the performance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira. The addition of liver injury warnings to the labels of AbbVie's HCV treatments will impact sales as will the entry of a new competitor (Zepatier). AbbVie expects worldwide Viekira sales of approximately $2 billion in 2016.Another focus area will be the performance of Imbruvica which was added to AbbVie's portfolio following its May 2015 acquisition of Pharmacyclics. Imbruvica has multi-billion dollar potential and the company is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica's label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.AbbVie is positioning Imbruvica as a \"pipeline in a molecule\" -- the treatment is currently in a wide range of studies. AbbVie expects Imbruvica revenues of at least $1.8 billion in 2016. Imbruvica is partnered with Johnson & Johnson  , which recorded first quarter Imbruvica sales of $261 million. The recent addition of the RESONATE-2 data to the label should help boost sales.AndroGel sales should continue declining given the presence of generic competition. Negative market trends will impact HIV sales also. Meanwhile, Duopa sales should ramp up eventually as physicians grow familiar with the product. Creon should also perform well with the product capturing the vast majority of new prescription starts in the pancreatic enzyme market.AbbVie has entered into quite a few collaborations so far in 2016 including with companies like Boehringer Ingelheim, argenx and CytomX. With the Boehringer deal expected to be earnings dilutive, AbbVie updated its 2016 guidance and now expects EPS of $4.82 - $5.02.On its fourth quarter call, AbbVie had guided towards first quarter earnings per share of $1.13 - $1.15. AbbVie is also working on improving operating efficiency through ongoing initiatives.Our proven model shows that AbbVie is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. : Earnings Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.77%.

Shares of biotech stock  are surging more than 26% higher as of 1:15 p.m. ET after a bullish article by TheStreet.com's Adam Feurstein suggests that the company's Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug eteplirsen may still have a chance at winning Food and Drug Administration approval. The  makes a convincing case that Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA's most senior evaluator, may be willing to go against the committee's recommendation and give eteplirsen the green light. That may not be as far-fetched as it sounds as the committee's vote against an accelerated approval was quite close. Six members of the panel were in favor of it while seven voted against it.In the article, Feurstein highlighted several comments that Woodcock and a few other influential physicians made during the meeting, which suggests that eteplirsen isn't as much of a guaranteed denial as many investors expect.Sarepta Therapeutics traders appear to be convinced that the article brings up a handful of valid points, hence the shares are skyrocketing today. While it still looks like the most likely outcome is a rejection, it is possible that the FDA could surprise investors and the DMD community at large with an approval. After all, eteplirsen is the last drug standing as a potential treatment for DMD after the agency outright rejected  ' drug drisapersen in January. That leaves patients with DMD no real treatment options, which is a point not lost on the agency. For that reason, the FDA could be willing to overlook the fact that Sarepta's clinical trial only included 12 patients.However, if history is any guide, Sarepta's chances of approval still seem quite low as the FDA did follow the advice of the advisory committee when it voted on whether to approve BioMarin's drug. Either way, investors won't have to wait long to get an official ruling as the agency is set to make its decision on May 26.While this article does a great job of making a case that the drug still has a chance, I think there's too much uncertainty in the air for me to consider making an investment. For that reason, I'm content to continue watching this fascinating story unfold from the sidelines.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.The company reports results under three business sectors - Healthcare, Life Science and Performance Materials.Sales at the Healthcare division should continue being driven by continued growth in sales of products like Erbitux, Gonal-f, and Neurobion. Moreover, sales in the Asia-Pacific region should fuel organic growth. However, we remain concerned about Rebrif sales, which are being hurt by competitive pressure from oral formulations.The Life Science division witnessed organic sales growth last quarter driven by continued demand for its products and the integration of the Sigma-Aldrich business. This trend should be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Sales at the Performance Materials unit should continue to improve on the back of the acquisitions of AZ Electronic Materials and Sigma-Aldrich Hitech business as well.Backed by the Sigma-Aldrich acquisition, the company expects a positive portfolio effect on sales in the low double-digit percentage range in 2016.The company's agreement with BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc.  to return the rights to Kuvan for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) has allowed it to earn cash proceeds worth \u20ac340 million. This one-time gain should be reflected in the company's first-quarter earnings.Meanwhile, Merck KGaA, in collaboration with Pfizer Inc.  , is evaluating avelumab in several phase III studies - JAVELIN Gastric 100 (advanced or metastatic gastric/gastro-esophageal junction cancers in patients whose disease has not progressed with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy), JAVELIN Gastric 300 (advanced or metastatic gastric/gastro-esophageal junction cancers), JAVELIN Ovarian 200 (platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer), and JAVELIN Bladder 100 (urothelial cancer). In Apr 2016, the companies initiated another phase III study, JAVELIN Renal 101, to evaluate avelumab, in combination with Pfizer's Inlyta, for the treatment of patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma.Investors are expected to focus on the company's approved products and avelumab's progress during its first-quarter call.Here is a health care stock that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements - a positive Zacks  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 - to post an earnings beat this quarter.Axovant Sciences Ltd.  has an Earnings ESP of +69.57% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Over the four trailing quarters, the company has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 2.10%, having beaten estimates in only one quarter and missing in the rest.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Soliris, the main growth driver at Alexion, is expected to keep up its performance in the approved indications paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome thereby driving top-line growth. The company continues to add new patients in both the indications.The launch Kanuma and Strensiq should also contribute to revenues and reduce the company's dependence on a single product for growth.Strensiq's launch, however, is projected to be sluggish as is the case with therapies for ultra-rare diseases, mainly due to low incidents, high mortality among hypophosphatasia patients, and low awareness of the disease.In its fourth-quarter call, the company provided its guidance for the first quarter of 2016. Revenues are expected in the range of $735 million to $745 million in constant currency, excluding the impact of $35 million due to foreign exchange headwinds. The company projects earnings in the range of $1.10-$1.15 per share.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Alexion is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) to likely post an earnings beat. But that is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 91 cents.

Lilly's Zacks Rank #2 when combined with an ESP of -1.18% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.While currency and generic competition for some products will play an unfavorable role in the first quarter, another area of concern is lower volume in China. Growth is being impacted by government initiatives and policies and more hospitals and institutions are shifting to lower-priced generics. This situation is expected to continue in the near term.Moreover, Alimta may continue to experience some softening in later lines of therapy (second line and beyond) reflecting the launch of Cyramza in the second-line setting as well as competition from immuno-oncology agents.However, products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Humalog, and Trajenta should continue performing well. The second-line setting represents incremental opportunity for Cyramza. Revenues should also benefit from the takeback of North American rights for Erbitux.Lilly could also see an uptick in Jardiance sales - the company and its partner Boehringer Ingelheim scored a big win with Jardiance succeeding in a long-term cardiovascular (CV) outcomes study. The highlight of the results was Jardiance's ability to actually reduce CV risk - an essential part of diabetes management. These study results are a huge positive for Lilly - with about 50% of deaths in type II diabetics resulting from CV disease, the addition of this data to Jardiance's label would lead to a major surge in sales.Other drugs in Lilly's portfolio like Glyxambi and Synjardy could also benefit as both belong to the Jardiance family. While Glyxambi is a combination of Jardiance and Tradjenta, Synjardy combines Jardiance and metformin.Alimta should continue doing well in the first-line setting and continuation maintenance for which it is being promoted.Investors will also be focused on the performance of new products like cancer drug Portrazza.Here are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +18.61% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because BioMarin Pharmaceutical is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BMRN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 66 cents per share for BMRN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate at a loss of 85 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BMRN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 22.35% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that BMRN has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for BioMarin Pharmaceutical, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The average earnings surprise over the last four quarters is +7.23%.Let's see how things are shaping up for the first quarter.Since the emergence of the first progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)-related death in a patient on oral MS drug, Tecfidera, investor focus has remained on the performance of the drug.Tecfidera sales grew 6% on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter though U.S. sales were positively impacted by an increase in inventory (approximately $30 million). Biogen is working on growing Tecfidera sales and is pursuing commercial initiatives including new direct to consumer marketing programs.Tecfidera demand is expected to remain relatively stable in the U.S. While the company expects its recently launched marketing campaign to reaccelerate growth, the impact cannot be determined until the second quarter of the year. Biogen expects constant pricing in Europe and continued patient growth, particularly in recently launched markets.Tysabri should remain on a stable trajectory. Meanwhile, the number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy combined will continue to decline as patients move toward oral treatments.Eloctate is expected to continue growing as a significant portion of the patient population that can benefit from long-acting therapies is yet to be treated. Alprolix patient adds are expected to moderate given the rapid uptake and penetration so far.Biogen also expects its profit share for Rituxan and Gazyva to decline on FDA approval for Gazyva for Rituxan-refectory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Biogen does not expect any price increases for Avonex, Plegridy, and Tecfidera in the U.S. for the remainder of the year.Meanwhile, the company expects the head count reduction and restructuring initiative announced in October to benefit operating expenses by about $250 million this year. Biogen also intends to reduce targeted fees and services expenses, which are largely reflected in SG&A. : Investor focus on the first quarter call will remain on Tecfidera's scrip trends, news regarding additional PML cases, whether the company is planning to divest the hemophilia business and if there is any new share buyback program on the cards.Our proven model shows that Biogen is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. : Earnings Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.90%.This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. : Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks of #1, #2 and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.

However, the reported figure was wider than the year-ago loss of 25 cents.The company's revenues came in at $236.7 million in the quarter, up 16.7% from the year-ago quarter, driven by strong sales of Vimizim and Kuvan. Revenues, however, narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $240 million.Vimizim contributed $72.6 million to the total revenue, up 43.5% year over year on growth of commercial patient count and continued global launch.Kuvan revenues soared 53.2% to $76.9 million driven by strong sales in North America.Naglazyme sales plunged 16.4% year over year to $65.4 million due to an uneven order pattern in Latin America.BioMarin receives Aldurazyme royalties - totaling $16.4 million (down 9.9%) - from its partner Genzyme, a subsidiary of Sanofi  .Meanwhile, Firdapse revenues were flat year over year at $4.1 million.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased 11.8% to $158.8 million while selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were up 13.5 % to $105.3 million.BioMarin continues to expect total revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, while Vimizim sales are estimated in the band of $315-$340 million (previously $300-$330 million).The company maintains its previous projections of Kuvan sales ($320 million to $350 million) and Naglazyme sales ($290 million and $320 million).SG&A and R&D expenditure are also maintained at the previously guided range of $470-$490 million and $680-$720 million, respectively.BioMarin continues to progress with its pipeline candidates. In the reported quarter, the company presented complete data from a phase I/II study on cerliponase alfa for the treatment of patients with late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. The company plans to submit regulatory application for cerliponase alfa in both the U.S. and the E.U. in mid-2016.Meanwhile, the company's Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug, Kyndrisa, is currently under review in the EU with an anticipated opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products later this quarter.BioMarin's first-quarter performance was mixed, with the company beating the bottom-line and missing the top-line estimates.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, Baxalta posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.79%.The average earnings surprise over the last three reported quarters is a negative 0.51%.Let's see how things are shaping up for the first quarter of 2016.In its fourth-quarter 2015 earnings release, Baxalta provided guidance for the first quarter of 2016. The company expects pro forma sales growth (excluding the impact of foreign currency) of 8-9%. Including the impact of foreign currency, the company expects pro forma sales to increase 4-5%. Baxalta also expects earnings in the range of $0.44-$0.46 per share.Baxalta's Hematology and Immunology segments should continue to perform well in the first quarter of 2016. Existing products like Advate, Feiba and HyQvia and newly launched product Adynovate should continue to contribute to top-line growth. Rixubis and Obizur should also aid revenues. The company also started reporting revenues under the Oncology segment beginning the third quarter of 2015.Meanwhile, Baxalta has a deep pipeline of candidates targeting hematology, oncology, immunology and biosimilars and is continuing to progress on its development. The company is also looking to boost its pipeline through external partnerships and strategic acquisitions. In Feb 2016, Baxalta announced a global collaboration with Precision BioSciences for the development of a broad series of allogeneic CAR T cell therapies targeting multiple cancers.Considering that Baxalta is set to merge with Shire plc  in a deal worth approximately $32 billion, all focus would be on the deal. The transaction is expected to close in early June this year.On the first quarter call, investor focus will be on Baxalta's quarterly performance, sales ramp-up of Adynovate along with that of other marketed products and pipeline updates.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Baxalta is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here as you will see below.

Last quarter, Glaxo delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.77%. Let's see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Glaxo expects double-digit core earnings growth (at constant exchange rate) in 2016.As far as the business segments are concerned, the company expects the Pharmaceuticals segment to return to growth this year driven by new products - Anoro Ellipta, Nucala, Tanzeum/Eperzan and others - as well as HIV products - Tivicay and Triumeq. This will likely more than offset the declines in Seretide/Advair, established products and Avodart. While Seretide/Advair sales are expected to continue declining due to pricing and competitive pressures, Avodart went generic in the U.S. at the start of fourth-quarter 2015.However, challenges in the form of capacity constraints and economic conditions in emerging markets could hurt the segment's performance. Biennial price cuts in Japan in April (expected in the 5-7% range) will negatively impact the whole year, especially the first quarter. Moreover, returning the rights of Prolia to Amgen Inc.  last December may hurt the segment's performance in Europe.The Vaccines segment is expected to remain volatile on a quarterly basis (particularly in emerging markets) due to factors like the timing of government tenders. Though it is expected to benefit from the continued uptake of meningitis vaccines, Bexsero and Menveo (acquired from Novartis AG  ), Bexsero could be hit by supply constraints in the first half of the year, especially in the first quarter.Lastly, growth of Consumer Healthcare business is expected to be sluggish in the first quarter due to the year-over-year comparison in Flonase's performance.Notably, currency movement is expected to provide tailwinds and boost first-quarter sales by around 2-3%.Meanwhile, Glaxo is on track to deliver annual cost saving benefits of \u00a33 billion from its restructuring program, which is largely expected to be complete by 2017 end. In 2016, Glaxo expects the program to deliver \u00a3800 million in annual savings.On the first quarter call, focus will be on the company's performance, sales ramp-up of newly launched drugs and pipeline updates.Glaxo's performance has been pretty good with earnings surpassing expectations in three of the last four quarters. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 4.34%.Amgen has an Earnings ESP of +3.52% and a Zacks Rank #3. It is\nscheduled to report first-quarter results on Apr 28.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Glaxo is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP for Glaxo is 0.00% since the Most Accurate estimate stands in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. Glaxo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a breakeven ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Amgen has an Earnings ESP of +3.52% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Does this vote leave Sarepta without any options? Read on to see what's at stake. DMD is a rare chromosomal disorder affecting mostly boys, and there are no FDA approved therapies for its treatment.Specifically, DMD is caused by a genetic abnormality that prevents the proper creation of dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscle building. Absent treatment, patients suffer from muscle wasting, and most patients succumb to their disease by their 30s.In an attempt to address the huge unmet need for DMD therapies,  and Sarepta Therapeutics each developed therapies that skip exon-51, a section of DNA in the gene for dystrophin that if skipped can result in shortened but functional dystrophin in 13% of DMD patients. Both companies filed their drugs for FDA approval last year, and each company was hoping for a green light this year. BioMarin presented the case for its drisapersen to the FDA's advisory committee in November, and unfortunately for patients and stakeholders, the committee determined that BioMarin failed to prove that drisapersen effectively treats DMD.In January, the FDA officially dismissed any hope for drisapersen's approval by issuing a complete response letter to BioMarin.That loss left DMD patients hoping that Sarepta Therapeutics could deliver a more convincing argument when it presented its findings for eteplirsen on Monday.However, in a meeting that ran longer than usual, experts on the committee's panel were mostly unimpressed by Sarepta's trial design and its findings.As a result, when the group voted on accelerated approval of eteplirsen, there were six votes for approval and seven against. The FDA and the committee members appeared at times annoyed by the fact that the study results Sarepta presented were from a trial involving only 12 patients, that the data didn't appear overly convincing, and that the company used a historical control group in an attempt to demonstrate efficacy.Specifically, in the FDA's briefing document, it wrote that the \"FDA has concerns regarding the comparability of treatment groups and the overall persuasiveness of the historical control comparison, as described in the FDA briefing materials. In fact, the clinical course of the 12 patients participating in Study 201/202 appears to be within the expected natural history of DMD.\"Sarepta has indicated that it was working with the FDA to frame the data in the most useful way possible, but it would seem that when push came to shove, there simply wasn't a large enough sample with convincing enough efficacy for the FDA panel to say \"science proves this drug works.\"Although the panelists remarks suggest many members wish they had been given data warranting approval, the voting result is the voting result. Absent intervention at the highest levels, the most likely outcome from here is a rejection letter like the one that was delivered to BioMarin.Perhaps such an intervention could come from Janet Woodcock, the FDA's director of drug evaluation. Before Sarepta's presentation, she made comments that some viewed as supporting an eteplirsen approval. However, that's a bit speculative (and a bit of a long shot), and therefore, investors interested in buying Sarepta's shares in hope of a surprise go-ahead might want to reconsider the risk of an official no-go decision on May 26. After all, Sarepta remains a clinical-stage company, and eteplirsen was by far its most advanced drug. If eteplirsen fails to get a green light, then it could be years until the company commercializes another therapy, if at all.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Over the four trailing quarters, the company has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 16.50%, having met earnings expectations in two quarters and missed the same in the other two. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Apart from license fees, Keryx's top line comprises revenues generated by Auryxia (ferric citrate). Auryxia (approved for the control of serum phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease/CKD) remains the growth engine at Keryx.In Sep 2015, Keryx gained EU approval for Fexeric (EU trade name for Auryxia) for the control of elevated serum phosphorus levels, or hyperphosphatemia, in both dialysis and pre-dialysis patients suffering from CKD, which was an important milestone for the company. It is currently seeking partners for the EU launch of the drug.We note that Keryx is investing a lot of resources in the commercialization of Auryxia. Moreover, the company has expanded its sales force by 50%. Going forward, the company plans to leverage its expanded sales force to increase the utilization of Auryxia. The company plans to further interact with nephrologists and dietitians regarding Auryxia's profile in treating hyperphosphatemia and its mechanism of action.Although the company did not provide a quarterly guidance, it did provide its annual guidance. Keryx expects Auryxia sales in the U.S to be $31-$34 million. It projects 2016 cash operating expenses in the range of $87 million to $92 million. Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of net Auryxia sales, is anticipated in the mid-20s. The company exited 2015 with a 1.4% share of the phosphate binder market, while its 2016 guidance implies an exit share of around 3% by the year end. However, the company does not expect sales in the first quarter of 2016 to grow at the 40%-plus rate that it recorded last quarter. Demand growth is projected between 20% and 35% on a sequential basis, with a further ramp-up as the company realizes the full impact of its sales force.Meanwhile, ferric citrate is being evaluated in a phase III study for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients suffering from stage III-V non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD CKD). The trial demonstrated statistically significant differences from placebo in the primary as well as all the pre-specified secondary endpoints. These encouraging trial results should support Keryx's plan to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) in the third quarter of 2016, through which it intends to expand the ferric citrate's label to include the treatment of IDA in patients with stage III-V NDD CKD.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Keryx is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below. : The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 22 cents. : Though Keryx's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Gilead Sciences  has an Earnings ESP of +1.65% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Many on The Street believe the \"Sell in May\" rule takes precedence over profits. But that's not the case with us, as we follow the rule that there is always a bull market to be found.For the last five years, the top three sectors have been food and beverage, technology\u00a0and biotechnology, providing positive results 80% of the time through the summer. The answer to the \"where to invest in May\" lies in focusing on what's worked in the past, namely the seasonally strong summer stocks. Our database starts by looking at the sectors that thrive through the summer.For the last five years, the top three sectors have been food and beverage, technology and biotechnology, providing positive results 80% of the time through the summer.We are focusing our attention to these groups this spring, and we have used our behavioral valuation models to identify stocks that are likely to heat up through the summer based on seasonality, sentiment and their technical strength.The following are seven stocks to buy before summer. In no particular order \u2026Video game maker  (  ) got knocked down a peg when it lowered its guidance last quarter, but the stock is revving-up for a strong summer.Electronic Arts shares recently put in a consolidation at $65 and are now making moves toward $70 as sentiment remains tepid. Short interest is near its highest readings over the last two years as short sellers are trying to make a buck from future declines, but the fact is that a break above $68 is going to spark a short-covering rally that will add fuel to the stock.Electronic Arts stock averages a summer return of 18.4% over the last five years and the currently improving trend suggests that investors may want to hang on to this stock through the dog days.For many, the summer means lifting the hood on the car in their driveway for some fun. For others, the unpredictable economy means they would rather change their oil themselves to save a few bucks.For  (  ), it's all good as it all means a busy summer season.O'Reilly stock has averaged 9% in four of the last five summers, putting it on the list of seasonally strong summer stocks. Currently, the shares are trading back toward their all-time highs after taking a break in late 2015. The company has seen year-over-year revenue growth every quarter for the last two years while beating analysts' earnings expectations.Sentiment is bearish toward O'Reilly stock, as only 63% of the analysts covering it have it ranked a buy, despite its relatively strong leadership. Also, the short interest ratio weighs in at a heavy 9.2, telling us that a short squeeze rally is likely to be triggered when the stock moves above $280.Watch O'Reilly shares to motor through the summer. (  ) has been executing its business model extremely well over the last year as it continues to expand its brand. The results: eight consecutive quarters of earnings beats and a YOY revenue growth figure that approaches 205!Now that ULTA is trading above $200, many think there is nowhere to go but down, but the summer favors this stock as it has traded higher all five of the last summer seasons for an average of 8.7%.Our models continue to rank Ulta stock as a buy with a target move of 10% or more over the summer as analysts continue to upgrade the shares. Currently, only 64% of Wall Street has it ranked a buy, so there is room for this stock to move higher before becoming a \"crowded trade.\"The summer means travel for many, which is one of the reasons that  (  ) stock is among the seasonally strong stocks. Over the last five years, Expedia stock averages an 11.2% return, putting it near the top of the list for consistent performers.Our model has identified the $105 level as a recent consolidation level that has the potential to launch EXPE higher into the seasonally strong period. Resistance stands above at the $115 mark, but this still gives Expedia shares 9.5% of overhead room before dealing with technical hurdles.After a rough year of earnings, where Expedia missed analysts' EPS expectations three of four quarters, the company has seen an improvement in revenue that may provide a fundamental surge for the stock. This would catch the growing camp of short sellers off-guard and trigger a covering rally that would light the fuse on a hot summer for Expedia stock.The biotechnology sector has been taken out behind the shed over the last six months, but some of the names within the group are making a comeback, among them is  (  ).This stock is breaking through the $90 level, which will garner the attention of technical buyers. The shares are starting to take a leadership role among the biotechnology sector as we head into the summer.What makes BioMarin Pharmaceutical a standout is its record for summer trading. Over the last five years, the stock has averaged returns of 9.6% each of the last five summer seasons. Our technical models currently have a target of $105 over the next four months - a 15% gain from today's prices. (  ) will fly below most investor's radars, but you need to take a look at this summer performer. CALM stock has spent each of the last five summer seasons punching higher, as it averages a summer return of 17.2%.A positive earnings report recently shot the stock to the $55 level before pulling back to continue a consolidation at $52.50. That said, the trend in Cal-Maine shares is growing stronger as we head into the dog days.Investor sentiment is the kicker for Cal-Maine right now, as the short interest ratio is a whopping 16.3 and only 40% of the analysts are recommending the stock as a buy. We're expecting a push above $55 to open the gates on short covering and upgrades which will set Cal-Maine stock up for another strong summer with a target of $60. (  )  has mostly found its groove again as the stock is trading into a new stratosphere. This doesn't stop us from tagging it as a summer season favorite.Domino's Pizza stock has spent the past five summers racking up an average performance of 14% a year, putting it in the top 5% of food and beverage companies.The stock recently broke through the $140 level, and even after a quick pullback Friday, shares have posted a one-year return of more than 30%. The Wall Street community has been cold to the stock, despite its returns and overall strength. Currently, only 38% of analysts have it ranked a buy, which is likely to change over the next four months as the stock climbs higher.Our model forecasts a continuation of the technical climb after this pause, with a target price in excess of $150 over the next four months.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" A handful of news announcements look responsible for last month's gains: It's tough to predict what kind of response the committee will have for eteplirsen. On the one hand, documents released by the FDA ahead of the drug's prior advisory committee meeting were quite harsh. On the other hand, eteplirsen has been granted Priority Review status, there are no adequate therapy options for DMD, and patient and provider support is huge -- meaning the committee might be willing to be more flexible.Companies that make drugs aimed at treating DMD haven't had any luck the with FDA at all. Case in point:  's Kyndrisa was outright rejected by the FDA a few months back. BioMarin has since turned its efforts toward getting Kyndrisa approval in Europe, but given the FDA's rebuke, the approval seems unlikely.In addition,  received a \"refuse-to-file\" letter from the FDA for its DMD treatment Translarna. The agency stated that the application wasn't complete enough for the FDA to conduct a full review. That came as a bit of a shock to PTC Therapeutics, as Translarna had already sailed through the regulatory approval process in Europe.Given the extreme uncertainty surrounding Sarepta's near-term future, I have a hard time being even remotely interested in purchasing shares.

Pfizer has made it no secret that inorganic growth, which supplements and strengthens its areas of focus, is part of its growth strategy.Image source: Pixabay. It's also been upfront with the idea that it wants to make deals that move the needle. In other words, don't look for Pfizer to pick up small drug developers here and there.Which companies may Pfizer be interested in? We actually took a more  at this just days ago, but three companies that sit squarely in the spotlight are U.K.-based  ,  , and rare-disease drugmaker  .Although an inversion is likely out, the selling point of an AstraZeneca buyout is the symbiotic nature of each drugmaker helping in areas where the other has weakened. AstraZeneca's promising diabetes franchise could reinvigorate growth in Pfizer's cardiovascular and metabolic segment, while Pfizer's growing cancer product portfolio and pipeline could bolster AstraZeneca's arguably stagnant oncology product portfolio and pipeline.Buying Bristol-Myers Squibb would make sense from the perspective of becoming the leader in cancer immunotherapies. Bristol-Myers' Opdivo is the leading immunotherapy in terms of sales, and immunotherapies could hold major promise as combination therapies for all types of solid and blood-based cancers. Bristol-Myers also pays a slightly lower effective tax rate than Pfizer, potentially adding some combination incentive.BioMarin would play to Pfizer's often overlooked focus on rare-disease drugs. Drugs that treat orphan diseases often face little-to-no competition, and are protected against competing therapies. Pfizer's size would likely help turn BioMarin's existing products profitable on a much-quicker basis. Plus, Pfizer could use various tax loss carryforwards from BioMarin to offset any adverse effects the deal might have on EPS.Secondly, Pfizer may be able to boost shareholder value by going forward with a proposed spinoff of its Global Established Products franchise, or GEP. Therapies within Pfizer's GEP have either come off patent and are exposed to generic competition, or are mature therapies with slowing growth and a dwindling time frame before generic competition enters the market.Image source: Pixabay. On one hand, Pfizer's GEP is a nightmare, because sales are seemingly in a constant decline. The loss of exclusivity on drugs like cholesterol-fighter Lipitor, anti-inflammatory Celebrex, and bacterial infection drug Zyvox acts like a cement weight wrapped around the metaphorical ankles of Pfizer that holds back any attempt for its top line to advance. Jettisoning its GEP would presumably allow its faster-growing innovative drug, oncology, and vaccine segments to shine.But Pfizer's GEP continues to provide the company with substantial cash flow. Let's remember that, even with substantially reduced sales, we're still talking about well-known brands that consumers and physicians trust. This means no need for marketing in many instances, which allows profits to flow straight to its balance sheet.Pfizer has said that it doesn't plan to evaluate a possible spinoff of its GEP until 2018, but the Allergan deal falling through could accelerate that time frame. Pfizer's management has also stated that it would need to see four things before considering a spinoff:I suspect that we're seeing the first three play out. But with the Allergan deal falling through, spinning off its GEP in a tax-efficient manner could prove tricky.Image source: Pfizer. Finally, in order to improve shareholder value, Pfizer may consider concentrating its organic growth efforts on what I suspect are its two most-promising therapeutic areas of focus: oncology and biosimilars.Pfizer is already realizing benefits from metastatic breast-cancer drug Ibrance, which was approved in February 2015. Sales of Ibrance totaled $723 million in 2015, and based on its Q4 sales of $315 million, appears well on its way to pushing for up to $1.5 billion in total sales in 2016. Assuming Ibrance can expand its label, it very well could grow into a $3 billion to $4 billion per year drug.Image source; Flickr user thetaxhaven.It's also invested heavily into avelumab, a cancer immunotherapy being developed with  . Pfizer wound up parting with $850 million in upfront cash, promised up to $2 billion in various milestone payments, and agreed to a co-promotion deal for Xalkori in order to be part of avelumab's development. But if the cancer immunotherapy market has demonstrated anything, it's that there's potentially tens of billions of dollars of opportunity waiting to be seized by effective immunotherapies.Biosimilars, or  , could transform into a multi-billion dollar business for drugmakers like Pfizer. Offering biologic drugs at 10% to 50% cost to branded therapies could help Pfizer secure new revenue streams. Of course, it remains to be seen how much of Pfizer's existing product portfolio could eventually become subject to biosimilar competition, as well.I suspect that Pfizer may choose all three approaches to grow shareholder value as opposed to just one or two, but we should know a lot more after the company reports its first-quarter earnings results in a few more weeks, and we hear from CEO Ian Read and the company's management team.

The combined entity was designed to become the largest drug developer in the world, capable of more than $25 billion in operating cash flow by 2018 and expected to possess more than 100 mid to late-stage pipeline products.In addition, the deal was structured in such a way that Allergan was \"acquiring\" the larger Pfizer, with Allergan shareholders expected to receive 11.3 shares of Pfizer's common stock for each share of Allergan. Structuring the deal this way would have allowed Pfizer to avoid the U.S. Treasury Department's tax inversion rules and redomicile its headquarters to Ireland, where Allergan is based. Ireland's corporate income tax is less than half that of the United States, and the tax savings alone would have been well in excess of $1 billion annually.However, the Treasury  on April 4, when it released some 300 pages of new tax-inversion regulations. While not specifically citing the Pfizer-Allergan merger, two of the new regulations in particular took direct aim at it.First, the new tax-inversion laws target serial inverters -- overseas companies that have rapidly grown in size by acquiring U.S. assets -- by not counting the value of assets acquired on a trailing three-year basis when taking a deal into consideration. In easier-to-understand terms, Allergan's purchases of Warner-Chilcott for $5 billion and Forest Laboratories for $25 billion, and its merger with Actavis, were all going to be thrown off the books when calculating the Pfizer-Allergan deal value since they occurred within the past three years. This brought Allergan's deal value down to $106 billion from $160 billion and put it well below the threshold that Allergan shareholders would have been required to own of the new company if Pfizer were to relocate its headquarters.Secondarily, the Treasury severely limited the practice of earnings stripping, in which overseas entities lend money to their U.S. subsidiaries and use the tax-deductible interest to lower their U.S. corporate income tax rate.Image source: AstraZeneca.With the deal now officially dead and each company going its own way, Pfizer is likely to remain on the hunt for acquisitions. Although, as we've heard from Pfizer's board previously, it's only interested in deals that'll move the needle, which is a fancy way of saying that anything sub-$5 billion (choosing an arbitrary figure here) is probably not on Pfizer's radar.So which drug developers might Pfizer go after? I'd suggest these three are distinct possibilities. No irony is lost on the fact that the emphasis on tax inversions began almost exactly two years ago, when Pfizer did its best to lure U.K.-based  into a buyout. At the time, buying AstraZeneca would have allowed Pfizer to escape what I figured to be around $1 billion in corporate income taxes per year if it were able to relocate its headquarters to the U.K.However, even without juicy tax benefits, a deal with AstraZeneca could make a lot of sense for both companies. The reason is that each company has what the other needs.Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca are struggling to grow demonstrably under the weight of patent expirations. But the therapeutic area that each has been struggling most is where the other can step in and assist.Pfizer, for instance, lost patent exclusivity on cholesterol-fighter Lipitor and has struggled to grow its cardiovascular and metabolic franchises. By contrast, AstraZeneca has been shoring up its CV and metabolic franchises. It acquired a 100% stake in its diabetes alliance with  in 2014, including Farxiga, a highly coveted SGLT2-inhibitor, and it gobbled up ZS Pharma just a few months prior to get its hands on the company's hyperkalemia treatments. Cardiovascular and metabolic drug products are AstraZeneca's main growth drivers.Image source: Pfizer.In turn, AstraZeneca hasn't exactly wowed Wall Street with its oncology franchise. Arimidex, Casodex, and Iressa all turned in a single-digit constant currency sales decline for AstraZeneca for the full year 2015. This is where Pfizer's oncology pipeline could be helpful. Breast cancer drug Ibrance is growing like wildfire, and Pfizer's experimental cancer immunotherapy avelumab (which it's developing with  ) looks to make it to pharmacy shelves well ahead of AstraZeneca's experimental immunotherapy products.A pairing of struggling equals may still make sense here, even if the tax benefits will be a moot point. Another idea, which was also hatched roughly two years ago, is that Pfizer might be interested in pursuing a deal to acquire U.S.-based Bristol-Myers Squibb.Why Bristol-Myers Squibb? Two primary reasons.First and foremost, cancer immunotherapies. I repeat, cancer immunotherapies. Pfizer is bent on making an impact on the cancer immunotherapy market, but it was admittedly a bit late to the game. This is why Pfizer entered into an arguably expensive deal with Merck KGaA in November 2014 for avelumab that saw it pay Merck KGaA $850 million upfront, dangle up to $2 billion in development, regulatory, and sales-based milestone, and even offer up co-promotion agreements for Xalkori in the U.S. and other key markets.Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb.Buying Bristol-Myers Squibb would give Pfizer access to the No. 1 immunotherapy on the market, Opdivo, which is approved to treat second-line non-small-cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma, and second-line renal cell carcinoma, but could have a long list of approvals and combinations to come. Added in with avelumab, Pfizer could become an immunotherapy giant.The second reason Bristol-Myers makes sense is potential cost synergies. Overlapping oncology research would likely result in cost-cutting, and both companies already co-market blood thinner Eliquis, which is expected to grow into a multibillion-dollar giant. Also attractive is that Bristol-Myers' full-year 2015 effective tax rate was just 21.2% compared to Pfizer's 24%. Even a modest move lower in effective tax rate can mean hundreds of millions in extra profit. Lastly, I could see Pfizer turning its attention to an acquisition similar in size to Hospira (this was about a $17 billion deal) and making a run at rare disease specialist  .Make no mistake about it: Pfizer enjoys being in the limelight for major and/or chronic diseases. But one often overlooked primary areas of focus for Pfizer is rare-disease drugs.Image source: BioMarin Pharmaceutical.Rare disease drugs, commonly known as orphan therapies, treat 200,000 or fewer patients in the United States. Generally speaking, the smaller the prospective patient pool, the larger the price tag of an approved therapy. Best of all, orphan therapies come with extra competitive protections and rarely contend with a lot of competition, if any. Orphan drugs may also escape generic competitors once they come off patent, too. Thus, rare-disease drugs can be incredibly profitable.The problem, as BioMarin has discovered after bringing five Food and Drug Administration-approved products to market, is that it can take time to bring costs under control while also continuing to research new rare-disease indications, market existing rare disease therapies, and generate more revenue in each successive year. At its current pace, BioMarin isn't expected to be healthfully profitable until fiscal 2019.If Pfizer were to acquire BioMarin, chances are that it would be able to use its size to get BioMarin's cost structure way down, meaning profitability off BioMarin's existing products would be either immediate or occur within a year, in my best guess. Plus, BioMarin's losses could allow Pfizer to take advantage of a myriad of tax loss carry-forwards, including $300 million in federal research and development and orphan drug credit carry-forwards. This could provide a quick boost to Pfizer's EPS that'll help offset any acquisition-based costs of the deal.What drug developer do you think Pfizer could go after next?

This stock might bounce around like a risky early stage biotech, but it has a handful of products that have more than doubled its top line over the past four years to $890 million.Biomarin has been on the slow road to profit town for over a decade, but it's also had its foot on the R&D pedal. That hasn't done wonders for its bottom line. Instead of profits, shareholders have had to settle for a stable of clinical-stage assets. That didn't bother investors too much until a very expensive Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug failed to impress regulators.Give me just a few minutes to explain the opportunities and obstacles BioMarin is facing, and you can decide for yourself if the company's valuation is too pessimistic. Biomarin's first two approved drugs, Aldurazyme and Naglazyme, treat different forms of Mucopolysaccharidosis, a group of rare metabolic disorders considered an \"orphan\" disease. The two drugs were granted orphan exclusivity in the U.S. and EU, but those periods have expired. Combined, BioMarin recorded $401.1 million in 2015 sales for these two biologics. A lack of bulletproof patent exclusivity for about 45% of the company's total revenue is a little scary, but I wouldn't run for the exits just yet.As biologics go, these two are relatively short and simple, but manufacturing \"generic\" versions, or  , requires drugmakers to jump through a longer set of regulatory hoops than small-molecule drugs. Given the extra expenses involved, biosimilar drugmakers are focused on blockbusters with huge addressable patient populations, meaning these two are probably safe for now. Another of BioMarin's marketed products, Kuvan, for treatment of some patients with phenylketonuria, is under a more immediate threat. Phenylketonuria, which is characterized by a buildup of phenylalanine in the body, is a very rare disease. However, with annual sales of $239 million last year, Kuvan made up nearly 27% of BioMarin's total revenue. Two generic-drug manufacturers have already submitted applications for generic versions of Kuvan, meaning BioMarin might be facing losses due to generic competition not too far off.A big downside of this disease is that patients generally need to stay on a protein-restricted diet. With this in mind, BioMarin's follow-up to Kuvan, pegvaliase, showed both good and upsetting results. After eight weeks of treatment with pegvaliase, patients on unrestricted diets had lower levels of phenylalanine than patients on Kuvan after six weeks -- which is great news.The upsetting part was a failure of pegvaliase to improve patients' cognitive function, a secondary endpoint I honestly felt was doomed from the outset. When phenylketonuria is diagnosed and treated immediately following birth, those individuals generally have normal intelligence throughout their lives, which suggests the damage done at an early age is permanent. Seems to me that pegvaliase's failure to meet its secondary endpoint, while disappointing, was much less meaningful than the drug's superior reduction of phenalynine. So, I'm fairly confident pegvaliase, if approved, will help offset losses from generic Kuvan competition.Despite revenue streams that are on somewhat shaky ground, BioMarin did something astonishing for several reasons in January 2015: It acquired Prosensa, a Dutch company with Duchenne muscular dystrophy candidate drisapersen, for $751.5 million. That's a big purchase for a company with negative cash flows and such an uncertain revenue stream.Image source: Flickr user Purple Slog.What confounds me further is the amount of uncertainty surrounding drisapersen, now Kyndrisa, ahead of the purchase. After several years of funding drisapersen's clinical development,  terminated its collaboration with Prosensa after the drug failed to outperform a placebo in a 186-patient phase 3 trial.Biomarin's reasoning behind the enormous purchase was based on positive results from a genetically defined subset of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients combined in a post hoc analysis. It believed they would be sufficient for an application without another trial. If I can give only one piece of advice to beginning biotech investors, it's this: When you see the words \"post hoc analysis,\" walk away.Perhaps the most disturbing facet of the Prosensa acquisition was that Kyndrisa's data was arguably less impressive than another candidate for the same subset of patients: eteplirsen from  .As many analysts expected,  , the FDA sent BioMarin a complete response letter stating there just wasn't enough proof of Kyndrisa's efficacy to warrant approval. Meanwhile the FDA continues its sadistic three-year-long accelerated review of Sarepta's candidate. I'm truly of two minds when it comes to BioMarin. One part of me sees a smart developer of rare-disease drugs that understands its limitations. It must have been tempting to develop its cancer asset talazoparib, but instead it stayed within its core-competency and sold rights to the compound to In the wake of that discipline I'm still baffled by the $751 million Prosensa acquisition. If BioMarin had paid $100 million or maybe even $200 million upfront for drisapersen rights, then back loaded the deal with milestone payments  the FDA agreed its combined post hoc analysis was sufficient, I would be shouting \"buy\" from the rooftops. Instead, this is a company I'll be keeping at arm's length.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

This signifies a massive upside potential, given that Sarepta's stock closed at $23.30 in Wednesday's trading (Apr 6).The raised price target was triggered by expectations of a favorable outcome of the FDA advisory panel meeting later this month followed by an approval for Sarepta's experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) candidate, eteplirsen.Sarepta is looking to get eteplirsen approved for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping therapy.The last three months have been anything but calm for Sarepta. In Jan 2016, the briefing documents that were released ahead of the FDA's Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee meeting were found to be unfavorable with the FDA raising concerns about eteplirsen's efficacy. The FDA panel was supposed to review the new drug application (NDA) for eteplirsen on Jan 22. The meeting, however, was deferred due to rough weather.In Feb 2016, the FDA pushed out the review period of eteplirsen further by three months. The regulatory agency said that with the company submitting a major amendment to the NDA in Jan 2016, it needed extra time to complete its review of the submission. The amendment included an additional six-minute walk test and loss of ambulation data compared to a historical control of four-year clinical effectiveness data.Finally, in Mar 2016, good news flowed in for Sarepta. The company announced that the FDA panel will review the company's NDA for eteplirsen on Apr 25.The regulatory agency is expected to announce its verdict by May 26, instead of Feb 26.DMD, a devastating and an incurable muscle-wasting disease, is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 3,500-5,000 boys born across the world. Given the lack of FDA-approved DMD treatments, there is significant unmet need for drugs addressing this disease. If approved, 13% of the total patient population with the disease having mutations is addressable by eteplirsen /exon 51 skipping.We remind investors that companies seeking approval for DMD treatments found little favor with the FDA. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  received a complete response letter from the FDA for its experimental DMD treatment Kyndrisa this January while the regulatory agency issued a refuse to file letter for PTC Therapeutics, Inc.'s  Translarna in February.In such a scenario, investor focus is expected to remain on the much awaited outcome of the upcoming advisory panel meeting and the approval status of eteplirsen.Sarepta is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Here are three beaten-down biotechs that investors with a long-term perspective should consider buying right now. 's stock is down around 19% this year. One big reason for the market's disfavor: Regulators gave its Duchenne's muscular dystrophy drug candidate, Kyndrisa, a thumbs-down in January. The FDA determined that there just wasn't enough proof of the drug's effectiveness.For now, at least, Biomarin's decision to buy Prosensa, the company that originally developed Kyndrisa, doesn't look too smart. The price tag paid -- $680 million up-front with potential milestone payments of up to $160 million -- really appears questionable in light of the FDA decision.But, aside from the Kyndrisa debacle, there's a lot to like about Biomarin. Sales of Vimizim, the biotech's enzyme replacement therapy for rare genetic disease Morquio A syndrome, nearly tripled year-over-year in 2015 to $228 million. Vimizim could reach peak annual sales of $800 million. Biomarin also has four other drugs on the market that combined for more than $656 million in sales last year.The biotech's pipeline also holds plenty of potential. Biomarin recently announced positive results from the phase 3 clinical study of pegvaliase in treating adults with inadequately controlled bloodphenylalanine levels. The company also reported good news from a phase 1/2 study of cerliponase alfa in treating children with CLN2 disease. Biomarin expects to pursue regulatory approval for both drugs later in 2016.There hasn't been much wind in  's sails so far this year. Shares are down more than 20% year-to-date. Good news could be on the way later in 2016, though, that could send Kite's stock soaring again.Kite has four clinical studies in progress for cancer immunotherapy KTE-C19. The biotech expects results from the lead study of KTE-C19 targeting treatment of refractory, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the second half of the year. If all goes well, Kite could file for FDA approval by the end of 2016. Analysts project peak sales for the cancer drug could reach $1.7 billion across all indications.Another positive for Kite is its collaboration with  . The small biotech and big biotech joined forces last year to develop chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapies. Kite and Amgen expect to file the first of multiple investigational new drug applications in 2016 as part of their deal.Kite appears to be in pretty good shape when it comes to cash. The company reported $614.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of 2015. That should be enough to fund operations well into 2017 and perhaps even longer. \"Beaten down\" might not be a strong enough term to describe the shares of  . The biotech has lost nearly half of its market cap in 2016.We do need to keep things in perspective, though. Anacor's shares gained more than 250% last year. Then, the general slump for biotech stocks helped dragged Anacor down. Disappointing sales for the company's only commercial product, Kerydin, didn't help.However, more success for Anacor could be on its way. The FDA recently accepted the new drug application for its dermatitis ointment, crisaborole. A decision on the drug is expected by Jan. 7, 2017. Analysts think crisaborole could generate peak annual sales of over $1 billion if approved.Anacor reported cash, cash equivalents, and investments  totaling $144.4 million as of the end of 2015. Investors worried that the company might move forward with a secondary stock offering that could dilute the value of existing shares received reassuring news last week. Anacor announced an offering of $250 million in convertible senior notes. All three of these beaten-down biotech stocks could see better days ahead. If I had to pick only one to put money in, though, I'd lean toward Biomarin.There's still some hope for Kyndrisa, with a European regulatory decision expected in the second quarter. However, the best hope for Biomarin stems from its pipeline. Pegvaliase and cerliponase alfa appear to be on track for approval. With those two potential catalysts and continued momentum for Vimizim, I think Biomarin should end 2016 much better than it started it.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Gilead suffered a setback with a jury ruling against the company in a patent dispute covering Gilead's sofosbuvir-based medicines for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) -- this includes the company's blockbuster drugs, Harvoni and Sovaldi. The jury found in favor of Merck and Ionis  , the co-inventors on the disputed patents.Gilead may well have to pay royalties to Merck on sofosbuvir-based product sales. Not just that, the next phase of the trial will decide the amount of damages that Gilead will have to give Merck as compensation for its past and future infringement. However, chances are high that Gilead will appeal the ruling.2. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office said that it will conduct an inter partes review of a patent covering Biogen's  oral multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera. The PTAB had earlier denied a petition to institute an inter partes review.3. Meanwhile, Amgen fared better on the patent litigation front with the company getting a favorable ruling in its patent infringement lawsuit against Regeneron and Sanofi related to PCSK9 inhibitors. The next step involves a decision regarding damages and a possible injunction against Sanofi and Regeneron. Not surprisingly, Sanofi and Regeneron said that they intend to appeal the ruling.Currently, Amgen's PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, and Sanofi and Regeneron's PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, are fighting for a share in the market. However, sales of both treatments are yet to take off as expected. Depending on how the legal situation pans out, Sanofi and Regeneron may end up paying royalties to Amgen on Praluent sales (Read More:  ).4.

Revenue was up 19% for the year thanks to the launch of Vimizim. To establish the new 2017 guidance, EVP and CFO Dan Spiegelman said that the company had come up with multiple scenarios for how sales and expenses could play out: \"Some of the cases, if the product approvals aren't there, will be more at the breakeven end than at the profitable end.\"Hank Fuchs, BioMarin's EVP and chief medical officer, highlighted that the pivotal trial for pegvaliase treating phenylketonuria (PKU) that will read out later this quarter and could be up for review with the FDA later this year: \"Pegvaliase has the potential to have an enormous impact on patients with PKU who are either not amenable to treatment with Kuvan or who want a more potent therapeutic.\" In addition to the aforementioned readout for pegvaliase, BioMarin expects a decision on EU approval for Kyndrisa in the second quarter. While the probability of approval is low given the showing stateside, the binary event has probably been discounted enough by investors that it offers more upside than downside.Even without Kyndrisa, management is guiding for revenue between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion this year, which is 19% higher than last year, thanks to a continued launch of Vimizim. As you might imagine from the focus on 2017, BioMarin will still run a loss of $75 million to $100 million on an adjusted basis this year, although that's substantially lower than the $142 million it lost last year on an adjusted basis.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.The company reports its results in three business sectors - Healthcare, Life Science and Performance Materials.The Healthcare division which consists of products like Rebrif, Erbitux, Gonal-f, and Neurobion should continue to perform well, driving sales of the division in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, sales in the Asia-Pacific region should fuel organic growth.The Life Science division witnessed organic sales growth in the last quarter. This trend should persist in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by continued demand for its products. Further, growing demand for viral clearance products and purification solutions of the Process Solutions business is projected to contribute to quarterly results.Lastly, sales at the Performance Materials unit should continue to improve on the back of the AZ Electronic Materials acquisition and the Advanced Technologies business unit.During the fourth quarter, Merck KGaA completed the acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich. With this transaction, the company has gained access to an attractive set of established brands and an efficient supply chain which will support the delivery of over 300,000 products, thereby enabling it to serve life science customers all over the world. The transaction had also allowed Merck KGaA to lift its 2015 guidance to \u20ac12.6- \u20ac12.8 billion from the previous projection of \u20ac 12.3- \u20ac 12.5 billion.Meanwhile, in Dec 2015, Merck KGaA, in collaboration with Pfizer Inc.  , initiated four phase III studies on avelumab - JAVELIN Gastric 100 (first-line treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic gastric/ gastro-esophageal junction cancers whose disease has not progressed with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy), JAVELIN Gastric 300 (third-line treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric/gastro-esophageal junction cancers), JAVELIN Ovarian 200 (platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer) and JAVELIN Bladder 100 (first-line treatment of patients with urothelial cancer), respectively.We note that early last quarter, the company reached an agreement with BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc.  to return the rights to Kuvan for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU).Investors are expected to focus on the company's approved products and avelumab's progress during its fourth-quarter call.Here is a health care stock that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.64% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Here, we establish that intermittent vs. continuous dosing of steroids is insignificant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that P values for the 6MWT comparison between treatments with Eteplirsen vs. External Controls have increased consistently culminating in significant values for years three and four. Finally, we show that Eteplirsen slows the loss of ambulation, conferring an important clinical benefit.A snow delay of Sarepta Advisory Committee (Adcom) meeting and pre-release of the FDA Adcom Briefing Documents (BD) resulted in a flurry of reports, news articles, and social media storm filled with opinions and emotions. This report assumes you are up to date on the current status of the company's drug Eteplirsen (Etep) and the approval process within the FDA.To provide minimal background, the Sarepta supplied FDA briefing document on Etep is  .The original FDA prepared analysis is  .Also, on January 8, 2016, SRPT replied with a major addendum to fix many inaccuracies in the FDA briefing document. That addendum is  .For experts and statistics people with a good knowledge of P-values and clinical trial data analysis, you may want to just jump ahead to the last section of this report with the statistical data analysis. The stats review section is completed by Yang Jiang, currently a Columbia PhD student with a Masters from Harvard University. Yang has a strong understanding of statistical analysis and used IBM SPSS Statistics to complete the analysis.Of major concern is the use of External Control for the 12 patients on the Eteplirsen trial for over four years. On the original FDA review, the FDA chose to throw out the EC chosen by Sarepta in favor of a less accurate set of data from Drisapersen (Drisa) control group, a competing drug company that recently received a complete response letter from the FDA. This report looks into the 6MWT data provided by Sarepta through the original sponsor document and Addendum.Finally, we will look at the reasons the FDA chose the seemingly less accurate Drisa control data. We will examine these reasons mentioned in the BD including: 1) intermittent steroid use by the Sarepta EC, 2) lower steroid use by the EC, 3) physical therapy, 4) selection bias by choosing the control group after year three data, 5) general inability to accept the trial as not well controlled, \"double blinded placebo randomized trial.\"Section 1: Detail analysis of week 216 data.Section 2: Arguments related to FDA briefing documents.Section 3: Statistical data analysis of week 216 data.Section 4: Report additions, corrections, and deficiencies.The first step is to dive into the data. Sarepta provided the exact yearly details of all patients and EC data through year three in its original FDA document. It then included year four data in the Addendum.Here is the Etep data as copied from those documents:The following is the Sarepta EC data:To data mine from here, we need to do some calculations to get the \"closest\" yearly age.Since Sarepta trials are based on a 48-week year, we use the following calculation example:This gives us yearly ages accurate to within 0.1 year (about a month). Doing just a quick glance at the two data packages, you can see 10 out of 11 controls have gone off their feet, with loss of ambulation (LOA). Yet, only two out of 12 from the Etep data set are LOA. This is pretty convincing on its face, but what about ages? We all know the progression of DMD. The youngest patients grow stronger as they get older, but start a downward curve and eventually end in loss of ambulation generally from 10 to 14 years. There are outliers, those that continue to walk longer. There are also outliers on the low end, those that have loss of ambulation younger than normal.So with the presented data, here is some data mining to determine the certainty of the efficacy of Etep. Some will yell this isn't even necessary, \"it's bloody obvious.\" Yet, the FDA briefing document seems to imply the opposite.First is a simple spaghetti line chart of every participant in the 202 study:More on the \"Twins\" later, for now recognize the solid lines are Etep group, the dashed lines are External Control group. Each line represents yearly data from the start of the Sarepta (201/202) trial including an initial baseline six-minute walk test (6MWT). Without a well-trained eye, you might not \"see\" the inherent treated patient benefit. The data includes yearly data points out to 216 weeks (4.15 years).When looking closer, you can notice a majority of the External Control are going loss of ambulation (LOA) around 13 years of age. There's an outlier above 15 years, and there are outliers 10 to 11 years of age. While Etep has a majority of patients still walking over 200 meters on week 216 data, with a majority over 13 years of age.It could be inferred that loss of ambulation could be the primary endpoint, and in fact, that in itself provides a strong conclusive evidence of efficacy. But to complete a data analysis with 6MWT as the endpoint, let's look further.To get a better understanding of the data, we will present the same data in a scatter chart, dropping all the same data points on a similar chart and calculate a linear average for each group. The first is a scatter chart with all the same data points:Now you can start to see the clear benefit of Etep over the untreated group. There is a mean difference of +74 meters for all data points (overall, including baseline). Key to this type of comparison is age. Older patients will drop faster. So are we comparing apples to apples? You can see in the full comparison of ALL data points the average age of EC is 11.4 and Etep is 11.2, very close but let's dig further.Understanding the significance of the 6MWT on two variables is the key to properly interpreting the data. The \"Age\" of the patient is one variable. This is the only value we have to match the probable 6MWT curves on a historical basis. The second variable is \"Years on Etep\" with a value from 0 to 4, meaning the five data sets from baseline to year four (or specifically to week 216). To get a good graphical image of these, we have a 3D graph.This representation is not the typical representation Sarepta has used in the past. To look at this 3D graph properly, you must realize ALL data for the External Control group is in the front row with the EC in green. The Etep treated patients are in blue. The Etep baseline (0 Years on Etep) is also in the front row with only 10- and 11-year-old patients. Younger patients are excluded from the graph because we are concerned only with the older patients (for the long-term efficacy and to keep the 3D visually interpretable).Each subsequent row is a following year on Etep, finally with the back row showing the Year 4 data of Etep treated patients.The graph clearly shows the drop in 6MWT by age as the EC patients reach 13 and 14 and finally the mean 6MWT drops to the lowest point with only one EC patient reporting non-LOA at age 15. In contrast, those older age patients continue to walk with a higher mean 6MWT on the later years while on Etep. This is shown by the longer blue bars on the right side of the chart with patients' ages 13 through 15.Finally, let's show the data in a box plot. This is what those in the statistical analysis field may consider the best graphical representation. A box plot shows the \"whiskers\" on each plot to help visualize the outliers, or as a way of showing the distribution of the data.Now let's take a look at some post-hoc analysis of the data. While the FDA clearly has a strong bias against any post-hoc analysis, the FDA BD does its own backwards post-hoc analysis by suggesting intermittent steroid use as a \"reason\" to throw out the Sarepta EC data and selecting Drisa EC after year three. So the following charts show the same data with the five intermittent steroid EC patients removed. This shows that the Etep patients still have a clear improvement over the EC patients without intermittent steroid. In other words, the Etep patients continue to perform better. This is further confirmed with statistical analysis in the final section, where the intermittent steroid control shows \"Not Significant\" (p=0.899).Additionally, let's look at the removal of the \"Twins.\" There is an argument they should be removed as it is \"reasonable\" to accept this as a modified intent to treat ((  )) as it is nearly impossible for a drug that shows long-term statistical benefit but little short-term benefit as being useful to compare 6MWT in a situation where the patient goes LOA in the short term. The \"Twins\" went LOA at six and 10 months after going on Etep.In fact, when looking at the EC selection criteria below, Sarepta correctly takes this into consideration by only selecting EC patients that have at least one year of 6MWT data. Therefore, the External Control is actually biased with stronger patients.To get to the real nuts and bolts of a proper data analysis, it's best to understand the \"age\" of the patient as its impact on the predictability of the 6MWT curve. Therefore, age might normally be used a covariate as a confounding interacting variable. But, as we examine the selection criteria of the EC, we find age is properly matched between groups. This is further confirmed in the close average ages shown in the graphs above. In other words, age is not a significant predictor for  when controlling for year and group. This is confirmed by Yang in the statistical analysis section below.As Sarepta presents in its October 1, 2015, data update, the EC is a selection filter of n=186 of the only two published data sets with at least three years of data (matching four years of data now).As mentioned in the above Sarepta slides, \"equivalent care standards including steroid use\" in the selection criteria. As well our post-hoc analysis above confirms any difference in Steroid \"intermittent\" use does not dismiss the significant difference between groups.Finally, here are a few more graphs to represent different views:   To summarize, there is significant difference between groups that demonstrates Eteplirsen provides long-term benefit. At year two, the p-value of p=0.199 with a 90-meter mean difference is a step in the right direction. The probability continues to improve with each subsequent year. Finally years three and four conclude with significant probability (p=0.016 and p=0.002 respectively) and a significant mean difference (160 and 169 meters respectively), showing a very strong benefit for the Eteplirsen treated group.Sarepta's stock crumbled 65% on the release of FDA BDs. If FDA uses the latest four year data in line with this article's analysis, we expect the stock price to return to pre-BD levels. The expected price should range from $35 if the favor of the FDA update leaves lingering questions, and $45 if mostly positive. We find that any analysis regarding LOA would be mostly positive.We remind readers that the consensus price target of $30.50 includes a variety of probabilities for an approval of Eteplirsen. Price targets will ultimately be updated after the FDA Advisory Committee expected to be held late April this year and final PDUFA date of May 26, 2016.Eteplirsen shows significant evidence of long-term benefit.\n  \nThe double-blinded placebo controlled portion of the 201 Study established assay sensitivity and further understanding of dystrophin biopsies.\n  \nLoss of ambulation is very objective as opposed to a subjective 6MWT value. Often it occurs after a fall, illness etc. when afterward the patient simply cannot walk at all. But, as stated by one DMD parent, \"there is no amount of physical therapy or coaching that a parent can do to keep their kids walking.\" The 202 Study is now at four years and shows 10 of 11 EC with LOA (not including two with missing 6MWT data), and only two of 12 Etep group LOA. This LOA difference is a very objective endpoint that shows an extreme level of significance (74% improvement). This extreme level of objective evidence is consistent with the FDA guidelines for approval using an External Control type clinical trial.Furthermore, regarding PT, I will refer to the January 18, 2016, letter addressed from Terri Ellsworth and 201/202 parents to the FDA.\n  \nIt might be interesting to note Sarepta provides the FDA steroid use data in different values. It is presented as total mg for some and mg/kg for other patients. This may be confusing for the FDA but not a significant difference.As a whole, the backwards post-hoc analysis of the FDA by using the Drisa placebo control is extremely inferior to Sarepta EC.Results from a repeated-measures ANCOVA revealed that age was not a significant predictor of  score after controlling for  ,  (ETEP, EC), and the interaction between the two independent variables,  (1, 20) = .25,  = .622. Therefore, we conducted our analyses by examining the effect of  and  on  without adding  as a covariate.Results of a repeated-measures ANOVA showed that there was a statistically significant interaction between year and group, F(4, 84) = 7.01, p    Below are the Descriptive Statistics for each group and year\n(6MWT baseline and years 1-4). Years two through four have a mean\ndifference with a larger value for Etep (Group2) with 90, 160, 169\nmeters, respectively.Below are the Descriptive Statistics for each group and year (6MWT baseline and years 1-4). Years two through four have a mean difference with a larger value for Etep (Group2) with 90, 160, 169 meters, respectively.Simple effect tests suggested that in year zero, one, and two, there was no significant difference between the two groups (year 0:  (1, 23) = .06,  = 0.808; year 1:  (1, 23) = .003,  = 0.957; year 2:  (1, 22) = 1.75,  = 0.199). In year three and four, the two groups began to show significant difference in  . For example, in year three, the ETEP group showed a significantly higher average  score (  = 263.1,  = 151.7) than the control group (  = 102.6,  = 140.1),  (1, 22) = 6.74,  = 0.016. Similarly, in year four, the ETEP group had a significantly higher average  score (  = 196.3,  = 130.2) than the control group (  = 27.3,  = 90.5),  (1, 21) = 12.84,  =, 0.002).Not significant, p = 0.899In conclusion, the drug has a long-term effect on patients, but does not seem to show an immediate short-term effect. At Year 1 and 2 repeated measures, patients who took the drug did not differ significantly with other patients who did not take the drug in their score on 6MWT. However, at Year 3 and 4 repeated measures, they showed significantly higher 6MWT score than the other patients who did not take the drug. In other words, taking the drug seemed to have an effect on slowing down the decreasing speed of the 6MWT score over years, especially after three years of taking the drug.This section addresses any major comments, additions, corrections, or deficiencies as it relates to the details contained in this report.

In addition, the launch of Vimizim in additional markets should contribute to the top line.During its third-quarter earnings release, BioMarin raised its financial guidance for Vimizim and Kuvan. This was primarily due to Vimizim's penetration into the  to bring new patients onto therapy at a faster pace. Meanwhile, Kuvan's revised label that includes safety in 0-4 year olds plus the education and adoption of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics practice guidelines to raise awareness of the benefits of Kuvan and the importance of the life-long treatment of phenylketonuria led the company to revise its projection.However, negative currency movements and unpredictable order patterns of Naglazyme in Latin America are causes of concern.

Since 2010, for example, the drugmaker's stock has outperformed even the red-hot  ETF:The underlying reason for BioMarin's rapid growth is its laser-like focus on so-called \"orphan\" drugs, or medicines indicated for rare diseases. Orphan drugs tend to have shorter clinical and regulatory lead times, come with certain tax advantages, and often have extended periods of exclusivity, making them highly coveted products by pharmaceutical companies and investors alike.In fact, orphan drug companies tend to sport the highest premiums (expressed as market cap divided by trailing-12-month revenue) in the entire healthcare sector.

Putting this number into context,  -- one of the fastest-growing biotechs in the world -- is trading at less than 8 times its trailing-12-month revenue.Kicking off 2016, though, BioMarin stubbed its toe on the experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug drisapersen, with the U.S. Food and Drug administration rejecting the drug for a lack of efficacy. As a result, the drugmaker's shares have gotten off to a lackluster start this year, shedding over 18% of their value in the first three weeks of January alone:Despite this double-digit pullback, BioMarin does have several upcoming catalysts this year that could maybe drive its shares to all-time highs.

A closer look at the numbers shows that a good chunk of this growth is being driven by the company's relatively new flagship product Vimizim, an enzyme-replacement therapy for the rare metabolic disorder Morquio A syndrome.Image source: BioMarin.By continuing the rigorous task of identifying new patients and subsequently getting them onto therapy, BioMarin has seen Vimizim's sales skyrocket since its commercial launch in 2014. This year, the drugmaker thinks this strong momentum will carry the drug's sales past the $300 million mark, putting it on track to grow by more than 25% from 2015. The long and short of it is that BioMarin's top line should still grow by over 30% in 2016, even after drisapersen's regulatory setback in the U.S., according to the analysts covering this stock.Besides its growing revenue base, BioMarin has one of the most impressive orphan drug pipelines in existence. In 2016, the company could file regulatory applications for both its experimental CLN2 disease therapy, cerliponase alfa, as well as its phenylketonuria treatment known as pegvaliase, depending on the progress of their respective clinical programs. Both of these experimental-stage drugs have the potential to add hundreds of millions to the company's top line within the next few years.BioMarin is also reportedly making excellent progress in advancing some of its other clinical-stage treatments for high-dollar markets such as achondroplasia, hemophilia A, and Pompe disease. The bottom line is that drugmaker's current pipeline and product portfolio could together end up generating an additional $4 billion in sales down the road, according to the company's managment.Despite BioMarin's setback with drisapersen, the company is a proven leader in the orphan drug space, and history suggests that it'll bounce back with additional regulatory approvals in the not-so-distant future. But the broader issue to keep in mind is that BioMarin isn't in the cross-hairs of the raging drug pricing debate that has weighed down the biotech industry, including top names like Gilead Sciences. Gilead, for instance, is struggling to shrug off the perception that further price discounts are coming for its hepatitis C franchise, which has been the biotech's biggest growth driver over the past two years.While orphan drugs have indeed received criticism in the past for their sky-high prices, the truth is that payers haven't offered much resistance because of the small patient populations. What this all means is that BioMarin's growth trajectory looks sustainable for the long haul, whereas Gilead's infectious disease drugs are probably going to continue to draw the ire of public and private payers alike. That's why BioMarin will more than likely bounce back from this recent pullback to turn in yet another strong year in 2016.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Ahead of news that the FDA has put a partial clinical hold on a key drug trial, shares in  dropped 32.4% in January, according to  In December 2014, Medivation acquired rights to MDV9300, which was believed to be a PD-1 inhibitor that works similarly to  's Keytruda and  s Opdivo, from CureTech.In December 2015, Medivation initiated a phase 2 study of MDV9300 in relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and suggested that if the trial is successful, then a big unmet need could lead to the FDA considering an accelerated approval.However, on Jan. 25, Medivation filed an 8-K with the SEC because it concluded that MDV9300 isn't a PD-1 targeting therapy after all.Medivation doesn't yet know how MDV9300 works and it's knee-deep in trying to figure it out, but unfortunately, the FDA has placed a partial clinical hold on the DLBCL trial that will keep patients from being enrolled in the study until that happens.: The revelation is important because MDV9300 is a key part of Medivation's strategy to diversify its revenue beyond its top-selling prostate cancer drug, Xtandi. Xtandi, which saw global sales grow to $547 million in the fourth quarter, has been winning market share away from  's multibillion per year Zytiga, but Johnson & Johnson is developing a new prostate cancer drug that could eventually slow demand for Xtandi and as a result, pressure is building on Medivation to usher new drugs to market.Given MDV9300 is in a holding pattern, hope shifts to MDV3800, a PARP-inhibitor that Medivation acquired from  last fall. A phase 3 trial studying MDV3800 in advanced breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations is expected to wrap up in June, so investors might want to keep a close eye on Medivation's press releases this summer.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The FDA panel is scheduled to review the new drug application (NDA) for eteplirsen on Jan 22.Sarepta is seeking accelerated approval for eteplirsen (administered as weekly 30 mg/kg intravenous infusions) for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping therapy.In its briefing documents, the FDA noted that the overall data did not provide statistical evidence to support efficacy in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. Moreover, concerns have been raised regarding the comparison of eteplirsen-treated patients with the historical control group, which is statistically not interpretable and whether dystrophin levels were increased by eteplirsen remains questionable. Though no safety issue of significant concern was identified for eteplirsen, it was noted that the dataset was too small to draw any valid conclusion.The regulatory agency also stated that though it is ready to be flexible with respect to a devastating illness for which treatment options are not available, it cannot approve drugs for which substantial evidence of effectiveness has not been established.We remind investors that last week, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  received a complete response letter from the FDA for its NDA for DMD candidate, Kyndrisa. The FDA stated that the standard of substantial evidence of effectiveness of Kyndrisa was not met. It did not come as a surprise since the company too had received an unfavorable feedback from the FDA's advisory panel regarding Kyndrisa in Nov 2015.With no approved product in Sarepta's portfolio and eteplirsen being its lead pipeline candidate, the latest news is disappointing.

On the revenue side, for instance, top dogs in the biotech industry, like  and  , are on track to post 30% and 20% growth in 2015, respectively, according to  .In terms of innovation, biotechs far and wide garnered several more major drug approvals and label expansions this year, such as the back-to-back approvals for the novel cholesterol-fighting drugs Praluent from  and  and Repatha from  .Finally, the industry continued to consolidate through numerous high-dollar acquisitions and mergers in 2015, especially in the rare disease space.Keeping this brief review in mind, let's now turn our attention to what may be in store for the industry in the New Year.If you've been paying attention to biotech in the least, you're probably aware that  and  are close to hearing the final word from the FDA for their Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, treatments -- drisapersen from BioMarin and eteplirsen from Sarepta.Source: Flickr via user Mediterranean Center of Medical SciencesAlthough BioMarin's drug had a poor showing at its advisory panel, the FDA has yet to decide the drug's fate, extending the review period into early next year. Sarepta's drug, on the other hand, is set to go through its own advisory panel meeting on Jan. 22, 2016, giving the industry two major catalysts in the first month of 2016.Why are these two regulatory decisions important to biotech investors at large? The overarching issue is that neither drug has a rock-solid case for approval. In fact, both companies appear to be relying on the severe nature of the disease, and the complete lack of pharmaceutical options for DMD, to sway the FDA.If either company is successful this time around, it might be a watershed moment for orphan drugmakers, in general, signaling that the FDA is now willing to truly consider the entirety of the clinical evidence in the context of the medical need for rare diseases -- and downplay strict statistical inference to some degree. The likely next foot to fall in biotech following the dueling DMD drug reviews is going to be the progress of the closely-watched cancer immunotherapy space, especially in the realm of blood-based cancers. Amgen and Celgene, for example, both have significant investments in cancer immunotherapy via their partnerships with leading clinical-stage biotechs.The important issue to understand is that these widespread research collaborations between blue chip biotechs and their smaller brethren should generate several data releases next year. The 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, which will be held from June 3 to 7, will be a key event to keep an eye on next year.All told, these forthcoming data presentations -- especially those for the ongoing studies involving novel combinations of cancer immunotherapies -- could be a harbinger of things to come for the industry as a whole in the coming years. As a result, these particular clinical updates in the cancer immunotherapy space should help to set the tone regarding the market's outlook toward biotechnology at large.Another important catalyst to watch next year is the evolving U.S. political landscape. After all, the U.S. presidential election could have major long-term ramifications for the industry. A Democratic presidency, for example, may ultimately result in reforms regarding the pricing schemes of new drugs, potentially shrinking the operating margins of biotechs and biopharmas alike.Source: Flickr via user Images MoneyAfter that, there's the open question of how either a Republican or Democratic president would impact the flight of biopharmas to foreign locales for tax purposes. If neither party is able, or willing, to address the problems with the U.S. tax code, biotechs will probably continue to look abroad to buoy their bottom lines.Predicting the future is a tall order, to say the least. But there are some hints regarding what may be in store.Firstly, we know that the industry probably won't see the level of revenue growth that it has been experiencing during the past five years. Gilead, for example, should see a minor dip in revenue generation next year, and Regeneron's projected 22% revenue increase in 2016 pales in comparison to its whopping 47% jump in 2015.That puts the onus for further value creation squarely on the regulatory and clinical progress of key experimental drugs, such as the aforementioned DMD candidates, and the host of cancer immunotherapies being developed right now.After all, the sky-high premiums some biotechs have been willing to pay to buyout smaller competitors of late has largely been a by-product of this golden era of medical innovation. Unfortunately, there's no good way to predict how these pivotal events are going to unfold in the New Year.In light of this slowing top-line growth and the reliance on further clinical innovation to drive valuations even higher at this stage, investors may therefore want to take a cautious approach with biotechs heading into 2016 -- at least until some of these regulatory and clinical risks are off the table.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The catalyst behind this monster move downward is the release of the briefing documents by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the company's experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) therapy, eteplirsen.Although eteplirsen's advisory committee meeting is scheduled for Jan. 22 and briefing documents tend to be released around two days prior to the meeting, the FDA apparently didn't have much trouble pushing these documents out ahead of time, presumably because of its recent review of  's rival therapy drisapersen.: According to the FDA's take on eteplirsen's clinical data, the agency appears unconvinced of the eteplirsen's efficacy, citing \"serious methodological concerns\" and the lack of a clear-cut increase in dystrophin levels as their main reasons behind this conclusion.  : Investors were hopeful that the recent rejection of BioMarin's experimental DMD therapy by the FDA indicated that the agency was leaning toward an approval for eteplirsen, given the complete lack of available treatments for this fatal muscle-wasting disorder. However, the FDA's briefing documents seem to indicate otherwise, meaning that it's looking like Sarepta will ultimately have to complete a late-stage study to clear up any outstanding questions regarding eteplirsen's effectiveness.Of course, the advisory committee could still vote to approve eteplirsen at next week's meeting, but that scenario doesn't seem all that likely in light of the serious questions raised in the FDA's review.

The FDA isn't required to follow independent committee recommendations, but it usually does. The next several weeks will also be tense for  (NASDAQ: VRTX) shareholders, as the company awaits a regulatory decision expected Feb. 6 or possibly sooner. Also in February,  (NASDAQ: FLXN) is expected to announce phase 3 results for a drug that missed the mark last year. Hands down, the industry's most watched event of the new year will be Sarepta Therapeutics' Jan. 22 advisory committee date. Its lead candidate, eteplirsen for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, will be the second drug in this space to undergo such a meeting, and the first was a disaster.Although there wasn't a yes-or-no vote to recommend approval of  's drisapersen, available trial data didn't persuade the panel to overlook the drug's inability to significantly improve patients' performance in the six-minute walk test, a commonly accepted efficacy endpoint.Image source: Sarepta Therapeutics.In contrast to Biomarin's candidate, Sarepta's eteplirsen significantly improved six-minute walking distance performance after three years on treatment, but not without some important caveats. With just 12 patients, improved performance could be due to one or two outliers in the treated population. Also diminishing the impact of eteplirsen's efficacy results is the use of historical control data instead of the generally accepted double-blind placebo controlled method.With etiplersin's efficacy data, and a superior safety profile, Sarepta's advisory committee meeting should be more upbeat than Biomarin's. However, I think the FDA will eventually send  companies requests for additional information before approval decisions are made.An eventual approval isn't the only uncertainty surrounding Sarepta and eteplirsen. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in about one of every 3,500 to 5,000 male births, but because of the deadly nature of the disease, the number of existing patients is unknown. Compounding the issue is that eteplirsen would be able to treat only about 13% of an already small population. Despite a small but unknown number of treatable patients, peak sales estimates for eteplirsen range from $500 million to $1.5 billion annually. Without any marketed products generating revenue for Sarepta, even reaching the low end would lead to tremendous gains. While Sarepta shareholders fret over an advisory committee meeting, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is anticipating approval of a label expansion for its cystic fibrosis (CF) drug Kalydeco. This is the first approved therapy to treat the underlying cause of CF, a life-threatening disease caused by any one of more than 2,000 known mutations in the CFTR gene.Zilretta, formerly FX006, is an injectable form of the topical, over-the-counter steroid\u00a0triamcinolone acetonide, or TCA. This isn't the first injectable form of TCA, but Zilretta is intended to provide longer lasting pain relief for osteoarthritic knee pain than existing options.Zilretta, formerly FX006, is an injectable form of the topical, over-the-counter steroid triamcinolone acetonide, or TCA. This isn't the first injectable form of TCA, but Zilretta is intended to provide longer lasting pain relief for osteoarthritic knee pain than existing options.In the phase 2b trial the higher of two doses tested provided significant relief over a saline placebo, in weeks 1 through 11, and again in week 13, but not during week 12, the trial's primary endpoint. This does not bode well for the phase 3 trial which is measuring Zilretta against saline  immediate release TCA, also at 12 weeks.Given the lack of effective, non-opioid pain relief for osteoarthritis, the drug's potential market is enormous if it is approved and used. In 2014 over 3.5 million patients received steroid injections in their knees, and the procedure is getting more popular every year. A longer lasting version that reduces visits to healthcare providers could reach blockbuster status. We'll know if this is a possibility sometime in February when the company is expected to announce phase 3 results.If Zilretta fails to show significant pain relief over existing steroid injections, investors could face heavy losses. When the company last reported it had enough cash and equivalents to take it into 2017, but without any revenue to speak of, and just one other drug in clinical trials, its shareholders have plenty of reasons to be nervous.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Or perhaps it's easier to simply avoid selling when you probably should, whether it means locking in a big gain, cutting your losses, or raising funds to put that money to work in more promising opportunities.With that in mind, we asked three of our contributors for stocks they believe investors would be wise to sell. Read on to see which businesses they chose. It seems an understatement to say  has had a rough couple of years. Incidentally, I gave the online surplus and salvage auction specialist a thumbs up in my CAPS portfolio in early 2014,  shares plunged more than 30% in just a few days after it  of its U.S. Department of Defense non-rolling stock and rolling stock surplus contracts, and kept the remaining contracts on less attractive terms after bidding reached higher-than-expected levels.Image source: Liquidity Services.But things only got worse from there. Almost exactly a year ago, Liquidity Services  that  -- at the time its single largest retail customer -- had terminated its exclusive agreement with the company. Nonetheless, Liquidity Services insisted at the time it would still be able to meet its financial guidance, and subsequently saw shares pop this past February after beating that guidance thanks to the strong performance of its commercial capital assets group.In its most recent quarter, however, Liquidity Services shares plunged once again after the company  for the coming year, thanks both to macroeconomic pressure and uncertainty surrounding some of the terms of a new DoD contract under which it began operating in October.In the end, while these uncertainties won't last forever, I think the difficult environment Liquidity Services continues to face isn't likely to change in the very near future. So, while I'm happy to keep Liquidity Services on my watchlist to look for signs of a return to sustained, profitable growth, in the meantime, I think our market has plenty of much more attractive opportunities in which investors can put their hard-earned dollars to work. is a clinical-stage biopharma that has been shooting higher ahead of the FDA's regulatory review for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment eteplirsen. Bulls are excited about this stock because eteplirsen should be ableto rake in around $500 million in peak sales. Furthermore, the company shouldn't needto employ an expensive, large-scale sales forceto market eteplirsen given that the target market is already fully aware of the drug's existence -- and is eagerly awaiting its approval, accordingto numerous reports.Image source: Sarepta Therapeutics.Sarepta's bull thesis really picks up steam, though, when you throw in the fact that eteplirsen is an orphan drug, meaning the market would probably be willing to pay a significant premium for any revenue derived from its sales due to the host of benefits these drugs confer to their manufacturers. And then you have the more recent development that  's competing therapy, drisapersen, appears to be DOA going into the FDAs target review date.As the saying goes, though, if it sounds too good to be true...Although there is a strong demand for this drug from DMD patients, their caregivers, and many within the medical community, eteplirsen's approval does hinge on a tiny clinical trial that may not be enough to sway regulators this time around. So, as this binary event could easily swing either way, investors may want to lock in some of the stock's eye-popping 150% gains this year prior to the FDA's upcoming decision. If investors can spot changing trends in the consumer world early, and find a way to invest accordingly, it will generally lead to some huge portfolio returns. On the flip side, if you find yourself on the wrong end of long-term trends, you can be in a world of hurt.When thinking of the latter situation, it reminds me of  , and the graph below shows the devastating contrast: data by  .Consumers inevitably grew irritated with increasing pricing, fees, taxes, and a plethora of cable and dish TV channel packages that, for the lack of a better term, sucked. When the Internet offered tech-savvy consumers the opportunity to kick the traditional TV programming to the curb via  , Hulu, and other options, the new digital trend began, and DISH has been fighting an uphill battle ever since. It's not a trend or a stock I would want to be invested in.Executives at Dish aren't oblivious, and the company has begun investing for its long-term future by pushing into the wireless business. Unfortunately, many investors believe its push into the wireless business is out of the company's realm and could put the company at risk.Ultimately, Dish's third quarter showed that its pay-TV subscriber losses accelerated, its customer churn rate -- which is the rate at which subscribers canceled service -- rose from last year, and its total revenue growth slowed to a meager 1.5%. In my opinion, this isn't a trend that's likely to change; it's why I don't own shares of Dish, and if I did, I would strongly consider selling.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The company is seeking approval for Kyndrisa for the treatment of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) amenable to exon 51 skipping. The FDA is expected to render a final decision on the candidate by Dec 27, 2015.The committee reviewed the Kyndrisa data package, which includes three randomized studies, and discussed overall strengths and weaknesses of the regulatory application. However, the panel was not asked to vote on a recommendation for the approval of Kyndrisa.Out of the 17 panel members, 15 were of the opinion that the lack of statistical significance in the primary outcome measure and nominally statistically significant results on all secondary endpoints in the phase III study weakened the persuasiveness of findings from Study 1 and Study 2. The remaining two voted that it had no effect.Only one panelist voted that the discussions on Study 1 and Study 2 strengthened Biomarin's case. Regarding the impact of dystrophin results on the interpretation of trial data, all panel members were of the opinion that it weakened or had no impact, except one who did not vote.Kyndrisa has Orphan drug and Fast Track status, Breakthrough Therapy and Rare Pediatric Disease designation in the U.S. The company is also submitting a regulatory application for Kyndrisa in the EU.We note that Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.'s  is also looking to bring its DMD candidate, eteplirsen, to market.

After competitor  for its Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug to a key FDA advisory committee, shares in  soared by 52.8% last month. Perhaps no class of drugs has struggled as mightily to reach FDA decision-makers as exon-skipping therapies for DMD.Exon-skipping drugs designed to skip exon-51 to boost dystrophin levels in patients and stave off the progression of this devastating disease have posted mixed results in clinical trials for both BioMarin Pharmaceutical and Sarepta Therapeutics.Arguably unconvincing efficacy in trials had many people thinking that exon-51 drugs would fail to pass muster with the FDA. However, a major need for new therapies and aggressive lobbying by patient advocates has led to the FDA considering the drugs anyway.Last month, BioMarin Pharmaceutical's drisapersen was the first to face public scrutiny by FDA regulators when the FDA's advisory committee tasked with evaluating its efficacy and safety met on Nov. 24.Concerns over safety risks and contradictory efficacy in drisapersen's trials led most industry watchers to lower the odds of an FDA approval for drisapersen when the FDA makes its final decision on Dec. 27.If the FDA does deny drisapersen, then it could be a big win for Sarepta Therapeutics eteplirsen.Although the two drugs both skip exon-51, Sarepta Therapeutics may do a better job showing regulators that eteplirsen boosts dystrophin levels and if so, then an argument could be made in support of eteplirsen's approval.Image source: Sarepta Therapeutics. Despite eteplirsen and drisapersen only being effective in a small portion of DMD patients, these drugs are likely to be big sellers because orphan drugs command top-tier prices and DMD treatment is chronic. An approval would also result in the FDA awarding these companies with a transferable priority review voucher. In the open market, those vouchers have commanded nine-figure price tags.However, before investors begin to model for potential DMD related revenue, they should remember that it's not certain that the FDA will shelve drisapersen or approve eteplirsen.Eteplirsen may have advantages in dystrophin production to drisapersen, but the basis for an approval of eteplirsen is a trial that included just 12 people. That's far fewer people than were studied in drisapersen's trials and that could mean that eteplirsen's results would have mirrored drisapersen's results if it had been studied in more people.Nevertheless, since there's no cure for this disease and most DMD patients fail to survive beyond their 30s, both drugs could get approved and because of that, investors may want to rein in some of their enthusiasm for Sarepta Therapeutics until they get the FDA's decision on drisapersen and insight into how they'll view Sarepta Therapeutics small sample size.

According to the latest update from the company. the FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of Feb. 26, 2016 to the drug and granted it Priority Review status as well.The other important wrinkle to this story is that  the FDA's briefing documents for  's rival DMD therapy, drisapersen, seemed to spell doom for the drug's regulatory hopes in the short-term, or at least indicate that it would have trouble capturing market share in a head-to-head competition with eteplirsen due to its problematic safety profile.With BioMarin's therapy apparently hampered by these outstanding safety issues -- along with its questionable efficacy profile -- some analysts think Sarepta's drug will be able to rapidly reach $500 million in peak sales, if approved. And stemming from this renewed optimism, the Street's median price target for Sarepta presently stands at around 30% higher than the stock's current price of $37.05.The problem, though, is that eteplirsen's regulatory fate is far from certain. As most investors understand at this point, the drug has only completed a small midstage study that generated data from a  .So. there is a real risk that Sarepta's stock could get clobbered -- yet again -- as a result of another regulatory setback. If history is any guide, for example, Sarepta would probably tumble by 70% or more from its current price if eteplirsen is rejected by the FDA.While I'm perfectly content to let others speculate about eteplirsen's chances for approval, I do think investors may want to consider taking one of two steps right now to reduce their downside risk potential on this speculative biotech stock. Given that Sarepta has more than doubled since the start of the year, there's a good chance many shareholders are staring at some pretty hefty gains at this point. As such, there's little reason to risk everything by holding the entirety of your position heading into a binary event where the outcome is anything  certain. By selling half of your holdings now -- or at least enough to cover your original investment, you'll ensure that you'll walk away with a profit and still be able to participate in any additional upside moving forward. After all, the stock is already bumping up against its 52-week highs, meaning that it may not be able to move much higher until -- and unless -- eteplirsen is approved. For investors that are feeling lucky and are brave enough to hold everything through the eteplirsen regulatory decision, I think you'd be wise to buy some insurance in the form of deep out-of-the-money Put options here. Because the stock has been leaping higher in the last few sessions, Put options in general have been falling in a big way and are therefore a great way to hedge your long position in case disaster strikes. In short, you can pick up some insurance on the cheap to soften the blow if this stock does end up imploding in the wake of a negative regulatory outcome.I know it's tempting to try to maximize your profits on a red hot stock like Sarepta that seems like it'll never stop shooting higher. But discretion is most definitely the better part of valor in this case. You don't want to be staring at your portfolio in February wishing you had taken some money off the table or at least hedged the position. After all, there's no way to tell how this regulatory event is going to play out, but you can be smart about how you approach it.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare disorder in which patients can't produce dystrophin in levels necessary to support muscle development. Absent that muscle development, patients with DMD tend to lose mobility over time and eventually succumb to heart related complications tied to the disease.Because there is no treatment that directly targets the cause of DMD, the standard of care is corticosteroids which simply delay disease progression.In an attempt to improve upon current treatment options, considerable effort has focused on developing therapies to restore dystrophin production in these patients.The majority of that work focuses on skipping specific exons believed to be disrupting dystrophin production and both BioMarin and Sarepta's drugs specifically target skipping exon 51. BioMarin acquired drisapersen by buying  . last year for $680 million in cash and promises of another $160 million if drisapersen can claw its way past regulators.The acquisition is a gamble for BioMarin because trial results for drisapersen have been less than stellar.Specifically, drisapersen failed to outperform placebo in a phase 3 study, prompting Prosensa's partner at the time,  , to walk away from the collaboration in January 2014.Typically, a high profile late-stage trial failure and the loss of a well-heeled partner would spell the end for a drug in development, however, because of DMD's significant unmet need for new treatment options and a dire prognosis for patients, advocacy groups successfully lobbied for the FDA to provide a pathway to consider approval anyway.BioMarin Pharmaceutical In documents released last week, the FDA provided talking points to the advisory committee that suggests the hurdle for approval may be high.After reviewing two mid stage trial results and the phase 3 data, the FDA came away believing that drisapersen's efficacy was \"inconsistent.\"That could be an understatement given that the FDA's report said the first phase 2 trial offered \"unimpressive statistical strength\" and thus, \"the overall persuasiveness of this study appears to be low.\"It offered a similarly dim view of the second phase 2 study, saying that the independent persuasiveness of this study is \"low.\" The advisory committee will debate drisapersen's merits tomorrow and all eyes will be firmly focused on what the members say. The committee will consider both the trial data that has been submitted and hear testimony from patients.If the testimony is strong enough to overcome the drug's shortcomings in trials, then it could indicate that the FDA will follow the committees recommendation and approve drisapersen. It could also suggest that the FDA will give Sarepta's eteplirsen a green light eventually too. The FDA is set to make its final decision on drisapersen on December 27 and eteplirsen on February 26.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Having a risky bet go south may not be a big deal for younger investors, who have decades left in their working lives, but for investors in their 50s, a big loss could negatively affect retirement.There's still room for taking some risk, of course, but safety should be a major concern. With that in mind, three of our Foolish contributors have found a few stocks that may make sense for investors in their 50s. : The steel industry has been hammered (Pun? Sorry.) over the past year-plus: data by Iron and steel prices globally have tanked, and much in the same way that  have: too much product; too little demand. This situation has led to a number of different reactions, including some illegal ones by some state-owned steel industries in some parts of the world being propped up by their governments. The U.S. government implemented tariffs in 2014, but illegally subsidized steel continues to get imported into the U.S. at prices that some steelmakers just can't compete with.And while this sounds like a terrible environment to invest in steelmakers, I think it makes for a good opportunity if you invest in the  steelmakers, such as  and  .What makes these two steelmakers exceptions? Their operations are better suited for the ups and downs of the cyclical steel industry, with steel mills and foundries which are much more scalable to meet fluctuations in demand. By having a more variable capital and operating structure, the companies have lower fixed costs that are hugely beneficial in downturns.Second, both companies are well run by management teams that focus on operations and maintaining strong balance sheets: data by Bottom line: Steelmaking is ugly today, but it will recover. Nucor and Steel Dynamics will navigate the downturn just fine and be huge winners when things eventually turn for the better. Finding a balance between growth potential and preservation of capital is important for investors in their 50s. High-flying growth stocks may be fine for younger investors, but big losses need to be avoided for those in the final stages of their working lives. I think one of the best options for investors in their 50s is  , a conglomerate with an unparalleled track record headed by legendary investor Warren Buffett.Berkshire consists of dozens of separate businesses spanning a broad swath of industries, as well as an investment portfolio valued at over $100 billion. The company generated nearly $200 billion in revenue and about $20 billion in net income in 2014, making Berkshire one of the largest companies in world measured by either revenue or profit.From 1965 through 2014, Berkshire's per-share book value has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 19.4%, while its per-share market value has grown at a faster 21.6% annual rate. For comparison, the S&P 500 index, including dividends, has grown by only 9.9% annually. While past performance doesn't guarantee future performance, Berkshire's track record is impressive.Buffett won't be around forever, but Berkshire is positioned well for the future. The company's businesses include Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which operates a variety of energy companies, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, one of the largest railroads in North America, various insurance companies such as Geico and General Re, and dozens of other companies big and small. Berkshire buys companies that have built sustainable competitive advantages, ensuring that they generate ample cash for Berkshire to invest for decades to come.: When buying stocks in your 50s, I think it's important to try to avoid any major risks by focusing on companies with solid balance sheets, top-notch management, and a strong competitive edge. In my view, the mid-cap biotech stock  fits that description nicely.BioMarin is quickly becoming a leader in the field of drugs for rare diseases, also known as \"orphan drugs.\" Orphan drugs have turned into an extremely important part of the pharma industry because they offer their manufacturers extended periods of exclusivity, premium pricing structures, and tax benefits, and they tend to face little to no competition once they hit the market. And perhaps the best part is that their prices, despite being some of the highest on average among all branded medicines, haven't attracted much attention from payers because of their small target markets.Turning to BioMarin in particular, this orphan-drug specialist has been able to deliver a CAGR in terms of total revenue of an astonishing 42.5% over the past decade because of management's keen ability to garner marketing approvals for three major orphan drugs. And according to  , the Street thinks BioMarin's top line should continue this upward trend by growing another 30% next year, mainly because of the strong sales momentum of its relatively new Morquio A syndrome treatment Vimizim.Perhaps most impressively, BioMarin has been able to deliver this eye-popping level of growth without stressing its balance sheet through gigantic mergers and acquisitions. The company's debt-to-equity ratio, for instance, currently stands at a hair under 30% -- well below the industry average of nearly 65%. Therefore, BioMarin appears, to me, to be a high-growth biotech stock that's built to deliver market-beating results for the long term.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

If so, then investors willing to step in and buy shares that have tumbled 37% since July could end up getting a bargain. Earlier this month, DepoMed boosted its product revenue guidance for this year to at least $336 million from its prior forecast of at least $320 million, and that growth trajectory has industry watchers thinking EPS will be $1.87 next year, up from $0.80 this year.Source: BioMarin.BioMarin is the biggest by market cap of these three specialty-drug companies, and it also boasts the most robust drug-development program, but its shares have still tumbled by 26% since July.BioMarin spent $158.7 million on therapies in its drug pipeline last quarter, including treatments for Batten disease and Pompe disease, two rare conditions.Financing that spending are ultra-high-price enzyme replacement therapies, including Naglazyme, a treatment for the ultra-rare Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome that BioMarin charges a jaw-dropping $485,747 per year for and that brought in sales of $54 million last quarter.Because therapies such as Naglazyme carry sticker shock-evoking price tags, investors have been fleeing BioMarin shares, but that might not be the right move.Most of the companies that are under the biggest scrutiny for sketchy price policies are those that have avoided spending the money necessary to develop new medicines. Instead, they've focused on an acquisition and rebrand/reprice strategy. Since BioMarin is investing heavily in new treatments for orphan diseases and its spending is high enough that it doesn't turn a profit yet, it probably shouldn't be lumped into that category.If I'm right that BioMarin is being unfairly punished, then BioMarin's recent decline and promising pipeline could make it the most attractive of these three stocks to own, especially for long-haul growth-oriented investors willing to stick it out until revenue is high enough to drop money to the bottom line. There's no doubt in my mind that attention and criticism over pricing will remain a major focus of payers, patients, and politicians, and that focus could limit price increases in the future, but that doesn't mean there aren't valid reasons to consider owning Mallinckrodt, DepoMed, or BioMarin.However, out of the three it's DepoMed and BioMarin that are my favorites.DepoMed's price for Nucynta is in line with the market, the market is competitive, and DepoMed is profitable and growing. Meanwhile, BioMarin's pipeline is packed with therapies that address the significant unmet needs of small patient populations, and that makes me think investors are undervaluing its potential.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Shares of  , a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD, skyrocketed more than 27% higher today after the FDA released a less than flattering report on an experimental drug produced by its primary rival. The FDA released a very critical report today related to its pending review of drisapersen, a DMD medicine that is made by Sarepta Therapeutics' competitor  .The FDA report was especially harsh on its review of drisapersen, stating:The report went on to express serious concerns about the safety profile of drisapersen, noting that some patients experienced severe toxicity across many organ systems while using the drug.Given that BioMarin Pharmaceuticals and Sarepta Therapeutics have been  to be the first to bring a DMD treatment to market, this report appears to have tipped the scales into Sarepta's favor. Since the FDA drug review process is designed to be hyper critical it's certainly understandable why the report was so harsh on drisapersen. However, this report doesn't necessarily mean that drisapersen has no chance of gaining approval. That decision will be released after the FDA panel vote scheduled for next week.Investors should also be aware that Sarepta isn't exactly a shoo-in for an approval based on today's update either, as its own clinical trial data  . Still, given the huge need for a DMD treatment, it's likely that at least one of these drugs will make its way to market.The drama unfolding as this story plays out is likely to continue on for several more months, so invesotrs in both BioMarin and Sarpeta Therapeutics investors would probably be wise to mentally prepare themselves for more volatility ahead.

Sarepta's shares were down 3.1% following the release of third-quarter results.The company did not generate any revenue in the third quarter of 2015 while the year-ago period generated revenues of $1.1 million. The lack of revenues in the reported quarter reflects the Jul 2014 expiration of the Marburg U.S. government contract.Research and development expenses shot up 67.8% year over year to $36.7 million. General and administrative expenses climbed 17.1% year over year to $15.1 million.Sarepta's lead pipeline candidate, eteplirsen, is currently under the FDA's priority review for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). A response is expected by Feb 26, 2016. But before that, eteplirsen will most likely be reviewed by the FDA's Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee, tentatively on Jan 22, 2016.In addition, Sarepta plans to seek approval for eteplirsen in the EU next year pending discussions with the European Medicines Agency scheduled before year end.In Aug 2015, eteplirsen also received the rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for DMD.Meanwhile, Sarepta continues to progress with its confirmatory studies - PROMOVI (enrolment ongoing) and Study 4045-301 (Essence - including both patients amenable to either exon 45 skipping or exon 53 skipping).Other eteplirsen focused studies with mutations amenable to exon skipping 51 include Study 4658-204 (enrolment completed) and Study 4658-203 (enrolment ongoing). While Study 4658-204 is being conducted in primarily non-ambulatory boys up to 21 years of age, Study 4658-203 is being conducted in boys between 4-6 years of age.The company continues enrolling patients in part II of the European dose titration Study 4053-101, which includes both additional patients with mutations amenable to exon-53 skipping as well as untreated control group with mutations not amenable to exon-53 skipping. Enrolment in this study is expected to be completed by year end.Sarepta also initiated Study 4045-101, which is a randomized, dose titration study in the U.S. for patients 7 to 21 years of age with limited or no ambulation and mutations amenable to skipping-exon-45.Sarepta's third-quarter results were disappointing with the company reporting a wider-than-expected loss. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the company's progress with eteplirsen. Eteplirsen, if developed successfully, would be able to capture a major share of this orphan disease market and its approval would be a huge boost for the company.However, we note that several companies including BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  are working on bringing DMD treatments to the market. BioMarin's DMD candidate, drisapersen, will be reviewed by the FDA's panel on Nov 24, 2015. BioMarin could have a two-month head start if approval comes by Dec 27, 2015.We expect investor focus to remain on the outcome of the upcoming advisory panel meetings.Sarepta is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.

However, revenues were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $220 million.Vimizim contributed $65.1 million to total revenue, up 20.8% sequentially. Kuvan revenues increased 20.2% year over year to $64.2 million. This increase is attributable to an increasing number of patients and higher rates of compliance.Naglazyme sales, which were largely impacted by uneven sales in Latin America, decreased 19.9% year over year to $54.1 million.

In addition to Kyndrisa, BioMarin's chairman and CEO, Jean-Jacques Bienaime, highlighted a couple of other pipeline drugs that could be up for approval: \"Over the next four quarters, we could potentially have three new molecular entities in registrations for approval: Kyndrisa for DMD, cerliponase alfa for CLN2 disorder, and pegvaliase for PKU. I cannot think of any other biotechnology company that has achieved this level of productivity.\"Them's fighting words. Of course, being \"in registration\" -- the technical name for being reviewed for approval by regulators -- is only the first step. BioMarin needs to actually get the drugs approved.Bienaime also had some interesting comments about all the presidential candidates complaining about high drug prices: \"Irrespective of the political rhetoric of our direct pricing we've heard about over the last few weeks, it is important to appreciate the distinction between taking unreasonable price increases on all drugs versus investing heavily in research and development to discover breakthrough treatments for people, mostly children in BioMarin's cases, who have no alternative.\"Orphan drugs have been able to charge such high prices because they treat so few people that they're not a drain on the healthcare system. None of BioMarin's current drugs are blockbusters; combined they won't even hit the $1 billion threshold this year. Let's hope politicians can see the difference. After the strong third quarter, BioMarin's management increased 2015 revenue guidance to between $880 million and $900 million, up from previous guidance of $850 million to $880 million. The biotech also expects to lose less money this year than it had previously guided for.The key there is that BioMarin is still losing money.

Patients on eteplirsen witnessed loss in ambulation at a lower rate (16.7%) compared to natural history control patients (46.2%). Patients experienced a slower rate of disease progression when compared to untreated matched historical controls over a treatment period of three years.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 58.49%.Impressive performance by Kuvan, Naglazyme and Vimizim which boosted sales in the previous quarter as compared to the year-ago quarter should continue earning higher revenues this quarter as well. Launch of Vimizim in additional markets and the identification of additional Morquio A syndrome patients should continue to boost revenues.Naglazyme sales, which saw an unexpected growth in the previous quarter from an increase in demand in Latin America, may not show the same result this quarter.The investors should remain focused on BioMarin's pipeline update in the third quarter.The company's lead pipeline candidate, drisapersen, which is currently under FDA review for the treatment of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to exon 51 skipping will be reviewed by the FDA's Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee at a meeting scheduled on Nov 24, 2015.

Rare-disease specialist  relies on several very expensive therapies for the majority of its top line. Amid outcry over drug pricing, it seems a company with some of the world's  drugs should be shaking in its boots.BioMarin shares have lost over 17% of their value since a scathing  article incited anger over drug pricing practices that Hillary Clinton described as \"price gouging.\" Rather than tremble in fear, BioMarin is boldly expanding its reach within a rare disease, phenylketonuria, or PKU. The company recently announced that it will repurchase rights to Kuvan and pegvaliase from  for about $389 million upfront and up to about $211 million in future milestone payments. This ends 10 years of Merck ownership of ex-U.S. and ex-Japan rights to Kuvan.Meanwhile, we know publicly-traded Valeant's R&D spending reached $255 million over the past 12 months. While this is far and away the most it has ever spent on R&D, it's less than 3% of revenue recorded during the same period.One of Clinton's proposals would require drugmakers to invest a \"sufficient\" amount of revenue in R&D. While it's highly unlikely legislation of this sort will ever see the light of day through a Republican-controlled Congress, BioMarin has little to fear even in a Democratic-controlled Congress. In stark contrast to Valeant, BioMarin spends so much on R&D that it hasn't produced a profit in years.Not that there isn't any justification for acquiring drugs versus developing them in-house. In this instance, BioMarin is repurchasing ex-U.S. and ex-Japan rights to Kuvan and to pegvaliase, which it sold to Merck KGaA years ago. BioMarin retained rights to U.S. and Canadian sales of Kuvan and will begin booking revenue from global sales excluding Japan in January. Management expects its share of Kuvan sales to reach about $335 million next year, or about $115 million more than it's on pace to earn from U.S. and Canadian sales of Kuvan this year.PKU affects an estimated 50,000 people worldwide. Reaching their physicians isn't easy, but BioMarin is well positioned to leverage inroads it has made in Kuvan's niche market. In the years following the sale of ex-U.S. rights to Kuvan, BioMarin has developed relationships with doctors worldwide who specialize in rare maladies such as PKU in the course of marketing the rest of its specialized portfolio.When BioMarin entered the Kuvan agreement with Merck KGaA in 2005, it simply didn't have the means to effectively market the drug around the globe. Fast-forwarding to the first half of this year, the company's ex-U.S. sales have already reached $255.1 million and are now responsible a majority of the company's revenue.As an investor, the important thing to bear in mind is that the market as a whole tends to sell first then ask questions later. Lumping BioMarin in with the likes of Turing and Valeant makes little sense, but both stock prices fell hard following Clinton's tweet.BioMarin's drugs are expensive, but its commitment to innovation hardly resembles \"price gouging.\" That's not to say well-intended legislation couldn't spill over in the future, but for now I'm optimistic about BioMarin's decision to cement its place in the global PKU market.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The vast majority of them aren't likely to pan out -- more than 90% of cancer drugs fall short in clinical trials -- but here are three that have caught my eye and that could move shares in the companies developing them higher or lower next year.In August, Celldex Therapeutics delivered bad news to investors when it announced that it would need to complete phase 3 trials of its brain cancer drug Rintega before filing an application for approval with the FDA. The admission disappointed investors hoping that the combination of a significant unmet need and solid early-stage trial results could clear the way for an accelerated approval.Clearly, the delay pushes back the timing of any potential revenue, but if Rintega succeeds in its phase 3 trials, it could become a top seller. In phase 2 studies, Rintega delayed tumor growth in glioblastoma patients and reduced the risk of death in these patients by 43% when used alongside Avastin and a control agent, compared with Avastin and a control agent alone.Investors could get insight into Rintega's phase 3 studies later this year or in early 2016, when monitors will conduct an interim look at the data. If the monitors decide to continue the trial to completion, then full trial results should be available in Q4 of 2016. Either way, next year will be an important one for Celldex.Source: Medivation. Medivation already has one billion-dollar blockbuster cancer drug on the market in Xtandi, which is used to treat prostate cancer, and it could have a second cancer drug on the market as early as 2017.Last month, Medivation paid $410 million in upfront cash to  to get BMN-673, or talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor, in phase 3 trials as a treatment for a subset of breast cancer patients. Specifically, talazoparib is being studied as a therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients who have already tried no more than two prior therapies and who have BRCA gene mutations that make them more amenable to the benefits of PARP inhibitors, which interrupt cell repair.Talazoparib's study is expected to conclude in the middle of next year, and if talazoparib is effective, then a filing for approval could come shortly thereafter.A similar PARP inhibitor made by  won approval earlier this year in ovarian cancer, and it reached the market with a six-figure annualized price tag. Because 10% of all breast cancer patients possess BRCA mutations and 12% of women may suffer from breast cancer in their lifetime, talazoparib could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in sales for Medivation, making it a company to keep tabs on in 2016. In September, Clovis Oncology presented data showing that 60% of lung cancer patients with a T790 mutation that makes them resistant to other therapies responded to its drug rociletinib.Those results could mean that the FDA will greenlight rociletinib in when it makes its approval decision next March, and if so, this could become an important drug. According to the National Cancer Institute, more than 400,000 Americans are living with lung cancer, and NSCLC accounts for the vast majority of these cases. Additionally, there are over 220,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed in the U.S. every year, and many of these patients will relapse because of developing a T790 mutation.Rociletinib's potential impact on Clovis Oncology next year is one reason to be watching the company's shares, but it's not the only reason. Clovis Oncology is also developing its own PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, for use in ovarian cancer. In phase 2 trials, 65% of patients responded to rucaparib and if phase 3 trials are similarly strong Clovis plans to file for FDA approval by the middle of 2016. Based on that timeline, if everything goes Clovis' way, the company could have two cancer drugs on the market in 2017. Biopharmaceutical companies are elbows deep in researching next-generation cancer treatments, and while these new treatments won't cure cancer, they could make significant improvements in patient survival.However, investors still need to remember that the vast majority of cancer drugs fail in their clinical trials, and Celldex, Medivation, and Clovis Oncology aren't immune to that risk. Having said that, I think these three companies have a shot at getting their therapies across the finish line, and that's why I'll be paying close attention to each of them in 2016.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

It is expected to be completed by Apr 2016. In the U.S., the drug enjoys orphan drug status for CMS. In addition, it enjoys orphan drug and Breakthrough Therapy designations for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).We remind investors that in Oct 2012, Catalyst entered into a strategic agreement to in-license the North American rights to Firdapse and responsibilities for its development program from BioMarin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  . The drug is already approved in the EU for the treatment of LEMS.Meanwhile, Catalyst is making a rolling submission of a new drug application for Firdapse for the treatment of LEMS to the FDA, which is expected to be complete during the fourth quarter of 2015. The company stated that it intends to amend its new drug application (NDA) filing with data from the pediatric study, when available. The company also intends to request the FDA for priority review status for its NDA. It has already started preparing for the commercialization of Firdapse in the U.S.Additionally, Catalyst is developing Firdapse for the treatment of a certain form of Myasthenia Gravis (MuSK myasthenia gravis).

Patients on eteplirsen witnessed loss in ambulation at a lower rate than the control arm over three years with pulmonary function remaining relatively stable through four years. Additionally, data from the fourth biopsy established that exon skipping occurred in 100% of patients after 180 weeks of treatment with an increase in dystrophin production in patients who received eteplirsen. On the safety front, eteplirsen was found to be well tolerated with a consistent safety profile.We note that eteplirsen is the company's lead pipeline candidate and is currently under the priority review in the U.S. with a response expected by Feb 26, 2016. The candidate enjoys Fast Track and orphan status in the U.S. In Aug 2015, eteplirsen also received a rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for DMD.Eteplirsen's approval would be a huge boost for the company - it would be able to address about 13% of the total DMD population. However, we note that several companies including BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  are working on bringing DMD treatments to the market. In fact, BioMarin is a step ahead of Sarepta and could gain FDA approval for its DMD candidate, drisapersen, by Dec 27, 2015.But before that, both eteplirsen and drisapersen will most likely be reviewed by the FDA's Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee in late November.

Boys with the disease can begin to show symptoms as early as age 2, and as they age, the symptoms tend to get worse. Many boys become dependent on a wheelchair before age 12, and the disease can lead to death at a young age, primarily due to respiratory or heart failure.DMD is a disease that currently has no cure or FDA-approved treatments, but two companies,  and  , are looking to change that. Each of them have successfully submitted a potential treatment for the disease to the FDA for approval, and the race is on to see which company will cross the finish line first and offer hope to patients with this rare disease.We asked our team of Motley Fool contributors to weigh in on which company they believe has the best chance of getting its drug to market first. BioMarin and Sarepta's respective DMD drugs are both barreling toward their long-awaited regulatory reviews with the FDA. Investors and patients alike are thus waiting to see whether the FDA will approve both drugs, just one, or perhaps neither.While I hate to play the part of the skeptic when it comes to new drugs that are desperately needed for rare diseases like DMD, I find it hard to believe that the FDA will green light either drug following these upcoming reviews.BioMarin's drug, drisapersen, actually failed to meet its primary endpoint in late-stage testing. Drisapersen's regulatory review thus hinges on the hypothesis that it might be more effective if given to younger patients, but there is limited empirical support for this notion right now.Sarepta's problem comes from the small sample size of the mid-stage study that's serving as the basis for the regulatory filing of its experimental DMD offering, eteplirsen. The FDA has repeatedly raised concerns that the 12 patients receiving eteplirsen in the study in question may not be sufficient to rule out a possible placebo or other experimental effect.Although Sarepta is attempting to counter this criticism by showing that patients taking eteplirsen experienced a significantly slower rate of disease progression than normal, the current data set can't speak to these concerns. Put simply, Sarepta is asking the FDA to take a leap of faith that further clinical data will confirm these promising mid-stage results, and that is something the agency has almost never been willing to do.A compelling case could certainly be made that the potential benefits of these drugs may far outweigh their risks for a disease that is always fatal. But my guess is that the FDA is going to ask BioMarin and Sarepta for more data before approving their drugs. At this point, I think there are just too many questions regarding their efficacy to warrant an approval. Clinical-stage biotech stocks developing much-needed new therapies for DMD have been among biotech's most frustrating investments; however, now that BioMarin and Sarepta's FDA decision dates are fast-approaching, investors will soon find out if sticking with these stocks through their nausea-inspiring volatility was worth it.Unfortunately, picking a winner in this horse race isn't going to be easy. Both BioMarin and Sarepta's drugs have a similar mechanism of action, and data from trials raised as many questions as it did answers for both companies.BioMarin's phase 3 failure following phase 2 success calls into question the efficacy of its drug, and despite Sarepta's mid-stage trial results being encouraging, Sarepta's findings are based on just 12 patients, and its three-year follow-up data suggests that efficacy for its drug may fade over time.Assuming regulators look beyond those question marks and both drugs win approval, I think BioMarin stands the best chance at commercial success because the drug maker has already proven that it knows how to commercialize rare disease treatments.However, since both companies were granted a rare pediatric disease designation for their drugs that nets them a transferable priority review voucher if their drugs get approved, both companies could get a big windfall next year.Similar vouchers have  for hundreds of millions of dollars recently, and if those prices hold up, selling them would have a bigger impact on the much smaller Sarepta, which boasts a market cap of just $1.37 billion. Regardless, I'm content to watch this race from the sidelines. BioMarin bought its way into this race in 2014 with its purchase of Prosensa, the original developer of their potential DMD treatment drisapersen. Considering that BioMarin forked over $680 million for the transaction, plus potential milestone payments, the management team must have had strong conviction that drisapersen would find its way to market and be successful. Given the company's  of success in treating orphan diseases, I'm inclined to give its management team the benefit of the doubt.In addition, the company was faster in getting its drug before the FDA for review, and regulators have set a target date for a decision of December 27, 2015. Sarepta has also already submitted, but its review date of February 26, 2016, is nearly two months later than BioMarin's.Given that the DMD community is rooting for both of these medicines to succeed, I'm sure doctors will be giving them a try as soon as they become available, which could give BioMarin a slight edge in the race given its potential two-month head start. If forced to choose a winner,  , but like Todd, I'm not confident enough in that outcome to put money in either of these names based solely on their DMD opportunities.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

It's been a busy couple of days for Sarepta that began with the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruling in favor of one patent licensed to its  for the exon-skipping approach used by both companies to treat DMD and ended with Sarepta providing more insight into the efficacy of its DMD drug, eteplirsen.BioMarin and Sarepta's drugs both employ an exon-skipping approach that attempts to restore dystrophin production in DMD patients to slow disease progression.According to Sarepta, the ruling by the patent office in favor of BioMarin relates to one patent on eteplirsen and the decision has no impact on eteplirsen's primary patent, which protects the drug until 2025.In its press release today, Sarepta reports that patients treated with eteplirsen showed a 151 meter advantage relative to a control in a six minute walk test. Sarepta also reports that nearly all of the patients receiving eterplirsen are producing dystrophin and that over the study period, the rate of loss in meters walked was less in the eteplirsen arm than in the control arm. Both BioMarin and Sarepta are awaiting an FDA decision on approval to begin marketing their DMD therapies and those decisions are expected within the next few months. The FDA is scheduled to issue a decision to BioMarin on December 27 and to Sarepta on February 26.If approved, these drugs will offer new hope to DMD patients with an amenable genetic makeup. Specifically, 13% of DMD patients have genetic mutations that could respond to BioMarin and Sarepta's exon-skipping therapies.Overall, that's a relatively small addressable patient population. DMD occurs in roughly one out of every 3,500 boys born worldwide and that means that only a few thousand patients would qualify for treatment.Regardless, because there is a significant need for new therapies for this life-shortening disease, there's a good chance that the FDA will approve these drugs and if so, then depending on the price that is charged by these drugmakers, these therapies could still generate hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. Additionally, if both drugs are approved, these companies will be awarded a transferable priority review voucher that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars given prices that have been recently paid for them on the open market.Overall, because there's still a chance that eteplirsen will fail to win FDA approval and it's uncertain what the impact could be on Sarepta if the ongoing patent litigation ends up favoring BioMarin, Sarepta remains a high risk stock suitable only for the most risk tolerant of investor.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Instead, the argument is over patents that cover the use of drugs to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy by skipping exons to partially fix the mutations that cause the disease.The mutation in the grey exon is skipped, creating a more-complete protein depicted by the purple circles. Source: Sarepta Therapeutics.Mutations in different exons have to be treated with different drugs. Both BioMarin and Sarepta are furthest along with drugs that treat patients with exon 51 mutations. BioMarin's drisapersen and Sarepta's eteplirsen are both currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration.Prosensa Therapeutics, which BioMarin recently purchased, has one set of patents licensed from Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, while Sarepta, which used to be called AVI, has another set licensed from the University of Western Australia.In Europe, Prosensa/BioMarin scored first with a ruling that the patents it licensed, which cover a wide number of exons, superseded Sarpeta's licensed patents. Sarepta fought back, scoring a point when it knocked out some of the claims so the patents only covered treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy using drugs that skip exons 51 and 46. Both companies are appealing the most recent decision in Europe.BioMarin scored its second point yesterday when the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruled that BioMarin's patents superseded Sarepta's patents for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy with exon 51 skipping drugs.Sarepta hasn't filed for approval in Europe yet, so the U.S. patent battle is arguably more important right now, with both drugs under FDA review. There are three potential scenarios that could happen next:The first one may not be possible since, according to Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum, BioMarin's licensed patent hasn't even been issued yet -- the board just agreed that the patent had been filed first -- and the BioMarin apparently can't get a court injunction to block Sarepta's launch without the patent being issued.Even if BioMarin could block the launch, it would make BioMarin look like a bully, which it probably wants to avoid given the unmet need and that Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients are kids. It's hard to compare the efficacy of the two drugs since they both have less-than-perfect data packages, but BioMarin is in a no win situation if it blocks the launch of eteplirsen: for those that think eteplirsen is best, BioMarin is blocking treatment to the best medication, and if BioMarin's drisapersen is best, then it has nothing to worry about by letting Sarepta launch.The potential for a royalty versus Sarepta appealing the decision will be based on how high of a royalty BioMarin wants and how Sarepta sees its chance of prevailing in an appeal. I'd guess an appeal is more likely than the two negotiating a royalty at this point, but a royalty is likely to be the long-term solution since it'll make the problem go away for both sides.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

However, the company recently took a step in the right direction toward diversification when it acquired a cancer drug for its pipeline from  . Because this acquisition could reshape Medivation's future, let's learn more about it.Source: Medivation. Xtandi is currently approved for use in postchemotherapy and prechemotherapy prostate cancer patients and that means that it competes head to head against  Zytiga.Overall, Zytiga's $2 billion in annual sales is a bit higher than Xtandi's, but Xtandi is catching up quickly.Since winning approval in 2012, Xtandi has displaced Zytiga to become the most widely used third-line therapy in prostate cancer patients, and following the FDA's decision last year to expand Xtandi's label to include prechemotherapy patients, Xtandi appears to be dethroning Zytiga in that patient population, too.In the second quarter, Zytiga revenue totaled $546 million, but Zytiga's ex-currency revenue growth was just 8.6%. For comparison, Xtandi's global sales came in at $486.4 million in Q2, but its U.S. sales surged 108% higher and its overseas sales jumped by 121% year over year. Clearly, Medivation and co-developer  have a fast-growing blockbuster on their hands, but the lifespan of any drug is limited by competitive threats and patents that expire; as a result, investors must be as concerned about a company's future plans as they are about its current successes.In this regard, Medivation's relatively thin R&D pipeline means that it still has some work to do if it hopes to sidestep risks to Xtandi. Fortunately, Medivation has plenty of options, including growth via acquisitions like the deal it struck with BioMarin.In that deal, Medivation forked over $410 million up front to get its hands on BMN-673, or talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor being developed as a breast cancer treatment for patients with BRCA mutations.The acquisition nets Medivation a drug that posted solid efficacy and safety results in early stage trials and that already has phase 3 trials well under way. In small phase 1/2 studies, 72% of talazoparib patients responded to or had stable disease at 24 weeks.In addition to solid early-stage results, Medivation may also have bought global rights to talazoparib because of the FDA's approval in February of a competing BRCA targeting PARP inhibitor:  Lynparza. The agency's approval of Lynparza for use in ovarian cancer patients validates talazoparib's PARP approach and Lynparza's $10,000 per month estimated price tag suggests that if approved, talazoparib could be a commercial success. PARP inhibitors, which limit the ability of cancer cells to repair DNA damaged by anti-cancer agents, have been shown to be particularly robust in patients with a BRCA mutation, but investors should remember that up to 40% of phase 3 drug trials fail and there's no guarantee that Medivation's talazoparib will ever reach pharmacy shelves.Although the risk of failure is real, investors shouldn't have to wait too long to find out whether or not talazoparib is a pharmaceutical stud or a dud. The phase 3 study started by BioMarin in 2013 is scheduled to wrap up in the middle of 2016 and if talazoparib extends progression-free survival -- the primary endpoint for this study -- then an application for approval could be filed shortly thereafter.Given that up to 10% of all breast cancer cases are diagnosed in patients with BRCA mutations and about 12% of all women will develop breast cancer, talazoparib could begin generating meaningful revenue for Medivation as early as 2017, and for that reason, investors should keep a close eye on talazoparib's results when they're announced next year.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Importantly, as Xtandi gains market share in the treatment of prostate cancer from  's (JNJ) Zytiga, Medivation reported significant growth in prescriptions written by both oncologists and urologists following Xtandi's approval for the chemo-na\u00efve indication.Moreover, while most of the Xtandi scrips are written by oncologists, there was significant growth in the number of urologists writing Xtandi. The company said that about 20% of scrips are now in urology.On September 8, UBS analysts put out a research note explaining their renewed optimism for the Medivation growth story. The firm reiterated a Buy rating and $74 price target on Medivation as shares continued to drop. The firm believes that shares are now at a 60% discount to the peer group, versus near-parity in April-May 2015. Analyst Matthew Roden noted...In contrast, our fundamental view that Xtandi has the potential to be a $3bn+ (US sales) drug prior to early stage prostate label expansion remains unchanged, based on our new analysis of the current underlying growth trends.Further we acknowledge the market needs more data before believing in Xtandi in breast cancer, the PARP, or pidilizumab, but our point from the risk-reward standpoint is that neither of these program are reflected in the multiple, and hence represent potential upside drivers.And it was on August 25 that the same analyst had initially raised his price target to $74 following Medivation's acquisition of a breast cancer drug from BioMarin. The drug, talazoparib, is an oral PARP inhibitor, belonging to a group of pharmacological inhibitors of the enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Roden said that the acquisition diversifies the revenue stream and adds to pipeline optionality. He further noted...\"Medivation's acquisition of world-wide rights to Biomarin's talazoparib (BMN 673), an oral PARP inhibitor is a fundamental positive, in our view, as it diversifies the revenue stream and adds to pipeline optionality. We spoke with management, who pointed to the literature on talazoparib that suggests it is a best-in-class PARP and may be effective in multiple high-value indications beyond breast cancer, including in prostate (potentially in combo w Xtandi) and lung. The macro selloff aside, we believe a higher multiple is warranted fundamentally (intraday 18x our new 2016e and 12x '17e) given the steep earnings ramp, multiple revenue growth opportunities, and revenue diversification.\"In other analyst actions, on September 15, Nomura Securities initiated coverage of Medivation with a Buy rating and a price target of $70. Also last week, William Blair analysts put out a fresh research note reiterating their Outperform rating and $83 price target. The Blair analysts stated...\"We believe Medivation is building an industry-leading oncology portfolio with strong fundamentals for sales growth and scientific rationales for future growth, in particular through combination therapies.\"Accumulation of MDVN shares in Q2 was steady.

But the stock has since seen a capitulation in price (on lighter volume) and the analyst reaction since Q2 earnings and the key drug acquisition created a big turn in sentiment to drive price above the July 29 selling levels, prior to the Hillary Clinton tweet that tanked the whole Biotech complex on September 21.Plus, we have a very clear picture of the big guys and gals buying on the way down from $65 to $55 in Q2. I don't think these very smart and successful players were plunking down this kind of dough here to run away between $40 and $50 now.

We note that the FDA grants priority review status to candidates that have the potential to bring significant improvements when compared to currently available therapies.Eteplirsen is the company's lead pipeline candidate. The candidate already enjoys Fast Track and orphan status in the U.S.Late last week, eteplirsen also received rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for DMD.A rare pediatric disease is one that affects less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. from birth to 18 years of age.

Moreover, the voucher might be sold or transferred without limitation.DMD is a devastating and debilitating disease and is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 3,500 boys born across the world. There is significant unmet need for DMD treatments.We are encouraged by the company's progress with eteplirsen. Eteplirsen's approval would be a huge boost for the company - it would be able to address about 13% of the total DMD population.However, we note that several companies including BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  are working on bringing DMD treatments to market.

(Symbol: BMRN) saw new options become available this week, for the April 2016 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 231 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the BMRN options chain for the new April 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $16.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $108.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of BMRN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $131.27/share today.Because the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 13.04% return on the cash commitment, or 20.60% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., and highlighting in green where the $125.00 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $19.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of BMRN stock at the current price level of $131.27/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $135.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 17.39% if the stock gets called away at the April 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BMRN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing BMRN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $135.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 44%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 14.55% boost of extra return to the investor, or 22.99% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 52%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 53%.

Source: Sarepta Therapeutics.The race is on between  and  to bring the first Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug for patients who can be helped with an exon 51-skipping drug.Both drugs are getting priority reviews from the agency, highlighting the unmet need in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. BioMarin Pharmaceuticals' drisapersen has a two-month head start with a Food and Drug Administration target action date of December 27. Sarepta's date with destiny for eteplirsen is February 26.Normally, accepting the applications and assigning an action date wouldn't be that big of a deal, but both drugs have blemishes that make their applications less than perfect.Sarepta Therapeutics has had an on-again, off-again relationship with the FDA. The biotech was  in 2013 when the FDA said it didn't think the limited phase 2 data Sarepta had was enough to approve the drug. But since then, Sarepta has  the FDA has reversed course and encouraged the company to apply for approval.BioMarin's drisapersen failed a phase 3 trial, but Prosensa, the owner of the drug before BioMarin bought the company, talked with the FDA, which agreed to a regulatory path forward as long as Prosensa agreed to run two post-approval clinical trials. Investors' anxiety about the FDA accepting the applications has to do with the lack of transparency for the interactions between the companies and the FDA. Investors only get one side of the story from the companies. Management will say the FDA offered \"positive feedback\" about submitting an application or that the FDA \"agreed\" with the company's plans, but there's no way for investors to verify it because the agency doesn't talk publicly about unapproved drugs.For drisapersen, at least investors were able to get a second opinion from BioMarin, which subsequently purchased Prosensa. The biotech presumably saw the meeting minutes and was clearly confident that the agency would accept the application.Investors won't have to wait too much longer to get a first-hand look at what the FDA thinks of the drugs when they are reviewed at an advisory committee meeting. A meeting for the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee has been tentatively scheduled for November 23 and 24. One day would presumably be used to review drisapersen and the other for eteplirsen although the FDA hasn't formally said that since the meeting is still tentative.Two business days before the advisory committee meeting, the FDA's summary of its review of the drugs and questions for the committee will be available on its website. Assuming the meetings are on separate days, investors in the company that goes second will have to wait an extra day.Considering how much feedback both companies have gotten from the agency before even submitting their applications, it seems the FDA wants to approve the drugs.The advisory committee meetings are a bit of a wild card. If the committee of outside experts recommended that the drugs not get approved, it's hard to see the FDA going against their recommendation. Luckily for the companies, advisory committees tend to be willing to overlook less-than-perfect data for diseases that don't have any approved drugs. Many doctors, who make up most of the panel, figure something that may work is better than nothing at all.It's always possible that the FDA will approve one drug but not the other, but it's hard to say which data package is worse.BioMarin Pharmaceuticals failed its only phase 3 trial. But the company will argue that drisapersen worked well in the two phase 2 trials and the reason the drug failed in phase 3 was because the trial enrolled older patients that had advanced to a point where the drug wasn't as helpful.The data for eteplirsen comes from a small phase 2 trial, so the drug hasn't been tested on nearly as many patients as drisapersen. The upside is that the data is much cleaner in large part because the patients have been on the drug for so long. Since this is a progressive disease, the lack of deterioration is a good sign that the drug is working even if there isn't any true placebo control at this point since those patients were switched over to the drug a while ago. Data from a fourth biopsy to see if there's still expression of dystrophin -- the protein missing in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients that eteplirsen restores -- is expected in October and can be added to the application, presumably before an advisory committee meeting.The tiebreaker could come down to the post-approval trials to confirm that the drugs work. If the FDA is worried that it's approving something that doesn't work, the faster the companies can confirm or disprove that worry, the less of a concern it'll be.Sarepta has BioMarin beaten in this category because its confirmatory trial, PROMOVI, has already started and should be fully enrolled by the end of the year. BioMarin doesn't plan on starting its confirmatory trials until after the details are worked out during the review process.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

While Knight Therapeutics sold its voucher to Gilead Sciences Inc.  for $125 million, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  received $67.5 million for its voucher.Meanwhile, United Therapeutics gained approval for Unituxin earlier this week in the EU for use in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-2 and isotretinoin for the treatment of pediatric patients (aged 12 months to 17 years) suffering from high-risk neuroblastoma, who have previously received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response followed by myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.However, Unituxin's approval in the EU came with special warnings and precautions related to allergic reactions and capillary leak syndrome among others. The drug is subject to additional monitoring.We are encouraged by the approval of Unituxin in the EU. According to the press release issued by the company, neuroblastoma is estimated to affect about 1,500 patients in the EU annually, half of whom fall in the high-risk category.We note that Unituxin has already hit the U.S. markets in the current quarter. Approval in the EU would boost the drug's sales potential further. We expect investor focus to remain on the commercialization and sales ramp up of Unituxin.United Therapeutics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Gilead is a better-ranked stock in the health care sector carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

Think about that for a moment: $1 trillion equates to 1.3% of global GDP, and is higher than the cumulative annual GDP of all but 15 countries around the world. And looking forward, global pharmaceutical spending is only expected to increase.  projects that spending could rise by 30% between 2014 and 2018 to $1.3 trillion.Why are pharmaceutical prices rising so rapidly? As we've discussed previously, there are  why prescription drug prices are soaring worldwide. Some are expected and include the need to cover research and development and marketing costs for new drugs. But other reasons for rising prescription costs often fly under the radar.For example, we know drug developers need to cover their R&D costs to develop a drug, but consumers often forget that drug developers are also looking to recoup losses tied to research into dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of failed discovery, preclinical, or clinical therapies that didn't make it to pharmacy shelves.Drugmakers are also making a strong push into treating orphan diseases (indications with 200,000 or fewer people in the U.S.) and developing medicines that are personalized and focus on a specific gene or protein within a patient. The move makes a lot of sense on the part of drug developers, as there's minimal competition and little reason for insurers to deny coverage. This push toward specialization has been a major reason why prescription drug prices keep heading higher.Source: Flickr user Dan Moyle.With drug cost inflation not expected to slow anytime soon, patients with rare diseases, or diseases that suddenly have breakthrough cures, have been faced with mammoth price tags -- and some consumers aren't happy about it.Last year,  had to answer to Congress after placing a $1,000/day price tag on its once-daily pill for hepatitis C, Sovaldi, and a $1,125/day price tag on once-daily HCV therapy Harvoni. A genotype 1 patient with liver cirrhosis who's been treated previously could be looking at a treatment cost of $189,000 with Harvoni! Of course, Gilead's therapies also provided a 90%-plus cure rate in most clinical studies and drastically improved patients' quality of life during treatment vis-\u00e0-vis manageable side effects, a far cry from any preceding HCV therapies. ' Orkambi, a drug designed to treat cystic fibrosis patients with the F508del mutation, has drawn even more ire with its $259,000 per year wholesale cost. Unlike Sovaldi and Harvoni, which promise a cure to a vast majority of patients taking them, Orkambi merely offers an improvement in lung function to the roughly 8,500 patients in the U.S. who may qualify for the drug.But neither Orkambi or Gilead's HCV duo even crack the top five when it comes to the world's most expensive drugs in 2015. In fact, a handful of drugs priced in the $300,000-$360,000 annual cost range didn't make the list! Today we'll take a brief look at what medicines will set insurers and consumers back the most.However, before we do that, two points of caution. First, drug developers have a tendency to change drug prices on a quarter-to-quarter basis, meaning this list could look different even three months from now. The other point worth noting is the cost for these treatments can depend on  you are in the world. Harvoni might run $1,125 per pill on a wholesale basis in the U.S., but in emerging markets overseas with price caps in place the same pill might run as low as $10. In other words, pricing is a bit subjective, and you should keep that in mind as you read on.Source: Pictures of Money via Flickr.With that out of the way, here are the world's five most expensive drugs: $1.21 million wholesale cost per yearWe knew that one day we would see the world's first seven-figure drug in terms of cost. Based on an approval in the EU last year for  , we now have one.Glybera is a gene therapy that helps restore LPL enzyme activity, which is critical to removing fat-carrying chylomicron particles in the intestines following a fat-containing meal. Specifically, it treats an extremely rare condition known as familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency, which affects only one in 1 million people -- thus Glybera's market potential is only around 150 to 200 people in the EU. Primary care physicians administer the drug in a one-time series of up to 60 intramuscular injections in a patients' legs.When you consider its one-and-done dosing and extremely small patient pool, it's slightly less shocking that UniQure settled on a 1.1 million euro price tag for Glybera. $700,000 wholesale cost per year ' Soliris has actually been the most expensive drug in the world for years, so seeing it fall out of the top spot may come as a surprise to many. Within the U.S. Soliris had a wholesale cost of nearly $537,000 last year, but the Patented Medicines Price Review Board notes that Soliris' annual cost in Canada can be as high as $700,000 per patient.Source: Alexion PharmaceuticalsSoliris has two current indications: as a treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and as a treatment for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. Both are very rare indications with no current competition, thus the ability of Alexion to command such a high price tag for Soliris. More importantly, patients with PNH often live for 10 to 15 years following their diagnosis, so despite a small patient population, Alexion has a source of long-term recurring revenue with Soliris. After delivering $2.2 billion in revenue in 2014, Alexion is projected by Wall Street to more than double to $5 billion in 2018, mostly on the heels of Soliris. $485,747 wholesale cost per year (based on 2014 pricing)Based on data provided by FiercePharma last year,  's Naglazyme will handily take the third spot, with an annual cost approaching a half-million dollars. I looked far and wide for an update on pricing for Naglazyme in 2015, but not a trace of an update was to be found. That's probably because the drug is only prescribed to a few dozen patients on a per year basis, according to EvaluatePharma.Naglazyme is an enzyme replacement therapy designed to treat a disease known as mucopolysaccharidosis type VI, which is also known as Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. This is a progressive disease that can cause organ enlargement and skeletal abnormalities, and it often leads to shortened life expectancies for those diagnosed.Source: BioMarin Pharmaceutical. $380,000 wholesale cost per yearBioMarin Pharmaceutical, a rare disease specialist, also brings us the fourth-most expensive drug in the world with Vimizim.Vimizim, with its $380,000 per year cost, is an enzyme replacement therapy that's given as a weekly infusion to treat Morquio A syndrome, a disease characterized by the body's inability to break down long-chain sugar molecules. An estimated 800 people have Morquio A in the United States, and Vimizim's developed world market is believed to be about 3,000 people. Analysts predict that despite its relatively small market potential, Vimizm could generate up to a half-billion in sales annually at its peak for BioMarin. $375,000 wholesale cost per year (based on last update in 2010)Lastly, the spot as fifth-most expensive drug in the world goes to  's Elaprase, an enzyme replacement therapy designed to treat patients with mucopolysaccharidosis II, or Hunter syndrome. You'll note the last conclusive pricing data on Elaprase comes to us from 2010 when it ran $375,000 per year on a wholesale level, but there's little reason to believe its price has fallen since that time with no added competition to the Hunter syndrome indication.Patients with Hunter syndrome lack an important enzyme (iduronate-2-sulfatase) that helps with the removal of long-chain sugar molecules. If these glycosaminoglycans aren't removed from a patient's body, it can lead to progressive organ decline, specifically of the heart, lungs, liver, and spleen. Incidence of the disease is fairly low, with the EU reported one case per every 140,000-156,000 births.With little standing in the way of higher prescription drug prices, annual costs in the high six-digit range could soon become a norm in the orphan disease space.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The FDA has informed BioMarin that it will hold an advisory committee meeting later this year to discuss the application. Timely approval would allow the company to launch drisapersen in early 2016 in the U.S.Meanwhile, a CHMP opinion is expected in the first half of 2016 followed by a final decision from the European Commission in the third quarter of 2016.As per the information provided by the company, DMD affects approximately 1 in every 3,500 live male births. The company estimates that drisapersen could address about 10,000 DMD patients within the U.S.Meanwhile, companies like Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.  and Catabasis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  are also working on bringing their DMD treatments to market. Sarepta completed the submission of its regulatory application for its DMD candidate, eteplirsen, in the U.S. in Jun 2015.

Although the number of deals completed in biotech was flat year-over-year at 27, according to Pharmexec.com the value of those deals skyrocketed to $12.7 billion from $7.1 billion the previous year. I believe this demonstrates that there is clear interest in dealmaking within the biotech sector at present.One reason we're seeing such an abundance of deals is easy access to cheap cash. Historically low lending rates have allowed bigger companies to be aggressive and finance deals at attractive interest rates. Another key point is the patent cliff, which has been clubbing Big Pharma product lines pretty hard and coercing them to seek out immediate alternative avenues for growth. The answer, in many instances, has been acquisitions.Of course, it's important to understand that predicting which company could be the next buyout candidate is far from an exact science -- and investing in a stock in the hope of a buyout is rarely, if ever, a good idea. Nonetheless, it's worthwhile to examine what biotech companies could be on bigger companies' radars, as it could have a material impact on our investments.With that in mind -- and with another reminder that these are merely guesses on my part and not necessarily suggestions to buy these companies -- here are three biotech companies that could be potential buyout targets.Source: U.S. Food and Drug Administration.BioMarin Pharmaceutical is far from a tiny tot with a valuation of $22 billion, but the company's incredible clinical-stage results and successful drug development platform could be the perfect match for a larger biotech or Big Pharma company.BioMarin's research revolves around ultra-rare diseases. In the past, most drug developers have shied away from researching rare disease drugs because it's costly and the patient pool is often very small. However, for those that did go that route, like BioMarin, the rewards can be enormous when they get their treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Approved ultra-orphan disease drugs carry hefty price tags and rarely have any competitors to worry about.BioMarin's product portfolio currently includes Naglazyme, a drug designed to treat Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome which markets for close to $500,000 per year, and Vimizim, a treatment for Morquio A syndrome that'll set insurers and/or patients back about $380,000 per year. Between 2014 and 2018, Wall Street anticipates BioMarin's sales could more than double from $751 million to $1.9 billion.So, who might be interested in BioMarin? Understanding that this is pure speculation, I'd still single out  . Shire's portfolio predominantly revolves around rare disease drugs, so a combination would help lower costs, and would probably provide an EPS boost as quickly as a year following the closing of a deal. The only complication here is that Shire made an unsolicited $30 billion bid for  earlier this month. There's no guarantees this deal will come to fruition, but if it doesn't, keep a possible Shire and BioMarin marriage on your radar.Source: National Cancer Institute.Clinical-stage biotech company bluebird bio is what you might call the cream of the crop of attractive biotech buyout candidates, because it offers therapies targeted at rare diseases and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell technologies (also known as CAR-T) which enhance the body's T-cell response to more effectively fight cancer. In other words, you have a company that has little competition at one end of its research spectrum, and a huge amount of interest from Wall Street and its peers in its immunotherapy-based therapies to treat cancer at the other.Currently, bluebird bio's most advanced clinical studies involve Lenti-D, which is designed to treat a rare hereditary neurological disorder known as childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, and LentiGlobin for the treatment of two rare hemoglobinopathies. The study involving Lenti-D is currently in phase 3 trials, while its LentiGlobin study for beta-thalassemia major is also in late-stage studies. LentiGlobin has the potential to become a blockbuster therapy, according to a handful of Wall Street projections.Obviously it's risky for a larger biotech or Big Pharma to consider buying a wholly clinical-stage biotech company, but  or  seem like logical suitors from my perspective.Celgene's interest in CAR-T therapies would give it a viable reason to make an offer. However, it's worth noting that Celgene just dropped $7.2 billion in cash to buy  , meaning it may not be looking for an acquisition as large as bluebird anytime soon. Meanwhile, Celgene also recently narrowed its collaborative efforts with bluebird in favor of a $1 billion, 10-year CAR-T research program with  . Roche, with its oncology pipeline stretching about six-dozen clinical studies deep, may be the most likely of the two destinations for bluebird bio in my opinion.Source: AstraZeneca. + How about a two-for-one special with Intrexon and Ziopharm? After all, I don't think one goes without the other.I'm certainly not the first to propose that Ziopharm Oncology could be a buyout candidate. In June, the  cited an interview with hedge fund manager Joe Barton who proclaimed that Ziopharm could be bought out relatively soon at a substantial premium. The reasoning behind Barton's assertion was the potential for success of Intrexon and Ziopharm's CAR-T immunotherapy development platform. Ziopharm's technology allowing it to control genes paired with Intrexon's RheoSwitch, which can turn genes on and off, could become the standard approach to treating cancer. In short, Interxon's and Ziopharm's approaches go hand in hand.The danger here is that we're talking about a very young pipeline. Aside from Ad-RTS-IL-12, which is being studied in a midstage breast cancer trial, and a phase 1 B-cell malignancy therapy, everything within Ziopharm's pipeline is preclinical or discovery in nature. It means a potential suitor would need to step up and pay an enormous sum for Ziopharm and Intrexon without actually having any revenue-generating therapies for years to come.So who might interested in this potential CAR-T dynamic duo? I'd take a look at U.K.-based  as a potential suitor. In June, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot had this to say when questioned about potentially buying a CAR-T immunotherapy developer:Of course, Soriot also added:It means investors shouldn't be betting on any buyouts solely as their reason for buying any of the aforementioned stocks (to echo what I said earlier), but it doesn't rule out the idea of AstraZeneca making a bid to bring this early but innovative technology into the fold.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Let's consider the three best performing big cap biotech stocks and find out if they remain worth picking up in portfolios. -- up 52.2%Sky-high prices and limited competition have made biotech stocks that target rare diseases, including BioMarin, all the rage, but BioMarin is far from a risk-free bet.The company's got a growing stable of drugs with six-figure price tags targeting uncommon conditions, such as those caused by genetic mutations, but profit remains elusive and that means its $21.4 billion market cap is arguably lofty.Because BioMarin's valuation may be stretched, investors considering BioMarin for portfolios need to think long term and, on that basis, a $20 billion plus market cap may not be as out of whack as it seems.The company's second-quarter sales soared 30.6% higher to $250.5 million and that allowed it to post a net loss per share of $0. 51, which was better than the $0.53 loss that had been expected.If sales continue growing and new therapies, including its promising treatment for Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy that is under consideration for approval by the FDA, get launched, then BioMarin thinks it can achieve non-GAAP profitability in 2017, with profit growth thereafter. If so, then valuation could become less worrisome; however, since we don't know whether the FDA will approve BioMarin's DMD drug, there's a good amount of risk associated with this one that suggests patience is warranted. -- up 46.7%Enthusiasm over Incyte's drug pipeline has helped propel shares higher this year, but for all the potential tucked away in its clinical-stage drugs, it remains a bit of a one-tricky pony.The company's only approved medicine on the market is Jakafi, a Janus Kinase Inhibiting drug, or JAK-inhibitor, that is used to treat myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.Granted, Jakafi's success so far is nothing to sneeze at. In the second quarter, sales of Jakafi jumped 69% year over year to $142 million leading the company to forecast that its full-year sales will total between $560 million and $575 million. However, despite Jakafi's growth, costly pipeline trials are keeping a lid on profit, so like BioMarin, Incyte isn't a cheap stock. Currently, investors are paying 30 times trailing-12-month sales and 156 times next year earnings to own it.Justifying Incyte's sky-high valuation may get easier if phase 3 results expected later this year continue to show that its promising rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib is safe and effective. Trials to date have been very encouraging, and positive news could help clear the way to an FDA filing and approval. If so, then baricitinib would compete in a market worth billions of dollars annually.Although baricitinib news could cause shares to move one way or another, its valuation and uncertainty surrounding baricitinib makes this one company that I'll be watching from the sidelines -- at least for now. -- up 41.2%Since winning approval for its vision restoring drug Eylea, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals shares have been on a tear, returning more than 936% since 2011.Eylea's market share-winning sales growth shows that investor enthusiasm hasn't been misplaced. Eylea, which is used to treat common causes of vision loss including wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, posted global net sales of $993 million in the second quarter, up 50% from a year ago.Eylea's ongoing opportunity for growth -- its main competitor Lucentis is still racking up annualized sales of roughly $4 billion -- makes Regeneron compelling, but  may exist for the company's recently approved cholesterol-busting drug Praluent.Praluent, which was co-developed with  , won FDA approval in July and the two companies wasted no time in slapping an annual price tag of $14,600 on it. Because Praluent could someday treat millions of people at risk of developing heart disease, the drug has billion-dollar blockbuster potential.Although Praluent could face competition from drugs that work similarly, industry watchers think it can still help boost Regeneron's EPS to $14.75 next year, up from $12.19 this year.Because Regeneron already has one top-shelf blockbuster on the market, potentially added another one in Praluent, and its shares sport the best valuation of these three companies, it's the one I'm most interested in still buying. Of course, there's no guarantee that any of these stocks will go higher or that the drugs in the works or hitting the market will live up to expectations.Historically, 90% of drugs entering human trials never make it to market and analysts' track record for correctly estimating the peak sales of those that do is, at best, hit or miss, and for that reason, biotech stocks, including these three companies, are suited for the most risk-tolerant investors. For investors willing to accept the risk of buying biotech companies, it's Regeneron that I think is the most compelling.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Sarepta's shares gained 5.8% following the release of second-quarter results.The company did not generate any revenue in the second quarter of 2015 while the year-ago period reflected revenues of $2.6 million. The lack of revenues in the reported quarter reflects the Jul 2014 expiration of the Marburg U.S. government contract. As per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company was expected to record revenues of $1.1 million.Research and development expenses climbed 41.4% year over year to $29.2 million.

Eteplirsen will come up before the FDA's Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee in late November this year. Priority review would mean a response from the FDA in late February.In addition, Sarepta plans to seek approval for eteplirsen in the EU next year pending discussions with the European Medicines Agency scheduled for year end.Eteplirsen is the company's lead pipeline candidate, being evaluated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).Meanwhile, Sarepta continues to progress with its confirmatory studies - PROMOVI (enrolment expected to be completed by the end of 2015) and Study 4045-301 (Essence - including both patients amenable to either exon 45 skipping or exon 53 skipping).Other eteplirsen focused studies with mutations amenable to exon skipping 51 include Study 4658-204 (enrollment completed) and Study 4658-203 (dosing initiated). While Study 4658-204 is being conducted in primarily non-ambulatory boys up to 21 years of age, Study 4658-203 is being conducted in boys between 4-6 years of age.With the first part of the European dose titration Study 4053-101 in patients with mutations amenable to skipping exon-53 been completed, the company has started enrolment in the second part which includes additional patients with mutations amenable to exon-53 skipping as well as untreated control group with mutations not amenable to exon-53 skipping. Enrollment in this study is expected to be completed by year end.Sarepta also plans to initiate Study 4045-101, which will be a dose titration study in the U.S. for patients up to 21 years of age with mutations amenable to skipping-exon-45 and limited or no ambulation.Sarepta's second-quarter results were encouraging with the company reporting a narrower-than-expected loss. We are encouraged by the company's progress with eteplirsen. Eteplirsen, if developed successfully, would be able to capture a major share of this orphan disease market and its approval would be a huge boost for the company.However, we note that several companies including BioMarin  are working on bringing DMD treatments to the market. BioMarin completed filing for its DMD candidate, drisapersen, at the end of April and could gain approval by Dec 27.

If it does, then BioMarin may chose to use it, rather than sell it, to speed up approval for one of its own drugs. If BioMarin does decide to sell the voucher, there's also no guarantee that prices being paid for them will remain at these levels, or higher.Regardless, as it stands today, the potential to receive this voucher makes BioMarin's purchase price for Prosensa appear to be a much better bargain than it appeared to be originally, and that may make BioMarin shares more attractive to investors.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Management noted that there are about the same number of patients on Naglazyme as there were a year ago, so the jump really is a one-time benefit that can be ignored.Sales of BioMarin's newest drug, Vimizim, which treats a genetic disease called Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA, more than tripled year over year to $53.9 million. Second-quarter sales were only marginally larger than the $50.6 million in the first quarter, but the previous quarter contained about $5 million in stocking. If you back that out, sales increased about 20% quarter over quarter. To hit the low end of management's guidance for Vimizim sales of between $200 million and $220 million, BioMarin needs about 9% quarter-over-quarter growth for the remaining two quarters of the year.Sales of Kuvan increased 28% year over year in the second quarter thanks to more patients starting treatment and those already on Kuvan taking it more regularly.All told, BioMarin revenue was up 32% year over year in the second quarter. But despite the solid increase in revenue, spending was also up considerably -- research and development expenses jumped 47% year over year -- resulting in a larger net loss, $82 million, than the $33.5 million net loss seen in the year-ago quarter.Of course, an $82 million net loss isn't a major issue. A lot of it is non-cash charges, and BioMarin still has almost $1.2 billion in the bank. The biotech isn't in danger of running out of cash anytime soon.In fact, BioMarin is still hoping to show a non-GAAP income in 2017 assuming its Duchene muscular dystrophy drug drisapersen is approved in the U.S. or Europe. Regulatory agencies on both sides of the pond have accepted BioMarin's marketing application; the first inclination about the drisapersen's chances for approval will come when an FDA advisory committee reviews the drug.There's a tentative advisory committee meeting scheduled for November, but the FDA hasn't told management that it's to review drisapersen. The agency may be waiting until it accepts  ' application for its completing drug eteplirsen to finalize the tentative meeting and book the reviews of both drugs back to back.With Sarepta on its heels, BioMarin is preparing to hit the ground running if the FDA gives the biotech a thumbs up later this year. Interestingly, management said that while more than half of Duchene muscular dystrophy patients had been genotyped, many doctors weren't sure which patients would be appropriate for an exon 51 skipping therapy, such as drisapersen or eteplirsen. That shouldn't come as too much of a surprise since there hasn't been much of an incentive for doctors to differentiate genotypes since there aren't any therapies available to treat patients right now. But it means BioMarin is going to have to spend a lot of time educating doctors, something the orphan-drug specialist already has lots of experience doing for its other drugs.Beyond drisapersen, BioMarin has a well stocked pipeline, including vosoritide for the treatment of achondroplasia, a form of short-limbed dwarfism. During the second quarter, BioMarin presented phase 2 data for the 15\u00b5g/kg/daily dose that produced a 50% increase in mean annualized growth velocity, which is enough for children to return to a normal growth rate.BioMarin is working toward taking the 15\u00b5g/kg/daily dose into phase 3 development, but it also recently started testing a 30\u00b5g/kg/daily dose of vosoritide that it hopes could be used for patients that start treatment late and need to catch up.The biotech is also ready to start testing BMN 270, a gene therapy, for treating hemophilia. With all the competition in the space, BioMarin's ability to get in the clinic first will give it a distinct advantage since gene therapies will hopefully result in cures, so patients will only require one treatment.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"... But you'll probably just call it \"how I made my millions.\" Don't be too late to the party --  when the Web goes dark.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because BMRN is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BMRN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 52 cents per share for BMRN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 53 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BMRN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.89% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that BMRN has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for BioMarin Pharmaceutical, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 52.83%.Recently launched Vimizim should continue performing well with the company launching the product in additional markets and identifying more Morquio A patients. At the time of reporting first quarter results, BioMarin had raised its guidance for Vimizim to $200-$220 million from $170-$200 million.Other key products, including Naglazyme, Aldurazyme and Firdapse should continue to perform well. Naglazyme should continue to grow on the back of increasing demand resulting from patient growth and high rates of compliance.Headwinds remain in the form of negative currency movements as well as lumpy order patterns in Latin America - unpredictable order patterns are expected to continue in Latin America throughout the year. Meanwhile, Kuvan is expected to grow this year, albeit at a slower pace compared to 2014.Our proven model shows that BioMarin is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.89%.

Revenues were primarily driven by solid growth of Vimizim, Naglazyme and Kuvan.Vimizim contributed $53.9 million to total revenue, up 6.5% sequentially. Commercial patient demand grew 29% sequentially.Kuvan revenues increased 28.1% year over year to $60.1 million. This increase is attributable to increasing patients and high rates of compliance. Naglazyme sales increased 13% year over year to $111.1 million benefiting from a major order in Latin America.However, this trend is not likely to continue in the coming quarters. BioMarin receives royalties from its partner Sanofi  on Aldurazyme. Aldurazyme royalties (excluding transfer revenues) amounted to $23.5 million, down 3.7% year over year.Firdapse revenues came in at $3.7 million, down 19.6% year over year.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased 46.6% to $157.9 million. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were up 49.1% from the year-ago quarter to $101.5 million.BioMarin continues to progress with its pipeline. The company expects a response from the FDA on its experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment, drisapersen by Dec 27, 2015. Meanwhile, a CHMP opinion is expected in the first half of 2016 followed by a final decision from the European Commission in the third quarter of 2016. A positive response from the FDA would allow the company to launch drisapersen in early 2016 in the U.S.During the quarter, the company had reported encouraging data from a phase II study on vosoritide (15 micrograms/kilogram/daily dose) for the treatment of achondroplasia. A 30 micrograms per kilogram daily dose is being evaluated currently. BioMarin is looking to enter discussions with regulatory authorities regarding pivotal studies with the 15mcg dose - the company is looking to start the pivotal studies in the first half of 2016.BioMarin continues to expect total revenues of $850 million to $880 million in 2015. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $883 million is above the company's guidance range. While Vimizim sales are expected in the range of $200 million to $220 million.Naglazyme revenues are expected in the range of $315 million to 340 million. The company continues to expect Kuvan sales in the range of $210 million to $230 million. Negative currency movement is expected to impact revenues by about $30 - $40 million.The company continues to expect SG&A and R&D expenditure in the range of $360 million - $395 million and $610 million - $640 million, respectively.BioMarin's second quarter results were solid with the company beating on the top - and bottom-line. However, results benefited from the Naglazyme order in Latin America - a situation not expected to be repeated in the remainder of the year. The company continues to work on boosting Vimizim sales. Reimbursement and expansion in additional territories including Turkey and Japan will drive sales.Meanwhile, the company has an important regulatory event coming up with the FDA expected to decide on drisapersen's approval status by year end. The company also has multiple pipeline-related news and several data readouts lined up for the rest of the year.BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

BioMarin now expects to finish enrolling patients in the first quarter of 2016 with results expected by the end of 2016.The successful development of talazoparib and subsequent approval would give patients who have exhausted therapeutic options an additional treatment option in the salvage setting.BioMarin also provided updated guidance on the pivotal phase III, EMBRACA study.

The overall goal of the process is to get new drugs to patients faster. Fast Track status will allow the company to make a rolling submission of its new drug application for the candidate and communicate with the FDA frequently throughout the development process, thereby expediting its review. Additionally, Fast Track status will make the candidate eligible for priority review or accelerated approval on fulfillment of certain criteria.Presently, CAT-1004 is being evaluated in a phase I/II study (MoveDMD) in boys aged between 4-7 years with DMD (any confirmed mutation).We are encouraged by the FDA granting Fast Track designation to CAT-1004, which will expedite the development process of the candidate. The candidate also enjoys orphan drug status in the U.S.Considering the lack of FDA-approved therapies for this rare and debilitating disease, there is a strong unmet need for drugs for the treatment of DMD. Meanwhile, we note that several companies including BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  and Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.  among others are developing treatments for DMD.Apart from CAT-1004, the company is also developing treatments targeting serious lipid disorders.Investors looking for a well-positioned stock in the health care sector may consider AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  , carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["t's been a busy week for the biotech sector, with companies like BioMarin  , Vical  , Epizyme  and Amgen  presenting data on their pipeline candidates.

The rolling NDA submission which began on May 20 immediately following the completion of the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA the day before was completed on Jun 26, 2015.Sarepta is seeking priority review, which could shorten the review period from the standard 10 months to just 6 months. We note that eteplirsen already enjoys Fast Track and orphan status in the U.S.Eteplirsen is the company's lead pipeline candidate. DMD, a devastating and debilitating disease, is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 3,500 boys born across the world. There is significant unmet need for DMD treatments. Once successfully developed and approved, eteplirsen has the potential to address up to 13% of the total DMD population.The NDA submission, however, puts Sarepta about two months behind BioMarin  , which completed filing for its DMD candidate, drisapersen, at the end of April. Meanwhile, BioMarin announced that the FDA has granted priority review to drisapersen with an FDA action date of Dec 27, 2015. BioMarin could have a head start if approval comes on schedule. With the FDA informing BioMarin that its regulatory application will come up before an advisory panel, chances are high that eteplirsen will also be reviewed by an FDA advisory panel.In concurrence with the completed eteplirsen NDA submission, Sarepta entered into a credit and security agreement with Midcap Financial to procure up to $40 million in debt financing.

The average earnings surprise over the last four quarters is -10.28%.Vertex, which had a strong presence in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) market earlier, is now entirely focused on the cystic fibrosis (CF) market. The company's flagship product, Kalydeco, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatory (CFTR) potentiator, is approved for the treatment of CF in patients (of certain age groups) who have specific genetic mutations in their CFTR gene.Vertex reported a 31% increase in Kalydeco sales in the first quarter of 2015 from the year-ago period. Sales benefited from additional use in the U.S. as well as ex-U.S. markets. Rapid uptake in patients in Australia following the completion of reimbursement discussions in late 2014 as well as uptake among patients with the R117H mutation should continue to drive Kalydeco sales.Vertex expects Kalydeco revenues of $560 - $580 million in 2015. There should be rapid uptake in Australia where more than 200 children and adults with CF are eligible for treatment.The guidance also assumes the completion of reimbursement discussions for gating mutations in certain European countries. Sales should also benefit from Kalydeco's label expansion in the U.S. for the 2 - 5 years age group.Vertex expects the number of patients eligible for Kalydeco to increase to about 3,900 by year end.Meanwhile, operating expenses will go up as the company works on the launch of Orkambi (the Kalydeco-lumacaftor combination) which gained approval in Jul 2015.Orkambi's approval is a major boost for the company and will remain a key focus area on the second quarter call. Orkambi's approval provides the company with access to a huge number of eligible patients and should boost CF franchise sales significantly.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Vertex is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) to be able to beat earnings. That is not the case here as you will see below. : The  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% since the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 76 cents per share. : Vertex carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Data from the study revealed that the candidate showed a favorable safety profile and efficacy at the 15 ug/kg/ daily dose.Children who received a daily dose of 15 ug/kg showed a mean increase of 50% in their annualized growth velocity compared to their annualized prior 6-month natural history baseline growth velocity.

BioMarin Pharmaceutical is one of the most successful developers of therapies for rare disease, and the results from this trial suggest that BMN-111 could end up being yet another important win for the company.BMN-111 is a stabilized formulation of C-type natriuretic peptide, a naturally occurring human peptide that helps promote bone growth.In this phase 2 study, 10 achondroplasia patients taking a 15 microgram per kilogram dose per day of BMN-111 showed an average increase of 50% in annualized growth velocity versus their prior six month annualized growth velocity. That's enough of an improvement, if it's maintained, for BioMarin to suggest that BMN-111 could allow the roughly 24,000 patients under 18 with this condition to resume a normalized growth rate.BioMarin plans to sit down with regulators and create a plan to move the 15 microgram dose of BMN-111 into phase 3 trials that, if successful, could lead to an eventual FDA approval. BioMarin also intends to explore whether or not a higher dose of BMN-111 could enable \"catch-up\" growth in the event of delayed treatment.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

(Symbol: BMRN) priced a 8,500,000 share secondary stock offering at $93.25 per share. Buyers in that offering made a considerable investment into the company, expecting that their investment would go up over the course of time and based on early trading on Tuesday, the stock is now 29.5% above the offering price.Investors who did not participate in the offering but would be a buyer of BMRN at a cheaper price, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2016 put at the $90 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $5.10. That would result in a cost basis of $84.90 per share before broker commissions in the scenario where the contract is exercised. If the contract is never exercised, the put seller would still keep the premium, which represents a 5.7% return against the $90.00 purchase commitment, or a 9.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Secondaries can often present buying opportunities for bullish investors interested in purchasing shares, because the sudden extra supply of stock tends to require that the offering be priced at an attractive discount to where the stock had previously been trading before the offering announcement. That can also introduce near-term volatility which improves the premiums a put seller can achieve. Selling a put does not give an investor access to BMRN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.

Drisapersen became a part of BioMarin's pipeline following its Jan 2015 acquisition of Prosensa.According to information provided by the company in its press release, DMD is estimated to affect about 1 in every 3,500 live male births with about 20,000 new cases being diagnosed globally every year.

In fact, the ODA catalyzed the development of more than 400 new treatments for rare diseases in the United States alone.Source: Wikimedia Commons.The trick has been that the ODA confers a number of significant benefits to drugmakers, such as extended market exclusivity, tax credits, accelerated regulatory reviews, waivers of regulatory fees, and the ability to apply for grants from the Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health to offset development costs.As a result, the orphan-drug space has absolutely blossomed and is currently on track to grow to a stunning  . Put simply, orphan drugs are now one of the largest and fastest-growing markets within the entire pharmaceutical industry.What's truly staggering, however, is that we've still barely made a dent in the immense rare-disease landscape. As our understanding of the genetics of disease has improved, we've come to realize that there are literally thousands of extremely rare disorders, many of which have horrifying complications that doctors are simply unable to do much about at present.With this in mind, here is a look at three \"ultra-rare\" diseases with no approved treatments -- despite their nightmarish symptoms -- that clearly illustrate the vast unmet medical need for orphan indications in general.The mascot for ultra-rare Still's disease, which afflicts less than 1 in 1,000,000 adults, is a dragon. Why? Because one of the most common symptoms is a daily fever that often exceeds 104 degrees F, making your body feel as if it's on fire.Still's disease is believed to be an extreme form of arthritis. It was first described in children but is now known to occur in adults, although on a far less frequent basis. The disease is characterized by high fevers, salmon-colored rashes, and extreme inflammation in the joints.Source: www.stillsdisease.org.Fortunately, some of the biological-based drugs indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, such as  's Enbrel and  's Remicade, do provide symptom relief in a decent portion of patients. Nevertheless, there are no truly disease-modifying treatments available, meaning that those afflicted with Still's remain locked in a lifelong struggle to control their devastating symptoms.Berlin breakage syndrome, or Nijmegen breakage syndrome, is an extremely rare autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by an abnormally small head, short stature, a poor immune system, and, worst of all, a predisposition to blood-based cancers. Studies have shown that about 40% of Berlin breakage patients end up developing some form of fatal blood-based disorder.Source: Creative Commons.Because Berlin breakage patients also have a compromised immune system, they are prone to respiratory infections that are frequently fatal.On the treatment front, there's little that can be done for these patients, aside from being monitored by an immunologist and an oncologist. However, the disease does appear amenable to a gene-therapy approach that would correct the mutation in the underlying NBN gene that's responsible for the syndrome.Can't sleep? Perhaps you have what is known as fatal familial insomnia -- a super-rare genetically based disease that's known to affect only 25 families in the entire world. This fatal sleep disorder is caused by a mutated protein in the brain that makes it impossible for people to sleep. In fact, sleep aids actually make the condition worse.Source: Flickr user Alyssa L. Miller.The odd part is that it tends to manifest later in life. So a person wakes up one day and then never sleeps again. Death comes about a year and a half later.Although vitamin therapy and sensory deprivation have helped in some cases, the disease is always fatal, and an effective treatment remains elusive.The pharmaceutical industry has made great strides in advancing important new treatments for dozens of rare and ultra-rare diseases over the past three decades.  , for instance, has successfully brought five products to market for rare diseases, such as Aldurazyme for the life-threatening lysosomal disorder mucopolysaccharidosis I. And the company now has an experimental treatment, drisapersen,  for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.Nevertheless,the scope of the problem, as these examples illustrate, is astounding.  'sDr. Brenda Cooperstone perhaps summed up the problem best at the World Orphan Drug Congress in 2013, stating that it could take hundreds of years to tackle the scourge of rare diseases at our current rate of innovation.To speed up the process of discovery and drug development, pharma companies far and wide have been teaming up to collaborate on a diversity of rare conditions. For example,  joined forces with the rare disease specialist  recently to develop luspatercept as a potential treatment for two rare blood diseases, namely beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.But the sheer size of the unmet medical need in this area is so monstrous that new, innovative solutions will need to be brought to bear before we see any significant progress.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

The key to the drugmaker's success has been its ability to identify promising clinical candidates and subsequently use its tremendous experience to bring those drugs to market.Source: Flickr via user Partij van de Arbeid.That's why many onlookers were absolutely baffled by BioMarin's $840 million buyout of Prosensa last year for its experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, drug, drisapersen.Drisapersen failed to meet its primary endpoint of stabilizing performance on the so-called six-minute walking test in a pivotal late-stage study, causing  to return the drug's rights to Prosensa.Prosensa, alone and underfunded, struggled to find a glimmer of hope following Glaxo's decision to end their DMD partnership.After combing through the data, however, the struggling biotech announced that the drug appears to be effective in younger patients, especially if it's administered over a long period of time. This nugget was apparently enough for BioMarin to risk nearly $1 billion on drisapersen.The Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, recently agreed to formally review drisapersen, meaning that BioMarin's risky bet may pay off.Last week, the FDA also gave the green light to  to file a rolling New Drug Application for its competing DMD drug, eteplirsen. Although the details of the filing haven't been made public yet, there is a good chance that the same advisory committee will review both drugs sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.The FDA's decision to review eteplirsen, on an accelerated basis, is somewhat out of character because it required Prosensa to complete a late-stage study for drisapersen. And the agency previously denied Sarepta's request for an accelerated review because eteplirsen's midstage study enrolled only 12 patients.So BioMarin and Sarepta investors alike might be wondering what's going on at the FDA.The FDA is under tremendous pressure from DMD advocates to approve at least one of these two exon-skipping therapies, given that there are no treatments on the market for this fatal disease.Drisapersen's regulatory review, though, hinges on the mere  that it  be effective in younger boys. Put simply, drisapersen's clinical benefit is still very much in question, and it won't be clarified until BioMarin completes another ongoing late-stage study.Eteplirsen, unfortunately, is in the same boat in many ways. Because of the small sample size of eteplirsen's midstage study, the drug's observed clinical benefits in terms of the six-minute walk test and pulmonary function may ultimately not hold up in a larger confirmatory trial. Indeed, drisapersen's midstage results looked promising as well, but this therapeutic signal was lost in a larger trial.So the FDA is basically reviewing two drugs that have yet to prove their ability to improve clinical outcomes. That's an unusual situation to say the least.A head-to-head comparison of the two drugs reveals that eteplirsen has a major advantage over drisapersen.Specifically, drisapersen reportedly induced a handful of serious adverse events -- namely kidney toxicity -- that required some patients to be hospitalized. Eteplirsen's safety profile, on the other hand, is basically unblemished.This safety issue may loom large if an advisory committee is convened -- which is almost certainly going to be the case.In short, drisapersen's efficacy is questionable at best, but its safety profile is somewhat concerning. The FDA therefore might favor eteplirsen simply because it has a cleaner safety record.The need for some form of pharmaceutical intervention for DMD is unquestionable. The FDA is thus being put in the unenviable position of considering two half-baked experimental drugs, so to speak.In the long run, drisapersen and eteplirsen may prove to be effective DMD treatments for particular types of patients. But the clinical trial process is definitely being short-circuited, to some degree, by the overwhelming need for a pharmaceutical option in the fight against this deadly disease.Viewed this way, the FDA may err on the side of caution by granting a conditional approval for eteplirsen because of its superior safety profile. That would give BioMarin the time it needs to formally test the hypothesis that drisapersen works in certain patients.The problem for BioMarin, however, is that an eteplirsen approval could make drisapersen obsolete. Drisapersen's only real competitive advantage is its first-mover status. Eteplirsen, by all accounts, should turn out to be more effective and safer than drisapersen.When BioMarin bought Prosensa, the overarching thesis seemed to be that eteplirsen would need to complete a lengthy late-stage study before approval. BioMarin's vast resources and experience would thus give it a real shot at getting drisapersen approved well before eteplirsen.In the wake of the FDA's decision to review eteplirsen, that scenario now looks dubious. And investors shouldn't be shocked if eteplirsen is  drug the FDA ends up approving later this year. In other words, BioMarin may have bet on the wrong experimental DMD therapy.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

During his tenure as the head of the Quantum Fund, for instance, he was able to generate annual returns in excess of 30% year after year.Kite's shares have since  , fueled by the early-stage success of the company's lead clinical candidate, KTE-C19, indicated as a therapy for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Sarepta's shares, on the other hand,  because of management's inability to advance the company's experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, drug, eteplirsen, toward a regulatory filing with the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Although the FDA finally agreed to review the drug last week, sending shares soaring, Soros unloaded his entire position in the fourth-quarter of 2014.The reason he initiated these speculative positions in the first place, however, probably has more to do with what was going on  these stocks -- rather than something intrinsically compelling about these companies in particular.Kite, for instance, is an immuno-oncology company, which is a field that has been absolutely bonkers since  (NYSE: BMY) and  's (NYSE: MRK) brought their potent cancer-fighting PD-1 inhibitors to market in nearly record time.Indeed, numerous early stage immuno-oncology companies have seen their share prices lift off into the stratosphere in the past year:In a similar manner, Sarepta is working in an extremely hot field in biopharma -- namely, treatments for rare diseases.Over the last decade or so, rare disease drugmakers have frequently garnered massive premiums via buyouts -- even while their flagship product candidates are still going through clinical trials. (NASDAQ: BMRN), for example, snapped up Sarepta's main rival Prosensa for a hefty premium last year, despite the fact that its DMD drug candidate essentially flamed out in late-stage testing.Armed with this insight, these two high-risk positions appear to be a Soros' means of exploiting the high level of investor interest in the areas of immuno-oncology and rare diseases.As Sarepta's cliff-diving share price illustrates, though, biotech stocks can be extremely poor vehicles for trying to play overarching trends in the market. After all, one company's breakthrough in a given area of biopharma by no means guarantees success for others.Per the recent 13F filings with the SEC, we learned that Soros again tried to apply his market psychology approach to a burgeoning area of biotech, gene therapy, only to get stung by the harsh realities of the industry.Gene therapy stocks have generated significant interest among investors ever since  (NASDAQ: BLUE) reported that its second-generation gene therapy, LentiGlobin BB305, was a safe and effective treatment for patients suffering from the rare blood disorder called beta-thalassemia.According to the company, the first four patients receiving the therapy have been transfusion-free for several months, meaning that it looks like functional cure for beta-thalassemia.The company's share price has skyrocketed higher as a result:Despite this major breakthrough, gene therapy as a whole has a long history of disappointing investors and clinicians alike.And Soros' gene therapy pick during the first-quarter of 2015,  , was no exception.The Soros Fund bought 120,000 shares of Celladon ahead of the midstage data release for its flagship product candidate, Mydicar, as a potential treatment for systolic heart failure.Mydicar's top line data release was nevertheless an utter catastrophe. Specifically, the gene-therapy showed no clinical benefit whatsoever in heart failure patients, causing Celladon's shares to collapse in breath-taking fashion:Soros can afford to take out high-risk positions that give him access to emerging trends because of the enormous size of his hedge fund. At the end of the day, the fund can lose a few million on a single stock without much of a consequence. And as the Kite and Sarepta examples demonstrate, his fund, on balance, comes out ahead because it is able to play dozens of trends simultaneously.The same probably can't be said for most retail investors, though. Having a position lose 80% of its value in short order tends to be painful, and it's not easy to efficiently spread the risk across several areas with limited funds.That's why it's generally a better idea to stick to companies with approved products, solid management, and growing cash flows. These particular traits can see companies through nearly any kind of market, and allow investors to avoid the costly mistake of losing a large chunk of their capital by swinging for the fences, so to speak.So, while the temptation to follow investing gurus like Soros into potential home run stocks might be extremely enticing, you have to keep in mind that they are able to manage risk in ways that are simply unavailable to most investors. And as the factory of sadness known as Celladon shows, the risk with these types of stocks is all too real.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

Regulatory updates include events like filing of marketing applications for a candidate or applications for updating product information, acceptance of these applications for review by the regulatory agencies, reviews by advisory panels and finally, a response from the regulatory agency regarding the approval status.Late last week,  's  biopharmaceutical business, Merck Serono, announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency granted a positive opinion on an update to the product information for Kuvan.Kuvan is already approved in Europe for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninemia occurring either due to phenylketonuria (PKU) in patients aged 4 years and above (who are responsive to Kuvan) or tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency in patients of all ages.Based on the results of the phase IIIb SPARK study on Kuvan, the CHMP recommended that Kuvan can be used for the treatment of PKU patients below 4 years of age, who are responsive to such a therapy.We note that the European Commission (EC) generally takes the CHMP's opinion into account while making a decision regarding the approval of a candidate. A positive opinion from the CHMP increases the odds of receiving a nod from the EC for updating Kuvan's product information. Upon approval, Kuvan's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) will be updated to include details on extended use of the drug.According to Merck KGaA, PKU affects approximately 1 out of 10,000 newborns in Europe. Given that no therapy is yet approved in Europe for the treatment of this disease in children less than 4 years of age, a potential label update will increase Kuvan's eligible patient population.We note that in 2014, Kuvan generated net revenue of $203 million, up 21% year over year. It is marketed by Merck KGaA outside the U.S., Canada and Japan, while BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  commercializes the drug in the U.S. and Canada (under the trade name Biopten). Kuvan is sold by Asubio Pharma in Japan.

BioMarin has one of the most robust rare disease product line-ups and pipelines, and it's frequently been the target of M&A chatter.Unlike Synageva, BioMarin already generates revenue thanks to a slate of high-priced therapies targeting ultra-rare conditions. The company's top seller is Naglazyme, an enzyme replacement therapy that treats MPS VI, costs $450,000 per year, and had sales of $78.2 million in the first quarter.BioMarin also markets Kuvan, a treatment for PKU that had sales of $50.2 million in Q1, and Aldurazyme, a therapy used to treat MPS I that had first-quarter sales of $18.2 million.BioMarin's most intriguing drug, however, could be Vimizim, a therapy for Morquio A that costs $380,000 per year and that won FDA approval a year ago.Vimizim's global roll-out has been so strong that first-quarter sales of it jumped 37% quarter over quarter to $50.6 million, prompting BioMarin to bump up its full-year forecast for Vimizim sales to between $200 and $220 million from prior expectations of between $170 million and $200 million.BioMarin thinks these drugs will combine to produce sales of between $840 million to $870 million this year, up from $751 million in 2014, and that could attract an acquirer, but it's BioMarin's pipeline that could make for a Syngeva-like price tag.BioMarin has just filed for FDA approval of drisapersen, a novel exon-skipping therapy that could help 13% of Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy patients, and an EU filing for approval should be coming soon.BioMarin is also developing a PARP inhibitor, BMN-673, to battle cancer in people with a specific genetic mutation, and a therapy for Pompe disease, and results from a phase 2 trial studying BMN-111 in achonodroplasia are expected to be released shortly, too.Source: BioMarin Therapeutic.BioMarin's pipeline potential makes it one of the most attractive players in the rare and ultra-rare drug space, but that pipeline could also present a roadblock to a sale. Investors already value BioMarin at more than $18 billion, and it could be tough for an acquirer and BioMarin to agree on the peak sales potential for these drugs, many of which target patient populations that are hard to quantify. As a result, it might be tough to negotiate a price that both companies could agree on.Amicus Therapeutics is another  rare disease biotech company that is much smaller than BioMarin.Amicus doesn't have any drugs on the market yet, but it does plan to file for U.S. and EU approval of migalastat in the second half of this year.Migalastat is an oral drug that could treat up to half of Fabry disease patients. The drug works differently from enzyme replacement therapies, which are the current standard of care for Fabry disease. That has Amicus thinking that migalastat could eventually be used as both a monotherapy and in combination with commonly prescribed ERTs, such as  's Fabrazyme or  's Replagel, two drugs that had a combined $990 million in annual sales last year, at current euro to dollar exchange rates.In addition to migalastat, Amicus plans to move its own enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of Pompe disease into clinical trials by year-end. If successful, this treatment could end up competing against Sanofi's Myozyme, an ERT with sales of $610 million in 2014.Amicus is spending a great deal of money this year in anticipation of a migalastat approval, and its spending will head higher as pre-clinical therapies move into human trials. That means losses are likely to remain high for the company. In the first quarter, Amicus' operating expenses totaled $24.1 million, up from $16.1 million a year ago, leading to Amicus reporting a net loss of $24.3 million last quarter.Fortunately, the company appears to have enough cash on hand to handle these rising expenses -- for now. Exiting the first quarter, Amicus had $151.6 million in cash and little debt, and that has Amicus thinking it has enough cash to last through the middle of 2016. BioMarin is arguably the gold standard in the rare disease category, but it's already pretty pricey. Amicus' $1 billion market cap means it's far cheaper than BioMarin, but Amicus doesn't have any approved products on the market (yet), and its pipeline is smaller, so it's more risky.Since acquisition rumors in this industry are common, and they often don't pan out, investors will want to consider these stocks based on their fundamentals, not their buyout potential. In both cases, I think these companies could as easily succeed as stand-alone companies, and that could make them great stocks to own in long-term portfolios.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

Adjusted EPS also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.6%. Even amid a difficult foreign exchange environment, the company registered year-over-year earnings growth on the back of better-than-expected revenue and profit.However, including certain one-time items, the company reported net income of $8.4 million or 25 cents per share, reflecting a massive year-over-year improvement of 280.1% or 257.1%, respectively.Total revenue during the reported quarter increased 8.7% to $233.7 million, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $230 million. Double-digit growth observed in Integra's global Dural Repair, Skin and Wound sales primarily benefited the top line in the quarter.Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 7.3%, primarily driven by higher regenerative product sales. This marked the second quarter in a row with more than 5% growth in organic revenues, which also makes it the highest revenue earning quarter in the recent past.With effect from the first quarter of 2015, the company is reporting its operations in three global business segments - Specialty Surgical Solutions, Orthopedic and Tissue Technologies and Spine.Revenues from Specialty Surgical Solutions segment increased 10.1% year over year to $140.1 million. Within this segment, global sales from the Dual Repair franchise improved more than 20% on account of DuraSeal and sales in new markets in the international market. Precision Tools and Instrument sales increased in low single digits (excluding MicroFrance) while Neuro Critical Care sales rose in low double digits.Revenues from Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segment increased 12.4% to $61.4 million. Within this segment, sales from regenerative technologies franchise increased over 20% on the back of higher demand for Integra's broad portfolio of skin and nerve products. Within upper extremities, shoulder and wrist sales also increased in double digits. However, sales in lower extremities declined on a year-over-year basis.Revenues from the Spine segment dropped 3.1% to $32.2 million in the reported quarter. Within this segment, hardware sales declined in mid single digits, partially offset by roughly flat sales in orthobiologics.Gross margin improved 120 basis points (bps) to 62.9% in the first quarter owing to higher organic sales.While selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.3% to $114.1 million in the quarter, research and development expenses remained almost unchanged at $12.6 million. Adjusted operating margin (excluding amortization of intangible asset) improved 320 bps to 8.7%.Integra Lifesciences exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $79.9 million, compared to $72 million as of Dec 31, 2014. In the reported quarter, net cash flow from operating activities was $31.6 million, up 181% from the year-ago equivalent of $11.3 million.Free cash flow in the reported quarter was $22.7 million, representing a huge improvement from the year ago free cash outflow of $0.1 million.Integra Lifesciences has raised its full-year 2015 outlook for both revenues and adjusted EPS. The company now expects full year 2015 revenues in the range of $965-$980 million, with annualized growth of 4-5.5% (up from the previous guided $960-$980 million representing sales growth of 3.5-5.5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in 2015 is pegged at $974 million, which lies within the company's guided range.The company now expects 2015 adjusted EPS in the band of $3.15-$3.33 with annualized growth of 6-13% (up from the previous range of $3.05-$3.23 representing annualized growth of 3-9%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is pegged at $3.19, within the company's guided range.For second-quarter 2015, Integra Lifesciences expects revenues in the range of $240-$245 million, which assumes an organic growth rate of roughly 5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $242 million, which lies within the company's guided range.For the second quarter, Integra expects adjusted EPS to increase slightly on a sequential basis over the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is pegged at 74 cents.Meanwhile, management continues to expect the spin-off of the company's spine and orthobiologics business into SeaSpine to be over in the second half of 2015.We are impressed with Integra Lifesciences' first-quarter 2015 financial results which squarely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Year-over-year growth on both fronts is also indicative of the company's healthy growth via organic and inorganic means across all its segments.Management believes strong execution within Integra's regenerative product lines, including dural repair and skin, resulted in the better-than-expected first quarter results. Management is also upbeat about the company's acquisition of MetaSurg's foot and ankle product line last December, which performed on par with expectation. Currently, management expects its revenues to ramp up in the second half of 2015, owing to this buyout.However, management is concerned about the unfavorable foreign currency fluctuation that can considerably hamper Integra's financial performance in the upcoming quarters. We believe the company will be successful in overcoming these difficulties soon, buoyed by new product launches and an efficient management team.Currently, Integra carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Ampyra revenues, however, declined 15.9% on a sequential basis.Acorda is currently facing several patent challenges from generic companies looking to bring their generic versions of Ampyra to market.

Higher R&D spend reflects investment in phase III studies on dalfampridine and CVT-301.Acorda is currently evaluating a twice-daily formulation of Ampyra in a phase III study for post-stroke deficits. Additionally, Acorda expects to start a second phase I study on rHIgM22 for remyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) in the second quarter.Acorda is also enrolling patients in the phase III study on CVT-301 for relief of OFF episodes in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.Meanwhile, an update on Plumiaz nasal spray for the treatment of patients with epilepsy who experience cluster seizures should be out within a month.

Sarepta had received an updated guidance from the FDA regarding eteplirsen last October.Sarepta plans to present additional data to the European Medicines Agency once data compilation for the FDA is complete. Thereafter, the company plans to seek approval for eteplirsen in the EU.Meanwhile, Sarepta continues to progress on additional studies on eteplirsen and other exon skipping pipeline candidates for DMD. Two new studies on eteplirsen are currently enrolling patients - one a confirmatory study (PROMOVI) in ambulatory patients and the other (study 4658-204) in advanced-stage patients including patients who are non-ambulant.The exon-53 study (on SRP-4053) has commenced in Europe. The company expects to completed enrollment in this study by the end of 2015.In addition to this, another confirmatory study 4045-301 including both patients amenable to either exon 45 skipping or exon 53 skipping is on track for initiation in the U.S. by mid-15 while EU enrollment is planned for late 2015 or early 2016.Sarepta's first-quarter results were disappointing with the company reporting a wider-than- expected loss and no revenues.

Last year, the pharma giant posted nearly $50 billion in annual sales across six different core therapeutic areas.Its jaw-dropping size can nevertheless act as a major impediment for investors trying to get a handle on the drugmaker's forward-looking prospects. A recent clinical update, for instance, revealed that Pfizer has a staggering 88 ongoing clinical trials in total, and 30 late-stage experimental candidates.Source: PfizerAn unfortunate consequence of this clinical trial frenzy, however, is that many promising clinical candidates fail to get noticed by the investing community. With that in mind, let's take a deeper look at two of Pfizer's experimental therapies for rare diseases that deserve far more attention than they are receiving at present.Unbeknownst to many investors, Pfizer is developing a myostatin inhibitor, PF-06252616, indicated as a potential treatment for the rare but devastating muscle wasting disease known Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD. The drugmaker started enrolling patients in a midstage study for the drug late last year, and the trial should be completed in January 2017.Source: imgbuddy.comEven though this experimental drug is a ways off from hitting the market, its staggering commercial potential should hold investors' collective attention for the long haul.Because there are no approved treatments for DMD in the U.S. and PF-06252616 might help to improve clinical outcomes in a wide swatch of DMD subtypes, there is good reason to believe it could generate sales in the multibillion dollar range upon approval.After all,  and  ' most promising competing exon-skipping therapies target only about 13% of the DMD population, and this small fraction of the DMD population is already believed to have the power to generate around $500 million a year in peak combined sales for the two drugs.Another interesting tidbit is that Pfizer's clinical candidate wouldn't necessarily compete with either of these exon-skipping therapies, if they are approved later this year. In fact, it might be used in conjunction with one of these drugs to further slow the progression of this fatal condition.Huntington's disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes the breakdown of nerves in the brain, leading to a whole host of terrifying symptoms like severe depression, psychosis, and degenerative motor skills.Source: WikimediaUnfortunately, there are no approved treatments specifically for Huntington's, and most current pharmacotherapies used in the clinic today simply aim to alleviate symptoms arising from the disease.Pfizer is presently exploring the safety and efficacy of its PDE10 Inhibitor, PF-02545920, as a treatment for motor impairment associated with Huntington's. Specifically, the drug is presently in a midstage study that is expected to readout in the third-quarter of 2016.Why is PF-02545920 worth keeping tabs on? This clinical candidate has the potential to be a game-changer for this rare condition, given that its therapeutic goal is to improve motor function. And if successful, it would essentially have the market all to itself.That said, Huntington's has proven to be extremely resistant to any form of pharmaceutical intervention, which is why numerous companies have completely abandoned their clinical programs for this disease over the years.So, PF-02545920 should definitely be considered a long shot. But the high unmet medical need in Huntington's means that any effective new therapy could rapidly turn into a blockbuster -- making PF-02545920 one of the pharma giant's more interesting clinical candidates for rare diseases.Pfizer's rare disease products often play second fiddle to the company's higher profile drugs in cardiovascular/metabolic care and oncology. However, they probably shouldn't be overlooked given that orphan drugs are undoubtedly going to be a major growth platform for the drugmaker in the decades to come.While the two clinical candidates for rare diseases mentioned above may both ultimately fail in clinical trials, they do demonstrate Pfizer's deep interest in the orphan drug arena. And why investors and the Street alike need to pay more attention to the drugmaker's concerted efforts to combat a diverse range of rare medical conditions.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

In 2013, most onlookers believed the FDA was willing to review eteplirsen, even though the drug had only completed a small midstage study at the time.Unfortunately for investors and DMD patients alike, the agency said such a filing would be premature, causing shares to crater by over 70% in a single day. Since then, Sarepta's shares have struggled mightily to regain their former glory.So, investors are undoubtedly cheering the FDA's change of heart today, especially since it could end up becoming a major catalyst for the stock as eteplirsen barrels toward its regulatory review. : As an orphan drug company with a major late-stage asset like eteplirsen, Sarepta certainly could turn into a red hot buyout target moving forward. After all, orphan drug specialists like Prosensa, NPS Pharmaceuticals, and ViroPharma were all gobbled up by larger pharmas recently, and their respective product pipelines were arguably far weaker than Sarepta's.In my view, Sarepta would be a great pick up for either  or  .

We expect investors to react positively to the news.We note that Sarepta's path to gaining regulatory approval for eteplirsen has not been smooth. The FDA had issued an updated guidance regarding additional data requirement last October, which led to a delay in the company's filing plans in the U.S. from year-end 2014 to mid-2015.Eteplirsen is the company's lead pipeline candidate, being developed for the treatment of DMD. DMD, a devastating and debilitating disease, is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 3,500 boys born across the world. There is significant unmet need for DMD treatments. Once successfully developed and approved, eteplirsen has the potential to address up to 13% of the total DMD population.We remind investors that Sarepta is not the only company working on the development of DMD treatments. BioMarin  has a late-stage DMD candidate, drisapersen. BioMarin is way ahead of Sarepta having completed its rolling NDA submission for drisapersen. Other companies developing therapies targeting the DMD market include Pfizer  among others.Sarepta currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Its share price, though, has struggled since the launch of rival drugs late last year, shown by the chart below:The market apparently believes that the flood of forthcoming hep C treatments, and a dwindling market in Western nations, will ultimately erode Gilead's sales in this space.While I'm not in total agreement with the market's pessimistic outlook, I do think there are better, albeit riskier, biotech stocks that investors should consider adding to their portfolio. Here is a look at one high-risk, high-reward biotech that could lead to jaw-dropping gains over the next year. and its exon-skipping Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, treatment called eteplirsen were once the darlings of Wall Street. After reporting some highly encouraging midstage data showing the drug increased levels of a key protein, dystrophin, that's deficient in DMD patients, as well as stabilized the ambulatory abilities of patients on a standardized test, shares catapulted higher in early 2013.A late-stage failure by a competing drug known as drisapersen -- since snapped up by by  and submitted for regulatory review -- combined with several regulatory setbacks for Sarepta's DMD offering, however, have lead to, well, this:In a nutshell, Sarepta has been pushing to have its drug reviewed based on a small midstage trial, whereas the FDA appears to want the biotech to finish up a pivotal late-stage trial, prior to review.This tug-of-war reportedly led to an increasingly poor relationship between Sarepta's former CEO Chris Garabedian and the agency, resulting in a  at the small-cap biotech earlier this year.And that's where things get interesting from an investing standpoint.With Garabedian's exit, Sarepta now has the opportunity to rehabilitate its relationship with the FDA, which is exactly what management appears to be trying to do.Per its recent conference call, the biotech is planning to meet with the agency sometime before the end of the second quarter to discuss eteplirsen's regulatory filing.According to interim CEO Ed Kaye, the company believes it is on track to submit eteplirsen's New Drug Application to the agency by mid-year. So, this upcoming meeting would serve as a final checkpoint to make sure there aren't any additional issues that could derail a regulatory filing yet again.Because of eteplirsen's limited clinical data set so far, and the FDA's subsequent reservations about this issue, Sarepta is certainly a high risk stock. But it also has one of the highest potential upsides among developmental-stage biotechs right now.What's key to understand is that eteplirsen is Sarepta's \"make or break\" drug for its exon-skipping DMD platform that could provide treatments for up to 80% of boys afflicted with this devastating disease:Source: Sarepta TherapeuticsWhile the DMD market as a whole is estimated to be worth billions, I find putting even a rough dollar value on Sarepta's DMD platform, though, to be an exercise in futility at this juncture. Right now, there's no telling how the FDA is going to view BioMarin's rival drug and its mixed bag of clinical trial data. In short, there are simply too many moving parts that could drastically affect pricing structures and market penetration for these drugs going forward.That said, I think investors should bear in mind that the market once valued Sarepta at over $45 a share (before the FDA's first change of heart back in 2013), or 300% higher than the stock's current price.While this orphan drug stock could easily double this year after getting pummeled, I think investors should wait until the FDA has formally agreed to accept a regulatory filing for eteplirsen, before pulling the trigger. After all, we should have the answer to this vital question by the end of the second quarter, which isn't that far off.All told, I think Sarepta is a speculative biotech that healthcare investors should definitely be watching right now, given its potential to become one of the sector's best-performing stocks this year.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

That filing comes after a review of trial data and an extension study suggested that drisapersen can delay DMD's progression for some patients.Baird believes that drisapersen's FDA filing clears the way for a similar filing from Sarepta for eteplirsen as early as midyear. If so, Baird thinks Sarepta's share price could climb north of $20. Although BioMarin's filing signals optimism that the FDA will look favorably on these DMD drugs, it's far from a certainty when Sarepta will file for eteplirsen's approval, or if the FDA will eventually approve it. For that reason, Sarepta remains a high risk stock that most investors should take a pass on, at least until we have more insight from the company on its plans.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

The agency, later on, even questioned the validity of some of the study's findings in terms of dystrophin restoration in patients receiving the drug.So, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this thawing of the relationship between Sarepta and the FDA is a big deal. In fact, my belief is that this news represents a golden opportunity for investors to buy into a grossly undervalued biotech that is about to skyrocket. Here's why.Back in 2013, the market valued Sarepta at nearly $2 billion because it believed that eteplirsen was closing in on a regulatory approval with the FDA.After the FDA rejected Sarepta's request for an accelerated review, shares plummeted to about where they are trading right now, giving the biotech a market cap of less than $1 billion. So, recent history certainly suggests that Sarepta's market cap could more than double from current levels.But what really matters is eteplirsen's value proposition at this stage in the game. With that in mind, I think there are a couple of fairly good reasons to believe this single drug could propel Sarepta's shares much higher. When considering eteplirsen's value proposition, the first thing to understand is it can be dosed at significantly higher levels than its chief rival drisapersen -- that is also under review with the FDA and presently owned by  . What this means is that eteplirsen has a decent shot at being the far more potent of the two drugs.In terms of commercial potential, the Street believes that eteplirsen's peak sales could reach $500 million with little to no effort on the marketing front. Because the drug is already well-known within the DMD community, it would basically sell itself, helping the company to save hundreds of millions on marketing costs typical of most other drug launches.Perhaps most importantly, though, eteplirsen would validate Sarepta's remaining DMD platform that, in total, should be able to generate sales that exceed $2 billion.Another key issue is that eteplirsen is indicated for a rare disease and has been granted orphan drug status by the FDA. It would therefore have numerous commercial advantages over traditional drugs, if approved, such as an extended period of exclusivity, a premium pricing structure, little pushback from payers, high penetration rates, tax advantages, among many others.And that's why the market absolutely loves rare disease drugmakers. Orphan drugmakers such as  ,  ,  , among others, for instance, all trade at more than 10 times their annual revenues.The biggest risk facing the company is obviously eteplirsen's upcoming regulatory review. And there's no telling how this pivotal event will ultimately turn out.That said, I think the FDA is going to be hard pressed by DMD advocates and specialists treating the disease to approve at least one of these exon-skipping therapies currently under review (eteplirsen and drisapersen).Given that eteplirsen looks like the better drug from both an efficacy and safety standpoint, and the agency would have the ability to pull the drug if it fails a late-stage study down the road, I'm cautiously optimistic that Sarepta will finally see its much-maligned DMD drug win the backing of the FDA before year's end.That's why I'm going to start buying shares of Sarepta ahead of eteplirsen's regulatory review and hold them for the long-haul.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

And a central theme emerging from this merger-and-acquisition frenzy is that deals are seemingly coming out of left field, leaving analysts and pundits alike flummoxed in their quest to predict the next big buyout.Source: EvaluatePharma.Backing up this assertion, Pfizer's management highlighted the company's extremely active rare-disease drug pipeline in its latest clinical update:Source: Pfizer.To show the immense scale of Pfizer's rare-disease pipeline, all you need to know is that it's on par with specialist companies such as  , and absolutely dwarfs most others, such as  and  .Yet rare-disease drugs tend to be an afterthought among Pfizer's shareholders, and they rarely, if ever, draw commentary from analysts covering the stock. But that could be about to change.Because rare-disease treatments come with extended exclusivity, premium pricing structures, tax benefits, faster review times, and little to no pushback from payers, and because they tend to be biologics that have built-in defenses against generics, orphan drugs have become hotly pursued items in the pharmaceutical world.Topping it off, the rare-disease market completely blows away far more popular trends in biopharmaceuticals, such as immuno-oncology and biosimilars, in terms of market size.By 2020, for example, immuno-oncology drugs are estimated to reach around $35 billion in sales. Orphan drugs, on the other hand, should see sales in the upper stratosphere of $130 billion.That's why I think Pfizer is going to buyout  , which has become a leader in the orphan-drug space through its acquisitions of ViroPharma and NPS Pharmaceuticals. Besides offering double-digit sales growth for both its orphan and non-orphan pharma products, the Dublin-based Shire would also enable Pfizer to pursue a tax inversion to lower its effective tax rate, making it a more profitable company over the long haul.The confluence of an attractive orphan-drug pipeline and the added benefit of a foreign address leads me to believe that Shire is almost certainly on Pfizer's buyout list, even though nobody is talking about it right now.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

Meanwhile, Geron expects R&D expenses to increase during the remainder of the year as the development of imetelstat continues in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson.General and administrative expenses increased 15.2% to $4.6 million mainly due to higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense, legal costs and consulting costs associated with the business development activities to identify potential new product candidates.In Mar 2015, Geron transferred imetelstat's investigational new drug application (IND) to Johnson & Johnson as per the agreement terms. Geron also transferred the IND for imetelstat for myelofibrosis to Johnson & Johnson.A phase II study on imetelstat is expected to commence for the treatment of myelofibrosis in mid-2015 which will be followed by a phase II study for myelodysplastic syndromes toward year end.We remind investors that in March, Geron had announced a restructuring plan which will see the company cutting its workforce from 39 to 21, the majority of which will be completed by the end of the second quarter of this year.

The disconnect -- Vimizim guidance was up $20 million to $30 million on either end -- has to do with headwinds associated with the stronger dollar.While not on the hot-topic list, it's worth pointing out that sales of Kuvan, which treats another genetic disorder called phenylketonuria, increased 11% year over year. While it's nice to see double-digit growth, the drug is working off such a low base, that it's hard to get too excited about the increase. In a year on the market, Vimizim has achieved equivalent sales to Kuvan, which gained FDA approval over seven years ago.On the drisapersen front, no news was good news for investors. BioMarin's meeting ahead of completing its marketing application earlier this week didn't bring any surprises; the company doesn't need to run any new clinical studies, which would obviously delay approval and BioMarin's plan for becoming profitable. Management expects the FDA will call an advisory committee meeting in the second half of the year to get the opinion of outside experts, but so did most investors, so that's not really news.Until we see the documents the FDA sends to the advisory committee a couple of days ahead of the meeting, we're unlikely to get any additional insight into the approvability of drisapersen. The FDA's decision will likely come down to the agency's stringent desire to see a phase 3 trial that succeeded -- which BioMarin doesn't have -- weighed on the other hand with the unmet need and hints that the drug works, especially in younger patients. BMN 270 is years away from generating revenue, since it hasn't been tested in humans yet, but it's worth highlighting because of the type of therapy and the potential curative nature of BMN 270, a gene therapy to treat hemophilia A. BioMarin is looking to start the first clinical trial in the next few months, which could result in data by the end of the year. Since the drug could be a cure -- and it's not like hemophilia just goes away on its own -- if the gene therapy works in the first few patients, it'll be a good sign for BMN 270 even if it takes a few more clinical trials to confirm the initial findings.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

That's clear from the sizzling performance of the industry. If five years ago you had invested $1,000 each in the current 10 biggest biotechs in terms of market cap, you would now have over $92,000. Which companies make up this top 10 list by market cap? Here are the biotechs that stand atop the industry.\n  \nSource: Yahoo! FinanceThese biotechs are certainly quite different, but they share at least one thing in common. Each company derives a big chunk of its revenue from only one or two drugs.Source: Gilead SciencesHepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni together generated more than half of Gilead Sciences' sales last quarter. The same was true for Amgen with Neupogen/Neulasta and Enbrel. Multiple sclerosis drugs Tecfidera and Avonex raked in more than 70% of Biogen's total sales last quarter. Celgene pulled in over 64% of its revenue from Revlimid. BioMarin's Naglazyme and Kuvan accounted for nearly 63% of total sales in the fourth quarter of 2014.Other biotechs are pretty much one-drug wonders -- at least for now. Regeneron's Eylea, Alexion's Soliris, and Vertex's Kalydeco all account for nearly all of each company's total product sales. The same is true for Pharmacyclics' Imbruvica and Incyte's Jakafi.The trajectories for these biotechs and their main products vary, however. Gilead's hepatitis C drugs and Pharmacyclics' Imbruvica, for example, are still relatively new to the market and growing sales quickly. Amgen, on the other hand, experienced a year-over-year decline in revenue from its Neupogen/Neulasta franchise and relatively anemic sales growth for Enbrel.Pipeline strength also differs considerably among the top 10 biotechs. Biogen's experimental Alzheimer's disease drug could become a huge winner for the company down the road. Incyte claims a couple of JAK-inhibiting cancer drugs in pivotal clinical trials that investors are anxiously watching. Meanwhile, Gilead and Celgene boast of 20 or more mid-stage and late-stage trials under way.One thing seems certain. The current ranking of the biggest biotechs won't remain the same for much longer.Imbruvica. Source: Pharmacyclics announced plans in March to acquire Pharmacyclics for around $21 billion in large part to add Imbruvica to its lineup. Assuming all goes well, Pharmacyclics will drop off the list in mid-2015. Meanwhile, rumors continue to swirl about  . Analysts at UBS add Alexion and Incyte to the list of biotechs that larger companies could be interested in scooping up.The order at the top appears likely to change as well. Celgene  in market cap over the next couple of years or so based on earnings growth projections. And there's always the possibility that one or more of the big biotechs use their cash to make a purchase that changes the map. Gilead, for example, has over $10 billion in cash, while Amgen claims a cash stockpile of more than $27 billion.Which is the best of the big biotechs? It depends.Over the last five years, Pharmacyclics enjoyed the biggest stock gains by far, climbing more than 3700%. Keep in mind, though, that the biotech's starting point was also the lowest back then. If you're looking for which of these biotechs has the greatest chance of a ginormous breakout, go with a relatively smaller one like Incyte.However, if you're wanting to go with the company that appears to have the highest probability of maintaining sustained success over the long term, my picks would be Gilead and Celgene. Gilead has two juggernaut franchises -- one in hepatitis C and another in HIV/AIDS. Celgene continues to expand the strength of its portfolio with up-and-coming drugs including Abraxane and Otezla. I think Gilead gets the nod due to a lower valuation, but either of these biotechs could be good selections for investors hoping to make their own big bucks in biotech.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

The year-over-year increase was mainly due to higher net product revenues.Vimizim contributed $50.6 million to total revenues in the first quarter of 2015, up 37.1% sequentially.Net product revenues from Kuvan increased 11% year over year to $50.2 million. Naglazyme sales in the quarter declined 2% year over year to $78.2 million. BioMarin receives royalties from its partner Sanofi  on Aldurazyme. Aldurazyme royalties (excluding transfer revenues) amounted to $22.3 million in the first quarter, up 1.8% year over year.Firdapse revenues came in at $4.1 million, down 13% year over year.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased 67.2% to $132.1 million during the quarter. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 56.6% year over year to $81.4 million during the quarter.BioMarin completed the acquisition of Prosensa earlier in the year. The acquisition added Duchenne muscular dystrophy candidate, drisapersen, to BioMarin's portfolio apart from multiple orphan-drug candidates. In Apr 2015, BioMarin completed the rolling new drug application submission for drisapersen in the U.S. The EU application will be submitted this summer.BioMarin said that it may turn to profitability on an adjusted basis by 2017 on the back of drisapersen.BioMarin now expects 2015 total revenues in the range of $850 million to $880 million (previous range: $840 million to $870 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $873 million is within the company's updated guidance. The company also raised its Vimizim sales guidance to the range of $200 million to $220 million from the previous range of $170 million to $200 million.BioMarin's net loss guidance is however unchanged in the $130 -$170 million range. Naglazyme revenue guidance is also maintained in the range of $315 million to 340 million. The company still expects Kuvan net product sales in the range of $210 million to $230 million.SG&A and R&D expenditure guidance is also maintained in the range of $360 million to $395 million and $610 million to $640 million respectively.We are pleased with the company's bottom-line results with losses coming in narrower than expected. Vimizim sales were impressive during the quarter. Sales of the drug should increase further in 2015, as reimbursement in additional EU countries pick up.Drisapersen regulatory decision is the next big event for BioMarin. The company expects multiple pipeline related news with a number of data readouts lined up for the rest of the year. We expect investor focus to remain on pipeline updates from the company.BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

On Monday, BioMarin announced that it completed its submission of the application to market drisapersen in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration has two months to review the application and decide whether to accept the application. Drisapersen's previous owner,  , which BioMarin bought last year, said the FDA gave the company \"positive feedback\" about applying with the current data set, so the FDA's accepting the application seems likely.An approval, on the other hand, is far from a sure thing. The drug failed its phase 3 trial, but BioMarin is hoping that the \"totality of data\" will be enough to get the drug an accelerated approval, which requires the company to run a follow-up trial to confirm that the drug works. Given the unmet need -- there aren't any drugs approved to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy -- BioMarin might be able to gain approval despite the far-from-clean data.We'll find out about the exact timing of when to expect an FDA decision when the FDA accepts the application, but the decision should come around the end of the year, assuming the drug gets an accelerated approval. There will also probably be an FDA advisory panel meeting of outside experts that will make a recommendation to the FDA, so listen for management's feelings on the challenges of that meeting. BioMarin plans to submit its application to market drisapersen in Europe this summer. Compared with their U.S. counterparts, European regulators tend to be more lenient on efficacy issues -- and more stringent on safety issues, but that doesn't seem to be an issue with drisapersen -- so the likelihood of approval is probably higher in the EU than in the United States.BioMarin hasn't said much about the European application beyond the plan to apply during the summer. With the U.S. application wrapped up, hopefully the company gives some indication on its plans to persuade regulators to approve the drug there. Like the U.S., the approval will probably be contingent on BioMarin's running an additional clinical trial to confirm that the drug works. On its fourth-quarter conference call, BioMarin said it expects revenue of between $840 million and $870 million this year. The guidance included $35 million in \"lost\" revenue from changes in currencies. Since the dollar has strengthened further, we may see further scale-back of the guidance unless the quarter blows past expectations and the company feels it can make up for the additional currency exchange-rate changes.Of all of BioMarin's drugs, Vimizim is the one to keep an eye on, as it should contribute the most to BioMarin's year-over-year growth. Last year, BioMarin sold $77 million worth of Vimizim, which treats a genetic disease called Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA, but it expects that to more than double to between $170 million and $200 million this year.BioMarin finished the year with $37 million worth of Vimizim sales in the fourth quarter, so the biotech needs quarter-over-quarter growth of about 13% to meet the midpoint of its goal. At constant growth, which probably isn't going to happen since the drug is still launching in different countries, BioMarin needs first-quarter sales for Vimizim of around $41.8 million to reach the midpoint of its goal.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

U.S. diversified equity funds slipped an average 0.3% last month. They were up 2.5% for the first quarter as a whole.Stock funds were buffeted by several cross-currents: A slowdown in the U.S. economy, brought on in part by a brutal winter and a labor standoff at West Coast ports. A stronger dollar that's putting the squeeze on exporters and adding to market volatility. And most of all, lying in wait but indistinct, a Federal Reserve rate hike.\"The Fed is data driven and the market seems to be Fed driven,\" said John Heffern, a senior portfolio manager at Chartwell Investment Partners and a co-adviser forVanguard Mid Cap Growth Fund . Heffern added: \"There's consternation about the approaching change in monetary policy and what that means for growth.\"Large-cap  , which tend to have heavy exposure to multinational companies, took the biggest hit as the dollar surged. Large-cap core funds -- which hold both growth and value stocks -- fell 1.5% for the month, but managed to cling to a 0.9% gain for the quarter.Domestic-focused companies, whose bottom lines are more insulated from currency volatility than  , fared better. Small-cap growth funds topped, rising 1.6% in March and 5.9% in Q1.Midcap growth funds similarly edged out their core and value peers last month. They grew 0.8%, taking Q1 gains to a hefty 5.8%.By comparison, S&P 500 index funds fell 1.6% in March and inched up 0.8% in the first quarter.Midcaps' strong year-to-date performance is not out of character for the segment, Heffern noted.\"Long term, midcaps have tended to outperform large caps in indexes, although with some volatility,\" he said. Midcaps are an attractive asset class or style, especially in the current climate. They haven't grown to such an extent that growth is slowing. Nor do they involve taking on risk the way small-cap stocks might.\"  want growth but are afraid of risk,\" Heffern said. \"Midcaps answer that call in a very nice way.\"They also can play both sides of the uptick in M&A activity -- as acquirers and as acquisition targets. \"That's another element undoubtedly attracting investors,\" Heffern added.Most of all, he likes the fact that the advance in midcap growth indexes has come from various sectors such as health, technology, consumer services and financials.\"That's a healthy sign,\" Heffern said.

Cheaper energy has also benefited the lines.Michael Arone, a chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors, points out that stock funds rebounded somewhat after the Fed made clear in mid-March that rates would stay lower for longer. A strong employment report in early March had sparked a sell-off in many risky assets. \"That raised concerns the Fed will raise interest rates more quickly than anticipated,\" he explained.Gradual rate hikes should especially benefit small caps as the cost of doing business remains lower.A more domestic focus also makes small caps less exposed to a rising dollar or energy price swings than multinationals, Arone said.Among sector funds, biotechnology continues to lead.

Even as incomes are rising, people are spending less on expenses such as gas for their cars. \"With time, we will see consumers put this money to work,\" he added.In March, consumer services funds rose 0.3%. They're up 4.5% in the first quarter.Real estate funds rose 1.4% in March and 4.3% in Q1.With interest rates likely to stay low awhile, these funds are proving popular with income investors.\"Retirees, for example, use REITs (real estate investment trusts) to generate income,\" Arone said, describing these investments as \"bond proxies.\"Bond investors shared in the March malaise.  slipped an average 0.05% while tax-exempts tacked on 0.3%.Passive, indexed funds have had a great run for several years.

Which can take market share?\" he said. \"That's the opening for active managers.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is scheduled to report first-quarter 2015 results on Apr 30 after the market closes.BioMarin's track record has been pretty good, with the company reporting narrower-than-expected losses in each of the trailing four quarters. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 49.15%. In fact, the company has posted positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 44.30%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that BioMarin is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. BioMarin has an  of +9.43%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the shares. BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which when combined with a +9.43% ESP makes us confident of a likely earnings beat.Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.BioMarin's key products Naglazyme, Aldurazyme, Kuvan, Vimizim and Firdapse should continue to perform well. In particular, Vimizim, which was up 46.4% sequentially last quarter, should boost sales this quarter. Vimizim is already off to a strong start, even surpassing the company's expectations.More than 1,650 mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA patients have been identified by BioMarin. Vimizim should continue to perform well in 2015 as reimbursement in additional EU and secondary markets picks up.However, we may see a sequential increase in the SG&A spend as the company continues to step up marketing efforts for Vimizim around the globe.Early in the first quarter, BioMarin completed the acquisition of Prosensa for about $680 million. The acquisition added Duchenne muscular dystrophy candidate, drisapersen, to BioMarin's portfolio. The deal is expected to be accretive to BioMarin's earnings beginning 2017 assuming drisapersen gains early approvals.BioMarin's total revenues in 2015 are expected in the range of $840 million to $870 million.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +6.06% and carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It is expected to report results on May 11.The Earnings ESP for Actavis  is +1.04% and it carries a Zacks Rank #2.

According to well-respected analyst Robyn Karnauskas at Deutsche Bank, BioMarin shares have plenty of room to head higher, either because of catalysts inherent within its own developing pipeline, or as a merger/acquisition target.Karnauskas specifically wrote in her note to investors that \"If there is pipeline success, we think [a merger and acquisition] premium will go into the stock in [2016]. We currently see a potential takeout at $170 a share.\" If right, Karnauskas' prognostication works out to nearly 40% upside from where BioMarin ended March.Additionally, Karnauskas believes that BioMarin could reach $219 per share if just some of BioMarin's key pipeline products are successful. Specifically mentioned were BMN-111 for achondroplasia, BMN-270 for hemophilia A, and drisapersen, a potential Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment that BioMarin inherited when it purchased Prosensa. In what's referred to as a \"blue-skies scenario,\" where everything in BioMarin's pipeline is successful, Karnauskas believes BioMarin could be worth anywhere from $308 to $418 per share, a tremendous leap from today's share price of $123.What investors need to ask themselves after BioMarin's monster run higher in March is whether or not this currently $20 billion market cap company deserves a valuation of $27 billion -- or higher based on Karnauskas' suggested M&A price.Source: BioMarin Pharmaceutical. On one hand, BioMarin's business model of focusing on ultra-rare and rare diseases should minimize competition, afford it a long opportunity to stay on pharmacy shelves with high margins, and should all but assure that insurers latch on with coverage. Focusing on rare diseases has been a successful strategy for  , and it looks as if BioMarin will follow in its footsteps.On the other hand, BioMarin looks like a hot air balloon when you examine its bottom-line. Biopharmaceutical companies with deep pipelines are often given some slack when it comes to losing money because of high research costs. However, its current valuation of nearly $20 billion should give even the most risk-tolerant investors some pause, considering that BioMarin is slated to lose money through 2017. It could be four or five years from now before BioMarin's forward P/E even falls below 100!While I could certainly see the allure of BioMarin from the perspective of Big Pharma, I don't personally view the company as having much room for upside short of a buyout, which is itself no guarantee. Before investing in BioMarin I'd want to see an additional drug or two make it to market, and I'd really prefer to see BioMarin narrowing its cash burn and lessening its annual losses.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

We note that Edward Kaye has occupied the post of Sarepta's CMO since Jun 2011. During his tenure as a CMO, he was responsible for the company's medical and clinical operations. Prior to joining Sarepta, he had worked in Genzyme, which is a subsidiary of Sanofi  now.Sarepta declared in its press release that it remains on track to file a new drug application for eteplirsen in the U.S. in mid-2015.

The FDA initially tanked the idea in November 2013, subsequently relenting under public pressure from various Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, advocates; but then it delayed the drug's regulatory filing last October, citing doubts over the company's data collection in estimating the amount of dystrophin production (the key protein that is deficient in DMD patients) in boys treated with the experimental drug. Garabedian then publicly blamed the FDA for delaying eteplirsen's progress, prompting a public response from the agency.In short, Garabedian's relationship with the FDA appears to be...problematic, potentially forcing the board to abruptly change course. The net result has been a highly volatile share price that has fallen ever farther from its former highs:In a press release, the clinical-stage biotech announced that Chief Medical Officer Ed Kaye will replace Garabedian as CEO on an interim basis. Perhaps more importantly, the company still plans on finally submitting eteplirsen for FDA review by midyear.In the wake of this news, should investors view this change in management as a buying opportunity?Any disease-modifying DMD drug that can get past the regulators is widely expected to quickly reach blockbuster status. That's why  paid a handsome premium for Prosensa and its DMD candidate drisapersen late last year -- despite the drug having a  .Unfortunately, the current generation of DMD drugs has failed to impress on the gold standard clinical measurement known as the six-minute walk test. The issue is that patients treated with these experimental therapies exhibit a wide degree of variability on this pivotal measurement, despite a reported marked increase in dystrophin levels.Sarepta has thus lobbied the FDA to accept dystrophin production as a surrogate endpoint that could serve as the basis for approval. But a recent FDA workshop highlighted the fact that measuring dystrophin levels is still a work in progress, underlying the agency's concerns over Sarepta's clinical data on the matter. Put simply, I think it's pretty doubtful that the FDA is going to accept dystrophin measurements as a primary endpoint.To be fair, Sarepta did show an impressive level of walking stabilization in its modified intent-to-treat analysis at week 96 for patients on the drug, compared to the placebo. However, Prosensa reported a largely similar result for drisapersen in its midstage trial, but this result evaporated in a larger late-stage trial. That recent history sits at the core of the FDA's concerns and eteplirsen's main challenges toward an accelerated approval.It will be interesting to see how the market reacts to this change in leadership, and whether the FDA relents somewhat following Garabedian's exit.My bet, though, is that the agency is even more skeptical about Sarepta's dystrophin estimates after the latest workshop. Drisapersen's failure to improve clinical outcomes on the six-minute walk test in a late-stage trial should also remain a significant hurdle toward an accelerated approval for eteplirsen.In short, I think that the FDA appears intent on forcing Sarepta to come back with late-stage data on the six-minute walk test, and perhaps with data on the drug's safety profile as well, before an approval is granted. And that's going to require money. Lots of it.Indeed, the FDA is only showing interest in drisapersen at the moment because the drug has a well-understood clinical profile, based on multiple studies that have enrolled over 300 patients altogether. Eteplirsen's clinical profile, by contrast, remains cloudy due to the sheer lack of data.So sticking to the sidelines is probably the best course of action with this speculative biotech for the time being.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

Read on to see why our team of healthcare experts think  (NASDAQ: ESPR),  (NASDAQ: BMRN), and  (NASDAQ: ACAD) could be next on the auction block. First, let me state that investors shouldn't buy shares in a company just because they think a suitor could emerge. Instead, they should focus on buying companies like Esperion Therapeutics because of their potential as a stand-alone company and then consider an acquisition as an unlikely, yet welcome, outcome.Esperion's ETC-1002, a cholesterol-busting medicine, just put up impressive mid-stage trial results showing that combining it with statins can significantly reduce cholesterol levels in patients. If those results are duplicated in to-be-held phase 3 trials, then Esperion could have a multibillion-dollar blockbuster therapy on its hands. estimates that 71 million Americans have high cholesterol, and since tens of millions of patients already take statins, ETC-1002 could become a big seller someday. Just how big is uncertain, but Esperion's co-founder is Roger Newton, the co-inventor of the wildly successful Lipitor.Indeed, Lipitor was the world's biggest-selling drug of all time, notching $125 billion in sales prior to losing patent protection. ETC-1002 isn't likely to be that successful, but it could certainly have blockbuster potential. Analysts think PCSK9 cholesterol fighters making their way through the FDA approval process could rake in $2 billion a year, or more. With a billion-dollar opportunity like that ahead of it, I wouldn't be shocked if a large drugmaker makes a bid for Esperion -- especially if the upcoming phase 3 trials pan out. I'll second Todd's assertion that you shouldn't buy a company simply because it might get acquired. That's a pretty poor investment thesis, especially since there's usually a lot going on behind closed doors that investors aren't privy to: What premium on the current price is management willing to accept? Does confidential information the company shares with potential acquires make it more or less attractive?Take BioMarin Pharmaceuticals, for instance. The biotech has been rumored to be a takeover target for years since BioMarin specializes in orphan drugs, a specialty pharma has an appetite for. While the company remains independent for reasons no one outside of BioMarin's management really knows, it's still a solid company, and investors have been rewarded nevertheless.With the company  , BioMarin  looks like an attractive bolt-on acquisition for a pharma looking to add a few already-approved drugs and a decent pipeline.There's one caveat here, though. BioMarin recently acquired  for its Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy drug, drisapersen, which isn't approved yet and has a bit of a checkered past, having failed a phase 3 trial. Potential acquirers are likely to wait until the biotech is able to gain FDA or EU approval to sell drisapersen before acquiring BioMarin, because the likelihood of approval is hard to quantify.Alternatively, an acquirer might offer BioMarin's shareholders a \"contingent value rights\" that pays them more after the acquisition if drisapersen is approved, which is actually the mechanism that allowed BioMarin to acquire Prosensa. Acadia Pharmaceuticals has repeatedly been the subject of the buyout rumor mill ever since it reported stellar late-stage results for its experimental Parkinson's disease psychosis drug Nuplazid (pimavanserin) over two years ago. And the underlying reasons for these lingering rumors are easy to understand.First off, this devastating disease has no real treatment options beyond supportive care, meaning Nuplazid wouldn't face any meaningful competition upon its commercial launch. Experts thus have the drug's peak sales pegged at nearly $3 billion a year.And with a market cap of about $3.3 billion at present, Acadia appears to be fairly valued in light of Nuplazid's value proposition, giving any buyer a good bit of upside potential going forward.So, which big pharma might be lurking in the shadows? My money is on  . AbbVie already has an important new Parkinson's disease drug in Duopa -- so a buyout of Acadia would significantly strengthen the drugmaker's position in this vastly under-served market.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

While there are no credible sources backing this rumor, the impression on the Street is that  might be interested, given that the acquisition would match the Irish biopharma's desire to become a leader in the orphan drug space.Adding some fuel to the stock's rapid rise today, analysts at both Deutsche Bank and UBS also upped their price targets for BioMarin to $140 and $136 per share, respectively.

(Symbol: BMRN) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Omnicom Group, Inc. (Symbol: OMC), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN), the market cap is now $19.45B, versus Omnicom Group, Inc. (Symbol: OMC) at $19.4B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of BMRN vs. OMC:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, BMRN and OMC collectively make up 1.12% of the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF (  ) which is up by about 0.3% on the day Friday.At the closing bell, BMRN is up about 0.1%, while OMC is up about 0.6% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking back to 63 days ago, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN) priced a 8,500,000 share secondary stock offering at $93.25 per share. Buyers in that offering made a considerable investment into the company, expecting that their investment would go up over the course of time and based on early trading on Thursday, the stock is now 19% above the offering price.Investors who did not participate in the offering but would be a buyer of BMRN at a cheaper price, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2016 put at the $90 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $8.10. That would result in a cost basis of $81.90 per share before broker commissions in the scenario where the contract is exercised. If the contract is never exercised, the put seller would still keep the premium, which represents a 9% return against the $90.00 purchase commitment, or a 11.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Secondaries can often present buying opportunities for bullish investors interested in purchasing shares, because the sudden extra supply of stock tends to require that the offering be priced at an attractive discount to where the stock had previously been trading before the offering announcement. That can also introduce near-term volatility which improves the premiums a put seller can achieve. Selling a put does not give an investor access to BMRN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.

There are many different types of DMD, and exon-51 is the most common, representing 13% of all DMD cases. Sarepta estimates that exon-skipping could treat 80% of all DMD cases and has seven additional exon-skipping drugs in its pipeline currently in the preclinical or discovery phase. These eight drugs (inclusive of eteplirsen) would cover nearly half of all DMD cases in the U.S. (and eventually worldwide were Sarepta to apply for approval in the EU and elsewhere).Prior to eteplirsen, which is designed to stimulate the production of dystrophin and ultimately keep muscle fiber membranes intact, no drug had slowed the progression of DMD. But, in Sarepta's phase 2 48-week update, the results for the intent-to-treat group actually showed an  in the six-minute walk test, or 6MWT, from baseline. This was unheard of, and it put eteplirsen on the radar.Since this update, things have normalized a bit, with the 168-week update showing a  . While some people would be disappointed by the drop-off in the 6MWT (which has been accelerating over the past 48 weeks), it still represents a statistically significant 65.4-meter benefit over the control group that was switched to eteplirsen (and who saw their 6MWT figures stabilize) at a later date.Sarepta began enrolling for a confirmatory phase 3 study of eteplirsen late last year and plans to submit a new drug application with the Food and Drug Administration by mid-year.Source: Sarepta Therapeutics.The other player in this space is  , which  for up to $840 million, depending on near-term milestones. Prosensa's lead experimental DMD drug, drisapersen, failed to meet its primary endpoint in a broad phase 3 study despite producing encouraging phase 2 results. However, after diving deeper into the data, Prosensa announced its belief that drisapersen could be a useful agent in earlier stages of DMD, and as such, it's being explored in those earlier indications. It still remains to be seen whether BioMarin is going to get its money's worth from the Prosensa purchase, but DMD patients and their parents are clearly holding out hope for an improvement in their quality of life. Although Sarepta's phase 2b extension study has been encouraging, DMD patients and investors should also take two additional factors into consideration.First, there have been a number of miscommunications between Sarepta and the FDA that have delayed a new drug filing for eteplirsen. Consider it a possibility that the FDA will want to see a full 48 weeks of data in Sarepta's phase 3 study before considering an approval. This would put a possible approval off until mid-2016, or even 2017.The other factor worth mentioning here is that eteplirsen's approval isn't a lock. Despite the utter lack of other medicines designed to treat DMD, the FDA has expressed concern about using increased dystrophin production as a primary endpoint. Because Sarepta's DMD pipeline revolves entirely around the exon-skipping model, a failure of eteplirsen to be approved, or for the FDA to validate its exon-skipping pathway, could be disastrous for the company.One thing for certain is that time is of the essence with DMD patients, and we desperately need therapies designed to slow or stop the progression of the disease. Eteplirsen very well could be the solution for the next few years -- or even longer -- until a function cure for DMD is actually a reality. I look forward to ongoing innovation in this space and hope that serious strides can be made to improve DMD patients' quality of life and survival.

We asked some of The Motley Fool's biotech experts to weigh in on common mistakes investors make when investing in the industry. : It's easy to get emotional about biotech companies. Investors set out to make money, but once they learn more about the disease a company's drug treats, they often become passionate about the disease and lose sight of the bigger picture.There is, of course, nothing wrong with altruism. But most people would be best off if they separated their \"donations\" from their \"investments.\" If you care passionately about the fight against a disease, consider donating to a nonprofit that supports the effort rather than investing in companies that develop products used to treat the disease.Passion can cloud your judgment about the likelihood that a drug will be approved. The Food and Drug Administration isn't nearly as compassionate; the agency's reviewers tend to see things in black and white. is a good example of this. Investors fell so in love with the idea of Provenge extending prostate cancer patients' lives that they lost sight of the fact that the company didn't have enough data to get the treatment approved the first time around.When kids are involved, it's even easier to get sucked in. Diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy are heartbreaking, but that doesn't mean investors in  and  should expect the FDA to go easy on their DMD drugs.: Biotech stocks aren't for the faint of heart, but some best practices can help you avoid companies headed for failure.One statistic that doesn't get mentioned nearly enough is that more than 90% of drugs that enter phase 1 clinical trials never make it to market. Researchers say 30% of drugs fail during phase 1, while 60% of those that advance fail during phase 2. That means the odds are stacked against biotech stocks from the get-go.It also means investors betting on companies with pipelines that are limited to preclinical or phase 1 drugs are taking on more than their fair share of risk. A better policy could be to wait until drugs enter phase 3. Of course, there's no guarantee of success in those late-stage trials, either: About 30% to 40% of drugs that reach phase 3 trials still end up in the waste bin. Still, by waiting to that point to buy, you have significantly decreased the odds that a pipeline failure will result in big investment loss. :  One pitfall applies to companies of all types but is particularly problematic with biotech stocks. If a company doesn't have enough cash on its balance sheet to finance its operations until it can become sustainably profitable, then it must find ways to raise that cash. Most of the time, a small company's options for raising capital will prove harmful for long-term shareholders.Specifically, most small companies can't afford to use straight debt financing to get cash, as the interest rates needed for such loans would be too high for the company to maintain. As a result, many biotechs and other small companies instead offer equity, either through a straight secondary offering of shares or by using an equity kicker to a debt instrument, such as a convertible bond offering. Inevitably, the price at which the company offers additional shares is below the prevailing trading price -- often considerably below -- and the offering therefore pushes the share price down. More important, a greater numbers of shares outstanding means you have to share the biotech's eventual success with a greater number of investors, and that makes the risk-reward proposition for a biotech stock far less favorable.The answer is to look at a biotech's balance sheet and make sure it has ample cash reserves. That way, the chances of the company diluting your interest are a lot smaller. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase.

Higher revenues boosted results.Revenues for the reported quarter increased 184.4% year over year to $274.7 million, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $228 million. Xtandi delivered U.S. net sales of $230.2 million, as reported by Astellas (  ), in the fourth quarter, up 27% sequentially. The company attributed about four-fifth of the sequential improvement to underlying demand growth thanks to Xtandi's label expansion into the lucrative chemo-na\u00efve population.Ex-U.S. net sales were approximately $126 million, up 5% sequentially. Currency movement negatively impacted ex-U.S. net sales by about 7% compared to the third quarter.Medivation is evaluating Xtandi for additional indications in the prostate cancer setting as well as for breast cancer.Medivation's collaboration revenues in the fourth quarter were $274.7 million consisting of U.S. collaboration revenues of $115.1 million (up 82% from the year-ago period), ex-U.S. collaboration revenues of $18.2 million (compared to $4.3 million in the year-ago period) and upfront and development milestone payments accounting for the remaining $141.4 million. This included a $90 million development milestone payment and a sales milestone of $50 million on the achievement of annual worldwide Xtandi net sales of $800 million during the year.Operating expenses increased 48.2% to $131.3 million. Research and development expenses increased 56% to $57.9 million. SG&A expenses increased 42.5% to $73.4 million. The higher expenses were due to higher collaboration-related expenses from Astellas, costs associated with the company's newly-licensed pidilizumab program and higher personnel-related costs. Medivation expects U.S. net sales of Xtandi, as reported by Astellas, in range of $1.050 billion to $1.125 billion with first quarter sales to be at or below $230 million.Total collaboration revenues are expected in the range of $600-$650 million. This includes Medivation's 50% share of collaboration revenue related to U.S. net sales of Xtandi and collaboration revenue related to ex-U.S. net sales of Xtandi, in the form of a royalty payment from Astellas. However, it excludes collaboration revenue of $2.8 million related to the amortization of upfront payments that the company expects to recognize in 2015 and up to $245 million of remaining milestone related payments that Medivation may earn from Astellas this year.Operating expenses are expected in the range of $410-$450 million. This excludes non-cash expenses, stock-based compensation expense and milestone-related payments to a third party. Medivation's fourth-quarter results were encouraging with the company exceeding expectations by a wide margin.

Reported net income of $1.5 million or 2 cents per share in the fourth quarter compared favorably with the year-ago net loss of $0.3 million or break even on a per share basis.For full year 2014, Merge Healthcare reported adjusted earnings of 15 cents per share, reflecting a massive year-over-year improvement from a penny earned in 2013. The full year adjusted bottom line was on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.During its earnings release, Merge Healthcare announced the recent acquisition of DR Systems - a privately held San Diego-based company that provides medical imaging information systems, for a total of $70 million. Following this buyout, Merge Healthcare will be able to deploy its iConnect Network services, including pre-authorization services, to a broader client base of DR Systems. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Merge's non-GAAP adjusted EPS in 2015 and beyond.Total revenue in the reported quarter remained almost flat year over year at $53.6 million. This top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $55 million. Of the total revenue, 63.6% was generated from subscription maintenance & EDI.For full year 2014, the company reported revenues of $212.3 million, down 8.4% year over year and short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $215 million.During the fourth quarter, the number of live trials on the Merge eClinicalOS platform increased to 396, representing year-over-year growth of 129%. This led to a whopping 139% increase in revenues from Merge's eCOS platform. However, sales from legacy platforms declined 35%.In the reported quarter, the company signed 4 significant deals with new customers in the cardiology market which resulted in a 38% increase in total cardiology bookings compared to 2013.Merge Healthcare derives revenues primarily from three segments - Software and others (36.3% of total sales in the quarter), Professional services (15.5%), and Maintenance and EDI (48.3%). Maintenance and EDI registered revenues of $25.9 million, down 1%. Likewise, the Professional services segment also experienced a decline of 14.5% to $8.3 million. Revenues in the Software and others segment increased 9.4% year over year to $19.4 million.Total costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) dropped 0.7% year over year to $21.1 million. Fourth-quarter adjusted gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 60.5%.Sales and marketing expenses were up 7% (to $8.1 million) while product research and development expenses declined 5.8% (to $7 million) on a year-over-year basis. General and administrative expenses slashed a huge 22.2% from the year-ago quarter (to $7.1 million). All these combined resulted in an 8% decline in total operating cost (adjusted) to $22.2 million in the reported quarter.Accordingly, adjusted operating profit came in at $10.3 million, up 28.9% year over year, leading to a 390 bps expansion in adjusted operating margin. The adjustments excluded restructuring and acquisition-related costs, depreciation and amortization.Merge Healthcare exited 2014 with cash (including restricted cash) of $42.5 million, compared with $19.7 million at the end of 2013. Cash generated from business operations was $42.6 million, significantly up from $21.3 million as of Dec 31, 2013.Merge Healthcare will provide a business update on the company's market outlook and strategies for 2015, in its conference call.Although fourth quarter revenues at Merge missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the earnings improvement provided some relief. The recent acquisition of DR systems, which is expected to expand the company's footprint in medical imaging arena, is also encouraging.On a positive note, increase in the number of cardiology bookings and significant revenue growth from Merge's eCOS platform was the highlight of the quarter. Significant increase in operating profit was another upside. According to management, the company will be able to achieve positive top-line growth in 2015.However, Merge Healthcare's growth prospects are highly subject to capital investments by hospitals for advanced imaging solutions, which are in turn, dependent upon generic economic conditions. The company believes that its addressable market has stabilized.Currently, Merge Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked medical stocks are Affymetrix Inc.

(Symbol: BMRN) priced a 8,500,000 share secondary stock offering at $93.25 per share. Buyers in that offering made a considerable investment into the company, expecting that their investment would go up over the course of time and based on early trading on Wednesday, the stock is now 12.6% higher than the offering price.Investors who did not participate in the offering but would be a buyer of BMRN at a cheaper price, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $85 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $12.40. That would result in a cost basis of $72.60 per share before broker commissions in the scenario where the contract is exercised. If the contract is never exercised, the put seller would still keep the premium, which represents a 14.6% return against the $85.00 purchase commitment, or a 7.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Secondaries can often present buying opportunities for bullish investors interested in purchasing shares, because the sudden extra supply of stock tends to require that the offering be priced at an attractive discount to where the stock had previously been trading before the offering announcement. That can also introduce near-term volatility which improves the premiums a put seller can achieve. Selling a put does not give an investor access to BMRN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. The chart below shows the one year performance of BMRN shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, BMRN's low point in its 52 week range is $55.04 per share, with $110.00 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $106.69.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, BMRN makes up 5.54% of the PowerShares Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PBE) which is trading up by about 0.3% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund (Symbol: FXH) where we have detected an approximate $123.9 million dollar inflow -- that's a 4.1% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 46,200,002 to 48,100,002). Among the largest underlying components of FXH, in trading today Centene Corp (Symbol: CNC) is down about 0.8%, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN) is down about 1.6%, and AmerisourceBergen Corp. (Symbol: ABC) is higher by about 0.1%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of FXH, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FXH's low point in its 52 week range is $47.08 per share, with $65.26 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $64.63. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he following companies are expected to report earnings after hours on 02/25/2015.

Of course, it was surrounded by a couple of conditions: not until \"2017,\" on a \"non-GAAP basis,\" and requires the \"near-term approval of drisapersen in either the U.S. or Europe.\"But investors will take it, especially the \"or\" between \"U.S.\" and \"Europe.\"You'll recall that BioMarin gained rights to drisapersen through its acquisition of  last year. BioMarin is looking to complete the FDA submission for the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy drug in April.That's about a month later than the previous timeline, but the delay seems to be simply due to making sure the data is presented in the best possible light. The phase 3 trial failed its primary endpoint, so the extra time spent on data analysis could be the difference between a \"near term\" approval and one that's years away if the FDA makes BioMarin run another study.BioMarin has experience with less-than-perfect regulatory packages, including Aldurazyme, which missed its primary endpoint but still gained approval.BioMarin plans to submit a marketing application to European regulators this summer. The fact that either territory would be enough to get to profitability on a non-GAAP basis in 2017 is good news, because European regulators tend to be a little more lax with imperfect data.For example,  , now part of  , was able to gain European  for Esbriet with only half of the phase 3 clinical trials successful, but the FDA made the biotech run a third trial to confirm the drug really worked. It  .While an approval of drisapersen is needed to reach profitability in 2017, BioMarin still can't forget about its already-approved drugs. Hitting the company's sales goals is critical to ensuring profitability. This year, BioMarin is looking for revenue between $840 million and $870 million.At the midpoint, that's a 14% increase over 2014, substantially down from the 37% year-over-year growth BioMarin saw between 2013 and 2014, but part of the slower growth has to do with changes in currency, which is out of the company's hands. On a constant currency basis, at the midpoint, the guidance for 2015 comes in 20% higher than last year.And let's not forget that BioMarin's management is notoriously conservative with its guidance. This time last year, management was guiding for 2014 revenue of $650 million to $680 million when BioMarin actually finished the year with $751 million in revenue.Beyond drisapersen and the approved durgs, BioMarin's pipeline will determine how quickly that profitability increases beyond 2017. Data for the phase 3 trial testing pegvaliase, which used to go by PEG PAL, in patients with phenylketonuria is expected in the first quarter of 2016. Add a few months to complete the application and another eight months for review time -- if the drug gets a priority review -- and pegvaliase could be on the market in 2017 if the clinical trial data is positive.And there's Cerliponase alfa, which also goes by BMN 190, for late infantile CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease. The drug is only in a phase 1/2 trial, but the data from the first nine patients looked so good -- stable disease over six months versus an expected decline in motor and language function -- that there's a possibility to get approved based on a limited number of patients although BioMarin still has to work out the details with regulatory authorities. Look for the full data set in the fourth quarter of the year. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase. There is a product in development that could revolutionize not just how we treat a common chronic illness, but potentially the entire health industry.

According to the company, these easy-to-use high-quality sequencing-ready libraries are compatible with Illumina's large portfolio of sequencing platforms.The NeoPrep System delivers reliable, top-quality DNA and RNA libraries with almost 85% lesser pipetting required to prepare libraries when compared to manual library prep methods. The hands-on time required is also reduced by approximately 90% in this system. Using precision digital microfluids technology, this system produces high quality and reproducible outcomes, even in presence of lower traces of DNA or RNA, which manual library assays do not comply with.Notably, this benchmark system is the first commercially available product that performs library prep, quantification and normalization, in a single, self-contained instrument. Interestingly, this system generates 16 quantified and normalized sequencing-ready libraries per run.Sequencing libraries prepared with the NeoPrep System can be used on any Illumina sequencing system, including the MiSeq, NextSeq 500, or HiSeq systems, and are analyzed using the BaseSpace genomics computing environment. The entire system together offers the easiest, most efficient and complete NGS workflow solution for its users.We believe this latest addition to its ever expanding line of sequencing portfolio will enable Illumina to expand its access in oncology, reproductive health, forensics, microbiology and other key markets.Illumina will begin shipping the NeoPrep System and NeoPrep versions of the TruSeq Nano DNA Kit and TruSeq Stranded mRNA Kit from Mar 2015. In the latter part of the year, management expects to launch additional library prep products including NeoPrep versions of the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Kit and other targeted resequencing kits.This indicates that the company is investing its resources generously toward the further development of its NGS portfolio. We believe such efforts on the company's part should enhance the potential value of Illumina's stock.Currently, the stock retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was earnings of 3 cents. The company had incurred a loss of 21 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.The bottom line was boosted by higher revenues during the quarter. Orexigen recorded revenues of $22.9 million as compared to $0.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The company received collaborative agreement revenues during the quarter related to the U.S. launch of Contrave. Revenues during the quarter were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Orexigen incurred a 2014 loss of 32 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss by a penny but narrower than the year-ago loss of 80 cents per share. The company's 2014 revenues came in at $55.5 million compared with $3.4 million in 2013. Revenues fell slightly short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $56 million.According to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd (  ), U.S. net sales of Contrave in the fourth quarter came in at $6.5 million after the drug was launched on Oct 20, 2014. Orexigen received $1.3 million as royalties on net sales of Contrave.Contrave was approved in the U.S. as an adjunct to a healthy diet (low on calories) and physical activity for chronic weight management in obese (Body Mass Index, or BMI, \u2265 30) or overweight (BMI \u2265 27) adults suffering from at least one weight-related co-morbid condition including high blood pressure, type II diabetes and high cholesterol.Regarding the Marketing Authorisation Application for Mysimba (EU trade name for Contrave), in Dec 2014 , the company received a positive nod from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on the approval of the drug. A final decision on the approval of the drug in the EU is expected next month.Operating expenses decreased 5.7% year over year to $20.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower research and development (R&D) expenses related to Contrave. R&D expenses decreased 16.2% from the year-ago period to $13.0 million. General and administrative expenses were up 19.8% to $7.6 million.Orexigen's fourth quarter results were disappointing with breakeven earnings missing our estimates. However, we are encouraged by the initial sales of Contrave. Moreover, the positive CHMP opinion enhanced the chances of the EU approval of Mysimba. We expect investor focus to stay on the performance of the drug going forward.We note that the obesity market is already crowded with products like Qsymia and Belviq among others.Orexigen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Last week, Celgene announced that the FDA has expanded the existing indication for Revlimid, which can now be used in combination with dexamethasone for treating patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma.Revlimid is approved in many countries across the globe in combination with dexamethasone for treating multiple myeloma patients, who have received at least one prior therapy.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 27.27%. In fact, the company has posted positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 37.16%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Last month, at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, BioMarin stated that its key products Naglazyme, Aldurazyme, Kuvan, Vimizim and Firdapse should continue to perform well. BioMarin expects total revenues from these five marketed products to surpass $700 million in 2014.Moreover, BioMarin increased the guidance for its potential blockbuster drug, Vimizim, on the back of continued impressive performance. The company expects Vimizim sales in the range of $75 million to $77 million (old guidance: $65 million to $70 million) in 2014 with fourth quarter sales expected in the range of $34.6 million to $36.6 million. The company believes Vimizim could generate revenues of approximately $110 million in its first full four quarters.With more than 1,650 mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA patients identified, Vimizim is already off to a strong start, even surpassing the company's expectations. Vimizim should continue to perform well in 2015 as reimbursement in additional EU and secondary markets pick up.At the time of releasing third quarter results, BioMarin had lowered its net loss guidance to $50 million to $65 million for 2014. The narrowed loss guidance assumed higher revenues and lower R&D expenses. However, BioMarin will see a sequential increase in the SG&A spend as the company continues to step up marketing efforts for Vimizim in the U.S. and EU.The key highlight of the quarter was BioMarin's acquisition of Prosensa for about $680 million. The acquisition added Duchenne muscular dystrophy candidate, drisapersen, to BioMarin's portfolio. The deal is expected to be accretive to BioMarin's earnings beginning 2017 assuming drisapersen gains early approvals.On the fourth quarter call, the focus will be on the company's outlook for 2015 and its pipeline since multiple data readouts are lined up for the rest of the year.Our proven model does not conclusively show that BioMarin is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP for BioMarin is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are at a loss of 59 cents per share. BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). BioMarin's Zacks Rank #1 when combined with an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Impax Laboratories Inc. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +27.27% and carries a Zacks Rank #1. It is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 24.The earnings ESP for Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.

Results from the study were published in the  .The study was conducted to compare three different anti-VEGF therapies, Eylea, Lucentis and Avastin. In the study, 660 patients were randomized to receive Eylea (2 mg), Avastin (1.25 mg) or Lucentis (0.3 mg).Results from the study revealed that patients when treated with Eylea (+13 letters) demonstrated a significantly higher improvement on the primary endpoint of mean visual acuity letter score change as compared to both Lucentis (+11) and Avastin (+10). Moreover, in patients who entered the study with moderate or worse vision loss (worse than 20/40), Eylea showed a statistically significant improvement in vision when compared to those treated with either Avastin or Lucentis (EYLEA +19 letters; Avastin +12; Lucentis+14).In addition to this, in patients with a vision of 20/40 or better, no significant differences were observed among the three drugs. Rates of most ocular and systemic adverse events were found to be similar across the three study groups.We are encouraged with the results from the study. According to the press release issued by Regeneron, 1.5 million of the 29.1 million diabetic adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with DME.Eylea is approved in the U.S. for several indications including the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, DME and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion.We note that Eylea, which is the key growth driver of the company, recorded sales of $1.7 billion in 2014, up 23%. Regeneron has a collaboration agreement with Bayer (  ) for the global development of Eylea.Regeneron is currently looking to get Eylea's label expanded to include diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. A final decision from the FDA is expected by Mar 30, 2015. Eylea's label expansion should boost sales over the long term.We expect investor focus to remain on pipeline updates regarding Eylea.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

According to the agreement, Seattle Genetics holds the commercialization rights to Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada, while Takeda has the rights in the rest of the world. Both companies share development costs for Adcetris equally, except in Japan where Takeda bears the entire costs of development.Apart from the AETHERA study, both companies are evaluating Adcetris in three phase III studies - ALCANZA (relapsed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma), ECHELON-1 (front-line advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma) and ECHELON-2 (front-line mature T-cell lymphoma including sALCL). Data from the ALCANZA study should be out in 2016.Meanwhile, Seattle Genetics is also working on developing its pipeline beyond Adcetris. The company has several early-stage candidates in its pipeline including six antibody drug conjugates - SGN-CD19A, SGN-CD33A, SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD70A, ASG-22ME and ASG-15ME.

Total revenues in 2014 came in at $401.5 million, up 19.3% from the year-ago quarter and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $393 million.The bulk of net product revenues at Acorda came from Ampyra, which generated $109.9 million in the reported quarter, up 29.9% from the year-ago period, benefiting from the company's efforts to increase awareness about the drug. Ampyra revenues improved 14% on a sequential basis.The company said that it has received eight Paragraph IV certification notice letters stating that some companies have submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) in the U.S. requesting permission to manufacture and market generic versions of Ampyra.Ampyra is marketed in ex-U.S. markets under the trade name Fampyra by Biogen Idec (  ).

This designation allows the product to enjoy a period of marketing exclusivity in the U.S., upon approval.Moreover, Oncolytics is now eligible to receive benefits like tax credits for research and development costs, annual grant funding as well as request for the waiving of certain administrative fees. However, orphan drug status does not alter the regulatory process for obtaining marketing approval for the candidate.Currently, Reolysin is being studied in a randomized phase II third-party trial (GOG186H), comparing the weekly dosage of Taxol with Reolysin plus Taxol for the treatment of patients suffering from persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Patient enrolment in this study was completed in Sep 2014. Meanwhile, a phase I/II study (OSU-07022) evaluated concurrent intravenous and intraperitoneal administration of Reolysin for the treatment of patients suffering from metastatic ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers. This study showed that the candidate is capable of viral targeting and replication in peritoneal and ovarian cancer cells.According to the American Cancer Society, 193,203 patients are estimated to suffer from ovarian cancer at a given point of time. In 2014, 21,908 American women have been estimated to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer with 14,270 expected to die from the disease.

Cancer treatment has been at the forefront of this research for years, both in innovating patient screening and revolutionizing drug development.For example, the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center runs the Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy.That center runs genetic tests on tumors in a bid to match up patients with the most effective cancer treatments, including both FDA-approved medicines such as  's Opdivo and drugs that are currently in clinical trials, such as  's BMN-673.At the center's Institute for Genomic Medicine, or IGM, a lot of that genetic research is being conducted with the help of Illumina's gene sequencing machines. According to the IGM, the Illumina HiSeq 2000, Illumina HiSeq 2500, Illumina MiSeq, and Illumina HiScan System are all used at the facility.According to the MD Anderson Cancer Center's Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy, we are converging on a \"perfect storm\" in personalized cancer treatment that could be \"offering the opportunity to make a bold leap forward in personalizing cancer care.\"One of the driving forces of this opportunity is the significant advances in speed and cost that have been made over the past decade in sequencing genes.Many of those advances have been the result of innovation at Illumina. In 2001, the National Human Genome Research Institute reports that the average all-in cost to sequence a genome was $100 million. Today, the cost to sequence a genome on Illumina's HiSeq X Ten has fallen to a little less than $1,000, but it's not just lower prices that will allow for significant strides forward in drug development and treatment. Speed will have a big impact, too. For example, the HiSeq X Ten -- a system of 10 machines -- may be able to sequence 18,000 genomes per year, and that means that more patient population data can be collected, analyzed, and leveraged for greater insight.Illumina's new HiSeq X Ten carries a price tag of $10 million, yet demand has significantly outpaced Illumina's January 2014 forecast for five customers last year.In Illumina's fourth-quarter conference call, the company reported that it had 18 customers (up from 13 customers exiting Q3) that had ordered a total of 201 HiSeq X Ten systems (up from 144 orders exiting Q3). Overall, Illumina shipped 134 HiSeq X Ten systems last year.As a result, Illumina's sales grew 32% year over year to $512 million in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the 29% year-over-year growth to $346 million that Illumina reported in Q3.But while Illumina's machines are pricey and generate significant top-line revenue, Illumina's real opportunity may not come from building expensive machines, but from generating revenue from the genomic information that these sequencers produce.Illumina already generates 57% of its revenue selling consumables to the users of its sequencers, and in the fourth quarter, consumables revenue grew 19% from a year ago to $290 million.Ultimately, however, a significant portion of Illumina's sales could come from software solutions that automate workflow and data analysis, or from deals wherein Illumina embeds itself as a companion diagnostic for new personalized medicines.For instance, in 2013 Illumina announced that the FDA had cleared its diagnostic kit assays for use in detecting cystic fibrosis that simultaneously detects 139 clinically relevant disease-causing mutations and variants within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, gene. Illumina is also collaborating with  ,  , and  to develop genetic tests that can better identify which patients would most likely respond to their specific cancer drugs.Source: IlluminaThere could be a multiplier effect to the impact of the president's plans that means that future research activity proves to be far greater than what is indicated in the administration's budget. A study by the Association of American Medical Colleges in 2011 showed that every dollar invested in research at medical school and teaching hospitals generates $2.60 of economic activity, not including the benefit of commercializing drug and research discoveries. Given that so many new emerging biotechnology companies have been created to explore commercialization of research conducted by medical colleges, it wouldn't be surprising to see additional NIH funding fuel even more demand for Illumina over time.Regardless, as it stands today, the NIH plans to use its $130 million share of the plan's $215 million to recruit a million or more volunteers to share their health data for analysis. Another $70 million will go to the National Cancer Institute for genetic research, and the remainder will be divvied up between other government agencies to create the infrastructure necessary to process information and address new drug applications. Based on that allocation, $200 million will be spent on initiatives that could boost sales for Illumina, and that could mean that Illumina is the biggest winner among companies likely to benefit from this initiative. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase. There is a product in development that could revolutionize not just how we treat a common chronic illness, but potentially the entire health industry.

Revenues increased 11.1% from the last year to $2.14 billion in 2014.We note that all growth rates below are in constant exchange rates.Product sales were up 12% from the last year. Excluding the impact of U.S. rebate reversals, net product sales growth was 10%. Sales increased 16% in the U.S., 10% in Europe and 9% in Japan. In the rest of the world, sales increased 8%, primarily due to strong performance in the emerging markets including China, Taiwan, Russia and Mexico.Opsumit generated revenues of CHF 180 million. The drug has been gaining new patient share in the ERA market rapidly, supported by patient switch from Tracleer to Opsumit.Tracleer revenues were down 1% year over year due to conversion from Tracleer to Opsumit, generic competition and pricing pressures. However, its sales were strong in markets where Opsumit is yet to be launched as well as in Europe for the digital ulcer indication.Veletri sales soared 84% from the year-ago period, driven by successful launches in Australia, the Netherlands and Spain as well as strong performance in Japan.Ventavis sales were up 3% year over year, mainly due to price rise and rebate reversals.Zavesca sales were up 11% from the prior-year period. Strong demand for the drug for the Niemann-Pick type C indication in ex-U.S. markets and stable demand for the type I Gaucher disease along with positive price movement in the U.S. contributed to its outperformance.Valchlor sales were CHF 11 million.Research & development expenses increased 7.9% year over year to CHF 437.4 million due to higher clinical development expenses. Selling, general & administrative expenses increased 6.6% from the last year to CHF 672.1 million mainly due to costs associated with product launches of Opsumit, Valchlor and Veletri.During the fourth quarter of 2014, Actelion filed for Uptravi for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in the U.S. and the EU. The company is currently studying Opsumit and cadazolid in two phase III studies, MAESTRO and IMPACT, for Eisenmenger syndrome and  -associated diarrhea, respectively.Actelion expects core earnings growth in the (excluding the impact of U.S. rebate reversals) in the low-single digit percentage range at constant exchange rates. In 2015, several drugs (Tracleer, Ventavis and Zavesca) are expected to face generic competition along with increased pricing pressures.Although Actelion's performance in the fourth quarter of 2014 was disappointing, overall performance by the company in 2014 was satisfactory. Strong sales of Opsumit and higher demand in emerging markets boosted revenues. Strong launch momentum for Opsumit is expected to drive growth into 2015.Actelion carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The drug is approved for the treatment of asthma.The patent was set to expire in 2018 and had paediatric exclusivity extending up to 2019. The company said that it will be reviewing the court's decision and will be considering legal options regarding this. Also, the company clarified that the court's decision is limited to the U.S. alone and will not affect the validity of patents related to the drug in other countries.AstraZeneca recorded Pulmicort sales of $946 million in 2014, up 11% at constant exchange rates. We believe that the U.S. court's decision may affect the drug's sales going forward.However, AstraZeneca believes that the decision will not impact its 2015 guidance provided during the fourth quarter conference call earlier in the month. AstraZeneca expects 2015 revenues to increase in the mid single-digit percentage range and 2015 core earnings to increase in the low single-digit percentage range.We note AstraZeneca has been under severe pressure as generic competition has adversely impacted its revenues over the past few quarters and is expected to do so in the coming quarters too.

The bottom line also improved substantially from the year-ago loss number by a solid 33.3%.Net loss for the quarter was $6.3 million, reflecting an improvement of 33% from the net loss of $9.4 million recorded in the year-ago period.For full year 2014, Genomic Health's loss per share deteriorated 85.7% to 78 cents but fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss by a penny.Total revenue in the quarter inched up 0.4% year over year to $69.1 million, but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $72 million. For full year 2014, revenues grossed $275.7 million, reflecting growth of 5.4% over the prior year. However, the full year top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $279 million.The company derived its quarterly revenues solely from product sales. Positive unit and revenue growth in the U.S. invasive breast cancer business coupled with growing U.S. adoption of the prostate cancer test drove the year-over-year improvement in total revenue.During the fourth quarter, international product revenues (representing 14.9% of product revenues) grew 2% year over year to $10.3 million. Genomic Health delivered more than 24,700 Oncotype DX test results, up 9% from the year-ago quarter.In the quarter under review, Genomic Health reported gross margin of 81.9%, reflecting a contraction of 240 basis points. The company's cost of product revenues increased 15.6% year over year to $12.5 million. However, excluding the prostate test volume, where there is no reimbursement in place, the company's gross margin would have been over 83% in the quarter.On the other hand, Genomic Health incurred a 2.8% decline in operating expenses to $75.1 million owing to a solid 44.7% fall in research and development expenses of $13.3 million. However, selling and marketing expenses were up 18.4% to $34.3 million, while general and administrative expenses spiked 11.8% to $14.9 million.In the reported quarter, Genomic Health recorded operating loss of $6 million, reflecting an improvement of 29.6% from the year-ago equivalent loss, owing to lower operating expenses.Genomic Health exited 2014 with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities of $103.7 million, down from $105.4 million at the end of 2013.In the fourth quarter , Genomic Health announced that from Apr 1, 2015, the Oncotype DX breast cancer test will be available for eligible breast cancer patients through the National Health Service (NHS) in England, as the only multi-gene breast cancer test recommended by NICE to assist in chemotherapy treatment decision making. The company also received positive reimbursement decision for the Oncotype DX breast cancer test through the mandatory health insurance system in Switzerland.Moreover, ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group announced a new NCI-sponsored clinical trial for women with newly diagnosed DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ). This trial requires Genomic Health's Oncotype DX DCIS Score to estimate the risk of recurrence to guide the use of radiation following lumpectomy.The company anticipates full year 2015 revenues in the range of $292-$305 million and loss per share in the range of 53-75 cents. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $308 million exceeds the company's guidance, while that for loss per share of 54 cents lies close to the lower end of the guided range.Management further expects to deliver Oncotype DX tests worth $102,000 to $109,000, which represents a growth rate between 7% and 14%.Genomic Health delivered mixed financial numbers in fourth-quarter 2014 with bottom-line beat but revenue miss. Given the fact that over 3,500 women in U.K. have already used Genomic Health's Oncotype DX test, management believes the earlier mentioned agreement of the company with NHS will help in accelerating test adoption from the second quarter and revenue generation, primarily, in the second half of 2015. As management continues to believe that growth in Western Europe will drive its success overseas, we believe the company is in a position to return to positive international product revenues in the coming quarters, in contrary to the slow growth observed in the reported quarter.Genomic Health has been incurring losses over the past few quarters and still expects to see the same in the current fiscal, albeit on a narrower scale. Nevertheless, the company's conviction of delivering profits in the fourth quarter of 2015 raises our optimism.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Applications have been submitted in the EU also for orphan designation for the candidate for the treatment of both pancreatic and ovarian cancers.According to the American Cancer Society, about 40,560 people in the U.S. are expected to die from pancreatic cancer in 2015.The FDA usually grants orphan drug status to drugs or biologics that are being developed for the treatment of rare diseases/conditions affecting less than 200,000 people in the U.S. at any given time. This designation allows the product to enjoy a period of marketing exclusivity in the U.S., upon approval.The development of treatments for pancreatic cancer is extremely tough and challenging. Incentives that come with orphan drug status include tax credits, waiver of certain administrative fees and a certain period of marketing exclusivity following approval.We note that Oncolytics is also seeking orphan drug designation for Reolysin in the U.S. for high grade gliomas in pediatric patients.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company reported a loss of 22 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents but wider than the year-ago loss of 13 cents per share.Revenues increased 10.3% from the year-ago quarter to $74.3 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $68 million, primarily driven by higher Adcetris sales and royalty revenues.Total revenue comprised product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties. Adcetris, the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics, generated revenues of $46.5 million (in the U.S. and Canada), up 21% year over year. The increase was due to effective commercialization and higher prescriptions of the drug.Collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalty revenues were $16 million (down 28.2%) and $11.9 million (up 80.3%), respectively. Collaboration revenues decreased due to an expected reduction in reimbursement from Seattle Genetics' partner Takeda Pharmaceutical (  ) under their collaboration for the development and commercialization of Adcetris on a global basis.In the reported quarter, research and development (R&D) expenses were $64 million, up 26.1% year over year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 15.5% year over year to $29.4 million.Seattle Genetics reported a loss of 62 cents per share in 2014, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents but wider than the year-ago loss of 51 cents per share.Revenues increased 6.5% from the year-ago quarter to $286.8 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $281 million. Net sales of Adcetris came in at $178.2 million, up 23% year over year.Seattle Genetics is working on expanding Adcetris' label. In Dec 2014, the company reported data from the phase III AETHERA study on Adcetris showing that Hodgkin lymphoma patients, who had a high risk of relapse following an autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), were treated with Adcetris as consolidation therapy immediately after ASCT and achieved significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to placebo. The company intends to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA for Adcetris in this indication in the first quarter of 2015.Meanwhile, Seattle Genetics inked a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (  ) for the development of an investigational combination of the former's antibody-drug conjugate, Adcetris and the latter's immunotherapy, Opdivo. The combination therapy will be evaluated in two phase I /II2 studies, both of which are slated for initiation in 2015.Seattle Genetics expects revenues from net sales of Adcetris in the range of $200 million - $210 million (in the U.S. and Canada). Additionally, revenues from collaboration and license agreements are expected in the range of $60 million - $70 million.The company expects R&D expenses in the range of $250 million - $275 million and SG&A expenses in the range of $105 million - $115 million.We are pleased with Adcetris' performance so far. Being the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics, the drug remains the growth driver for the company. Moreover, Seattle Genetics is working towards label expansion of Adcetris - the drug is being evaluated in a number of corporate and investigator sponsored trials for Hodgkin lymphoma, apart from the AETHERA and ECHELON-1 studies.

Synthetic Biologics is developing the candidate for the prevention of  (  ) infection (by protecting the gut microbiome from collateral damage caused by antibiotics) as well as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and secondary antibiotic-resistant infections in patients undergoing intravenous beta-lactam antibiotic therapy.Top-line pharmacokinetics data from the phase Ib study should be out during the first quarter of 2015.Synthetic Biologics stated that top-line results from the study reinforce SYN-004's potential to become the first and only point-of-care therapy to prevent  infection. The company intends to initiate phase II studies to evaluate SYN-004 for this indication in the first quarter of 2015.We are pleased with Synthetic Biologics' progress with its pipeline. Given that 1.1 million patients in the U.S. suffer from  infections every year with 30,000 deaths related to the disease, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers  an 'urgent public health threat'.

While healthcare was a minor part of the address, it stood out as one of the most investible topics mentioned by the president:Source: Whitehouse.gov. We're supposed to get more information about this new initiative when Obama's budget proposal is released, but I'm not really sure what's so new about \"precision medicine.\"For years, the biotech industry has been doing precision medicine, which targets precise genetic defects that lead to a given disease in order to tailor treatments to the patient populations most likely to benefit from them. As such, the one-size-fits-all approach to drug development is a rarity these days. has a stable of drugs designed to treat hereditary diseases by replacing proteins that are mutated in patients. Ditto for  .To highlight the benefits of \"precision medicine,\" Obama invited William Elder, a cystic fibrosis patient, to sit with the first lady during the address. The drug Elder takes wasn't mentioned by name, but  ' Kalydeco is the logical conclusion, since it's the only drug approved drug to treat the underlying genetic mutation that causes cystic fibrosis.Many targeted cancer treatments fit in the class of precision medicine.  's Herceptin, for example, treats patients with tumors that have elevated levels of Her2, a protein that promotes tumor growth.  's Xalkori treats lung cancer with a mutation in a gene called ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase).  ' Gleevec treats leukemia caused by the fusion of two genes when chromosomes 9 and 22 swap ends. Obama said he wants \"the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine -- one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.\"Interestingly for investors to note, Jonas Salk, who developed the polio vaccine, made little to nothing from his invention. \"There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?\" Salk told Edward R. Murrow in a television interview.While started by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health, the sequencing of the human genome was completed by an international consortium that included scientists in the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Germany, China, and other countries.Celera Genomics conducted a separate program to sequence the human genome, but the company never really profited from the effort.  bought up Celera, but investors that bought at the height of the genome-sequencing hype didn't make out too well.Human Genome Sciences, which was built on the idea of using knowledge of the human genome to design drugs, topped out at $100 per split-adjusted share in 2000;  bought the company in 2012 for $14.25 per share. To design drugs for genetic mutations, you must find the genetic mutations first. The falling cost to sequence human genomes has made it much easier to do precision medicine and allowed companies to profit from it.While there are many drugs on the market, and many more in the clinic, that I would put in the class of precision medicine, the field is far from mature. There are numerous diseases in which the underlying causes still aren't known, so the medications can only treat the symptoms.The financial downside to treating a subset of patients is that precision medicine drugs need to be priced higher. The cost of developing drugs is about the same as with other pharmaceuticals, so companies have to charge more to make up for the lower volume.For example, Vertex's previously mentioned Kalydeco sells for about $300,000 per year. As long as insurance companies and the government are willing to pay up, companies can make money developing precision medicine. If you're going to invest in companies focused on this business, though, keep in mind that any pushback on price will likely send the stocks prices tumbling.

Moreover, they have shown a penchant for picking the next \"home run\" biotech stocks, such as  and  , with both of these stocks exploding higher since the fund took a position:Per the third-quarter 13F filings, we learned that the Baker Brothers have amassed a huge position -- more than 10 million shares -- in the orphan-drug maker  , making them the company's largest shareholders and Synageva the fund's fourth largest holding.Given the Baker Brothers' stellar record of generating marketing-crushing returns and the considerable size of their stake in Synageva, should average investors consider buying this stock? Let's take a deeper look.Drugs for rare diseases have gained favor in the pharmaceutical industry because they offer their manufacturers several key advantages over treatments for more common conditions, such as an extended period of market exclusivity, tax credits, faster review times, and even a waiver of some regulatory fees.To top it off, most approved treatments for rare diseases to date have been biologics -- or therapies developed from biological organisms -- making them hard to copy via so-called generic biosimilars. The net result is a group of products that tend to enjoy a long shelf life and high profit margins, which is probably why most orphan-drug makers garner huge premiums in terms of their share price.Synageva is looking to break into this space with its lead clinical candidate, sebelipase alfa (brand named Kanuma), an enzyme replacement therapy indicated for patients afflicted with the rare disease lysosomal acid lipase, or LAL, deficiency. So far, the company has filed regulatory applications in both the EU and the U.S., with possible approvals coming in the third or fourth quarters of this year.Although the market size for Kanuma is still up in the air because the disease often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, according to Synageva, the company noted in a recent investor presentation that most enzyme replacement therapies eventually generate several hundred million in annual revenues once the work of identifying patients has begun in earnest:Source: Synageva corporate presentation.While Synageva looks like it's on the fast track toward following in the footsteps of rare-disease drugmakers such as  , the company's rapid ascent and limited revenue opportunities in the near term present some serious risks that should be carefully considered.First, management is going to have to spend a tremendous amount of money on developing the LAL deficiency market after Kanuma's launch. In short, Kanuma won't be a major revenue source for the company anytime soon, and its launch will more than likely result in an increase in net losses.Next up, the remainder of Synageva's clinical pipeline is extremely early stage:Source: Synageva.What this means in a nutshell is Synageva is years away from becoming cash flow-positive, with most of its resources going into its clinical pipeline and the commercial launch of Kanuma. The company does have a strong balance sheet, with $797 million in cash and zero debt at last count. But its market cap of $4 billion clearly reflects the market's enthusiasm for orphan drugs, more than Synageva's fundamental outlook.A big part of the Baker Brothers' resounding success in the healthcare sector has been their ability to identify undervalued companies with long-tailed growth prospects. In many ways, Synageva fits this classic profile of a Baker Brothers pick -- i.e., the company is only now transitioning into a commercial operation in a space with a bright future in terms of revenue potential.And if the truth be told, the same risks inherent in Synageva could have been applied to BioMarin as well, once upon a time. Now that BioMarin's business plan has unfolded more or less as planned, the result has been nothing short of spectacular for early investors who were willing to take on the risk:By the same token, there's no guarantee that Synageva will turn out to be a leader in the orphan-drug space, and its present market cap, in light of its development stage, is off-putting, in my opinion. So I think average investors may want to take a pass on this stock for the time being. That said, it still looks like a good watch list candidate and a potential buy if its shares pull back in a significant way.

Additionally, with pipeline updates, companies sometimes provide updates on the regulatory front including events like new designations for their candidates, filing of marketing applications or acceptance of these applications for review by regulatory agencies.These updates provide information on experimental drugs and at times give an insight on the commercial potential of the candidate once it is successfully developed and commercialized.Earlier this week,  (  ) announced the commencement of patient dosing in a phase I/II study on its investigational candidate, SBC-103. The company is developing SBC-103 as an enzyme replacement therapy for mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB (MPS IIIB, also known as Sanfilippo B syndrome).Synageva said this is the first study on an enzyme replacement therapy for MPS IIIB. In this study, the company will enroll approximately nine patients in the age group of 2 years to less than 12 years in three different dosing cohorts (0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg). Patients will be treated with intravenous administrations of SBC-103 every alternate week for 24 weeks.Those who meet the qualifying criteria may continue to receive SBC-103 for an extended treatment period of up to 128 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous administration of SBC-103 in patients suffering from MPS IIIB. Preliminary data from the study should be out during the second half of 2015.Additionally, Synageva reported that SBC-103 has been granted fast track status by the FDA.

Although the allure of marijuana's potential from legalization may be enticing, investors could discover that these three investments make more sense -- and come with less risk.Source: Bristol-Myers Squibb It's often been proven that chasing the latest investing fad can be perilous, so while marijuana's potential is intriguing, investors may be better served focusing on great companies, in proven markets, that offer a much clearer opportunity for upside.For example, cancer treatment is a big and growing market that offers plenty of shareholder-friendly growth. There have been substantial strides in cancer treatment since President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971, but it's only recently that innovation, such as the mapping of genes, has unlocked secrets that could revolutionize treatment.Some of the most interesting cancer research is happening at big drug companies like  . In December, the FDA approved Bristol-Myers Opdivo, a melanoma drug that blocks a key mechanism (PD-1) used by cancer cells to sidestep the immune system. Opdivo's potential is so big that industry analysts think its peak sales could eclipse $7 billion by 2020.But Bristol-Myers isn't alone in conducting cutting-edge cancer research. For example,  is working on a drug that may offer hope to cancer patients with a specific gene mutation. Since IMS Health projects that spending on cancer medicine will climb to nearly $100 billion annually by 2020, investors may find that cancer drug investments like these are a better bet than marijuana.Source: Blu. There's long been great debate about whether smoking tobacco or marijuana is worse (or better!) for your health, with many studies, perhaps surprisingly, finding that marijuana might be preferable to tobacco. When it comes to investing, though, consider plunking your hard-earned money into tobacco stocks, not marijuana ones. Some marijuana stocks might perform well over the long term, but at this point, there's more speculation than long track records of solid performance. After all, it's not entirely clear whether or when there will be widespread national recreational use of marijuana, or whether medicinal use approval will grow or falter.Meanwhile, for smoking and non-smoking investors alike, there are tobacco stocks that happen to have been outstanding performers for decades, thanks in part to the fact that they offer a product that is literally addictive.  , for example, which sells the Marlboro brand domestically, among other endeavors, has averaged an annual return of 20.7% over the past  (and more than that over the past five), and recently yielded a solid 3.9%.  , its international counterpart, recently yielded 4.8% and has averaged 16.5% over the past five years.  , which is merging with  , has averaged 27.2% over the past five years, and yields about 3.8%.These aren't slam-dunk long-term investments, though, because they do face some significant challenges, such as a shrinking smoking base domestically, rising taxes on tobacco (often partially aimed at reducing the smoking rate), increased regulations against smoking, and public health campaigns against tobacco use. Still, they're far from dead yet, they generate hefty free cash flow, and they have been responding to threats with some innovation, such as electronic cigarettes, and diversification. (Altria, for example, has a 27% stake in  (NASDAQOTH: SBMRY), a major beer and soft drink company.) If you want to add smoke to your portfolio, think tobacco. Investors have celebrated the legalization of marijuana in states like Colorado and Washington, but they've ignored the potential risk that harsher enforcement of existing federal law prohibiting marijuana could crush emerging businesses in the industry. For my money, I'd prefer sin stocks that have already gone through the legislative wringer, and that points me to alcohol and its Prohibition-busting staying power over the decades.Many argue that alcohol is potentially more destructive than marijuana, but from an investing standpoint, alcohol stocks have done quite well and appear poised to benefit from favorable trends both in the U.S. and around the world. Beer giants  (NYSEMKT: BUD) and  have seen their stocks soar in recent years, with Constellation in particular benefiting from huge growth after its 2013 acquisition of the U.S. rights to market Grupo Modelo beer brands like Corona and Tsingtao.Elsewhere in the industry, spirits manufacturers have seen a spike in interest beyond the beer and wine segment, with innovations like flavored vodka sparking demand from a new generation of consumers.No matter what happens to marijuana, you can count on sellers of beer, wine, and spirits having lasting demand from a thirsty customer base for decades to come. Let me cut right to the chase. There is a product in development that could revolutionize not just how we treat a common chronic illness, but potentially the entire health industry.

The rare-disease specialist's fourth drug approved in the U.S., Vimizim, had such a successful launch that CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime said it could become an  product. He also announced  for BioMarin's drug combating infantile Batten disease.Orphan drugs, with their high barriers to entry and six-figure price tags, have often morphed into huge winners for big biotechs. So it's no surprise that BioMarin is often touted as a possible  . In addition, the company has an outsized pipeline, with four data read-out catalysts probably coming in 2015. Those include key trial data on BMN-111 (dwarfism), due this spring. BioMarin is also in the  to win regulatory approval for a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug it acquired with its  buyout.BioMarin's rare-disease focus makes it a stock perfectly designed for those who don't mind taking the road less traveled. But it never hurts to remember that sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason. (Thank you, Jerry Seinfeld, for that bit of wisdom.) BioMarin has very high R&D ($360 million-plus) for the yearly revenues its generates (around $550 million). But sometimes you get what you pay for in R&D, and thus far, this company has turned out a string of winners.:  looks, to me, like a good pickup in February, because the stock started the year off by absolutely cratering (down over 40% at one point), but not for sound reasons.Specifically, Flamel's shares took a beating after the Food and Drug Administration approved a New Drug Application for  's neostigmine methylsulfate injection on Jan. 14. For those new to this story, Flamel was expected to enjoy a monopoly in the neostigmine market this year with its branded version of the drug called Bloxiverz.Now that the smoke has cleared somewhat, I think this emotionally charged sell-off has created a compelling buying opportunity. My optimism stems from the fact that Flamel's management responded by increasing Bloxiverz's price a whopping 175% to $98.75 per vial. And as Fresenius isn't expected to launch its drug for another quarter or two, this dramatic price increase should help to more than compensate for any loss in revenue later in the year.Based on all the available information, Flamel's shares thus appear to be trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of something along the lines of 7, depending on how long it takes a competitor to reach the market. In a sector where the average P/E ratio tops 22, this stock looks cheap by comparison, making it worth checking out.: The FDA could give  a big boost later this month. That's because the U.S. drug regulator is set to announce whether it will approve expanding the use of Celgene's top-selling multiple myeloma drug Revlimid as a first-line multiple myeloma therapy.Currently, Revlimid is the market share-leading second-line treatment in patients who have seen their disease return after being treated with at least one other treatment. Since multiple myeloma patients often relapse, Revlimid sales totaled nearly $5 billion last year, up 16% from 2013.That already makes Revlimid one of the best-selling cancer-fighting drugs on the market, but Revlimid's sales could head even higher if the FDA approves its use as a first-line treatment. Celgene estimates that Revlimid's sales could climb to between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion in 2015. Even better, Celgene thinks the first-line approval and the potential for a future approval for maintenance therapy could push Revlimid's sales to as much as $7 billion in 2017. That forecast suggests that investors should be watching the FDA closely on Feb. 22 -- the date that its decision on Revlimid is expected. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase.

Additionally, seven of the nine patients with matched baseline age and disease severity fared better than their natural history counterparts.Based on the initial promising data, the company plans to work with regulatory authorities to see if this single study will be enough to support approval.

Vimizim is currently toting around a $380,000 price tag. Overall, Morquio syndrome only afflicts one in every 200,000-300,000 people, and Vimizim specifically treats only one type of the disease, meaning its patient pool is even narrower.At the moment, BioMarin isn't profitable, but the expectation would be that a few more approvals and little chance of any near-term competition will change that in a big way by the end of the decade.Alexion Pharmaceuticals throws diversity out the window; its only FDA-approved drug is Soliris, a treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, a rare blood disorder that leads to the destruction of a patient's red blood cells, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, or aHUS, a genetic deficiency that leads to progressive damage to vital organs and can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, or death.Source: Synageva BioPharma.On top of five in-house preclinical programs, Synageva is also running a phase 1/2 study of SBC-103 as a treatment for Sanfilippo B syndrome.

It's present in about one in every 70,000 births.Synageva likely carries the most risk of these three as it doesn't have a single approved product as of yet and will carry losses nearly to the end of the decade.

Our Motley Fool contributors explain what these warning signals are and how to use them to reduce the risks that come along with investing in biotech stocks. : Biotech is a risky business, and the rapid exit of a CEOcan signal major turbulence ahead, as with the high profile case of  . If top management's exit is coupled with a heavy debt load -- as was the situation when Dendreon's CEO John Johnson exited in June of last year -- watch out. The company may be heading straight for the rocks.When Johnson said his goodbyes, the cancer vaccine maker had $620 million in convertible debt and a market cap of $350 million. Still, the company had seen success in the clinic, and that is often equated with success for biotech investors.Dendreon was a pioneer in immunotherapy, and its prostate cancer vaccine, Provenge, was once expected to be a blockbuster. Johnson did what he could for the company, including securing marketing authorization for Provenge in the European Union. But the sales ran into trouble right away, due in part to the drug's whopping $93,000 price tag.Five months after Johnson left, on Nov. 10, the company plunged 81% after it filed for bankruptcy. This is just one instance, and not every CEO departure means imminent failure, but big shifts in management should always raise warning flags, especially when coupled with debt. : Large pharmaceutical companies are constantly looking to offermarketing partnerships to smaller biotech companies, which reduce research and development costs at the larger company while injecting the smaller one with cash. But when partnerships are dissolved and drugs are returned to a company, a smaller company (especially one with a narrow pipeline) could be gutted.For example,  handed the failed Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug drisapersen back to  last January. Since drisapersen was Prosensa's lead candidate, the company's stock plummeted 85% in the two months following the announcement. Fortunately,  agreed in November to acquire Prosensa for up to $840 million, helping shareholders recoup some of their steep losses.Another example from last year was the end of a partnership between  and  . Inovio's core pipeline consists of immunotherapies for hepatitis B and C, cancer, and even HIV that are derived from synthetic DNA and delivered via electrical pulses.The problem is that Inovio has not had a single drug approved since being founded over three decades ago. That's why investors perked up when Roche and Inovio inked two collaborations for prostate cancer and hepatitis B vaccines in September 2013, which included an up-front payment of $10 million and $412.5 million in potential milestone payments. But Roche abandoned the prostate cancer partnership in November, eliminating a large portion of those payments and casting doubts on Inovio's other pipeline candidates.Therefore, if one of your smaller biotech bets loses a major pharma partnership, it could be time to reevaluate your investment. : Relying on the old maxim \"cash is king\" might keep investors from getting stuck in a soon-to-fail biotech company.A strong balance sheet is critical to biotech companies, given that most are emerging businesses without approved revenue-producing products and are spending big bucks on research and development. According to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, it costs drugmakers $1.395 billion to develop one drug; that steep price tag means biotech stocks have little room for mistakes, particularly if research pipelines are a bit thin.As a result, investors should pay particular attention to biotech stocks' cash burn rate per month. To calculate that rate, simply divide the change in cash for a specific period by the number of months in that period. Once you have the monthly burn rate calculated, you can divide cash on the balance sheet by the rate to see how long the company can spend at that pace before tapping investors or banks for additional capital. I become most nervous when a company has six months or less of cash, particularly if its drugs are still in midstage trials and debt levels already exceed the cash on the books, which could signal that investors and lenders might become increasingly unwilling to provide financing. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase.

(Symbol: BMRN) priced a 8,500,000 share secondary stock offering at $93.25 per share. Buyers in that offering made a considerable investment into the company, expecting that their investment would go up over the course of time and based on early trading on Tuesday, the stock is now 5.1% above the offering price.Investors who did not participate in the offering but would be a buyer of BMRN at a cheaper price, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2016 put at the $85 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $8.90. That would result in a cost basis of $76.10 per share before broker commissions in the scenario where the contract is exercised. If the contract is never exercised, the put seller would still keep the premium, which represents a 10.5% return against the $85.00 purchase commitment, or a 10.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Secondaries can often present buying opportunities for bullish investors interested in purchasing shares, because the sudden extra supply of stock tends to require that the offering be priced at an attractive discount to where the stock had previously been trading before the offering announcement. That can also introduce near-term volatility which improves the premiums a put seller can achieve. Selling a put does not give an investor access to BMRN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of IBB, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, IBB's low point in its 52 week range is $207.48 per share, with $319.14 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $305.72. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ource: Celgene CorporationThe biotechnology industry has been one of the best performing baskets in the stock market this year, but just because biotech stocks were kind to investors this year doesn't necessarily mean that they'll rally next year, too.Biotech stocks can move significantly higher or lower in any given year due to investor's reaction to data from ongoing drug trials, so I like to focus on biotech stocks that already generate healthy sales, that also have intriguing drugs in their pipeline. That way I can still benefit from sales growth from existing therapies even if a promising drug fails during its clinical trials. Using those criteria, I've come up with five companies that may be worth considering for portfolios in 2015. Read on to learn what biotech stocks I think may be in store for upside next year. is one of biotech's biggest and brightest shining stars. The company's top selling HIV drug franchise, which includes five separate drugs that could deliver a billion dollars or more in sales this year, is fueling acquisitions and research that are generating impressive growth.For example, the company's $11 billion acquisition of Pharmasset in 2012 netted the company Sovaldi, a therapy for hepatitis C that launched last December and has already generated more than $8 billion in sales through the first nine months of this year. Gilead Sciences' research efforts are expanding the company's HIV lineup, including a successor to Viread, and have resulted in the launch of the company's second-generation hepatitis C drug, Harvoni, in October. Looking ahead, Gilead Sciences is developing next generation HIV drugs, potentially game-changing therapies for hepatitis B, cardiovascular treatments, and the company should begin getting traction in oncology too. The company's first cancer drug Zydelig was launched this past summer. 's top selling multiple myeloma therapy Revlimid is on pace to deliver annual sales of more than $5 billion, but sales of the drug could  in 2015 if the FDA gives the company approval to begin marketing Revlimid as a front-line therapy. Currently, Revlimid is used a second-line treatment, but the FDA will make a decision on expanding the label in February.In addition to Revlimid, Celgene also markets the cancer drug Abraxane, a treatment used in breast cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer patients. Abraxane's sales have climbed sharply in the past year after receiving approval for pancreatic cancer patients in 2013, but Celgene's fastest-growing drug is Pomalyst, a third line therapy for multiple myeloma that saw its sales grow 159% year over year to $478 million during the first nine months of 2014. Thanks to those drugs and a promising pipeline that includes partnership and equity stakes in emerging biotech stars  ,  , and  , Celgene could be positioned to see its shares climb in 2015.Source: BioMarin When it comes to ushering high-priced drugs for small patient populations through clinical trials, few have a better track record than  .The company's existing product lineup includes the $395,000 per year Naglazyme, a treatment for mucopolysaccharidosis VI, or MPS VI, a rare, life-threatening inherited disorder. Sales of Naglazyme totaled $246 million through the first nine months of this year, up 21% from last year, but BioMarin is enjoying rapid growth for its other drugs Kuvan and Vimizim, too.Kuvan is a treatment for a rare genetic disorder known as Phenylketonuria and its sales are up 19% to $146 million through the first three quarters of 2014. Vimizim, which is used to treat patients with Morquio A Syndrome, won the FDA go-ahead in February and its sales already total $40 million this year.These drugs already had BioMarin targeting a goal of $1 billion in annual sales, but the company strengthened its product pipeline further last month when it  it was acquiring Prosensa, a company with a promising treatment for Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD, that is in phase 3 trials. In addition to this potential DMD treatment, BioMarin's pipeline also includes phase three stage drugs for the treatment of certain genetically caused cancers, pompe disease, and patients who don't respond to Kuvan. As a result, if BioMarin continues to put up solid growth for its existing drugs and delivers strong trial data, 2015 could be another profitable year for its investors. doesn't have a product portfolio or pipeline as big as Gilead, Celgene, and BioMarin, but it does have one of the fastest-growing therapies for the treatment of prostate cancer, the most common cancer diagnosed in men. Since its launch in 2012, the company's Xtandi has become the leading postchemotherapy medicine used in advanced prostate cancer patients, outpacing competitor  's Zytiga. Xtandi's third quarter sales in the U.S. climbed 67% year over year to $181 million and, thanks to recent launches overseas, sales outside the U.S. jumped to $119.6 million last quarter. Xtandi's sales could head significantly higher in 2015; however, thanks to the FDA expanding its label in September to include prechemotherapy patients. The combination of pre- and postchemotherapy indications has been a boon for J&J's Zytiga, which had sales of $1.6 billion during the first nine months of this year. Zytiga's revenue suggests that if Xtandi can win away prechemotherapy market share at a similar rate as it did in the postchemotherapy indication, 2015 could prove to be another banner year for growth. Similar to Medivation,  markets one highly successful drug. The company's Eylea, a therapy used to treat vision loss tied to age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular degeneration, or DME, posted sales of $722 million in the third quarter, up 48% year over year. Sales should continue to improve in 2015 given that the FDA approval for use in DME patients was granted just this past summer, but Eylea is only one reason that 2015 may prove to be a big year for Regeneron.The company is developing alirocumab, a cholesterol fighting drug that inhibits PCSK9. Analysts think that PCSK9 targeting drugs like alirocumab and  evolocumab could become top sellers given that prior generation cholesterol battling statins remain some of the globe's most-prescribed medicine.  Lipitor, for example, was once the world's best selling drug, with annual sales of $13 billion.Regeneron and  , its partner on the drug (and an equity owner of Regeneron), plan to file for alirocumab's approval before year-end using a priority review voucher that could result in an FDA decision next summer. Beyond alirocumab, Regeneron is also conducting ongoing phase 3 trials for drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. If Eylea sales continue to grow globally, alirocumab gets the FDA green-light, and these other studies deliver solid data, shares could head higher next year.Gilead Sciences, Celgene, BioMarin, Medivation, and Regeneron all have the benefit of fast-growing, top-selling drugs already on the market, but that doesn't mean they're a lock to deliver on expected growth. Biotech companies need to execute on their marketing and development programs if they hope to reward investors. That means making wise investments in marketing and sales that don't weigh down profit margin and focusing their attention and resources on the most promising of their research programs. That being said, the potential for balance sheet friendly sales and profit at these five companies suggests to me that investors may want to consider owning them next year. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks. But if you want to make sure that 2015 is  best investing year ever, you need to know where to start.

A 21-way tie for first place. All 21 companies got a single vote.I kid you not. As I'm writing this, more than 48 hours after Schoenebaum made his tweet, there wasn't a single duplicate in the bunch. And that's with quite a few people offering their second-best choice as well. At first, the lack of consensus surprised me. You'd think there'd be some company that people on  would have latched on to. Twitter is the perfect place for the herd mentality to kick in.But looking at the list a little closer, there are a few themes that I think investors on Twitter have identified even if they didn't pick the same stocks. As it should be, innovation was a big theme among Twitter's followers. One person recommended  , which recently announced additional positive data suggesting its next-generation gene therapy treatment can cure patients with beta-thalassemia.Big pharmas, which you usually don't associate with innovation, were also metioned. @GantosJ picked  and  specifically for their immuno-oncology drugs that help block a repressor of the immune system that keeps the immune cells from attacking the tumor. Merck's Keytruda was approved in the U.S. this year, and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo is approved in Japan and is on track for an FDA approval before the end of March. Both  and  , which is buying Sarepta's rival  , made the list. Sarepta and Prosensa are developing drugs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, for which there isn't a treatment currently. BioMarin already has drugs on the market for other orphan drug indications. ' obeticholic acid is being tested in three different liver diseases, but nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is the indication with the most promise for the company, given the lack of treatments and the large market.A couple of other companies on the list are also developing drugs for unmet needs:  is working on drugs for pediatric epilepsy, and  's antibiotics are designed to treat bacteria that have become resistant to other antibiotics. Quite a few picks --  ,  ,  , and  -- are primarily focused on developing drugs to treat various cancers.  , a diagnostic company with tests to help doctors know how to treat tumors, was also mentioned as a top pick by one of Schoenebaum's followers.While it's tempting to call this a trend, there are probably more biotechs focused on cancer than on any other disease, so it's hard to read too much into the number of picks in this category. Two recommended companies have a combined market cap of $37 million. I know nothing about either company and don't really care to investigate further. Investors buying shares are pricing the companies as if they're long shots.Might one hit? Sure, but most investors will come out ahead by avoiding biotech  . That goes double if they're recommended in 140 characters by people on Twitter whom you've never met. Finally, you need a sense of humor to invest in this industry. One person chose Chiron, following up with an \"oh ... wait.\" Clearly a joke, since  acquired the biotech in 2006. The parody account @BioTurdCEO suggested  , which declared bankruptcy last year. Considering the source, I think it's safe to assume that was a joke.Former-CNBC-reporter-turned-PR-guy Mike Huckman didn't offer any suggestions but instead wondered where he put his crystal ball and suggested a dartboard might be of use to answer Schoenebaum's question. Sometimes it feels like that, Mike. Healthcare stocks soared in 2014, and 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

That makes it exceedingly difficult for biotech companies to remain in front of the pack. In order to maintain their lead, drugmakers need to think smarter and act more quickly than their peers. Here's how three leaders,  ,  , and  , are doing just that.In the middle of November, Gilead Sciences spent $125 million to buy a priority review voucher it will be able to use to fast track FDA review of any drug of its choice. Gilead Sciences bought the voucher from Knight Therapeutics, a Canadian drugmaker, in an auction last month.These biotechnology companies are among the most successful in execution, both in terms of ushering new drugs through clinical trials to market and turning those drugs into commercial successes. While Gilead Sciences, BioMarin, and Amgen's moves are incredibly intriguing, they're far from the only decisions being made to deliver future investor-friendly growth. Regardless, they serve as examples of how forward-thinking biotechnology companies need to be if they hope to dominate their markets for years to come. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase. There is a product in development that will revolutionize not just how we treat a common chronic illness, but potentially the entire health industry.

Even though there was very little company-specific news to speak of last month, the dominant stories on the feed for Sarepta investors concerned a handful of prospective shareholder lawsuits against the company for alleged breach of fiduciary responsibilities. It's no surprise that Sarepta's shares had been volatile during the year, with sales of DMD drug eteplirsen essentially equating to most of its market value, but delays in filing a new drug application for eteplirsen, as well as perceived miscommunication between the company and the Food and Drug Administration, have led to the threat of legal action against Sarepta. These lawsuits, aside from being a distraction, can also get costly and could cause Sarepta to  .Also, Sarepta shareholders have had time to think about BioMarin's purchase of Prosensa and they're left wondering what the heck just happened. Prosensa wound up being scooped up for a 55% premium to its prior-day closing price despite the fact that drisapersen, its DMD drug hopeful, failed to meet its primary endpoint in late-stage studies despite performing well in mid-stage trials. Upon deeper analysis, drisapersen studies did allude to positive results in the early stages of the disease, but there are no guarantees that the drug will ever find its way to pharmacy shelves. I believe Sarepta shareholders have to be disappointed that it wasn't their company being purchased instead considering eteplirsen appears to have a much better shot at gaining FDA approval than drisapersen. If we've learned anything by now it's that Sarepta is going to live or die by eteplirsen. On one hand, I have been extremely disappointed by the back and forth  between Saretpa's management and the FDA. The two of them not being on the same page has cost the company quite a bit of market value, and it's delayed the potential approval of a game-changing drug that DMD patients need sooner rather than later.Source: Sarepta Therapeutics.Then again, the limited data pool we have so far shows a remarkable improvement for eteplirsen-treated DMD patients. Through 144 weeks, eteplirsen-treated patients have seen the distance of their six-minute walk test decline by 33.2 meters, a 75.1-meter improvement over the control group which would be expected to see a 108.3-meter walking distance decline over 144 weeks. . Similarly, those in the control group through the first 24 weeks who then were switched over to eteplirsen have demonstrated a minimal decline since week 36.The data shows promise for eteplirsen, but management's miscues and its reliance on one drug to drive most of its current market value make owning this stock a potentially scary proposition.

BioMarin is looking to acquire Dutch company, Prosensa, and could end up paying up to $840 million for the acquisition. This includes two $80 million payments which depend on the time-specific approval of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) candidate, drisapersen. While it's a high risk deal considering drisapersen failed in a phase III study and GlaxoSmithKline backed out of a partnership agreement for drisapersen, rewards will be equally high if drisapersen gains regulatory approval. Although quite a few companies are working on bringing DMD treatments to market, Prosensa has already started the rolling NDA submission in the U.S. and could have a head start over competitors if approval comes on schedule. Prosensa shares shot up 62.6% on the acquisition news (Read more:  ).2. Clinical-stage biotech company, Five Prime Therapeutics, struck a deal with Bristol-Myers under which Five Prime's antibody (FPA008) will be evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers' promising PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab). The combination will be evaluated for safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in six types of cancer - non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and malignant glioma. This marks the second immuno-oncology collaboration between the companies. Immuno-oncology is an area that has been attracting a lot of attention and the possibility of combining antibodies targeting PD-1 and CSF1R to get an enhanced anti-tumor immune response looks interesting and may well represent the next generation of immunotherapies for cancer patients. Five Prime's shares shot up 31.4% on the deal.3. AbbVie could gain EU approval for its experimental HCV cocktail treatment sometime in the first quarter of 2015. The EU's CHMP has provided positive opinions for the investigational, all-oral, interferon-free treatment of Viekirax plus Exviera for use with or without ribavirin (RBV) in patients with genotype 1 (GT1) and genotype 4 (GT4) chronic HCV infection. Meanwhile, a response from the FDA regarding the approval status of the candidate should be out shortly (Read more:  ).4. Amgen (  ) has decided that it will not be continuing with studies being conducted on its advanced gastric cancer treatment, rilotumumab. The company's decision was based on a planned safety review of a late-stage study which showed a higher incidence in the number of deaths in the rilotumumab and chemotherapy arm compared to the chemotherapy only arm (Read more:  ). Meanwhile, Amgen and partner AstraZeneca fared well in a phase III study with their experimental psoriasis drug, brodalumab, beating Johnson and Johnson's Stelara. The companies are now planning to enter into discussions regarding regulatory filings.5. Biogen's (  ) oral multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment, Tecfidera, will now carry a warning in its label regarding the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and subsequent death of a MS patient who was being treated with Tecfidera. On its third quarter call in October, Biogen had confirmed the PML case. Tecfidera, approved in the U.S. in Mar 2013 and the EU in Feb 2014, is one of Biogen's most successful product launches. Tecfidera, which is the number one oral MS treatment in the U.S., has already brought in sales of $1.99 billion in the first nine months of 2014. The updated label should not impact scrips significantly - with one PML case being reported out of more than 100,000 patients, patients may be willing to overlook safety concerns given Tecfidera's impressive efficacy.Over the last five trading days, Celgene was the highest gainer with shares increasing 4.02%. Meanwhile, Gilead lost the most during this period (down 2.51%).Vertex (  ) recorded the highest gain (60.74%) among major biotechs over the last six months.Overall, the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was up 1.51% over the last five trading days (See the last biotech stock roundup here:  ).\n  \nWhile nothing specific is lined up later this week, stay tuned for the usual pipeline and regulatory updates.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Either way, the program adds a financial incentive for companies to develop drugs for neglected tropical diseases.Credit: Dafne Cholet via The catch: To use the voucher, the owner has to give the FDA at least a 365-day warning that it plans to use the voucher for a future marketing application.The $125 million price tag looks mighty expensive considering that  and  bought  ' priority voucher for just $67.6 million a few months ago. BioMarin acquired that voucher under a different program for rare pediatric diseases, and the voucher only requires the owner to give the FDA a 90-day warning, so it's more useful and should therefore be worth more not less.At least, at this point. There's actually legislation in Congress that could reduce the FDA leeway requirement for tropical disease vouchers to just 90 days and allow the vouchers to be sold more than once.We don't know what the auction process for the two vouchers was like, but it appears that Gilead should have outbid Regeneron and Sanofi, potentially getting BioMarin's voucher for less than $125 million. According to my calculations though, it looks more like Regeneron and Sanofi got a deal on their voucher than Gilead overpaid for its.The value of a voucher can be broken down into three parts:Getting revenue four months early shouldn't contribute much extra value except under rare situations where a drug is an instant blockbuster. And those drugs usually garner priority reviews on their own because they offer \"significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications\" according to the FDA.The extra four months of patent life is actually quite valuable if peak sales are high enough.The potential to get to market early, allowing the companies to compete with other drugs for patients, is hard to quantify, but it's certainly an added bonus that can justify purchasing a priority voucher.Regeneron and Sanofi plan to use their voucher for their cholesterol drug alirocumab, which will be submitted to the FDA shortly. The drug will face competition from  's evolocumab, which is in the same class, inhibiting a protein called PCSK9. Amgen has already submitted its application to the FDA, but Regeneron and Sanofi could jump ahead of Amgen's Aug. 27, 2015, FDA action date if the companies submit their application and voucher before the end of December.We could speculate what drug Gilead might use its priority voucher on, but it probably isn't worth the effort. There's a good chance that Gilead didn't buy the voucher with any drug in mind but will use it strategically in the future on a drug where the benefits justify the cost. The voucher could even end up being used on a drug Gilead has yet to gain rights to through an acquisition or license. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase.

BioMarin is a smart cookie when it comes to rare disease drugs, but I'd be remiss if I didn't say I was scratching my head on this one. It'd be one thing if drisapersen's future as a DMD therapy looked bright, but it actually  last year after it showed no benefit over the placebo, although a deeper analysis demonstrated it could be effective in early stages of the disease. Furthermore, previous drisapersen partner  walked away from its portion of the deal, leaving Prosensa with all remaining study and development costs moving forward. If Glaxo didn't want drisapersen, what does BioMarin see that it didn't?In addition, this is shaping up to be a somewhat competitive space in spite of DMD being a rare disease.  has  for its experimental drug eteplirsen on its relatively small dozen-patient midstage cohort which continued to show a statistically significant benefit in the six-minute walk test compared to the progression typically observed in non-eteplirsen-dosed patients. Though Sarepta has had its issues getting on the same page with the Food and Drug Administration, it would appear that a new drug application filing could happen in early 2015.As things stand now I'd be jumping for joy and buying drinks for everyone at the local bar if I were a Prosensa shareholder and possibly banging my head against the wall if I owned BioMarin shares. I could certainly be wrong and drisapersen could prove effective in treating early stage DMD, but the phase 3 results compounded by GlaxoSmithKline walking tells me everything I need to know about Prosensa. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

Buying Eastman Kodak rather than the upstart Apple () with its camera phone thingies probably looked to some like the smart, conservative play back in 2007, but ignoring change can be costly. Immunotherapy could be viewed as simply a buzzword by some, but it truly represents a fundamental shift, not just in the way cancer is treated, but also in the way treatment is approached. As such, it could be argued that staying on the right side of this particular historic shift is essential if an investor wants to keep up with or even beat market performance over the long term.Immunotherapy has changed the approach to cancer treatment by encouraging our own bodies to fight the disease rather than attacking it from outside. Put simply, our immune systems recognize and react to most cancer when it comes, but the cancer itself suppresses our body\u2019s ability to destroy it. Immunotherapy drugs attack the mechanisms and techniques that the cancerous cells use to do that. In some ways using the immune system is nothing new; Edward Jenner produced the first vaccine based on that principle at the end of the 18th century. As a cancer treatment, however, immunotherapy is not that old, but still has been around longer than many believe. The first drug in the class, Rituximab, was approved in 1997.Just as with vaccines, however, a different drug is needed for each different disease and with cancer, that is a mammoth task as there are thousands of variations. The biotech field has become immensely risky for investors as many have tried new variations of the basic approach to treatment. Some have succeeded and some have failed, making long term investing in the field tricky at best. Most of these companies are highly leveraged, so failure is often catastrophic and no investor can take too many total losses in a portfolio. This makes immunotherapy an area where spreading risk by using an ETF is smart. This sector is immensely technical, extremely diverse and just too fast moving for most retail investors to keep up with.In fact, in this case it would pay to go even further and split an investment between two ETFs. It is an indication of how diverse this area is that if you buy the top two biotech ETFs by market capitalization there is zero overlap in their top 5 holdings. The largest fund, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Fund () holds a total of 126 companies led by Amgen (), Celgene (), Regeneron (), Gilead () and Biogen Idec () while the more focused First Trust NYSE ARCA Biotech Index Fund () has 30 holdings led by Incyte (), Isis (), Biomarin (), Alkermes () and Pharmacyclics ().As you can see, both funds have had a pretty spectacular year, leading some to conclude that all of the value has gone or that there is a bubble in the field just waiting to pop. I would refer those people back to the example of Apple and this chart for the year before the first iPhone launch.IBB and FBT are up 44 percent and 53 percent respectively over the last 12 months, but if that puts you off consider that Apple was up 123 percent in the year shown above.It is almost impossible to grasp the amount of growth that can be achieved when an industry or sector makes a truly significant advance. Immunotherapy is, to use a modern day clich\u00e9, a real game changer. A short term view may give the impression that the sector is overvalued, but it is likely that we have only just begun. It is hard to argue that either IBB or FBT look cheap right now, but for a long term investment what matters is how cheap today\u2019s pricing will look in 10-20 years. On that basis broad based exposure to the industry should be a part of every investor\u2019s portfolio.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Source: Vertex Pharmaceuticals.Though  ' Kalydeco is admittedly expensive, it's also a considerable step forward over prior treatments, and thus partially justifiable in its price tag. When the drug was approved in January 2012, it was targeted at the G551D mutation, which covers about 4% of all forms of cystic fibrosis. Vertex is in the process of attempting to  for Kalydeco to a handful of additional mutations. On the bright side, Vertex has set up financial assistance for eligible patients to help offset the exorbitant costs of its drug. ,  Developed by  , a company  , Naglazyme costs close to a half-million dollars annually and treats mucopolysaccharidosis type VI, which is better known as Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, a progressive condition that causes a person's organs to enlarge and often presents with skeletal abnormalities. According to data from EvaluatePharma, just 64 people in the U.S. were prescribed Naglazyme last year.Next year, it's likely Vimizim will also work its way onto this list with an annual price tag of $380,000. Vimizim treats Morquio syndrome, another rare inherited disease where the body lacks or is missing a substance needed to break down long-chain sugar molecules, and was approved in February. While BioMarin isn't profitable at the moment, it also has no concerns about generic competition considering the rare diseases it's focused on. , Source: Alexion Pharmaceuticals.Taking the  is  ' lone approved drug Soliris, which treats a rare blood disorder known as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a condition where a patients' red blood cells die prematurely. Soliris is also approved to treat atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, another rare and chronic blood disease that can lead to renal failure.Don't get me wrong; this isn't to say Soliris isn't amazing. When it was approved in 2007 to treat PNH, it became the first complement inhibitor approved in the U.S. to treat  disease. It also gave PNH patients, who often lived about 10-15 years following their diagnosis, the prospect of a longer life. But from a business standpoint, it also gives Alexion a viable reason to sell its half-million-dollar-plus drug to PNH patients for a decade or longer. With drug prices soaring and more pharmaceutical companies focusing on these higher-margin, higher-priced drugs, it's quite possible a battle could wind up brewing between pharmaceutical companies on one end and insurers and pharmacy-benefit managers on the other.The danger with pricing pharmaceutical products high, of course, is that insurers may simply choose to leave a drug off of their approved purchase list, which would be bad news for the manufacturing company as well as for patients if the drug is superior to what's already on the market. Though we haven't witnessed much in the way of pushback from insurers and PBMs in recent years, I would expect their tune to change if more and more drugs continue to work their way into the six-digit annual cost category.Recent tax increases have affected nearly every American taxpayer.

Consequently, Catalyst Pharma expects to initiate a rolling new drug application submission in early 2015.We expect investor focus to remain on updates relating to the Firdapse study. It is going to be a challenge for the company as amifampridine, the active ingredient in Firdapse, will continue to be available from compounding pharmacies and is likely to be substantially less expensive than Firdapse.Apart from Firdapse, Catalyst Pharma is evaluating its pipeline candidate CPP-115 in multiple indications including epilepsy and other neurological indications. However, the competition has intensified substantially in the epilepsy market also with competitors like UCB's (  ) Keppra, among others.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Catalyst Pharma is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. : Earnings ESP for Catalyst Pharma is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are a loss of 6 cents per share. : Catalyst Pharma carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP, the company's 0.00% ESP makes a surprise prediction difficult.We recommend caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is one other company you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Mallinckrodt (  ) has an earnings ESP of +5.22% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

For the quarter, BioMarin Pharmaceutical reported revenue of $176.8 million, 29.1% higher than the year-ago period, led by $25.2 million in Vimizim revenue in just its second full quarter since it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, a 22.5% increase in Kuvan's net revenue, and a 6.8% increase in sales of BioMarin's best-selling drug Naglazyme, which also happens to be one of the  .BioMarin's adjusted loss per share grew to $22.9 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to an adjusted loss of $16.7 million in Q3 2013. However, on a GAAP basis (which factors in one-time costs and benefits, or costs and benefits considered to be non-recurring) BioMarin earned $0.05 per share in profits compared to a GAAP loss of $0.38 in the year-ago period. The big swing was because of the one-time sale and profit of the company's Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher for $67.5 million. Comparatively, Wall Street was expecting a loss of $0.38 per share on an adjusted basis (meaning BioMarin crushed adjusted estimates by $0.22 per share), while the Street was looking for a more robust $209.6 million in sales.In addition, BioMarin boosted its full-year sales guidance to a fresh range of $700 million-$710 million, which is up nicely from its prior forecast of $680 million-$700 million.Also helping BioMarin is speculation (which has been going on for years) that it could be a buyout target. BioMarin is right in the sweet spot of the buyout valuation range and its focus on rare disease drugs means incredible pricing power and practically no competition.Source:  user Alberta Innovation and Advanced Education. While I couldn't agree more that BioMarin is a potentially attractive takeover candidate, I'm absolutely terrified by the company's current valuation considering that it isn't expected to be profitable until 2017 at the earliest.One positive for BioMarin is that competition for its disease indications is  . It would cost a lot of money for a rival biopharmaceutical company to develop a competing drug only to wind up splitting sales, so BioMarin is likely going to hang onto its full share of existing disease indications for a long time. Pricing will also work in BioMarin's favor as long as it serves a handful of patients and few, if any, alternative treatment options exist.However, BioMarin's ongoing losses and limited patient pool make it a very risky play here with a valuation north of $12 billion. I'm used to investors looking into future, but I foresee them valuing BioMarin based on its 2020 earnings potential ... which doesn't make much sense to me. Given that, current shareholders may want to consider taking some of their chips off the table here. If you're on the outside looking in, I'd suggest keeping your distance until there's a sizable pullback.

But ultra-orphan-drugmaker  has a more realistic short-term goal: have $1 billion in sales for biotech's basket of five drugs.It's getting there. In the third quarter, revenue increased 29%, to $177 million, more than two-thirds of the way to the $250 million per quarter required for the company to reach its goal. Much of the growth came from its newest drug Vimizim for Morquio A syndrome. BioMarin recorded $25 million in sales of the drug in just its second full quarter on the market, a solid 76% quarter-over-quarter increase. The fast uptake has come from clinical trial patients switching over to commercial prescriptions, so sales growth in the U.S. may slow; but the EU is further behind, so we should still see growth there and in Latin America, as well as Brazil, where it's awaiting approval.Source: BioMarin Pharmaceuticals.Kuvan was another solid performer, with sales growing 22.5% year over year. The new powder formulation that can be dissolved in water or juice to make it easy for younger children has helped with new patient starts.Sales of Naglazyme are always choppy due to lumpy ordering from Latin America; this quarter was no different. Revenue was only 6.8% higher than the year-ago quarter and substantially lower than the second quarter of the year. The better way to look at the growth is the year-to-date numbers, where sales of Naglazyme are up 21.5% over the same period in 2013.Revenue from Aldurazyme, which is sold by  's Genzyme, fell slightly, but that was due to adjustments used to reconcile timing of product transfer. Genzyme recorded a 6.9% year-over-year growth in sales of the drug in the third quarter.BioMarin's fifth drug, Firdapse, remains a token side note with sales of just $4.6 million in the third quarter.With the solid earnings under its belt, BioMarin raised its 2014 guidance. Again. The biotech is now looking for revenue of $700 million to $710 million for the year. That's fairly remarkable considering that guidance at the start of the year was for revenue to come in between $650 million and $680 million. The increased revenue and slightly decreased expectations for research and development costs for the year allowed BioMarin to lower its expected non-GAAP loss for the year to between $50 million and $65 million from a previous expectation of between $60 million and $80 million.BioMarin is a far cry from being profitable on a GAAP basis -- losses should come in north of $160 million for the year -- but the non-GAAP is a better measure of its cash flow. The company has slightly more cash, cash equivalents, and investments now than it did at the start of the year.With the next drug approval, PEG PAL, not expected until the second half of 2016 -- assuming everything stays on track for the drug -- the current crop of drugs are going to have to be enough to get the biotech to blockbuster status. The goal seems reasonable given the growth BioMarin has seen recently.

The narrower-than-expected loss was primarily due to higher revenues, driven by strong Vimizim sales.Total revenues climbed 32.2% to $177.1 million in the reported quarter but failed to beat Zacks Consensus Estimate of $198 million. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher net product revenues.Vimizim contributed $25.2 million to total revenues in the third quarter of 2014.Net product revenues from Kuvan were up 22.5% to $53.4 million. The impressive rise was due to higher demand for the drug. BioMarin had launched Kuvan in powder form for oral solution earlier in the year. The launch of the new formulation also contributed to sales growth.Naglazyme sales in the quarter increased 6.8% year over year to $67.5 million.BioMarin receives royalties from its partner Sanofi (  ) on Aldurazyme. Aldurazyme royalties (excluding transfer revenues) amounted to $22.9 million in the third quarter, up 11.7% year over year.Firdapse revenues came in at $4.7 million, up 14.6% year over year.Both research & development (R&D) expenses (up 42.7%) and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses (up 20.6%) were steeper during the quarter. BioMarin's efforts to develop its pipeline led to the increase in R&D expenses. Costs associated with the marketing of Vimizim pushed up SG&A expenses.BioMarin upped its earnings guidance for 2014 yet again. BioMarin now expects total revenues in the range of $700 million to $710 million (old guidance: $680 million to $700 million).The raised outlook reflects the continued strong performance of Vimizim and updated expectations.Naglazyme revenues are still expected in the range of $305 million to $320 million. The company expects Kuvan net product sales in the range of $190 million to $200 million (old guidance: $180 million to $200 million). The company projects 2014 Vimizim sales in the range of $65 million to $70 million (old guidance: $60 million to $70 million).SG&A guidance remains unchanged at $280 million to $295 million. The company lowered its R&D guidance to the range of $455 million to $470 million (old guidance: $460 million to $480 million).BioMarin lowered its net loss guidance to $50 million to $65 million (old guidance: $60 million to $80 million). The guidance reflects higher revenues and lower R&D expenses.The U.S. adoption of Vimizim as well as uptake in the EU has been promising, even surpassing the company's expectation.BioMarin expects multiple pipeline related news in 2015.

But that isn't happening in all cases.Instead, fearing that a flood of new patient prescriptions will result in crippling costs, some healthcare payers are balking at approving the use of Harvoni in all but the most advanced cases of hepatitis C. And it's not just for-profit insurers that are holding back treatment. Worry that Harvoni may swamp budgets also appears to have State Medicaid programs rationing access to it.When Gilead won approval for its $1,000 per pill hepatitis C drug Sovaldi last winter, some heralded the event as the dawn of a new generation of sky-high medicine prices.Historically, the most expensive drugs treated the rarest of conditions. Drugs like  's Acthar for nephrotic syndrome,  's Soliris for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and  's Naglazyme break the bank, with prices ranging from $205,681 per year to $536,629 per year. Drugmakers argued -- and many agreed -- that the patient population for the indications they treat is so small that the drugs may not have been developed if not for their high price tags.But Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni don't treat a small patient population. They treat hepatitis C, a disease that afflicts 3 million Americans and more than 150 million people globally. Since the patient population is huge, many were stunned by Gilead's decision to price Sovaldi at $1,000 per pill, or about $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment.Sovaldi's price dwarfed the $50,000 cost of  's prior hepatitis C drug, Invicek, and the $20,000 cost for the peginterferon and ribavirin combination, and sparked a massive backlash by patient advocates, health insurance companies, and state Medicaid offices.While that backlash failed in its attempt to force Gilead to slash prices, few can blame those who stood up and shouted \"no fair\". After all, if every American with hepatitis C was treated with Sovaldi, the cost to health payers would eclipse $250 billion (yes, billion), and treating everyone on the planet with hepatitis C would cost a truly staggering $14.28 trillion (yes, trillion). To put those numbers in perspective, the U.S. spent about $381 billion on prescribed medicine last year.Source: Gilead SciencesNo one expected Gilead to cut prices for Harvoni, so it wasn't shocking when Gilead set Harvoni's price at $94,500 for a 12-week treatment course.The company justifies Harvoni's price by reminding payers that Harvoni costs just about what payers were forking over for the treatment regimen of Sovaldi plus ribavirin, a prior generation drug that still needed to be taken alongside Sovaldi. Gilead has been quick to point out that the cost of liver transplant in advanced hepatitis C cases is far higher than Harvoni's price, too.Gilead also points to the price \"discount\" patients may receive with Harvoni if they're eligible for an eight week treatment course. Roughly 40% of hepatitis C patients may qualify for that shorter regimen, which carries a cost of about $63,000.However, payers may not rejoice at that prospect given that the cost is still a far cry higher than that of prior generation treatments, and that even if every hepatitis C patient in America were able to take Harvoni for eight weeks, it would still cost health care payers a breathtaking $189 billion.As a result, it's little wonder that state Medicaid programs are scrambling to figure out how to limit Harvoni's use and smooth out the potential impact of Harvoni on budgets. Following Sovaldi's launch, 35 state Medicaid programs chose to restrict Sovaldi's use to just those with liver failure, and it's likely a similar number of states will adopt that approach to Harvoni, too.Healthcare payers are also restricting Harvoni's from use in patients with drug or alcohol addiction, limiting what types of doctors can prescribe it, and limiting Sovaldi and Harvoni's use to \"once-in-a-lifetime\".Some states are also picking and choosing treatment plans based on each patient's variation of the disease. For example, Harvoni is definitively a better drug than Sovaldi in genotype 1 patients, so Washington state will allow those with that genotype to receive it. But patients with other genotypes, in which Harvoni's advantage may be more debatable, may be forced to take other drugs instead.In the end, limiting access to Harvoni may not matter to Gilead investors. Despite restricting Sovaldi's use, Sovaldi's sales still eclipsed $8 billion during its first nine full months on the market.Importantly, that $8 billion plus in revenue came from treating just 117,000 patients. According to the World Health Organization, there are between 350,000 and 500,000 deaths annually from liver disease caused by hepatitis C. So even if just half that number were prescribed Harvoni's shorter eight week treatment course, Gilead would still bring in sales of at least $9.4 billion every year.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the BMRN options chain for the new January 2017 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $13.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $51.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of BMRN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $66.90/share today.Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Sales of Firdapse (Lambert eaton myasthenic syndrome) are expected to remain modest in the third quarter as in previous quarters.Focus will mainly be on the performance of Vimizim (MPS IVA), the latest entrant into BioMarin's product portfolio. We expect sales of the drug, which gained U.S. and EU approval in Feb and Apr 2014, respectively, to improve from the $14.3 million recorded in the second quarter.Operating costs are expected to increase in the third quarter. While research & development costs are expected to increase due to the company's efforts to develop its pipeline, selling, general and administrative expenses should increase due to costs associated with marketing Vimizim.We expect BioMarin to provide a detailed update on its pipeline candidates on the .Our proven model does not conclusively show that BioMarin will deliver a positive surprise this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. : BioMarin has an Earnings ESP of -31.82%, since the Most Accurate Estimate stands at a loss of 29 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 22 cents. BioMarin holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

In fact, consensus estimates have moved sharply higher for both of these time frames over the past four weeks, suggesting that BioMarin Pharmaceutical could be a solid choice for investors.In the past 30 days, 9 estimates have gone higher for BioMarin Pharmaceutical while none have gone lower in the same time period. The trend has been pretty favorable too, with loss estimates narrowing from 53 cents a share 30 days ago, to 8 cents today, a move of 84.9%.Meanwhile, BioMarin Pharmaceutical's current year figures are also looking quite promising, with 11 estimates moving higher in the past month, compared to none lower. The consensus estimate trend has also seen a boost for this time frame, with loss estimates narrowing from $1.75 per share 30 days ago to $1.22 per share today, an increase of 30.3%.The stock has also started to move higher lately, adding 18.1% over the past four weeks, suggesting that investors are starting to take note of this impressive story.

These updates provide information on experimental drugs and at times give an insight into the commercial potential of the candidate once it is successfully developed and commercialized.Earlier this week,  's (  ) biopharmaceutical division, Merck Serono, announced the presentation of detailed 26-week data from a phase IIIb study (SPARK) at the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) Annual Symposium.The company had already announced in Apr 2014 that the SPARK study had met its primary endpoint. This study evaluated the effect of Kuvan in children (After 26 weeks of treatment, the patient group administered with Kuvan in addition to a phenylalanine-restricted diet showed a statistically significant increase in phenylalanine tolerance (from a baseline of 37.1 mg/kg/day to 80.6 mg/kg/day). The other group which was subjected only to a phenylalanine-restricted diet showed an increase in phenylalanine tolerance from 35.8 mg/kg/day to 50.1 mg/kg/day.Kuvan is already approved for patients suffering from tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency as well as patients (aged \u22654 years) who suffer from PKU (due to phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme deficiency) and are responsive to Kuvan. Based on the positive outcome of the SPARK study, Merck KGaA intends to file for a label extension for Kuvan for PKU patients aged \u22644 years and responsive to Kuvan, in 2014. Kuvan enjoys orphan drug status in the U.S. and Europe.While Kuvan is marketed by Merck KGaA in certain ex-U.S. markets, BioMarin (  ) holds the rights to market the product in the U.S. and Canada. Kuvan is sold by Asubio Pharma under the trade name Biopten in Japan.Merck KGaA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the pharmaceutical sector are Lannett Company, Inc.

Here are seven things management wants you to know.1. -- Leonard Schleifer, Regeneron's founder, president, and CEOLeonard Schleifer. Source: Regeneron.Off-label use of compounded bevacizumab has been a touchy subject for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals since before it launched its macular degeneration drug Eylea. In addition to competition from  's Lucentis, some doctors also use Roche's bevacizumab, known by its brand name Avastin. The cancer drug can be used in fairly small doses for macular degeneration, so when the bottle is split up -- referred to as compounding -- the cost per dose of Avastin is substantially less than Eylea and Lucentis.Fortunately, compounded Avastin doesn't seem to be eating into Eylea's sales, with second-quarter sales up 26% year over year.2. -- SchleiferThrough the first half of the year, Regeneron generated $774 million in Eylea sales in the U.S., so the company is expecting that it could get more than $1 billion in sales in the second half of the year. That's as much as 15% quarter-over-quarter growth for the next two quarters.Where's that growth going to come from?3.  -- SchleiferLast month, the Food and Drug Administration approved Eylea to treat diabetic macular edema, or DME. This is a big opportunity for Regeneron, considering there are about as many DME patients as there are patients with wet age-related macular degeneration. Lucentis has been approved as a DME treatment for over two years, but Regeneron isn't necessarily counting on having those patients switch.Only about 40% of DME patients are currently on an anti-VEGF treatment -- the rest are treated with lasers or steroids -- so there's potentially low-hanging fruit if Regeneron can convince doctors that Eylea is a better option. The biotech is also counting on convenience to compete with Lucentis, because Eyela comes in the same strength for DME and wet AMD, so doctors have to stock only one strength of the drug, unlike Lucentis. -- Robert Landry, Regeneron's CFO and senior vice president of financeRobert Landry. Source: Regeneron.This is key to Regeneron's valuation. Read that last sentence again.Regneneron is guiding for as much as 15% quarter-over-quarter growth in U.S. sales of Eylea for the remainder of the year, but earnings should go up even more because expenses won't increase by the same relative amount.But enough about Eylea ...-- SchleiferThe drugs in development weren't given much attention on the conference call, but investors shouldn't forget about them. As much as Eylea is the current driver of growth, Regeneron's pipeline is going to have to take over fairly soon.One of the more advanced drugs is Regeneron and Sanofi's cholesterol treatment, alirocumab, which did get a highlight on the call because of a unique situation ...6. -- SchleiferSanofi and Regeneron are in a battle with  to brink the first PCSK9 inhibitor to market. To try and get a bit of a jump start, the duo purchased a priority review voucher from  , which allows a drug to get a priority review even though it only deserves a standard review .As Schliefer notes, the voucher reduces the filing and review time from 12 months to eight from the time the application is submitted. Sanofi and Regeneron are on target to submit their application before the end of the year, potentially leapfrogging Amgen, which plans to file its application this quarter. -- SchleiferThe whole reason investors buy money-losing biotechs is in the hopes that they'll one day have positive earnings (or be bought by a larger company expecting to get positive earnings from the drugs in the pipeline).Getting past there, to where the company has made as much as it lost developing the drugs, is an impressive feat. That Regeneron did it in less than three years after gaining FDA approval for Eylea is quite remarkable. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. There's a product in development that will not only change how we treat a common chronic illness -- it could potentially revolutionize the entire health industry.

Consider  (  ), a firm in the Med-Biomed/Generic industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, BMRN has beaten estimates by at least 45.0% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Two quarters ago, BMRN forecasted to incur loss of 50 cents per share, while it actually incurred loss of 27 cents per share, a beat of 46.0%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to incur loss of 42 cents per share, when it actually incurred loss of 19 cents per share instead, representing a 54.8% positive surprise.Thanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for BioMarin Pharmaceutical. In fact, the  for BMRN is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This is the case for BMRN, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 55.56%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that BMRN has a great Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. And when you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP,  of the time, so it seems pretty likely that BMRN could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company stated in its press release that a company, looking to launch a generic version of Kuvan, has submitted a paragraph IV certification notice letter to the FDA. This pertains to an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) filed with the U.S. regulatory body seeking to market a generic version of Kuvan.The paragraph IV certification implies that the filer believes the relevant patent is invalid or will not be infringed by its generic version of the drug. BioMarin stated that it intends to defend the patents and will file a complaint alleging patent infringement against the applicant within 45 days of receiving the notification letter.In the event of BioMarin filing the lawsuit within 45 days, a 30-month stay period will come into force. Consequently, the ANDA pertaining to Kuvan cannot be cleared by the U.S. regulatory body within that time frame or until a court rules the patents to be invalid or not infringed, whichever happens earlier.Currently, Kuvan is covered by 8 issued patents which are listed on the FDA's approved drug products List (Orange Book). The patents will expire between 2024 and 2026. Kuvan has been co-developed by BioMarin and Merck KGaA (  ). Kuvan was approved in the U.S. in 2007 for phenylketonuria, a genetic disease.Kuvan is one of the most promising drugs at BioMarin. Kuvan has been performing well since its launch. Net product revenues from Kuvan climbed 14.7% to $46.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. The company expects 2014 Kuvan sales to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million. Consequently, genericization of the drug would hurt the top line of BioMarin. We expect investor focus to remain on updates relating to Kuvan.BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The narrower-than-expected loss was primarily due to higher-than-expected revenues.Total revenues (on an adjusted basis) climbed 36.7% to $192 million in the reported quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $159 million. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher net product revenues.Net product revenues in the second quarter of 2014 surged 42.1% to $188.2 million. Naglazyme, approved for treating MPS-VI, a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder, accounted for a significant portion of product revenues in the quarter. Revenues from the drug were up 40.6% to $98.3 million. Sales were positively impacted by the timing of government ordering patterns in some international markets.Net product revenues from Kuvan tablets, indicated for treating mild-to-moderate forms of phenylketonuria, were up 14.7% to $46.9 million. The impressive rise was due to higher demand for the drug. BioMarin had launched Kuvan in powder form for oral solution earlier in the year. The launch of the new form will boost the drug's sales potential. The new version will benefit very young and elderly patients who are either intolerant to or have difficulty with the tablet version. BioMarin receives royalties from partner Sanofi (  ) on Aldurazyme. Aldurazyme royalties (excluding transfer revenues) amounted to $24.4 million in the second quarter, up 15.1%.Net revenues from Firdapse, currently marketed in the EU, came in at $4.6 million in the quarter compared with $4.1 million a year ago. Firdapse was launched in Apr 2010 in the EU for treating patients suffering from LEMS, a rare autoimmune disorder. The drug has performed disappointingly since launch.The latest entrant in BioMarin's product portfolio is Vimizim. The drug was cleared in the EU last month for treating patients suffering from MPS IVA. Approval of the drug in the U.S. came in Feb 2014. Approvals in the EU and Canada came in Apr 2014 and Jul 2014 respectively. The drug contributed $14.3 million in the second quarter of 2014 to total revenues. Following the U.S. approval of Vimizim, BioMarin was awarded a voucher under an FDA program to encourage the development of drugs to treat rare pediatric diseases. The company sold the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher (PRV) for $67.5 million to Regeneron Ireland, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (  ).Both research & development (R&D) expenses (25.7%) and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses (34.4%) were steeper during the quarter. BioMarin's efforts to develop its pipeline led to the increase in R&D expenses. Costs associated with the marketing of Vimizim pushed up SG&A expenses.Encouraged by the strong sales of its primary products in the second quarter, BioMarin raised its top-line outlook for 2014. BioMarin now expects total revenues in the range of $745 million to $765 million (old guidance: $650 million to $680 million). The sale of the PRV voucher also contributed to the raised revenue outlook. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 (prior to the release) was $673 million. We expect it to be revised upwards following the fresh outlook issued by the company.We also expect the shares of the company to react positively to the narrower-than-expected loss, higher-than-expected revenues and improved guidance.The company now expects total Naglazyme revenues in the range of $305 million to $320 million (old guidance: $290 million to $310 million). Kuvan net product sales are still expected in the range of $180 million to $200 million. The company still projects 2014 Vimizim sales of $60 million to $70 million. The company expects Vimizim sales at the high end of the projected range.Selling, general & administrative expenses are now expected in the range of $280 million to $295 million (old guidance: $265 million to $285 million). Though the company expects R&D expenses to rise in the remainder of the year, it lowered its R&D guidance primarily because it has spent less than anticipated in development programs. Based on its spending dynamics, BioMarin now expects R&D expenses in the range of $460 million to $480 million (old guidance: $500 million to $530 million).BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The RELIEF study is evaluating PV patients treated with Jakafi in comparison to those being treated with hydroxyurea.Results revealed that a significant proportion of patients treated with Jakafi failed to achieve more than 50% reduction in a defined cluster of symptoms including tiredness, itching, muscle aches, night sweats and sweats while awake at week 16 from baseline. Consequently the study did not meet its primary endpoint. Jakafi treated patients managed to show a 43.4% symptom response rate compared to a symptom response rate of 29.6% in the hydroxyurea arm.Last month, the company had submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Jakafi in the U.S. for the PV indication based on positive results from the RESPONSE study also announced in June. (Read more: Incyte Gains on Positive Jakafi Data).Incyte stated that if approved, Jakafi will be the first JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor to be available for patients suffering from PV. We note that Jakafi was launched in the U.S. in Nov 2011 for treating patients suffering from intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF). Jakafi contributed around $69.7 million to Incyte's top line in the first quarter 2014, representing an increase of 44% from the year-ago quarter.Incyte has a collaborative agreement with  (  ) to market Jakafi outside the U.S. The drug has also been approved by the European Commission to treat adults suffering from primary MF, post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF.Although Jakafi's sNDA submission was based on the results from the RESPONSE study, disappointing data from the RELIEF study will be a matter of concern for Incyte as far as Jakafi's PV indication is concerned. Currently, Incyte is primarily dependent on the success of its only approved product, Jakafi. Successful label expansion of the drug will boost sales.

Gilead's second quarter results were way above expectations thanks to the continued impressive performance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Sovaldi. Sovaldi contributed $3.48 billion to second quarter revenues, accounting for more than half of total revenues in the reported quarter.

The approval of this agreement boosted the bottom line by 15 cents.Second quarter 2014 revenues increased 40% to $2.4 billion, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.1 billion.Including one-time items, second quarter 2014 earnings increased 46% to $3.01 per share.Second quarter Tysabri revenues increased 37.9% to $533 million from the year-ago period. Biogen is now booking 100% of Tysabri revenues following its acquisition of Elan's rights in Tysabri. Ex-U.S. revenues included deferred revenues of $54 million related to the agreement with AIFA.Meanwhile, Avonex, Biogen's lead MS product, posted second quarter revenues of $774 million, down marginally (0.8%) from the year-ago period.Rituxan and Gazyva related revenues were $303 million in the second quarter.Tecfidera, the latest offering from Biogen's MS portfolio, continues to impress with sales coming in at $700 million - this included U.S. sales of $585 million and EU sales of $115 million. Second quarter Tecfidera sales were well above first quarter sales of $506 million. Tecfidera is the leading oral MS therapy in the U.S. Biogen had launched Tecfidera in early Apr 2013 in the U.S.Alprolix, Biogen's recently launched hemophilia treatment, recorded revenues of $10.4 million.Biogen upped its guidance for 2014 again.

Earlier, Biogen had guided towards earnings of $11.35 - $11.45 per share on revenue growth of 26% - 28%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.69 per share is below the company's guidance range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue growth is also below the guidance range at 27.8%.The significantly higher guidance reflects the continued strong performance of Tecfidera and the positive impact of the AIFA agreement.The company expects to spend 20% - 21% of total revenues (old guidance: 20% - 22%) on R&D. SG&A guidance remains unchanged at 22% - 23% of total revenues.Biogen's second quarter results were way above expectations. Shares were up in  on the strong second quarter results and impressive guidance.We remain impressed with Tecfidera's performance. Tecfidera continues to perform well in the U.S. and is off to a strong start in the EU where it was launched recently.Biogen remains poised for strong growth.

Moreover, earnings were short of the year-ago figure by 45.2%.Including one-time items, Cubist Pharma reported earnings of 30 cents per share as compared to 23 cents a year ago. Revenues in the second quarter of 2014 climbed 14% to $294.4 million. Revenues fell well short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $299 million. The top line was hurt by weak Cubicin (daptomycin) sales. We expect the company's shares to be negatively impacted by the weak earnings report.Net product sales in the U.S. climbed 10.8% year over year to $265.3 million. Most of the U.S. sales came from Cubicin. Net sales of the product in the U.S. climbed a mere 3.3% to $234.7 million. Apart from revenues from Cubicin sales, total product revenues at Cubist Pharma comprised Entereg (up 17.9% to $14.6 million) and Dificid ($15.9 million, up 10.4% sequentially) sales in the U.S. and international markets (up 16.9% to $17.5 million).Cubist Pharma gained full control of Dificid (fidaxomicin), an antibiotic for treating patients suffering from clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), following the completion of its acquisition of Optimer Pharmaceuticals in Oct 2013. This has strengthened the company's antibiotics portfolio. Dificid was relaunched earlier in the year.Both research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose during the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted SG&A expenses were up 57.5% to $78.6 million. Adjusted R&D expenses during the quarter were up only 2.8% primarily due to lower-than-expected pre-launch expenses related to the manufacturing of ceftolozane/tazobactam. We note that ceftolozane/tazobactam is under priority review in the U.S. with a decision expected by Dec 21, 2014.Cubist Pharma is looking to get the candidate approved for treating complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. EU approval of ceftolozane/tazobactam will be sought by Dec 31, 2014. Furthermore, Cubist Pharma intends to initiate a phase III study on ceftolozane/tazobactam in patients suffering from hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP)/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) by Dec 31, 2014.In Jun 2014, the FDA approved Sivextro (200 mg: once daily for six days). Sivextro, cleared by the FDA for treating adults suffering from acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), becomes the third approved antibiotic in Cubist Pharma's portfolio, after Cubicin and Dificid.The FDA has approved both intravenous as well as oral versions of the drug which can be used for treating serious skin infections, including those caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The favorable decision was based on encouraging safety and efficacy data from two global phase III studies (ESTABLISH 1 and ESTABLISH 2). Data revealed that Sivextro was non-inferior to  's (  ) Zyvox, requiring less frequent dosing and a shorter treatment period.Sivextro is under review in the EU for treating complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI). Sivextro was added to Cubist Pharma's pipeline following its acquisition of Trius Therapeutics last year.Surotomycin is another interesting phase III candidate in the company's pipeline. It is being developed for treating CDAD.Apart from announcing its earnings results, Cubist Pharma reiterated the guidance for 2014 provided by it while releasing its fourth quarter and full year 2013 results in January. The company still expects revenues in the range of $1.19 billion to $1.275 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.2 billion is near the high end of the guidance range. Net U.S. sales of Cubicin are expected on the lower end of the previous guidance range of $0.97 billion to $1.02 billion. All other product revenues are still projected in the range of $205 million to $235 million. Guidance for service and other revenues are maintained in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Gross margin (on an adjusted basis) is still expected in the range of 77%-78%.The company expects R&D costs (inclusive of milestone payments) for 2014 on the lower end of the previously guided range of $460 million to $480 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2014 are still expected in the range of $310 million to $320 million.Cubist Pharma currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Higher revenues led to the favorable results in the quarter.Revenues jumped 53.8% to $56.1 million. Revenues were boosted by impressive Gattex sales, which improved 22% sequentially to $22 million. Gattex, NPS Pharma's sole marketed product, was launched in the U.S. in Feb 2013 as a subcutaneous injection for treating adults with short bowel syndrome (SBS), dependent on parenteral support. The drug was cleared in the EU in 2012 (European trade name: Revestive). NPS Pharma is currently preparing to roll out the drug in some EU countries.Gattex sales were only $4 million in the second quarter of 2013. Earlier in the year, the FDA approved a revised label for the drug to include long-term data from the STEPS 2 study.Royalty revenues climbed 7.9% year over year to $34.2 million in the second quarter of 2014. The bulk of royalty revenues ($31.6 million) came from Amgen's (  ) Sensipar. Revenues were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $52 million.Research and development expenses declined 31.4% to $21.2 million in the reported quarter due to lower costs pertaining to the production of pre-approval Natpara inventory. Selling, general and administrative expenses jumped 82.1% to $26.4 million. The massive increase was primarily due to costs pertaining to Gattex's marketing in the U.S. Costs related to pre-launch activities of Natpara also led to the increase.NPS Pharma still expects net sales in the range of $100 million to $110 million. The company said that it is well on track to achieve the guidance as Gattex sales have totaled $40 million in the first half of the year. Operating expenses (excluding cost of goods sold and share-based compensation expense) in 2014 are still projected in the range of $180 million to $200 million.We are impressed by the rebound in Gattex sales from the disappointing first quarter. We expect Gattex sales to remain strong in the last two quarters of the year. A key action date for NPS Pharma is coming up in October when the FDA will decide on Natpara (hypoparathyroidism). Prior to that, the FDA's advisory committee will meet on Sep 12 to review the marketing application of the drug. We expect investor focus to remain on its regulatory status. Natpara approval will augment the company's top line and reduce its dependence on Gattex. Focus will also remain on the development of NPSP795 (autosomal dominant hypocalcemia: phase IIa).NPS Pharma, a biopharmaceutical company, carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Consider  (  ), a firm in the Med-Biomed/Generic industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, BMRN has beaten estimates by at least 20.0% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Two quarters ago, BMRN expected to lose 34 cents per share, while it actually suffered loss of 27 cents per share, a beat of 20.59%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to suffer from loss of 50 cents per share, when it actually saw loss of 27 cents per share instead, representing a 46.00% positive surprise.Thanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for BioMarin Pharmaceutical. In fact, the  for BMRN is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This is the case for BMRN, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 7.14%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that BMRN has a great Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile.

Kuvan is marketed for treating patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder.The U.S. regulatory body arrived at the decision to extend Kuvan's marketing exclusivity period on the basis of data from the studies submitted by the company. The submission followed a written request by the FDA to evaluate the use of the drug in pediatrics (from birth to 6 years old).BioMarin stated in its press release that Kuvan in the form of tablets and powder for oral solution is the first and only treatment to be approved in the U.S. for PKU to bring down the level of blood phenylalanine (Phe) in patients suffering from hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) due to tetrahydrobiopterin- (BH4-) responsive PKU. Kuvan should be used in combination with a Phe-restricted diet.The bodies of patients affected with PKU are unable to process Phe, an amino acid found in many foods, leading to excessive Phe in the blood. The disorder can affect the brain, impair thinking and cause behavioral problems if not treated promptly.The powdery form of Kuvan is more convenient for infants and children compared to tablets as it dissolves rapidly in water, apple juice or a small amount of soft food, thereby reducing chances of acidity. Kuvan is one of the most important products in BioMarin's product portfolio.

The narrower year-over-year loss was primarily due to higher revenues. We expect the huge shrinkage of loss compared to expectations to lead to stock price appreciation.Total revenues (on an adjusted basis) climbed 19% to $155.3 million in the reported quarter beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $145 million. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher net product revenues.Net product revenues in the first quarter of 2014 surged approximately 17% to $149 million. Naglazyme, approved for treating MPS-VI, a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder, accounted for a significant portion of product revenues recorded in the quarter. Revenues from the drug were up 15.4% to $80.1 million. Sales were positively impacted by the timing of government ordering patterns in some international markets.Net product revenues from Kuvan tablets, indicated for treating mild-to-moderate forms of phenylketonuria, were up 20.2% to $45.2 million. The impressive rise was due to higher demand for the drug. BioMarin launched Kuvan as powder for oral solution earlier in the year. The launch of the new form will boost the drug's sales potential. The new version will benefit very young and elderly patients who are intolerant or have difficulty with the tablet version.BioMarin receives royalties from partner  (  ) on Aldurazyme. Revenues to BioMarin (excluding transfer revenues) from Aldurazyme were $21.9 million in the first quarter, up 13.5%.Net revenues from Firdapse, currently marketed in the EU, came in at $4.7 million in the quarter as opposed to $3.6 million a year ago. Firdapse was launched in Apr 2010, in the EU, for treating patients suffering from LEMS, a rare autoimmune disorder. The drug has performed disappointingly since launch.The latest entrant into BioMarin's product portfolio is Vimizim. The drug was cleared in the EU last month for treating patients suffering from MPS IVA. Approval of the drug in the U.S. came in Feb 2014. The drug contributed $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2014 to total revenues.Both research & development expenses (2.9%) and selling, general & administrative expenses (17.6%) were steeper during the quarter. BioMarin's efforts to develop its pipeline contributed to the increase in research & development expenses. Costs associated with the launch of Vimizim pushed up selling, general & administrative expenses.BioMarin maintained its outlook for 2014 that was provided in February this year while releasing the fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. BioMarin expects total revenues in the range of $650-$680 million (the company anticipates 2014 revenues toward the upper end of the guidance range). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $670 million is within the company's guidance range. The company still expects total Naglazyme revenues in the range of $290-$310 million and Kuvan net product sales in the range of $180-$200 million. The biopharmaceutical company still projects 2014 Vimizim sales of $60-$70 million with at least 350 patients on therapy by year end.Selling, general & administrative expenses are still expected in the range of $265-$285 million and research & development expenses are projected in the range of $500-$530 million. The company anticipates exiting 2014 with research & development expenses toward the lower end of the guided range.We are impressed by the strong sales of BioMarin's products in the first quarter of 2014 leading to a narrower loss. The EU approval of Vimizim is a positive for BioMarin as the market has a greater population of MPS IVA patients compared to the U.S. Consequently, BioMarin should over achieve the 2014 sales guidance on Vimizim. Approval has also been sought in other markets. Moreover, BioMarin's pipeline is interesting with many pipeline related events lined up in the coming quarters. Successful development and commercialization of the robust pipeline will help drive long-term growth at BioMarin.BioMarin, a biopharmaceutical company, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Even though some companies came up with positive developments, overall sentiment remained bearish. Gilead could well have its next hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug approved later this year -- the company, which had filed for FDA approval of its once-daily fixed-dose HCV cocktail treatment -- ledipasvir (NS5A inhibitor) plus Sovaldi (nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor) - said that the combination has been accept for review.The FDA will decide on the approval status of this cocktail treatment by Oct 10. Approval would make this combination the first oral treatment for HCV patients with genotype 1 infection to be available in the U.S. The important thing is that patients would not need to take interferon or ribavirin (RBV), which are usually associated with greater side effects.But competition is not far behind. Earlier this year, AbbVie had provided data from four additional studies that evaluated its all-oral, interferon-free therapy with/without RBV in the same patient population. AbbVie followed up with impressive data at the recently held International Liver Congress.AbbVie remains on track to file for its HCV treatment early in the second quarter of 2014 and expects to gain approval this year.Both treatments look effective with high cure rates. But Gilead's treatment is once daily while AbbVie's will require more frequent dosing. However, eventually pricing will play a role as well in share uptake.Gilead should also watch out for Merck's combination treatment. The FDA, which was supposed to deliver a response regarding Afrezza's approval status by Apr 15, has delayed its decision by three months. So MannKind will now have to wait until Jul 15 before a decision of Afrezza is available. MannKind shares, which had surged almost 74% on a positive FDA panel, dropped 8% on the delay.The delay should not come as a huge surprise - the FDA has a lot of information to sift through before it can arrive at a decision. Although an FDA advisory panel voted in favor of approving the drug, there are some concerns regarding safety. So the FDA will need some time to decide on the label as well as post-marketing requirements. Alkermes shares were up on impressive top-line data from a pivotal study on its experimental schizophrenia drug aripiprazole lauroxil. The candidate was also found to be safe and well-tolerated. With the once-monthly injection achieving the primary as well as secondary endpoints in the study, Alkermes is set to file for FDA approval in the third quarter.The schizophrenia market is pretty crowded given the presence of several oral antipsychotic drugs. However, of late, the treatment landscape is changing with doctors recognizing the advantages of long-acting injectable antipsychotics. This may work in aripiprazole's favor given its once-monthly dosing option (which provides dosing flexibility and enhances current treatment options). But then, it does not have first-mover advantage as other once-monthly dosing options are already available. Pharmacyclics has filed a regulatory application in the U.S. for its cancer drug, Imbruvica, based on data from a head-to-head study (in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia -- CLL -- patients) versus Glaxo's Arzerra.An interim analysis from the study earlier this year showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival as well as a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in the Imbruvica arm. Imbruvica, which has multi-billion dollar potential, is already approved for mantle cell lymphoma and CLL.\n  \n Agios presented promising early data on its experimental cancer drug, AG-221. Results showed complete remissions, reduction of 2HG (2-hydroxyglutarate), a favorable safety profile and effects on cellular differentiation providing proof-of-principle for AG-221's novel mechanism of action. Shares were up 27.8%. AG-221 is being developed under a strategic collaboration with Celgene. Intercept put on a good show at the International Liver Congress of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). The company presented new data on obeticholic acid (OCA) for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune liver disease estimated to affect about one in 1,000 women above the age of 40.The company, which had already presented positive data on OCA from the phase III POISE study, said that OCA also brought about a highly statistically significant reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as early as two weeks. Intercept intends to file for approval by year end. Shortly after Halozyme said that it is temporarily halting patient enrolment and dosing in an ongoing mid-stage study being conducted with PEGPH20 for pancreatic cancer, the FDA announced a clinical hold. Shares were down 2%.A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA under which the sponsor of the study is asked to delay a proposed trial or suspend an ongoing trial. The temporary halting of the phase II study due to safety signals is a matter of concern and creates uncertainty regarding the future of this program. BioMarin's Kuvan will now enjoy an additional six months of exclusivity. Kuvan, which is approved for a rare genetic condition that is estimated to affect at least 50,000 diagnosed patients under the age of 40 in the developed world, will now enjoy exclusivity up to Jun 2015. Kuvan is an important product in BioMarin's portfolio accounting for about 30.5% of total sales in 2013. Lexicon Pharmaceuticals presented positive top-line data from a mid-stage study on its type I diabetes candidate LX4211.Next week, several major biotech companies will be reporting first quarter results the most important being Gilead. With so much being discussed about Sovaldi and the biotech selloff being triggered by Sovaldi-related pricing concerns, Gilead's first quarter report is a highly-awaited event.

(Symbol: BMRN) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Newmont Mining Corp. (Symbol: NEM), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN), the market cap is now $11.52B, versus Newmont Mining Corp. (Symbol: NEM) at $11.47B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of BMRN vs. NEM:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, BMRN is off about 2.7%, while NEM is down about 1.4% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) continued to receive encouraging news on its enzyme replacement therapy Vimizim (elosulfase alfa), when the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the drug's approval in the EU for treating patients suffering from mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA).The positive development came a week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the drug for the same indication. The encouraging news from Europe impressed the investors with the stock gaining 4.95% on the news.The positive opinion of the CHMP will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC). A decision from the EC on Vimizim is expected within the next 2 months. After receiving clearance for the drug in the U.S., BioMarin had said that gaining EU approval was important since the U.S. accounted for only 15% of the 1,500 MPS IVA patients identified by BioMarin.Consequently, a favorable EC decision on Vimizim will go a long way in boosting the drug's sales potential. Moreover, EU approval would make Vimizim the first therapy in the EU for the treatment of this rare genetic disorderBioMarin is also looking to get Vimizim approved for MPSIVA in other markets as well such as Brazil, Australia, Canada and Mexico. Approval in these markets will increase the drug's contribution to BioMarin's top line. Only U.S. approval for Vimizim will not make it a meaningful contributor to the biopharmaceutical company's total revenues due to the limited target population and the presence of a boxed warning in the drug's label to include the risk of anaphylaxis as its infusion of resulted in life-threatening anaphylactic reactions in some patients during clinical trials.Management at BioMarin is bullish on the potential offered by Vimizim. Strong Vimizim sales are expected to help the company record total revenues in excess of $1 billion for the next few years. The company projects Vimizim sales in 2014 in the range of $60 million-$70 million with about 350 patients on therapy by year end. We expect the company to easily achieve its 2014 sales guidance on Vimizim. The company has priced the drug in the U.S. at about $380,000 (net) annually for a typical MPS IVA patient.Following FDA approval, Vimizim has become the fifth member of BioMarin's product portfolio. The other marketed products of the company are Naglazyme, Kuvan, Aldurazyme and Firdapse. BioMarin co-markets Aldurazyme with  (  ). Buoyed by the addition of Vimizim to its product portfolio, BioMarin announced earlier in the week that it expects its total revenues in 2014 to increase by more than 20% over the 2013 preliminary revenue figure ($548.5 million).

The FDA had asked for additional clinical pharmacokinetic and safety data in children suffering from achondroplasia.However, in Sep 2013, BioMarin announced that the clinical hold on the candidate has been lifted by the U.S. regulatory body following the submission of modified phase II protocol and withdrawal of the previous one. The regulatory authorities in the U.S. as well as in Europe agreed that a phase II study for the indication can be initiated without additional data.We are encouraged by the successful study initiation after the clinical hold. However, further objections from regulatory authorities related to BMN 111 may put the candidate's future in jeopardy.In a separate press release the company announced that it has initiated Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies on BMN 270 for the treatment of hemophilia A.

Morgan Annual Healthcare Conference where pipeline updates, strategic goals and guidance for 2014 were presented. Many companies also presented preliminary results. Celgene expects to deliver 2013 earnings of $5.96 per share, well above expectations. Total net product sales are expected to come in at $6.4 billion, up 18%. 2014 guidance also surpassed expectations.Moreover, the company's long-term outlook looks good with Celgene raising its product sales targets as well as earnings outlook for 2015 and 2017. Jazz hit a 52-week high last week after it presented a strong outlook at the J.P. Morgan conference and announced the acquisition of global development, manufacturing and commercial rights to ADX-N05 from Aerial BioPharma. ADX-N05 is being developed for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in patients suffering from narcolepsy.Meanwhile, Jazz expects to cross the $1 billion revenue mark in 2014, driven by continued growth of existing products and new product launches. Sarepta's shares jumped 40.1% on 120-week data from a phase IIb study being conducted on its experimental drug, eteplirsen, for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This is the long-term extension phase of the study which had met its primary endpoint at week 48. Patients on the experimental drug continued to show stability in walking ability. Investors are now eagerly awaiting an update on the company's plans for phase III development. Big pharma companies continue to show a lot of interest in Alnylam - Sanofi expanded its agreement with the company for the development of rare genetic diseases. Genzyme, Sanofi's subsidiary, will acquire a 12% stake in Alnylam through a $700 million investment. This deal validates Alnylam's technology, ensures continued pipeline progress and provides the company with a pile of cash. Alnylam's shares shot up 40.9% on the news. Regeneron was also there at the J.P. Morgan conference where the company said that it expects Eylea's fourth quarter sales to be about $400 million and $1.4 billion in 2013. Importantly, Eylea continues to represent significant growth potential in the form of additional indications and continued uptake for approved indications. Shares were up 11.8%.Regeneron has also signed up with health care giant, Bayer, for the joint development of a PDGFR (Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor Beta) beta antibody. The companies intend to explore the possibility of combining this antibody with Eylea for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration.Regeneron will split development costs with Bayer and will get an upfront payment of $25.5 million as well as milestone payments. Moreover, U.S. commercialization rights remain exclusively with Regeneron. Will the companies be able to re-create the success they have enjoyed with Eylea? Given their successful track record with Eylea, confidence levels remain high.\n  \n The EU approved Gilead's hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection treatment, Sovaldi. Sovaldi's approval, while expected, is an important event for Gilead as well as HCV patients in the EU who have postponed treatment as they await the launch of a better therapy. Sovaldi basically represents a new HCV treatment paradigm - high cure rates, a short treatment period and reduction/elimination of the need for interferon injections. The EU market is huge with about 9 million people carrying the infection. Sovaldi, a potential blockbuster product, is already approved in the U.S. Alexion is teaming up with Moderna Therapeutics for the discovery and development of messenger RNA Therapeutics (mRNA) for the treatment of rare diseases, Alexion's focus area. The mRNA Therapeutics platform could help fasten the development and manufacture of treatments for several rare diseases that cannot be treated with existing technologies. ARIAD has re-launched Iclusig in the U.S. after the product was temporarily suspended a few months back due to safety issues. Iclusig is back with a revised label, a boxed warning and a REMS plan. The question remains whether Iclusig will be able to bounce back and pick up where it left. Sales in the third quarter of 2013 were $16.7 million.

The candidate is a small-molecule prodrug of monomethyl fumarate (MMF) being developed for treating patients suffering from multiple sclerosis.The USPTO issues a notice of allowance only after the patent application is deemed fit enough to be granted a patent on its basis. Alkermes stated in its press release that it expects the above mentioned patent to be issued in the next few months. Furthermore, the patent is not expected to expire before 2033.Alkermes intends to file an investigational new drug (IND) application for ALKS 8700 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and move the candidate into phase I studies in mid 2014.

The procedure reduces the time taken to review the marketing application.We expect Vimizim to be approved in the U.S. (target date: Feb 28, 2014). Last month, the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) of the FDA recommended the approval of Vimizim for the indication.Vimizim is also under review in the EU.

Most of the share gains were based on important news flowing in from the EU on Friday. The biggest gainer last week was Biogen. On Friday, Biogen received a huge boost with its oral multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment, Tecfidera, gaining new active substance (NAS) designation in the EU. Shares jumped 13.15% on the news and hit a 52-week high of $289.97 that day. The NAS designation is very important for Biogen as the company had delayed the EU launch of Tecfidera until it gained stronger patent protection.NAS designation basically means that Tecfidera will have 10 years of regulatory exclusivity in the EU. So Biogen can now launch Tecfidera in the EU (once approved) without worrying about generic competition entering the market in the near future. EU approval should come shortly - the CHMP has already given a positive opinion.Tecfidera is the hottest new entrant in the U.S. multiple sclerosis market. The product, launched in early Apr 2013, is already off to a strong start in the U.S. bringing in sales of $478 million and is the leading oral multiple sclerosis therapy in the U.S. (according to IMS). Given the strong U.S. launch, it's reasonable to expect a similar launch trajectory in the EU. Not surprisingly, Tecfidera estimates are rising and the product is set to bring in multi-billion dollar sales for Biogen over the next few years. (  ) was at the receiving end of some positive news with the CHMP giving a favorable opinion regarding the approval of the company's hepatitis C virus (HCV) candidate, Sovaldi. Importantly, the recommendation is in favor of a wide label which increases the commercial potential of the candidate, once launched.The vote came ahead of expectations -- Gilead shares were up 3.7% and reached a 52-week high of $75.21 on Friday. Meanwhile, it should be smooth sailing for Sovaldi in the U.S. as well where it has already received a positive opinion. Expectations are high for FDA approval early next month. The commercial potential for Sovaldi is huge - there is major unmet need in the HCV market and several patients have postponed treatment as they wait for new and improved options like Sovaldi to enter the market. Sovaldi has multi-billion dollar sales potential.Last week, Gilead also gained EU approval for HIV drug, Vitekta. However, the regulatory path has not been as smooth in the U.S. where the FDA refused to grant approval earlier this year. Another biotech major,  (  ), hit a 52-week high last week, once again on news from the EU. Celgene's oncology treatment, Abraxane, which is already approved for a wide range of indications, received a favorable opinion from the CHMP for pancreatic cancer. Shares were up about 3% and Celgene hit a 52-week high of $164.00 on Friday. With  (  ) Vimzin coming a step closer to gaining FDA approval, rumors regarding the company being an acquisition target surfaced again. Last week, Vimzin, which is under regulatory review for the treatment of patients with the lysosomal storage disorder Morquio A syndrome, was backed by the FDA's advisory panel.Given BioMarin's promising orphan drug portfolio, the company is viewed an attractive acquisition target. Some of the names being tossed around as potential bidders include Roche, Glaxo, Pfizer and Sanofi. However, valuation could be an issue and it remains to be seen whether any of these companies will be willing to shell out a huge premium. BioMarin shares gained 6.2% during the latter half of last week and expectations remain high for Vimzin's approval.\n  \n (  ) and partner Bayer scored a new indication for oncology drug, Nexavar. Nexavar, which was previously approved for liver and kidney cancer, can now be used for thyroid cancer as well. The news came out after market close on Friday. :  (  ) and partner Sanofi's experimental rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug, sarilumab fared well in a phase III study. Results from the SARIL-RA-MOBILITY study showed that patients treated with sarilumab+MTX experienced an improvement in disease signs and symptoms and physical function along with inhibited progression of joint damage.Regeneron also gained approval in Japan for the use of Eylea in macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). : Ariad, which has been struggling of late due to negative updates on its sole marketed product, Iclusig, has something to cheer about with EU regulators saying that Iclusig can remain on the market. Of course, tough restrictions will be imposed for continued marketing of the product. This scenario is quite different from the situation at home where the company had to temporarily suspend marketing of the product. Shares were up 35.7% on the EU update. : Investors reacted favorably to Vertex Pharma's monetization of Incivo royalties, sending the shares up 4.4%. The company sold its product royalty rights to its hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Incivo, to partner Janssen. The $152 million cash inflow should come in handy for Vertex Pharma's cystic fibrosis pipeline development efforts. : Amarin's shares lost 10% with the FDA refusing to accept the company's appeal for a review of the agency's rescission of a special protocol assessment (SPA) agreement. The SPA agreement was for the ANCHOR study supporting a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Zavesca. The FDA will deliver a decision by Dec 20 and as things stand, chances of approval for the additional indication look low. Amarin will most likely have to provide cardiovascular outcomes data so that its cholesterol management drug can be used in a broader patient population. : Orexigen shares have gained more than 10% so far this week on positive interim data on Contrave (obesity candidate) from the Light Study. Orexigen could well be on the path to FDA approval for Contrave by Jun 2014. : Shares of  (  ) jumped 8% earlier this week with the company reporting promising phase III data on its experimental antibiotic - ceftolozane/tazobactam for complicated urinary tract infections. : Merrimack shares gained 11.46% on encouraging phase II data on its experimental breast cancer drug MM-121.

The U.S. regulatory body cleared the drug for the treatment of patients suffering from mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA) or morquio A syndrome.Following the FDA clearance, Vimizim becomes the first therapy to be cleared for the treatment of this rare genetic disorder, which affects approximately 3,000 patients in the developed nations according to BioMarin. The shortage of activity in an enzyme involved in glycosaminoglycan metabolism causes people to be affected by MPS IVA.Vimizim's approval does not surprise us as the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) of the FDA had recommended the approval of Vimizim for the above indication in November last year. The FDA clearance came a few days ahead of the assigned target date of Feb 28, 2014.We note that even though Vimizim managed to get FDA clearance, all aspects of the decision did not favor BioMarin. The drug was approved with a boxed warning to include the risk of anaphylaxis as the infusion of the drug resulted in life-threatening anaphylactic reactions in some patients during clinical trials. We note that the target population is not large in the first place. The presence of a severe warning in the drug's label will further limit its sales potential. Consequently, the U.S. approval of Vimizim is not expected to boost BioMarin's top line significantly. The shares of the biopharmaceutical company slipped marginally on the news of the presence of the boxed warning in Vimizim's label.BioMarin is looking to get Vimizim approved for MPSIVA in additional markets such as the EU, Brazil, Australia, Canada and Mexico. Approval in additional markets will boost the drug's sales potential.Apart from Vimizim, the approved products at BioMarin are Naglazyme, Kuvan, Aldurazyme and Firdapse.

However, the terms of the agreement are yet to be disclosed.The recent agreement allows BioMarin to use Myriad's novel Homologous Recombination Deficiency test, popularly known as HRD. This test will help detect tumors that have lost the ability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks, resulting in increased susceptibility to DNA-damaging drugs. Tumors that could adversely respond to BioMarin's drug candidate, BMN-673, can also be identified through this test.Myriad recognizes the complex and dynamic nature of the biology of cancer. The joint initiative fulfils the need for a comprehensive test to identify patients who can possibly benefit from treatment with PARP inhibitors or DNA damaging agents.Myriad Genetics develops new molecular diagnostic tests taking into account the active role of genes in the treatment and recurrence of diseases.BMN 673 is a novel and highly potent PARP1/2 inhibitor used for the treatment of human cancers with DNA repair deficiency. PARP1/2 inhibitors comprise a class of anti-cancer agents that target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. Currently, BMN 673 is undergoing early-phase clinical development meant to evaluate its success rate in cancer treatment.Globally, medical as well as research professionals have been constantly trying to formulate new ways and means to determine the genetic causes of DNA repair deficiency in the treatment of fatal diseases, such as cancer. The HRD test from Myriad promises to overcome this problem by identifying patients who can benefit from cancer therapy using BioMarin's PARP inhibitor BMN 673.In Oct 2013, Myriad had forged its first agreement with BioMarin to use its BRACAnalysis test in connection with the latter's Phase III study of BMN-673 for breast cancer.Currently, Myriad Genetics Inc. carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

BioMarin stated in its press release that of the 21 members in the advisory, all but 1 voted in favor of Vimizim's approval. While 19 members recommended the approval of the drug for treating all MPS IVA patients, a sole panel member voted in favor of approving the drug for treating a subgroup of patients suffering from the disease.A final decision from the FDA on the matter is expected by Feb 28, 2014. We note that the FDA is not bound to accept the recommendation of the panel. The U.S. regulatory body, however, considers the panel's recommendation while deciding on the fate of a candidate.

Higher revenues led to the narrower loss. Total revenues climbed 32.2% to $177 million driven by Vimizim and Kuvan. BioMarin raised its guidance again this year. Both Vimizim and Kuvan should continue performing well. Meanwhile, the impending Prosensa acquisition should boost BioMarin's rare disease portfolio. BioMarin has several pipeline updates lined up for 2015. While we remain encouraged by the company's progress with its pipeline, the generic challenge for Kuvan is a concern. We maintain a Neutral recommendation on the company.San Rafael, CA based BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. focuses on the development and commercialization of treatments for serious diseases and medical conditions.

BioMarin has a collaboration agreement with Sanofi for Aldurazyme.BioMarin has several interesting candidates in its pipeline including PEG-PAL (phase III severe PKU results due in the first quarter of 2016) and talazoparib (phase III BRCA breast cancer enrollment to complete in the second half of 2015).BioMarin is currently looking to acquire Prosensa in an all cash transaction valued at about $680 million or $17.75 per share. The Prosensa acquisition will add Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) candidate, drisapersen, to BioMarin's portfolio and further expand its rare disease portfolio. With this acquisition, BioMarin will also gain worldwide rights to Prosensa's multiple orphan drug candidates that have the potential to be developed for the treatment of various genotypes of DMD and other genetic disorders.

Far be it for me to argue with their balance sheets, but based on the indicators I've highlighted in the past, and that have served me well since 2009, the underpinning of the bull move of the last four years -- the corporate bond market -- is about as solid as it has been during that period, and by all indications, is actually getting even better. Since I submit to  on a regular basis and with some detail on corporate bonds and derivatives, for this article I'll support my assertion with just a couple of data points: $37.7 billion of new bonds sold so far this week, and $115 billion MTD; 2-year swap rates are at 10.25bps and stabbing regularly into the single digits.Bears can take solace in the fact that on a daily basis, the  (INDEXSP:.INX) -- note that I use the S&P Futures Pit contract as the proxy -- has printed a Sequential Combo Countdown Sell, and as of last night, it put in a bearish \"Price Flip.\" If you are inclined to take action on this signal, consider that the \"Risk Level\" is at 1802.40. More encouraging for the bears is the weekly TD Sell Setup in force for the last two weeks. However, for this signal to prove itself, the weekly price pattern needs to print its own \"Price Flip,\" and that must happen within the next two weeks. Otherwise, the action post TD Sell Setup will look more like \"the pause that refreshes\" than \"the beginning of the end.\" (If you are not familiar with DeMark indicators, my article  explains enough to allow you to follow along.)Similarly, traditional charts show many overbought conditions, but pattern-wise, it's worth highlighting that the drop of the last few days has just brought us back to the level from where the SPA PIT broke out of a major multimonth channel. This kind of retracement is not only to be expected, it's what a bull wants to see.What does worry me some, are the moves in some of the mo-mo names, a number of which reached flat-out stupid levels. But the likes of  (  ) and  (  ) are coming back to Earth hard and fast (see  , subscription to  required).

Even a recent hot IPO like  (TCS) is worth a nibble if it gets caught up in the downdraft.The bottom line is, there have been nasty corrections in the last four years, and every single one proved to be a buying opportunity once companies get sick of watching their stocks fall, and use their cash hoards and debt to prop up their tickers. The fuel for this dynamic is corporate bond sales, and despite the headline risk, higher rates will likely draw even more money into corporate bonds as buyers chase yields. Hence, the reservoir for future buybacks is getting deeper by the day.

Vimizim has been granted priority review and a response from the FDA is expected by Feb 28, 2014.The briefing documents posted by the FDA hinted at a favorable risk-benefit profile for the candidate. The document further says that on the basis of the available data treatment with Vimizim appears to be well tolerated in both the short as well as long term. Moreover, the safety profile of the candidate is also in line with other approved enzyme replacement therapies. The adverse reactions associated with the drug like hypersensitivity reactions are not uncommon to such therapies. The upbeat content of the documents further brightens the prospects of the drug gaining FDA approval in Feb 2014.Apart from the upbeat briefing documents posted by the FDA on Vimizim, BioMarin received further encouraging news on the candidate with the French regulatory body issuing temporary clearance to Vimizim for treating MPS IVA patients. Vimizim is also under review in the EU. An opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use is expected by late 2013/early 2014.

This, along with increased pipeline visibility and smart utilization of cash, should increase confidence in the sector.Meanwhile, a flurry of restructuring activities has been witnessed in the sector.

The year-over-year increase in total revenues was attributable to higher net product revenues.Net product revenues in the reported quarter surged approximately 6.3% to $134.3 million. Naglazyme, approved for treating MPS-VI, a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder, accounted for a significant portion of product revenues recorded in the quarter. Revenues from the drug were up 1.1% to $63.2 million during the quarter. The marginal rise in Naglazyme sales was due to the delay of the centralized order from the Brazilian Ministry of Health.Net product revenues from Kuvan tablets, indicated for treating mild-to-moderate forms of phenylketonuria (PKU), were up 19.8% to $43.6 million. The impressive rise was due to higher demand for the drug.

The drug has performed disappointingly since launch.Both research & development expenses (33.1%) and selling, general & administrative expenses (33.4%) were on the upswing during the quarter. Total BioMarin's efforts to develop its pipeline contributed to the rise in R&D expenses.Apart from announcing financial results for the third quarter of 2013, the company also maintained its outlook for 2013.

The most important pipeline at BioMarin is Vimizim. The candidate is being developed for the treatment of patients suffering from mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (MPS IVA) or morquio A syndrome.The candidate is under review in the U.S. and the EU. BioMarin is also seeking approval of the candidate in Brazil. The target date in the U.S. is Feb 28, 2014. BioMarin stated in its press release that prior to the final decision an advisory panel of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will review Vimizim's marketing application on Nov 19, 2013. The European approval of Vimizim is also on track with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validating Vimizim marketing authorization application and granting it accelerated review status. Consequently, BioMarin expects the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use to render an opinion on the marketing application before Dec 31, 2013.Another interesting candidate in BioMarin's pipeline is PEG-PAL, which is currently in phase III development for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU). Data from the study is expected by the end of next year.The pipeline at BioMarin also includes BMN-673 for genetically defined cancers. The company expects to initiate a phase III study on the candidate in deleterious germline BRCA mutation metastatic breast cancer shortly.Another pipeline candidate is BMN-701, being developed to combat Pompe's disease. In Mar 2013, the company announced positive results on BMN-701. BioMarin announced in its press release that the FDA has accepted Maximal Inspiratory Pressure as the primary endpoint of the proposed phase II/III switching study on the candidate in patients suffering from late-onset Pompe's disease who have been previously treated with  's (  ) Myozyme/Lumizyme (alglucosidase alfa). BioMarin also threw light on the ignition of the study in Europe. The company is currently in discussions with European regulatory authorities on the study. Following the discussions, the study on BMN-701 is expected to be initiated by year end/Mar 31, 2014.BioMarin announced encouraging news on BMN 111 in children suffering from achondroplasia. The FDA lifted the clinical hold on the candidate, following submission of modified data and withdrawal of the disputed phase II protocol. The regulatory authorities in the U.S. as well as in Europe have agreed that a phase II study for the indication can be initiated without additional data. BioMarin intends to commence its first global study in pediatrics with achondroplasia by year end/first quarter of 2014.BioMarin also stated that it has initiated a 48 week phase I/II study (n~22) on BMN 190 for treating patients suffering from Batten disease.

The FDA gave the above-mentioned designation for the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) indication. The designation from the FDA was based on encouraging data from clinical trials of Firdapse in patients with LEMS.We remind investors that Firdapse enjoys orphan drug status in the U.S., EU and Switzerland. Catalyst Pharma acquired marketing rights to Firdapse from  (  ) in Oct 2012. Only the North American rights were licensed.

The narrower loss was due to higher revenues.Total revenues climbed 10.3% to $136.8 million in the reported quarter but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $135 million. The year-over-year increase in total revenues was attributable to higher net product revenues.Net product revenues in the reported quarter climbed approximately 7.6% to $132.4 million. Naglazyme, approved for treating MPS-VI, a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder, accounted for a significant portion of product revenues recorded in the quarter. Revenues from the drug were up 11.1% to $69.9 million during the quarter.Net product revenues from Kuvan tablets, indicated for treating mild-to-moderate forms of phenylketonuria (PKU), were up 17.9% to $40.9 million. BioMarin is conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, 13-week outcomes study (PKU-016) in patients treated with Kuvan. In Feb 2013, the company announced positive results from the PKU-016 study.BioMarin recorded revenues from another enzyme replacement therapy, Aldurazyme, co-marketed by  (  ), of $17.5 million, down 19.7%.Net revenues from Firdapse, currently marketed in the EU, came in at $4.1 million in the quarter. Firdapse was launched in Apr 2010, in the EU, for treating patients suffering from LEMS, a rare autoimmune disorder. The drug has performed disappointingly since launch.While research & development (R&D) expenses up were up 10.1%, selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses went down 1.7% during the quarter. Total operating expenses were up 1.2% in the reported quarter.In Mar 2013, BioMarin submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for Vimizim (GALNS) for the treatment of patients suffering from mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (MPS IVA) or morquio A syndrome. The BLA submission was based on positive results from a phase III study on Vimizim. Vimizim was granted a priority review designation by the FDA and a final verdict on the U.S approval of the candidate is expected in Feb 2014.BioMarin also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the candidate earlier this year. BioMarin expects the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA to provide its verdict on the EU approval of Vimizim by year end.Moreover, BioMarin initiated a phase III study on its PKU candidate PEG-PAL during the reported quarter, with top-line data expected by the end of next year. The company expects to commence a phase III study on BMN-673 shortly in patients suffering from breast cancer. BioMarin also has several other pipeline related events lined up this year.Apart from announcing financial results for the second quarter of 2013, the company also maintained its revenues outlook for 2013. BioMarin still expects total revenues in the range of $530-$555 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $539 million is well within the company's guidance range.The company also maintained total Naglazyme revenues in the range of $265-$285 million and Kuvan net product sales in the range of $155-$170 million for 2013.However, BioMarin narrowed its SG&A expenses guidance to the range of $220-$240 million from the previous range of $220-$250 million.

BioMarin now plans to submit data from the study to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to include this in the Kuvan label.BioMarin recorded revenues from another enzyme replacement therapy, Aldurazyme, co-marketed by  (  ), of $16.7 million, up 39.2%.Net revenues from Firdapse, currently marketed in the EU, remained flat at $3.6 million in the quarter. Firdapse was launched in Apr 2010, in the EU, for treating patients suffering from LEMS, a rare autoimmune disorder. The drug has performed disappointingly since launch.Both research & development (R&D) expenses (up 13.4%) and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses (up 12.8%) shot up in the quarter, leading to a 16.1% rise in total operating expenses.In Mar 2013, BioMarin submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for Vimizim (GALNS) for the treatment of patients suffering from mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (MPS IVA) or morquio A syndrome. The BLA submission was based on positive results from a phase III study on Vimizim. BioMarin expects Vimizim to be approved in the US by the end of the year.BioMarin also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the candidate earlier this month. Vimizim has been granted accelerated review status in the EU.The company has plans to initiate two more late stage studies this year for PEG-PAL (PKU) and BMN-673 (solid tumors). Management expects to initiate the PEG-PAL study by Jun 30, 2013. The company expects to commence the BMN-673 study by the end of this year. BioMarin also has several other pipeline related events lined up this year.Apart from announcing financial results for the first quarter of 2013, the company also maintained its outlook for 2013. BioMarin still expects total revenues in the range of $530-$555 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $549 million is well within the company's guidance range.The company also maintained total Naglazyme revenues in the range of $265-$285 million and Kuvan net product sales in the range of $155-$170 million for 2013.SG&A expenses are still expected in the range of $220-$250 million. The company continues to expect 2013 R&D in the range of $340-$380 million.Though the company's first quarter financial results were disappointing, we are impressed with the company's progress with its pipeline. Vimizim, on approval, is expected to drive growth at BioMarin. We expect investor focus to stay on the candidate's regulatory progress.BioMarin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, other biopharma stocks such as  (  ) and  (  ) look better positioned.

Toward this end, each day we search our database for a \"top stock\" (a top rated company in terms of earnings strength as well as company and industry performance) that presents a strong technical \"set up\" and a good entry point.In short, when our equity team is looking to add a stock to one of , the \"bull's eye\" stock shown below is generally their first choice.Company Symbol Industry StockRating YTD% Gain StopLoss Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc () is our most compelling buy today due to the fact that it is a top rated stock (in terms of earnings strength and company/industry performance) with a positive technical set-up. A lot of Biotechnology stocks act very differently, so we can work with these stocks as trades that really aren't correlated to the market or to themselves. For example, REGN's competitors Alexion Pharma (), Vertex Pharma (), Biomarin Pharma (), and Pharmacyclics Inc () all act on their own, and really don't even resemble the SPDR Biotech ETF (). So, on it's own merit, REGN is a great looking stock. On a weekly basis, the stock has exhibited strong performance since the beginning of 2012. Notice that the stock tends to pullback and base for a while until marching higher on a new leg up. That is what is happening currently with REGN, which makes for a great entry point. We'd be buyers at the current price around 3, and look for a test / possible breakout of recent resistance at ~5. A close above 0 would be the goal here. With some wiggle room (stop at 8.32), REGN looks like a great intermediate- to long-term trade and is our most compelling buy today.At the current price (~3.00).Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) is an integrated biopharmaceutical company, which discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions.

The closer a company gets to the finish line in the clinical-testing process, the less chance that a drug will fail -- taking the company's stock down sharply.That's also the logic used by big drug companies. They like to acquire promising young drug developers, but only those that have done much of the heavy lifting to vet a drug's prospects. Anacquisition announcement sends stocks skyrocketing, so early investors in those small biotech companies can make a lot of money.For Instance, I'm a big fan of  , which  to my  . But there are also a number of other biotech stocks that hold a considerable amount of promise -- if you are willing to stomach the risk. That's why a basket approach makes sense for this speculative segment, as just one big gainer can make up for the other biotech picks that don't gain traction. So it's wisest to own a mix of biotechs, including those that already have drugs on themarket along with those that have yet to get the Food and Drug Administration seal of approval.Large pharmaceutical companies, while partnering with development stage biotechs, typically seek to acquire companies with drug approval already in hand. Here are four biotech stocks that may soon be in the crosshairs of Big Pharma.For a number of years,  was one of the hottest stocks in this sector, thanks to a strong franchise in the area ofmultiple myelomas, or blood cancers. The company has parlayed its success into a current $31 billionmarket value . Some investors say Onyx Pharma, which has seen a string of recent clinical advances, may be \"the next Celgene.\" Notably, the company's current $5 billion market valuation makes it more digestible for a Big Pharma acquirer.Onyx's most important drug is Nexavar, which has already been approved to treat liver and kidney cancer, and is being tested for broader applications such as thyroid and breast cancer. Bayer is already a key marketing partner with Nexavar and the most logical firm to make anoffer for all of Onyx. Onyx has also just begun selling Kyprolis, which is expected to takemarket share in the multiple myeloma market Celgene currently dominates.Big Pharma firms don't like to acquire just a promising drug, they like to acquire broad drug development platforms. They know that if the basic science works in one area, then it could end up serving as the basis for many other drugs that may treat different types of diseases.This helps explain the appeal of Biomarin, which has been developing a portfolio of genetic disease therapeutics. The company targets treatments for rare diseases, which mayyield only a small patient population, but a high level of spending per patient. For example, its Aldurazyme drug targets a global population of just a few thousand people, but is on track to generate roughly $200 million in sales this year, thanks to a $200,000 per patient price tag.Biomarin now has more than $400 million in annual sales, though this figure could spike sharply if the company's Kuvan drug takes off as the company hopes. This drug treats phenylketonuria, a fairly common metabolic disorder. The key will be whether the longer-term efficacy data (due out in coming months) will convince more doctors to prescribe the drug, and whether Big Pharma will sit up and take note.By the end of this year, this firm may finally get the FDA green light to market cabozantinib, a drug for thyroid cancers. But that's not why investors are focused on this stock. Instead, it's the drug's testing on prostate cancer, currently in Phase III clinical trials, that holds even greater promise. If successful, Exelixis may be able to target a market exceeding $500 million annually (notably higher than the potential $200 million thyroid opportunity.)The company is also testing cabozantinib to see whether it is effective in the treatment of kidney, liver, lung and ovarian cancer. Further clinical progress in these areas just might convince a Big Pharma player that this is a drug development platform worth acquiring.I laid out my reasons for why this biotech firm is so appealing  and thoughshares have continued to move well higher since then, they still look like a bargain. More to the point, Threshold's drug development platform, known as TH-302, can be applied to many kinds of tumors, which is just the kind of broad opportunity that Big Pharma looks for.Threshold already has deep ties to Germany's Merck KgA, which makes that company a logical potential buyer. That relationship may actually keep Threshold from attracting other offers, so it is likely up to Merck KgA to decide whether it's better to pay out big milestone payments to Threshold, or simply write one large check to acquire the company.Risks to Consider:  As noted earlier, a basket approach to these stocks is prudent to limit company-specific risk. Yet these companies are working at the forefront of cancer research, and their years of hard work and heavy investments could be just starting to pay off.-- David StermanDavid Sterman does not personally hold positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

The wider loss was due to higher operating expenses.For full year 2012, BioMarin reported a loss of 95 cents per share, wider than the year-ago loss of 48 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 79 cents per share. The company's total revenues for the year 2012 came in at $500.7 million, up 13.4%. Reported revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $495 million.Total revenues climbed 22.3% to $131.9 million in the reported quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $129 million. The increase in total revenues was attributable to higher net product revenues.Net product revenues in the reported quarter climbed approximately 23.5% to $131 million. Naglazyme, approved for treating MPS-VI, a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder, accounted for a significant portion of the net product revenues recorded in the quarter. Revenues from the drug shot up 31% to $63 million during the quarter.Net product revenues from Kuvan tablets, indicated for treating mild-to-moderate forms of phenylketonuria, were up 29.9% to $40 million. BioMarin is conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, 13-week outcomes study (PKU-016) in patients treated with Kuvan. The company recently announced positive results from the PKU-016 study. BioMarin now plans to submit data from the study to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to include this in the Kuvan label.BioMarin recorded revenues from another enzyme replacement therapy, Aldurazyme, co-marketed by  (  ), of $24.6 million, up 3.4%.Net revenues from Firdapse, currently marketed in the EU, were $3.4 million in the quarter, up 3% year over year. Firdapse was launched in Apr 2010, in the EU, for treating patients suffering from LEMS, a rare autoimmune disorder. The drug has performed disappointingly since launch.Both research & development (R&D) expenses (up 45.7%) and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses (up 13.6%) shot up in the quarter, leading to a 38.3% rise in total operating expenses.In Nov 2012, BioMarin reported positive results from the much awaited phase III study of Vimizim (GALNS) for the treatment of patients suffering from mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (MPS IVA) or morquio A syndrome.The company now plans to seek US approval for Vimizim soon, with potential approval of the candidate expected by the end of 2013. BioMarin also plans to submit the EU application for the candidate in the second quarter this year.The company also plans to initiate two more late stage studies this year for PEG-PAL (PKU) and BMN-673 (solid tumors). Apart from these, BioMarin has several data readouts and trial initiations throughout the year.Apart from announcing financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012, the company also provided its outlook for 2013. BioMarin expects total revenues in the range of $530-$555 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $554 million is on the higher end of the company's guidance.The company expects total Naglazyme revenues in the range of $265-$285 million and Kuvan net product sales in the range of $155-$170 million in 2013.Meanwhile SG&A expenses are expected in the range of $220-$250 million and R&D expenditure are expected to be $340-$380 million in 2013.The company's fourth quarter financial results were disappointing. We are, however, impressed with the company's pipeline. Late stage candidate Vimizim can drive growth at BioMarin. The company can swing to profitability on the back of Vimizim. We expect investor focus to stay on the candidate's regulatory progress.BioMarin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The wider loss was due to an increase in operating expenses, which offset the increase in revenues.Total revenues climbed 12.1% to $124.0 million in the reported quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $122 million. The increase in total revenues was attributable to higher net product revenues.Net product revenues in the reported quarter climbed approximately 12.2% to $123.0 million. Naglazyme, approved for treating MPS-VI, a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder, accounted for the bulk of the net product revenues recorded in the quarter. Revenues from the drug increased 4.3% to $62.9 million.Net product revenues from Kuvan tablets, indicated for treating mild-to-moderate forms of phenylketonuria, grew 20.5% to $34.7 million. BioMarin is working on expanding Kuvan's label and is conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, 13-week outcomes study. Top-line results from the study are expected in the second quarter of 2013.Revenues from another enzyme replacement therapy, Aldurazyme, co-marketed with  (  ), shot up 26.0% to $21.8 million. BioMarin recorded an increase of 8% in the number of Aldurazyme patients.Net revenues from Firdapse, currently marketed in EU, were $3.6 million in the quarter, up 12.5% year over year.

The drug has performed disappointingly since launch.Both research & development (R&D) expenses (up 47.1%) and selling, general &administrative expenses (SG&A) expenses (up 25.7%) shot up in the quarter, leading to a 41.1% rise in total operating expenses.We are encouraged by BioMarin's efforts to develop its pipeline. With multiple pipeline events lined up, R&D costs are expected to increase further in the coming quarters.BioMarin continues to expect total revenues in the range of $475-$510 million, total product revenue in the range of $470-$505 million, Naglazyme net product revenues in the range of $250-$265 million, Aldurazyme at $81-$87 million and Firdapse at $13-$17 million. However, BioMarin increased its guidance for net product revenues from Kuvan to $130-$140 million from $126-$136 million.While the SG&A guidance remained unchanged at $195-$205 million, the R&D guidance was raised to $285-$295 million, from the previous range of $265-$275 million.We have a long-term Neutral recommendation on BioMarin, which carries a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) in the short run.

Preliminary data from the program showed that PEG-PAL was well tolerated and could prove to be efficacious. Although two patients dropped out of the study due to adverse reactions, BioMarin said that the cases were not severe. Twelve more dropped out due to logistical reasons.BioMarin expects to meet the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to review data from the phase II program in the first quarter of 2013. The company plans to initiate a phase III study of PEG-PAL in the second quarter of 2013 after the end of phase II discussion with the US regulatory body.Primarily, the phase III program of PEG-PAL will include a study for the evaluation of safety and blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in patients suffering from PKU.BioMarin already markets Kuvan around the world which is indicated to treat PKU. BioMarin recorded net product revenue of $34.7 million from Kuvan in the second quarter of 2012. The company expects to generate around $130-$140 million as net sales of the product at the end of 2012.We note that BioMarin has a partnership with Merck Serono, a division of  (  ), since 2005 for the development and commercialization of both Kuvan and PEG-PAL.

The narrower loss was due to an increase in total revenues.Total revenues climbed 13% to $128.1 million in the reported quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $127 million. The increase in total revenues was attributable to higher net product revenues.Net product revenues in the reported quarter climbed approximately 11.9% to $126.3 million.

BioMarin expects that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will approve GALNS in the fourth quarter of 2013.We are encouraged by BioMarin's efforts to develop its pipeline. With multiple pipeline events lined up, R&D costs are expected to increase further in the coming quarters.BioMarin continues to expect total revenues in the range of $475-$510 million and total product revenue in the range of $470-$505 million.

The wider-than-expected loss was attributable to increased operating expenses which more than mitigated the rise in revenues. The company reported break-even earnings in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues climbed 6.1% to $107.8 million in the reported quarter. Revenues fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $115 million.Net product revenues in the reported quarter climbed approximately 7.7% to $106.1 million. Naglazyme, approved for treating MPS-VI, a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder, contributed the bulk of the net product revenues recorded in the quarter. Revenues from the drug climbed 6.7% to $48.1 million. The increase in patient demand outweighed the negative foreign exchange impact on Naglazyme sales during the reported quarter.Net product revenues from Kuvan tablets, indicated for treating mild-to-moderate forms of phenylketonuria, grew 12.8% to $30.8 million. The increase was attributable to the higher demand for the drug in the US.Revenues for BioMarin from another enzyme replacement therapy, Aldurazyme, co-marketed with  (  ), increased 3% to $23.8 million. In addition to the above-mentioned products, BioMarin possesses the rights to Firdapse through its acquisition of Huxley Pharmaceuticals in October 2009.Net revenues from Firdapse, currently marketed in Europe, were $3.3 million in the quarter, up 10%. Firdapse was launched in April 2010, in the European Union, for treating patients suffering from LEMS -- a rare autoimmune disorder. The drug has performed disappointingly since being launched. The sales of the drug were a mere $3 million in the final quarter of 2010, $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2011, $3.2 million in the second quarter and $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2011.Both research & development (R&D) expenses (up 37.2%) and selling, general &administrative expenses (SG&A) expenses (up 15.1%) were on the upswing during the reported quarter leading to a 23.2% rise in total operating expenses.While BioMarin's focus on developing its pipeline led to the increase in R&D expenses, increased sales and marketing expenses towards Naglazyme and Kuvan were mainly responsible for the rise in SG&A costs.For the full year 2011, BioMarin suffered a loss of 48 cents as opposed to earnings of $1.79 in 2010. The Zacks Consensus loss estimate for 2011 was 35 cents per share on revenues of $449 million. Revenues for 2011 climbed 17.3% to $441.4 million due to higher product sales.BioMarin also provided guidance for 2012. Total revenues are expected in the range of $465 million-$510 million, as opposed to $441 million recorded in 2011. The increase is due to higher product sales expected in 2012. Net product revenues are expected in the range of $460 million-$505 million. Net product sales were $438 million in 2011.We expect BioMarin to easily achieve the revenue guidance driven by Naglazyme and Kuvan. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $514 million for 2012 is above the company's guidance range.Revenue guidance for the marketed products at BioMarin is as follows: Naglazyme - $240 million-$265 million: Kuvan - $126 million-$136 million; Aldurazyme - $81 million-$87 million; and Firdapse - $13 million-$17 million.Both SG&A expenses and R&D expenses are expected to be higher in 2012 compared to 2011 levels. While SG&A expenses are expected in the range of $195 million-$205 million (2011: $175 million), R&D expenses are expected in the range of $255 million-$265 million (2011: $214 million).We recently downgraded our long-term recommendation on BioMarin to Underperform from Neutral as we believe the stock to be overvalued at current levels. Moreover, we are disappointed by the initial sales ramp of Firdapse.Furthermore, we expect cash burn to increase since the company is investing heavily in its pipeline.

These include data readouts from a phase III trial for GALNS, a phase II trial for PEG-PAL, a phase I/II trial for BMN-701 for Pompe's disease, a phase I/II trial for BMN-673 for solid tumors, and a phase I trial in healthy volunteers for BMN-111 for achondroplasia.During the first quarter of 2012, BioMarin's R&D expenses shot up 64% from the year-ago quarter due to costs related to the GALNS phase III trials. Increased stock based compensation along with other pipeline development expenses also added to R&D expenses.The company raised its R&D guidance for the year 2012 to $265 million to $275 million. The company mentioned that almost 20% of the projected R&D expenses are for clinical drug supply. BioMarin currently has four marketed products - Naglazyme, Kuvan, Aldurazyme and Firdapse - which are funding the pipeline development process.At the end of the first quarter of 2012, BioMarin had a cash balance of $288 million. The raised funds should come in handy towards the company's pipeline development efforts.

Cephalon is a subsidiary of  (  ).

Bracanalysis is Myriad's flagship product, which analyzes the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes to assess a woman's risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.Moreover, the acquisition of RBM (Rules-Based Medicine), made in 2011 would better place Myriad in this arena on account of the former's proprietary protein technology and immunoassays. RBM has provided custom assay development and companion biomarker discovery for several pharmaceutical companies. Through these collaborations, RBM has obtained companion diagnostic rights to many of the drugs under development, which should augur well for the long-term development of the company. During the last reported quarter, Myriad recorded $5.2 million in revenues from companion diagnostic business.We consider Myriad's Bracanalysis as a valuable asset for top-line growth as it has the potential to tap a widely unexplored market. Besides, a strong cash balance enables the company to buy back shares, expand into new markets and introduce more products. We are also impressed with the recent in-licensing deals that will bring some promising candidates for growth.In addition to its focus on companion diagnostic business, Myriad has made commendable progress with respect to its expansion in Europe. The company's laboratory in Munich, Germany is operational since January and capable of generating $50 million in revenues each year within the next five years. With its headquarters in Switzerland, hiring of country managers for the five major markets of Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland have been done. While reimbursement for Bracanalysis, Colaris and Colaris AP have already been received in these markets, Myriad is working to receive reimbursemnet for Prolaris.

Net product revenue is expected in the range of $460 million-$505 million, well above $438 million in 2011. We expect BioMarin to easily achieve the revenue guidance driven by Naglazyme and Kuvan. Our 2012 revenue estimate is well within the company's guidance range.The marketed products at BioMarin are Aldurazyme (co-marketed with  (  )), Naglazyme, Kuvan and Firdapse. Aldurazyme is marketed for the treatment of MPS-I (mucopolysaccharidosis). Naglazyme is marketed for treating MPS-VI, a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder. Kuvan is marketed for treating patients suffering from phenylketonuria (PKU). Firdapse, added to BioMarin's portfolio through the October 2009 acquisition of Huxley Pharmaceuticals, was launched in the EU in April 2010 for treating patients suffering from Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) - a rare autoimmune disorder.Moreover, we are pleased by the company's efforts to develop its pipeline with multiple pipeline events lined up.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Full analysis of all these stocks is available at  .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:We are upgrading our recommendation on  (  ) to Outperform, based on the company's premium growth, stable ratings and improved ROE. The company's third-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the back of higher premiums. Consequently, operating cash flow and assets also improved, driving the book value of shares upward and leading to initiation of a cash dividend.Higher operating cash flow is also likely to translate into enhanced operating leverage and excess capital generation for share repurchases. We believe the benefits of geographic diversity, aggressive claims defense and strong financial position are likely to have a positive impact over time.Our six-month target price of $101.00 per share equates to about 14.8x our earnings estimate for 2011. Combined with the $1.00 per share annual dividend, this target price implies an expected return of 20.1% over that period, which is consistent with our Outperform recommendation. :We are downgrading  (  ) to Underperform from Neutral purely on valuation grounds as we believe that the stock is overvalued at current levels. Moreover, we are disappointed by the initial sales ramp of the company's newest marketed product - Firdapse.Moreover, we expect cash burn to increase since the company is investing heavily in its pipeline. Any negative news regarding the pipeline would have an adverse impact on the stock.These concerns have caused us to widen our loss estimate for 2012 by $0.32 to $0.39 per share. Since we believe the stock is overvalued at current levels, we advise investors to avoid the name. Our target price is $35.00.Latest Posts on the Zacks  :Political leaders in Greece overlooked the violent protests on the street and nationwide elections in the coming days to endorse the fresh dose of tough medicine for Greece, whose economy is deeply in recessionary territory.This paves the way for Greece getting a fresh bailout from the troika of EU, ECB, and the IMF.

BioMarin expects gross proceeds of around $248.9 million from this public offering.The public offering is expected close on June 5, 2012. The underwriters will also be granted a 30-day option to purchase an additional 650,000 shares of the common stock. BioMarin intends to use the raised funds for general corporate purposes, including working capital and research and development (R&D).BioMarin has been focusing on developing its pipeline and has five clinical readouts by the end of 2012. These include data readouts from a phase III trial for GALNS, a phase II trial for PEG-PAL, a phase I/II trial for BMN-701 for Pompe's disease, a phase I/II trial for BMN-673 for solid tumors, and a phase I trial in healthy volunteers for BMN-111 for achondroplasia.During the first quarter of 2012, BioMarin's R&D expenses shot up 64% from the year-ago quarter due to costs related to the GALNS phase III trials. Increased stock based compensation along with other pipeline development expenses also added to R&D expenses.The company raised its R&D guidance for the year 2012 to $265 million-$275 million. The company mentioned that almost 20% of the projected R&D expenses are for clinical drug supply. BioMarin currently has four marketed products - Naglazyme, Kuvan, Aldurazyme and Firdapse - which are funding the pipeline development process.At the end of the first quarter of 2012, BioMarin had a cash balance of $288 million. The raised funds should come in handy towards the company's pipeline development efforts.

The study will evaluate 10 to 15 children below 5 years of age. The open-label, multinational study will also evaluate the levels of urinary keratan sulfate (  ) and growth velocity.Apart from the mid-stage study in children, GALNS is also being evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled late-stage study (n~160) in the MPS IVA indication. BioMarin is enrolling patients in a late stage study with primary endpoint of six-minute walk distance. Enrollment is underway in the 24-week study. Top-line data from the study, to be conducted in 40 centers around the world, is expected in the second half of 2012.Apart from GALNS, another promising candidate at BioMarin is PEG-PAL (PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase) for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU). PEG-PAL is currently undergoing mid-stage studies. The company intends to provide an update on the candidate at its Research & Development day on December 8, 2011.BioMarin intends to initiate a late-stage study with PEG-PAL for PKU in the second half of 2012.

An EMA verdict in favor of the facility expansion would allow BioMarin to market the drugs manufactured there across the EU.The successful extension of the facility would help BioMarin generate revenues up to $1.0 billion. The positive opinion of the CHMP comes close on the heels of the clearance of the expanded facility at Novato by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).According to management, the EU clearance pf the facility expansion will help the company's marketed drugs to fully realize their sales potential apart from supporting its expanding pipeline.We note that BioMarin has been constantly on the lookout to expand its manufacturing capacity in order to support its product portfolio and robust pipeline.

Through the agreement, the company seeks to obtain worldwide exclusive rights for biomarkers for gene mutation.In collaboration with the Tennessee-based molecular diagnostics company Insight Genetics, Qiagen will provide a genetic test with a biomarker for non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) that express the abnormal anaplastic lymphoma kinase (  ) gene.Meanwhile, under the agreement with Maryland-based Personal Genome Diagnostics, Qiagen's 89% subsidiary Ipsogen obtained rights to genetic testing for mutations of the IDH1 and IDH2 genes for brain cancers, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and other malignancies.With the companion diagnostics market expected to remain a major growth driver going forward, several clinical laboratory companies in the US are coming up with their comprehensive portfolio of biomarkers and genetic tests.Qiagen's current initiatives to expand its biomarker portfolio through the addition of the ALK and IDH1/IDH2 biomarkers are expected to strengthen its position in the strongly growing molecular diagnostics market. This should bring in incremental sales for the company globally. Qiagen also plans to develop companion diagnostics to make these biomarkers available in combination with new medicines.We are encouraged by Qiagen's focus on strategic initiatives to drive growth and profitability in the companion diagnostics market. Its innovative tests in the genomic/esoteric arena, specifically in the area of cancer with a focus on the high-margin esoteric testing business, are expected to accelerate sales growth in next several quarters.However, Qiagen is facing mounting competition in the molecular diagnostic space especially from players like  (  ) and  (  ). LabCorp has already expanded its companion diagnostic portfolio with the ALK biomarker for  (  ) Xalkori.Xalkori received FDA approval along with a test (Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit) for certain patients with late-stage (locally advanced or metastatic) NSCLC who express ALK gene. This companion diagnostic test is exclusively available through LabCorp.Myriad is also aiming to establish itself as a strong player in the companion diagnostic market. In 2011, the company entered into an agreement with  (  ) to conduct BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing on patients to be enrolled in the latter's phase I/II clinical study of BMN 673. BMN 673 is a PARP-inhibitor drug candidate for the treatment of genetically defined cancers.

Following the expansion, management stated that revenues up to $1.0 billion can be generated via production at the facility.BioMarin intends to use the expanded facility to produce GALNS, for treating MPS IVA, a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder, on approval. GALNS is currently in phase III study with top line results expected in the second half of 2012.

Many publicly traded biotechs are early-stage players with no drug on the market yet. A small subset of those firms will develop therapies that prove safe and effective and eventually come to market, often resulting in explosive success for those firms and instant economic moats, or competitive advantages. The vast majority of biotech companies, however, will fail to meet clinical hurdles for their drugs in development and fall by the wayside.Right now, plenty of investor attention is focused on the biotech space for a different reason: potential merger-and-acquisition activity. It's widely believed that large pharmaceutical firms will continue to be major acquirers of biotech firms in the coming months, as Big Pharma sees massive upcoming patent losses and relatively poor research and development productivity (and little further opportunity to consolidate among one another). So, Big Pharma has been looking at absorbing large and small biotech firms alike. Already, we have seen Roche (  ) acquire Genentech and Sanofi (  ) gobble up Genzyme; and Morningstar equity analysts see several other biotechs as likely takeout targets, including Biogen Idec (  ), Seattle Genetics (  ), Actelion, Exelixis, and BioMarin (  ).From a fundamental perspective, in 2010, large-cap biotechs suffered from some pricing pressure (owing to U.S. health-care reform and European austerity measures), and an industry tax should erode earnings by 1% to 2% in 2011. Looking ahead, we see something of a \"return to normal\" for the entire biotech industry in the very near future. Morningstar equity analysts see stabilization next year, after a tough 2010 and the annualization of some measures in 2011.Even so, the entire biotech space has done extremely well, relative to the broader market. For ETF investors, the biotech industry has been the place to be for capital appreciation in recent years, with all biotech ETFs significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last five years.We think there is plenty of rapid growth ahead in the biotech sector. There are several drugs for diseases with high unmet patient need and favorable demographic trends that are approaching the market, including for diabetes, hepatitis C, and cancer.Currently, investors can choose from among five biotech ETFs. There are meaningful differences in portfolio construction and performance among the five, and we would suggest that investors study the funds closely before investing. Below we highlight the five funds and then make our recommendation.Far and away the biggest and most liquid of the biotech ETFs, IBB holds more than 125 biotech firms listed on the Nasdaq with market caps of at least $200 million. It follows a cap-weighted index, meaning that close to half of its assets are invested in its top-10 holdings. Morningstar analysts believe this ETF is close to fully valued, trading at 99% of its fair value. The fund charges a 0.48% expense ratio. This is the second best-performing biotech ETF over the last five years (rising an impressive 44%). The fund also has posted generally smoother recent performance than some of its biotech peers.The second-largest and second-most liquid biotech ETF, XBI offers much higher-beta exposure because it tracks an equal-weight index of 43 biotech firms. As a result, it provides much more exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks than a cap-weighted fund like IBB. XBI, whose index recently expanded, also owns only a handful of established biotech companies. Nearly half of its holdings are early-stage players with no drug on the market yet and that therefore are devoid of profitability. The smaller firms and their decidedly uncertain prospects but explosive upside potential definitely loom larger and have a meaningful sway on the portfolio. The fund has done well over the last few years, rising almost 60% in that time period (and topping all but one of its biotech ETF peers), compared with the S&P 500's anemic rise of just 2.4%. XBI significantly underperformed in 2009 (when it was basically flat, compared with the S&P 500's 23.5% increase), but has had good performance in other years. One nice attribute for investors is the fund's 0.35% expense ratio--the lowest of all traditional biotech ETFs. Because Morningstar equity analysts follow just half of the assets in this ETF, we are not able to provide a fair value for it.Like XBI, this is an equal-weight ETF, meaning that upstarts sit shoulder-to-shoulder with established players like Biogen Idec, Amgen (AMGN), and Celgene (CELG). This fund also is the second-most concentrated biotech ETF, holding just 20 biotech firms. With a 0.60% expense ratio, FBT is one of the most expensive biotech ETFs, and it's easy to question the potential upside for investors at these levels, given that the fund trades at 99% of its fair value. At the same time, this has been the best-performing biotech ETF by far over the last five years, rising an explosive 113%. That includes a 45% gain in 2009 and a 37% increase in 2010.Although this quirky fund trades on an exchange, it does not track an index, unlike traditional ETFs. And holdings are static, reflecting solely the selections that its parent, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch subsidiary, made at launch. As a result, this is a highly concentrated (just 12 names) fund that devotes more than 85% of assets into just three large biotechs: Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD), and Biogen Idec. Amgen alone makes up more almost 36% of the fund. We like the cost structure of a HOLDRS fund--they charge annual custody fees of $0.08 per HOLDR share, which converts to an expense ratio of anywhere from 0.02% to 0.05%. Like its peers, BBH has outperformed the broader market significantly over the last five years; however, it has significantly underperformed competing biotech ETFs during that same interval. We would attribute that to its heavy concentration in larger names; investors in this fund see less volatility but also are deprived of the potential for explosive gains from individual portfolio companies that enjoy drug approval. BBH also trades at a slightly less expensive valuation than the other biotech funds that Morningstar values. Currently, it trades at 92% of fair value.Like XBI, this is an equal-weight ETF with a higher exposure to small- and mid-cap biotechs, many of which are early-stage players with no drug on the market yet. In addition, this ETF tracks a dynamic (as in, changing often) benchmark that selects and ranks biotech stocks based on capital appreciation. The index is governed by a quantitative-active model that aims to surpass the returns of traditional indexes by investing in stocks that display favorable fundamental growth, attractive valuations, and momentum traits. This ETF charges a 0.63% expense ratio, which is higher than several competing ETFs, but eminently reasonable for a fund that can outperform its rivals. This fund has done well over the last five years (up 36%) and in the last few years in particular (up 31% last year alone, versus a 13% increase for the S&P 500). Unfortunately, Morningstar does not cover enough of the assets in this ETF to be able to provide an estimate of its fair value.In looking closely at the five funds, we would encourage investors to focus on cost, portfolio construction and risk, recent performance, and if available, valuation. Right out of the gate, we would dismiss the HOLDRS and PowerShares offerings. We like the BBH's price tag and its current valuation, but it has posted pretty weak performance relative to the other funds over the last few years, and we don't think the biotech space is the place to be for such heavy portfolio concentration. PBE charges a high price tag, and investors should expect to receive superior performance for that cost. In recent years, they haven't--at least, not relative to peer ETFs.We also would dismiss the iShares fund. We like its liquidity and its portfolio diversity, but it has a higher price tag and a fairly rich valuation, and its five-year performance is below that of two of its other peers.That leaves the SPDR and the First Trust offering. For more conservative investors, we would recommend the SPDR (XBI), given its low beta relative to its peers, its very strong recent performance, its low price tag, and its portfolio diversity. For a more risk-seeking investor, we would recommend [[FBT]], which has posted incredibly impressive performance over the last few years. FBT is a perfect example of a higher-priced fund that thus far has earned its fee. At the same time, we worry about the concentration in FBT, which holds just 20 firms, and the fund's currently fairly rich valuation, and we would urge investors to tread carefully with this ETF.
