At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new July 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $220.00 strike price has a current bid of $13.80.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $220.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $206.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $226.50/share today.\n\nBecause the $220.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.27% return on the cash commitment, or 36.34% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $220.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND", "Eikon search string for individual stock moves: STXBZThe Day Ahead newsletter: http://tmsnrt.rs/2ggOmBiThe Morning News Call newsletter: http://tmsnrt.rs/2fwPLThWall Street's main indexes were lower in choppy trading on Thursday, as renewed worries about Sino-U.S. trade relations added to fears of an extended economic downturn due to the virus outbreak. .NAt 12:36 ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 0.15% at 23,282.25.

Income investors now more than ever need to be able to trust their dividend stocks. Hefty yields do no good if a company cuts or suspends its payout. By the same token, even the slimmest yield is immensely valuable if there's little to no chance it will come under duress.In short, income investors need super safe dividend stocks right now, and we know some good ways to find them.One option is to monitor the DIVCON system from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares. DIVCON's methodology uses a five-tier rating to provide a snapshot of companies' dividend health, where DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase, and DIVCON 1 the highest probability for a dividend cut.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new August 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $250.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $250.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $240.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $268.41/share today.\n\nBecause the $250.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.80% return on the cash commitment, or 5.76% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $250.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND", "END", "It's almost the end of 2019 and time to look back and reflect on the strongest-performing industrial stocks of the year.
