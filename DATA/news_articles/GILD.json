While neither stock was immune to the coronavirus bear market plunge in March, both companies managed to stave off much of the volatility impacting their competitors in the broader market.Gilead has gained increasing attention in the news of late. In early May, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the emergency use of the company's antiviral medication remdesivir to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients. Gilead is donating millions of doses of the drug globally, as more countries around the world have approved it for severely ill patients.\u00a0Taiwan is the latest nation to clear the drug to treat COVID-19 patients. Bristol Myers\u00a0has proffered its research capabilities and over 1,000 different compounds to companies collaborating on prospective COVID-19 solutions as its contribution to battle the pandemic.Both Bristol Myers Squibb and Gilead Sciences have extremely solid pipelines of existing products and strong core financials. So today's burning question is, which stock is the better buy?\u00a0END", "A crucial aspect of success in investing in biotech stocks is that of timing. Buying a stock too early can mean enduring infinite dilution and clinical trial failures before a company can finally bring a product to market. On the other hand, buying a stock too late can mean missing out on the impressive gains associated with a company's clinical trial success.\u00a0Today, let us look at why it's the perfect time to buy one biotech stock and why investors should avoid another for the time being.\u00a0END", "(RTTNews) - Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) and Galapagos NV (GLPG) said that data from Phase 3 FINCH 1 and FINCH 3 studies of filgotinib demonstrated sustained efficacy and a consistent safety profile with up to 52 weeks of filgotinib treatment across rheumatoid arthritis patient populations.The study of filgotinib is an investigational, oral, selective JAK1 inhibitor, in adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.Filgotinib 200 mg and 100 mg demonstrated a consistent safety profile in this study of MTX-IR patients, and no new safety signals were detected through Week 52. There were five deaths reported prior to Week 24; two patients were in the placebo group, two were in the filgotinib 200 mg group and one was in the filgotinib 100 mg group. Four deaths were reported between Weeks 24 and 52; two treated with filgotinib 200 mg, one in the adalimumab group, and one in the placebo group. Adverse events of interest including serious infections, herpes zoster, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were infrequent and balanced across treatment groups.END", "Adds backgroundZURICH, June 4 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Roche ROG.S has received emergency use authorisation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its Elecsys IL-6 test to help identify severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19, it said on Thursday.The test can be used to help identify coronavirus patients who could be at high risk of intubation with mechanical ventilation, helping doctors decide early on if ventilation could be required, Roche said.Roche is testing its arthritis drug Actemra in patients with coronavirus-linked pneumonia, joining other pharmaceutical companies seeking to re-purpose existing medicines to fight the epidemic. It also plans to test if mixing anti-inflammation drug Actemra with Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O anti-viral treatment remdesivir works better against severe COVID-19 pneumonia than remdesivir alone. END", "Gilead Sciences (GILD) has outperformed the market in 2020, up nearly 16%, as hopes have been pinned on its ability to bring a viable COVID-19 treatment to market.The Phase 3 SIMPLE trial evaluating remdesivir as a 5 and 10-day treatment for moderately ill COVID-19 patients compared to placebo, found that by the primary end point of day 11, those given the medication for 5 days were more likely to show a clinical improvement than those receiving standard care.\u00a0However, patients taking the medicine for 10 days displayed some clinical improvement but not enough to be statistically significant, compared to the standard-of-care treatment.It should be noted that no new safety issues came to the fore.

For vaccine developers, that could be a problem.Scientists in Europe and the United States say the relative success of draconian lockdown and social distancing policies in some areas and countries means virus transmission rates may be at such low levels that there is not enough disease circulating to truly test potential vaccines.They may need to look further afield, to pandemic hotspots in Africa and Latin America, to get convincing results.\"Ironically, if we're really successful using public health measures to stamp out the hot spots of viral infection, it will be harder to test the vaccine,\" said Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health in the United States.END", "Ongoing efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have deeply divided Americans.
