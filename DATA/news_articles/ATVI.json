    "Content": ["Tencent Holdings (OTC: TCEH.Y) is looking to kick off the next stage of its growth with the help of anime and manga characters from Japan. Tencent is already one of the largest companies in China. Its WeChat social messaging platform is one of the most frequently used apps in the country, and it's also the world's largest video game publisher. The company is now fixing its gaze on the talents of Japan's animation studios to jump-start the next phase of its growth.\u00a0Late last month, Tencent acquired a 20% stake in prominent Japanese anime studio Marvelous Entertainment for about $65 million, making it the company's largest shareholder.

As coronavirus worries infected the financial markets, stocks tumbled at a record pace. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 34% from its all-time high in about a month. During the Great Recession, it took nearly a year for the index to decline by that amount. A near-total economic shutdown in the country's biggest cities compounded the damage. \"These are unprecedented times,\" says Philip Lawlor, managing director, global markets research at FTSE Russell.But smart investors are greedy when others are fearful, and this time is no different. Fidelity Puritan fund manager Dan Kelley and other fund managers have been busy buying during the sell-off. \"Opportunities like these come along once a decade if you're lucky,\" says Kelley, who says he's finding some of the best investment opportunities he has seen in a long time. Just because a stock is cheap doesn't mean it's a bargain. Stocks in high-quality firms--financially strong, well-established firms with lots of cash and little debt--are better equipped to withstand troubled times and rough markets. Some even emerge from a crisis stronger. With that in mind, we set out to find stocks with staying power, focusing on firms that lead their industry and have a competitive advantage over peers, a steady history of profitability and good long-term growth prospects.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ATVI options chain for the new June 26th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $66.00 strike price has a current bid of 42 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $66.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $65.58 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ATVI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $71.96/share today.\n\nBecause the $66.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 75%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.64% return on the cash commitment, or 4.65% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Activision Blizzard, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $66.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND", "In early trading on Thursday, shares of PayPal Holdings topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 11.9%.

(Symbol: ATVI) saw new options become available today, for the April 2021 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 347 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ATVI options chain for the new April 2021 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.30.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $57.70 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ATVI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $66.56/share today.\n\nBecause the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 11.23% return on the cash commitment, or 11.81% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Activision Blizzard, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND", "In this episode of Rule Breaker Investing, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner and Motley Fool analysts Karl Thiel and Maria Gallagher review three Five-Stock Samplers.

However, it's unlikely that the franchise is dead. Disney+ had a huge 26.5 million subscribers in its first quarter of existence, thanks in part to the marquee Star Wars spinoff The Mandalorian.

Leading game device developers are set to launch their next-generation consoles in 2020. Naturally, such a move would inspire other competitors to take note, releasing their own competing devices.

Find out more about MyWallSt's exclusive InPerson November event!There was a time when the word \"game\" invoked the image of children playing cards quietly around a table, or perhaps fetching a dusty chess set from under the stairs. Nowadays, it refers to high-octane digital epics with budgets (and revenues) to rival, or indeed surpass, Hollywood blockbusters. The new gaming landscape is dominated by cool and glamorous companies such as Take-Two Interactive\u00a0and Activision Blizzard. While the older industry of toys and board games may not be as obviously exciting, it has shown remarkable resilience in the face of these highly addictive new technologies. No company demonstrates this ability to remain relevant despite the odds better than Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS).A couple of weeks ago, Hasbro made headlines when it purchased Entertainment One in a $4 billion all-cash deal. The deal gives the company access to a number of valuable brands, most notably the children's character Peppa Pig and, funnily enough, Death Row Records. It was the latest episode in the toy maker's long history of partnering with the most iconic names in the entertainment industry. Its portfolio now includes the\u00a0Star Wars, Frozen, Marvel, and Fortnite brands. More interesting, though, is the company's exceptional ability to keep its older, more traditional lineup of products relevant in a world of virtual reality and billion-dollar franchises.Founded in 1923, Hasbro has been manufacturing some of the world's best-loved children's toys for almost a century. The company's first hit product was the classic Mr. Potato Head, which incidentally became the first toy to be advertised on television. Far from a passing fad, Mr. Potato Head went on to run for the mayoralty of Boise, Idaho; to star in his own short-lived TV series; and, of course, to feature in Pixar's Toy Story\u00a0series. The character takes his place alongside other timeless Hasbro favorites such as Jenga, Monopoly, and Play-Doh as a toy that seems to renew itself for each successive generation.Image source: Unsplash.Play-Doh is a particularly interesting case here. First manufactured as a domestic wallpaper cleaner in the 1930s, and eventually launched as a plaything in 1956, the putty-like modeling substance seemed an unlikely to become a timeless toy. But it has been an enduring presence for many generations of children. By the time Hasbro acquired the brand from the (now defunct) toy maker Kenner Products in 1991, Play-Doh was one of the best-known toys on the planet. The company declined to tinker with the product's winning formula, and by Play-Doh's 60th anniversary, in 2016, it was revealed that 3 billion cans had been sold to date. On that occasion, company executive Greg Lombardo said that the success of Play-Doh lay in its ability to evolve \"to meet kids' ever-changing play styles while continuing to deliver imaginative and open-ended play experiences which we know are very important to parents.\"One of the ways Hasbro has evolved is through the use of what we might call meta-branding, which is the process of building new brand power through the mischievous use of pre-existing brand power.Since the company is old enough to have seen its underage consumers grow into parents themselves -- and indeed, into grandparents -- a potent resource it exploits is the nostalgia its products inspire. Play-Doh is firmly ingrained in popular culture, which allows it to make use of its own ubiquity by appealing to the childhoods of adult buyers. It was for this reason that the company launched a humorous \"eau de Play-Doh\" fragrance in 2006, a stunt it took even further last year when it actually patented the product's distinctive smell. Another example of this meta-branding in action came with the 2018 launch of a \"Cheater's Edition\" of Monopoly, apparently in response to a study revealing that more than half of Monopoly players had admitted to cheating at the game.A major setback for Hasbro was last year's closure of Toys R Us. Deprived of a massive customer, the company saw its sales plunge by 12%, while it was forced to stomach $60 million in bad-debt expenses. Hasbro's eOne deal, as well as its recent alliance with Netflix\u00a0to produce an animated series based on trading card game Magic: The Gathering, demonstrate the creative ways the company is leveraging its brand power as it recovers from the Toys R Us calamity.\"Our consumers have grown up with our brands,\" says Victor Lee, Hasbro's senior vice president of digital marketing. \"The power of storytelling has to provide a strong emotional connection which not only reminds them of the fun we've given them when they were kids but also encourages them to share that fun with their kids.\"With a mixture of nostalgia, innovation, and playfulness, Hasbro's marketing genius has kept its simplest products alive for each generation, even as the toy maker pushes its boat into unknown new waters. This almost century-old company may lack the wow factor of its tech-savvy younger peers, but investors should always pay attention to a company that manages to remain at the top of its industry for so long. After all, it might just stay there.END", "Much like the hero of a classic video game, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:) has undergone an epic journey, struggled mightily, and ultimately appears to be staging a comeback from the depths of despair or at least that\u2019s what longtime investors in Activision stock are hoping for.END", "After a year of uncertainty, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) may be getting its mojo back.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ATVI options chain for the new August 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ATVI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $45.39/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Activision stock has been hammered of late, falling 36% in a month and a half. ATVI stock now trades at an 18-month low - and just 22x updated 2018 EPS guidance.And the news doesn't seem that bad. The long-term drivers behind the gaming industry remain intact. Activision's Q3 earnings were fine. Guidance was disappointing, but Activision Blizzard has provided low guidance for years, so that shouldn't necessarily be a surprise. There are some concerns here about the launch of Diablo Immortal on mobile and a near-term slowdown in growth. But given a still-strong balance sheet, the depth of the decline in ATVI stock hardly seems to match the importance of the news over the past 6-7 weeks.The catch from my perspective, however, is that Activision stock was overpriced at October - and all-time - highs near $85. This remains a company dependent on mature, low-growth franchises. Earnings growth here has been minimal for years. Gaming industry headwinds may help, but I'd still rather own Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ) or Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ: TTWO ) - which I still think is the best play in the space . In contrast, Activision Blizzard charges a high price for low growth , as I argued last year.END", "Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) has worked hard in recent years to expand its portfolio of video game franchises so that the business doesn't depend mainly on the results from just a handful of big titles. To that end, the developer now counts major franchises that span across several gaming niches in the free-to-play, subscription, and purchase-based sales models.However, a key drawback to that strategy is that it can force the company into new arenas that might sit outside of its core strengths, leading to weaker growth results from time to time.The company's third-quarter earnings report, while showing healthy overall results, included signs that Activision wasn't meeting management's targets in a few of its latest launches beyond its Call of Duty and World of Warcraft staples. Executives added context for investors on those misses in a conference call with analysts , and below we'll take a look a few highlights from that presentation.END", "Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ: TTWO) is still a smaller company than chief rivals Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) and Electronic Arts , but the video game publisher can now lay claim to two of the biggest entertainment releases ever. The company's Red Dead Redemption 2 ( RDR 2 ) hit the market on Oct. 26 and generated a whopping $725 million in sales across its first three days on the market, good for the second-highest debut of an entertainment release ever and trailing only the record $1 billion in three-day sales delivered by the publisher's own Grand Theft Auto V .RDR 2 's launch was nothing short of fantastic, and subsequent data suggests very strong post-release sales and that Take-Two shareholders can look forward to the game's continuing to post impressive performance.END", "Video game standouts Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ: TTWO) beat expectations for their third-quarter earnings, but Wall Street dinged them anyway, sending shares of both down by double-digit percentages.In this segment from Motley Fool Money , host Chris Hill and senior analysts Jeff Fischer, David Kretzmann, and Jason Moser discuss what might have been behind investors' pessimism. Activision's recent launches were successful, but its guidance was a little light.

In hindsight, that month proved to be the start of a technology stock correction that took semiconductor stocks even lower.

If the results from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) are any indication, Nvidia could disappoint investors, too. AMD said that lower demand from cryptocurrency mining hurt its GPU sales.

But what happens when a game's unveiling goes wrong? What happens when dedicated fans of a franchise or developer almost unanimously reject what's on display?There aren't universal answers to those questions, but the reaction to Activision Blizzard 's (NASDAQ: ATVI) latest game is a case study in how this scenario can play out and has to be one of the most negative reactions to a game in recent memory. The company revealed Diablo Immortal , a mobile installment in a famously PC-centric series, at its recent BlizzCon conference -- and intense fan reaction helped send the company's share price 7% lower in the day of trading that followed.

The game set an opening day digital sales record on Sony 's Playstation store and sold over $500 million in the first three days. The game didn't match previous opening weekend sales numbers in the series, though, which may have contributed to the stock's 10% slide since the company disclosed initial sales.Regardless of how the market feels about Activision at the moment, there are three signs about Black Ops 4 that point to big money-making potential for the franchise going forward.END", "Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) recently revealed Diablo Immortal , the first mobile entry of the venerable Diablo series, at its annual BlizzCon event.

Core gaming audiences, especially those that have followed a particular property for years, tend to dislike when companies chase trends with their beloved franchises.That said, Activision did just release one of the biggest games of the year, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, and its King subsidiary recently rolled out the latest mobile smash hit, Candy Crush Friends Saga.

That is because the Sep 28, 2018 $64.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Activision Blizzard shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Activision Blizzard is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Toys - Games - Hobbies industry that ranks in the Top 46% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while 11 analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 65 cents a share to 51 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Activision Blizzard right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.END", "ActivisionATVI is all geared up for its biggest release from the Candy Crush franchise.

The appeal, of course, is that you can get in on the ground floor of a paradigm-shifting industry. But remember the adage cash is king . The most dependable stocks to buy are usually what people call \"cash cows.\"While no one will criticize sharply rising growth metrics, cash flow represents a business' lifeblood. A weakened cash position can lead to severe problems further down the road, even with strong growth. No matter how viable an organization, it must find a way to keep the lights on. That's why some of the best investments also feature consistent free cash flow.Another reason to look at a company's money outflows as opposed to strictly its income statement is flexibility. Simply put, well-financed operations have more options.

Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 19 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Activision Blizzard, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $62.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $93.00. The standard deviation is $8.727.But the whole reason to look at the average ATVI price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

The company's Q2 revenues announced last week topped street estimates. We expect the company to see low double digit revenue growth for the full year, partly due to the impact of acquisitions - Casual Cards, and Gram Games. We have created an interactive dashboard ~ What Is The Outlook For Zynga ~ on the company's expected performance in 2018. You can adjust the revenue and margin drivers to see the impact on the company's overall revenues, earnings, and price estimate.Expect Online Games To See Low Double Digit Revenue Growth \n\n\n\nWe forecast Zynga's Online Games revenues to grow in low double digits to around $750 million in 2018. The company's forever franchises, such as Zynga Poker, and CSR 2, continue to do well, and account for around half of the company's overall revenues. Zynga's collaborations with automakers is aiding the demand for the CSR franchise. For instance, it launched BMW M2 competition ahead of the car's actual debut in market, and it plans to crate events around Porsche in the coming months. While the company is also launching several new games, the company's management in the recent earnings conference call stated that it expects to see their contribution to be significant from 2019 onward. However, the company's acquisitions of Casual Cards and Gram Games will aid the overall top line growth. Gram Games' popular titles include Merge Dragons and 1010 , and are expected to boost Zynga's active user base. In fact, the company expects Merge Dragons to see strong future growth and become a forever franchise.Zynga is seeing growth primarily on the mobile platform, and the same now accounts for around 90% of the company's overall revenues. While mobile offers a significant growth opportunity, Zynga competes with large players, such as Activision Blizzard's King Digital, and Electronic Arts. Also, small players are making inroads, as the cost of developing games is low. It will be interesting to see how Zynga's new games trend amid competition from other players. New games, growth in forever franchises, and the impact of acquisitions will also aid the company's advertising revenues growth. Advertising revenues were up 15% in H1 2018, and it will likely see double digit growth for the full year, as well.What's behind Trefis?

In the first, second and third quarter of 2017, the company registered top-line growth of 10%, 8% and 13.5%, respectively. We believe WWE will continue to garner record revenues as it has not only extended its earlier deal but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program - Raw and SmackDown - in different countries.

In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the Media Networks segment formed after the acquisition of Starz reported revenue growth of 7% year over year, largely gaining from strong subscription growth at Star. Incidentally, Starz witnessed subscription growth of 400,000 on a sequential basis, aided by Power and Outlander.Notably, the addition of Starz is aiding Lions Gate to emerge as a major player in the TV space and helping it regain lost ground in the streaming network. Moreover, the company has invested in The Immortals to capitalize on the increasing popularity of eSports. It expects the eSports market to grow more than$1 billion in 2018.However, fewer movie releases in fiscal 2018 compared with the previous year might hurt Motion Pictures revenue performance. Dismal television production performance in the past few quarters has also been a concern for investors. In the fiscal second quarter, Television Production revenues declined 4.7%, following a fall of 18.6% in the preceding quarter.

Legal entities and regulators have been contemplating on how to treat in-game loot boxes in games such as Overwatch. The fact they they can be purchased with real money, and can yield an in-game item/utility at random, has compelled some authorities to consider treating them akin to gambling. This poses a risk to gaming companies such as Activision Blizzard ( ATVI ), which earn a significant amount of revenue from sales of these boxes. Accordingly, it is important to understand how Activision's valuation could be impacted if loot boxes are banned from its games. We have created an interactive dashboard using Trefis' interactive technology that shows a scenario where loot boxes get banned, and how it could impact the company's revenue, EPS and subsequently, valuation. You can modify the assumptions to generate your own estimate of the company's value under various scenarios. The chart below shows the negative impact on revenue from a ban of loot box sales. The blue bars refer to the 'loot boxes get banned' scenario. \n\n\n\nNearly half of Activision Blizzard's revenue comes from in-game content. We assume that nearly 50% of in-game content revenue can be attributed to micro-transactions, and nearly 50% of micro-transactions are related to 'loot boxes'. These assumptions imply that a ban on loot boxes could reduce the revenue per active user for Activision Blizzard's game by nearly 12-13%. However, if you disagree with any of these assumptions, you can make changes to our estimates and see the consequent impact on Activision Blizzard's operations and valuation.See More at Trefis |View Interactive Institutional Research(Powered by Trefis)Get Trefis TechnologyThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "This is a great time to be in the video game business.

See our interactive breakdown of Activision Blizzard's business which shows how Activision Blizzard needs its Blizzard unit to keep churning out great games. In this note, we take a quick look at what exactly Blizzard is doing to achieve this growth. The most promising upcoming launches are in 2019 and 2020, when Blizzard is expected to launch the next version of Diablo and Overwatch , along with a mobile MMO. This, along with the expected launch of next expansion of World of Warcraft in late 2018, reinforces our belief that Blizzard's user base growth is likely to continue. Our price estimate for Activision Blizzard stands at $66 , which is slightly higher than the current market price. This is hinged on our expectation that Blizzard's monthly active users will increase from an estimated 40 million in 2017 to nearly 77 million in 2022. \n\n\n\nOverwatch , in particular, has been a huge success for Blizzard lately. In October 2017, the company announced via Twitter that Overwatch had reached over 35 million players, nearly 75% higher than the year-ago count. Now Goldman Sachs estimates that Overwatch 2 , which is expected to be launched in 2020, will sell nearly 20 million copies in the first year itself. In addition, the bank expects 15 million unit sales for next version of Diablo in the first year of launch. These figures are higher than those for the previous versions of these games, suggesting growing popularity. Additionally, Blizzard has been working on an unannounced mobile MMO RTS game and has been hiring engineers for the same.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ATVI options chain for the new August 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $62.50 strike price has a current bid of $5.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $62.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $56.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ATVI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.31/share today.Because the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Play These 5 StocksIn the heart of the third-quarter earnings season, investors' feverish search for earnings beat is understandable. Investors love an earnings beat because it usually always translates into stock price appreciation. In fact, a beat works better than earnings growth in this regard. We'll tell you why.What Makes Earnings Beat So Intriguing?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) fall if they miss or just come in line with market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it looks good apparently) doesn't tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend. If that is the case, the company's fundamentals raise serious doubts.Also, seasonal fluctuations are crucial in determining a company's earnings growth. If a company's Q1 is seasonally weak and its Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline in Q1. In such cases, growth rates are misleading when it comes to analyzing the true picture of a company.END", "Indexes pushed deeper into record territory last week as earnings season hit its peak.

After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it looks good apparently) doesn't tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend. If that is the case, the company's fundamentals raise serious doubts.Also, seasonal fluctuations are crucial in determining a company's earnings growth. If a company's Q1 is seasonally weak and its Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline in Q1. In such cases, growth rates are misleading when it comes to analyzing the true picture of a company.On the other hand, Wall Street analysts rack their brains to study companies' financials and initiatives to forecast earnings. They in fact club their insights and the company's guidance to derive an earnings estimate.END", "END", "If beating earnings expectations is a game, then Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) is winning.

That is because the August 11th, 2017 $47 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Activision Blizzard shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Activision Blizzard is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Toys - Games - Hobbies industry that ranks in the Top 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 44 cents per share to 47 cents.Given the way analysts feel about Activision Blizzard right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $40.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $70.00.

(Symbol: ATVI) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $55.21, changing hands for $55.88/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 16 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Activision Blizzard, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $40.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $68.00. The standard deviation is $8.086.But the whole reason to look at the average ATVI price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ATVI crossing above that average target price of $55.21/share, investors in ATVI have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $55.21 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

That is because the May 26th, 2017 $47 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options todayWhat is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Activision Blizzard shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Activision Blizzard is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Toys - Games - Hobbies industry that ranks in the Top 34% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts has dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 29 cents per share to 25 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Activision Blizzard right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

In such circumstances, growth-focused dividend stocks make compelling plays as these stocks not only pay dividends but also consistently increase their payout.Why Growth-Focused Dividends? Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth ensure steady returns and act as a hedge against any market downturn and economic or political turmoil. These stocks belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market. Simultaneously, these offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and more scope for capital appreciation as opposed to those that pay high yields.Additionally, these companies have a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth stocks a quality and promising investment for the long term. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.END", "Robust sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the market.

(Symbol: ATVI) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $49.13, changing hands for $49.20/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Activision Blizzard, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $40.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $55.00. The standard deviation is $4.596.But the whole reason to look at the average ATVI price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ATVI crossing above that average target price of $49.13/share, investors in ATVI have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $49.13 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen .Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 193 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ATVI options chain for the new August 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $39.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.92. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $39.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $36.08 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ATVI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $39.75/share today.Because the $39.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.49% return on the cash commitment, or 14.16% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Activision Blizzard, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $39.00 strike is located relative to that history:END", "For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 06, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog.

As per a VentureBeat report, The NPD Group issued video game sales numbers for the month of November. As per NPD, overall sales plunged 24% year over year to $1.97 billion. In fact, every category witnessed a record drop. Despite the release of Sony's SNE PlayStation 4 Pro and Nintendo's NES Classic (sold 196K units), hardware sales fell 35% to $723.8 million. Declining sales of Xbox One and PS4 were the main reasons. Tougher year-over-year comparisons marred console software sales, which fell 18% to $955.2 million.Per a NPD analyst, sales in the year-ago period benefited from the super success of Activision Blizzard's ATVI Call of Duty; Black Ops 3, Electronic Arts' EA Star Wars Battlefront and Bethesda's Fallout 4. However, this year's top three games, Call of Duty; Infinite Warfare, EA's Battlefield 1 and Nintendo's Pok\u00e9mon Sun didn't make that big an impact. In fact, sales of Infinite Warfare are reportedly down 50% from last year's Black Ops 3 sales. Though nobody expected Infinite Warfare to outsell Black Ops 3 as the former is a relatively less recognized series, a 50% drop was unexpected. Together, the sale of the top three titles was down 43% year over year in November.Further, NPD adds that PC software tanked 28% to $27.5 million and accessories sale was down 6% to $259.8 million. A decrease of 49% in interactive gaming toys accessory spending was the main reason behind dismal accessory sales numbers. The launch of PS4 did not help accessory sales either.

Black Ops 3, a hit series in the COD franchise, was expected to do well while Battlefront benefited from the release of Star Wars: the Force Awakens, the first Star Wars movie in a decade.

And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at FII given that, according to its RSI reading of 28.53, it is now in oversold territory.What is RSI?RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Other FactorsYet, ATVI's low RSI value isn't the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Activision Blizzard's earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 4 earnings estimate revision move higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for ATVI has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $1.87/share two months ago to just $1.91/share right now.END", "This has been a disastrous month for GoPro, Inc.GPRO and its shareholders.

Just after the news of the recall became public late on Tuesday, GoPro shares were down over 5% at one point. The decline continued in the trading session yesterday, as the stock closed 4.1% lower.Karma's Bad LuckKarma is GoPro's long-awaited quadcopter drone that is compatible with GoPro's latest line of cameras, the Hero5.Reports of some Karma drones losing power during flight and then crashing to the ground, prompted the company to recall all 2,500 units it sold and pull Karma from the market. The malfunction could pose a serious safety hazard, although the company assured that no injuries or property damage has been reported. It assured buyers that they could return their units to GoPro, or their place of purchase, for a full refund.

Active monthly users for both Activision and Blizzard hit a record during the quarter, reaching 46 million and 42 million, respectively. Key gamse driving the growth were \"Overwatch\", \"Legion\" and significant in-game purchases for \"Call of Duty\". Backed by strong results, the launch of \"Infinite Warfare\", \"Skylanders: Imaginators\" and the Netflix series \"Skylanders Academy\", the company raised its annual guidance to revenues of $6.45 billion and EPS of $0.98. Though much of the company's growth for the year will be attributed to the acquisition of King Digital, the strength of the content launched during the year cannot be ignored. Activision should take heart of the fact that it has managed to keep excitement around the launch and new expansion of its successful franchise names running, even though the buzz usually dies off after a while.END", "Investors with a high risk appetite always look for a momentum strategy that can add to their portfolio returns.

Investors are looking for both income and growth in their portfolios irrespective of market conditions.

This is because these stocks act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty and stock market volatility. Simultaneously, these offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.Additionally, these pose a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.

Hardware sales are down 6% to $178.1 million whereas console software sales increased 8% to $273.7 million.Sales of Microsoft's MSFT Xbox One beat the likes of Sony's PS4 and Nintendo's 3DS. Release of Xbox One S caused a 37% jump in unit sales and for 3DS, unit spending was up 83% driven by the Pok\u00e9mon Go craze. However, higher sales of Xbox One S and 3DS couldn't offset the fall in sales of PS4 and other older consoles, resulting in an overall decline for the segment.On the other hand, console software sales grew mainly driven by releases of titles like Madden NFL, No Man's Sky and Deus Ex. However, Madden 17, despite being the highest selling title saw its sales fall 3% compared with NFL 16 released in Aug 2015. Take Two Interactive's TTWO Grand Auto Theft V and Activision Blizzard's Overwatch occupied the fourth and fifth spots on the list of highest selling titles for the months.

(Symbol: ATVI) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $40.68/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $30 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.92. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.4% return against the $30 commitment, or a 4.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ATVI's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $30 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. ( Do options carry counterparty risk? This and six other common options myths debunked ). So unless Activision Blizzard, Inc. sees its shares fall 26.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $28.08 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.92 from $30), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.5% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 4.5% figure actually exceeds the 0.6% annualized dividend paid by Activision Blizzard, Inc. by 3.9%, based on the current share price of $40.68. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 26.22% to reach the $30 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Activision Blizzard, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for ATVI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 0.6% annualized dividend yield.END", "When hedge fund manager \"titans\" think alike, investors are wise to pay attention.

It is not every day we see this many notable hedge fund managers thinking alike, so we wanted to take a closer look.Before we continue, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position.

It now covers multiple sectors and generates more revenue than the movie and music industry. Last year total revenue in the U.S. eclipsed $23.5 billion, jumping 5% from a year earlier. A big part of that increase is due to a shift away from physical games towards digital software.In the past 5 years, video game publishers have focused on expanding their direct to consumer channels through robust digital offerings. Meanwhile, the emergence of mobile gaming, eSports and virtual reality are poised to take the industry by storm in the next few years. With the industry growing at a rapid clip, it should be near the top of any investor\u2019s list.Video Game IndustryFor starters, the video game industry consists of three primary sectors; PC, console and mobile. PC gaming is currently the biggest moneymaker followed by console and mobile. However, mobile is poised to eclipse both PC and console sales in the next 5 years. Console gaming remains a blue chipper in the industry with limited upside or downside potential.Despite the booming popularity of PC games, computer sales continue to struggle. Names like HP (HPQ) and IBM (IBM) continue to point to a weak PC market as the source of its problems. Both stocks are down double digits in the past 12 months and should only be pursued as long term investments.Console gaming, on the other hand, has become so advanced that they are essentially mini computers in the living room. Currently, there are three major consoles on the market: Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One and Nintendo\u2019s Wii U. There is little question as to who dominates this segment. The PS4 has sold 40 million units worldwide since its debut, nearly double what Xbox has moved. Sony is also updating its system to support virtual reality and 4k functionality which projects to be high growth areas. Sony (SNE) stock is down in the past 12 months, but has reconciled some of its losses since the start of the year.Mobile GamingMobile gaming is quite different than it was when Snake launched in 1998. The smartphones we carry today have become so advanced that they replicate the capabilities of computers at the turn of the millennium. The Apple app store has been a popular place for developers to sell their games to a relatively untapped market.Viral sensations such as Clash of Clans, Angry Birds, FarmVille, and Candy Crush have brought their respective makers fame and fortune. In the past 3 years mobile gaming has been brought to the public market with mixed results.Glu Mobile (GLUU) and Zynga (ZNGA) have suffered as publicly traded companies as they attempt to deliver new viral sensations. King Digital, on the other hand, was recently taken over by Activision Blizzard in a deal valued at $5.9 billion and more importantly removed from the NYSE. Mobile gaming is still expected to eclipse PC and console sales, despite limited success on the financial market.Game DevelopersVideo game publishers have seen the greatest impact from the shift to digital games. The recent advancements in technology and streaming now allow users to download games rather than visiting the local GameStop. Developers have seen digital downloads jump as they no longer need to shepherd their games through physical retailers.The market for digital games grew 8% in 2015 with downloads to consoles making the biggest leap. Activision was the top earner amongst publishers, pointing to an uptake in digital services for its recent success. Game publishers remain a popular destination for investments as Activision (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take Two Interactive (TTWO) are all up over 20% in the past 12 months.What\u2019s NextThe newest innovations in technology are poised to take over the gaming industry. Virtual reality and eSports are already household names so it\u2019s clear why most investors are rushing to get a piece of the pie. Facebook\u2019s Oculus Rift is scheduled for shipment in the next few months with industry experts optimistic about its potential.Virtual reality systems are not only interactive but appeal to users\u2019 senses of sight and hearing, creating a truly immersive experience. Some studies estimate VR/AR gaming will generate $10 billion in revenue by 2020.eSports is already a big business, but has only recently made the mainstream news. The eSports ecosystem is already a $300 million industry with the potential to surpass $1 billion by 2018. It has over 205 million fans with expectations to garner 100 million new fans over the same time frame.Some of the most interesting opportunities for investors are in streaming, branding, and sponsorships.

Such moves are important for Activision as it strives to position itself as a broad based media company.These apart, the company has been benefiting from its relentless focus on broadening its franchise portfolio, innovation and initiatives to expand to new geographies. Most importantly, the acquisition of Candy Crush maker King Digital Entertainment is especially of significance for Activision as it is allowing the company to expand its presence in the lucrative mobile gaming business (which otherwise had been a sore point for the company).As a result of these developments, the company's shares have surged over 16% in the past month, in contrast to a gain of only 1.1% in the S&P 500 index over the same period.

The persistent oil price weakness was one of the major factors behind the underperformance. Adding to the woes, the negative earnings trend is expected to continue through the first half of this year with growth unlikely before late 2016.Factors Behind the Negative Earnings TrendIn order to better understand the earnings trend in the market, let us analyze the stocks included in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500). Going by the quarterly performances last year, the S&P 500 witnessed earnings declines of 2.2%, 2.6% and 6.4% in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, after increasing by 3% during the first quarter.The results posted in the last four earnings seasons show the Oil/Energy sector at its weakest. Lackluster earnings figures hurt the overall growth picture of the S&P 500 index. Data-wise, the Oil/Energy sector witnessed earnings declines of 54.7%, 60.3%, 56.2% and 77.5% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. A supply glut in the face of lackluster global demand led to further deterioration in crude prices. Moreover, a stronger dollar made the greenback-priced crude costlier for investors with foreign currency. The turmoil in Greece, Iran and China added to the pressure.Hence, the overall market condition remained bleak as growth was stunted by a slowing global economy, a strong U.S. dollar, and weakness in oil and other commodity sectors.END", "Nintendo Co.

Its two main products, World of Warcraft and Call of Duty , continue to be caught in the transition from consoles to smartphones. What does not help either is the rapid rise of the casual gamer who is not an aficionado of hardcore games in general and of Call of Duty in particular.Whatever the reasons for the decline in Activision's main products are, there is no question that there is a decline.First, World of Warcraft . The game hit its peak of just shy of 12.5 million subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2010. Since then, it has steadily declined, with a short recovery in Q4 2014. By end of the third quarter 2015, the game had slightly over 5 million subscribers and is expected to have ended up slightly below 5 million by the end of 2015. Worse, it looks probable that this decline is very likely to continue and will not be reversed by the forthcoming release of World of Warcraft: Legion on September 21, 2016.The picture is not looking much better for the other major driver - Call of Duty .

Yet coming into its fiscal third-quarter report on Wednesday, Take-Two investors worry about the impact that not having a new blockbuster installment of its biggest franchise will have on its overall results. Moreover, competition from Activision Blizzard remains fierce, and Activision Blizzard has outpaced gains in Take-Two stock over the past year.

Kotick stated that his goal was to \"build the ESPN of video games\" -- a premium cable TV channel dedicated exclusively to gaming.E-sports viewership is certainly on the rise. SuperData research claims that there are currently 134 million viewers worldwide, and that figure could grow at around 30% over the next five years.

The publisher capitalized on its growing gamer audience with hit releases in sports franchises like NBA 2K , along with steady demand for its Grand Theft Auto V blockbuster.Image source: Take-Two Interactive.Because a growing portion of those sales are occurring online, Take-Two's profitability is rising as well: Gross profit margin is up to 46% from 42% a year ago.

This is especially important in the fast-moving technology field.With that in mind, let's look at the top non-levered, non-inverse tech-sector ETF this week.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $37.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $36.16 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ATVI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $38.61/share today.Because the $37.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

In fact, the company released a special mid-year edition of the franchise just before the event: 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil, which further boosted the franchise's sales. On the other hand, there is no major soccer tournament in 2015, and that will be a major factor in the slower volume growth of the franchise.According to sales data by VGChartz, FIFA 16 volume sales in the first week of the release reached 4.944 million units comparable to that of FIFA 15 , which sold 4.947 million units in its first week.

Yet what's more impressive is how well Home Depot has responded to the housing bust and the ensuing recession in 2008. The company was able to adapt to an economic environment in which homeowners were underwater on their mortgages, emphasizing renovation projects to make homes more livable since many homeowners couldn't sell their homes to move up to higher price points.With the housing market having recovered, Home Depot has successfully used a two-part strategy. It is still catering to do-it-yourself homeowners, but it has also built up a bigger presence among professionals needing supplies to do projects. In addition, offering its own project-based work has also helped lift Home Depot's sales. Even though the stock is at all-time highs, Home Depot's latest financials suggest that there's plenty of growth left for the retailer in the next decade.Chipotle will get healthier By contrast, fast-casual restaurant Chipotle Mexican Grill has been dealing with less-than-perfect conditions lately.

This flagship brand has been posting soft sales since the beginning of 2013. Stiff competition from other fashion dolls is dampening the demand for this iconic brand. Meanwhile, Mattel's Monster High brand once again experienced a challenging quarter.We would like to remind investors that except for the first quarter of 2015, Mattel's revenues have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate since the beginning of 2014. Though overall POS has been positive so far in 2015 (down in third quarter 2015), owing to the company's efforts to lower its retail inventories, the improvement is not broad based. Meanwhile, despite the cost saving initiatives, adjusted gross margin has declined so far in 2015 owing to costs related to marketing and promotional initiatives and for clearing inventories including digital efforts.END", "With Q3 earnings in the books, most Facebook investors and industry pundits are relishing in yet another blow-out quarter.

At a recent Q&A session at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, Zuckerberg pledged to \"prioritize\" shutting down unwanted invitations, although he didn't didn't explain which features will be removed.Source: Pixabay.Back in the early days of Facebook, social games -- particularly those from Zynga -- drew a lot of new users to the site. But three years ago, new contract terms weakened that symbiotic relationship. Facebook's subsequent reformatting of its Timeline, News Feed, and Notifications further marginalized social games. If Facebook places even more restrictions on game notifications or blocks them altogether, how badly would Zynga and its social gaming peers suffer?Why Facebook wants to kill game notifications Today, Facebook no longer needs social games to drive its active user growth. Instead, it's investing heavily in turning the social network into a first-party ecosystem with its own video, news publishing, and e-commerce platforms. It's turning Messenger, its stand-alone chat app, into a monolithic platform with its own app store. It's also tethering third-party apps and websites to this ecosystem through time-saving single-sign ons.Within this new system, Flash-based games on Facebook seem outdated and out of place. More importantly, many social games reward users with powerups for spamming non-players with invitations. If these invitations are burying Facebook's own first-party ecosystem notifications, it's easy to see why Zuckerberg is interested in blocking them altogether.END", "\u2022 Shares of Activision Blizzard, Inc.

A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The combination of EA's Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of +6.06% makes us confident in looking for positive earnings surprise this quarter.Factors at PlayWe believe that EA's strong games portfolio, strength in new consoles and continuing growth in the mobile market are key growth catalysts. Also better-than-expected sales of Battlefield Hardline are contributing to the top line. Moreover, strong growth in digital sales coupled with cost optimization initiatives will be beneficial going forward.This quarter, the company is likely to benefit from its new launches like EA SPORTS FIFA 16 , Madden NFL 16 and others.

Guitar Hero Live hits stores on Tuesday, and with that comes the hope that musical-timing games rock back into fashion.Activision Blizzard had a hit on its hands a decade ago. It was the publisher for the original Guitar Hero , developed by RedOctane and Harmonix in 2005. It liked what it saw, snapping up RedOctane two years later. Harmonix would go on to be acquired by MTV Games, turning to Activision Blizzard rival Electronic Arts to distribute its competing Rock Band franchise.Gamers ate up the niche, for a few years at least. Players took to guitars, microphones, and faux drum kits as controllers. Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts were the toast of the town. The genre breathed new life into the gaming market at a time when the Wii was already getting gamers to stand up and move. Small-box specialty retailers may have resisted at first. They had to give up shelf and storage space that was once dedicated to new and secondhand games to make room for bulky plastic guitars and drum kits. However, once the games started selling and crowds started to gather to watch folks play air guitar, it helped spark a retail revolution.By the time Activision Blizzard seemed to have milked the last bit of amp juice out of the franchise, it had spawned six generations of the game, as well as the short-lived DJ Hero and Band Hero spinoffs. Sales peaked in 2008, and by the time that the final entry rolled out in 2010 it was a fair bet that we would never be collecting guitar controllers again.END", "Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel , one standout is the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (Symbol: RYT) where we have detected an approximate $22.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 3.2% decrease week over week (from 7,700,000 to 7,450,000).

On September 15, 2015, the company released the 18 GB expansion pack, aimed at expanding the game's sundry offerings. The expansion pack also includes a new raid, King's Fall, which went live three days after the expansion launch. The Taken King, the third expansion pack in the series, not only has great potential to boost the gamer base for the title, but can also provide a huge boost to the company's financials.

However, on both occasions, the company's stock price didn't show much movement. The important thing to notice is that the release of the first DLC pack, The Dark Below, happened during the peak of the holiday season, when gamers were busy buying other newly released popular games. On the other hand, it seemed like a somewhat desultory add-on to some core gamers, as there were many lingering issues with the game's content after the expansion. The tough timing and issues with the game's content contributed to the weak growth of the game's unit sales.The game's second DLC pack, House Of Wolves, saw the company bring new features to the storyline, but the solution to the endgame issues remained somewhat neglected. On a whole, the company managed to get positive reviews from expert-level players, but it still wasn't a perfect strike. \n\n\n\nThe company showcased the third expansion pack, The Taken King , during the 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) .

Additionally, the next major shooter game to hit the market is Activision's Call of Duty in November. This gives users ample time to play and get used to the game's new features and storyline.Improved ContentAfter the mixed reception of the first two efforts, the onus was on the company to give its users whatever they want. As a result, most of the effort was apparently put in changing the game-play and story of the game. Destiny has proven itself to be a good shooter game for the next-generation consoles, though the game has to face some of the blockbuster titles this season, including Fallout 4 and Call of Duty.The company claims that this expansion will make the game more player-friendly, with additional innovative features. Further, the end-game features have been taken care of, according to the company. The Taken King, with its King's Raid , has been generating hype among core gamers after the E3. Fixing the issues will be a great start for the franchise.Manageable Price PointThe new expansion comes at a retail price of $40. For gamers who have yet to buy the game, the original Destiny game plus both the expansions and all the content in The Taken King will be available for $60. It is a great discount price for new starters and will surely attract more gamers, further boosting the company's revenues from the franchise.Activision Blizzard should be off to a solid start if the game's new expansion pack gets a positive user response. The company's 2015 holiday season will largely depend on how Destiny's new expansion pack is received by gamers.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis ResearchThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define.

The stock has risen more than 54% since the start of this year, driven by strong franchise momentum. \n\n\n\nOur $29 price estimate for Activision Blizzard's stock is roughly the same as the current market price.See our complete analysis of Activision's stock hereCall of Duty: Widening The GapThe FPS (First-Person Shooter) leader, Call of Duty, has been a dominating franchise for many years now, with the highest worldwide sales and one of the largest online gamer bases. The latest edition of the franchise, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare , is still in high demand among the game lovers, with roughly 19.5 million units sold through June 2015. The increasing contribution of the digital receipts indicates the rising popularity of online game contents and mobile platforms among the users. Downloadable content (DLC) of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, success of Call of Duty Online in China, increasing number of accounts on Battle.net, and the release of Heroes of The Storm contributed significantly to the digital growth in the second quarter.The only topic of concern for the company is the sluggish performance of World of Warcraft due to its declining subscriber base. To remedy the situation, the company has been trying to introduce new expansion packs. In June, the company launched a non-expansion content update for the franchise, aimed at stabilizing the subscriber base in the last part of the quarter. However, with the introduction of many free-to-play online games in same category, Activision Blizzard's efforts seem unproductive.Trefis estimates the number of subscribers for World of Warcraft to drop to 5.8 million by the end of this year.Apart from these major contributions, the release of Hearthstone on handheld devices , Destiny's new expansion pack: House of Wolves, and Diablo III's success in China, were other drivers that led the revenue growth in the second quarter. Activision is highly confident ahead of its new releases, which include Destiny's mega expansion:  The Taken King, Skylanders SuperChargers, Guitar Hero Live, Hearthstone's next expansion: The Grand Tournament, and Call of Duty: Black Ops III. More details about the upcoming surprises will be revealed in the Gamescom 2015 event, taking place from August 5 to 9, 2015.Earnings takeaways:END", "What: Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software saw its stock jump 15% higher during the month of July, according to  S&P Capital IQ data. The bounce put shares at a new all-time high, leaving Take-Two investors up 50% over just the last year. \n\n\n\n TTWO data by YChartsSo what: With second-quarter earnings due out on the afternoon of Aug. 10, investors are betting that Take-Two can benefit from the same powerful trends that have lifted sales and profits at rivals Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts . These game publishers far outweigh Take-Two in terms of market capitalization. But their latest results show that the industry is on a broad upswing that should help Take-Two's business as well.A banner next-generation console launch has built a huge installed base of gaming devices. And players are embracing digital content purchases, which is extending the productive life of hit video games and making the properties far more profitable for game developers. Activision and EA both logged record high second-quarter profit margins last week. And digital sales now account for more than half of these video game giants' businesses.END", "Take-Two Interactive Software ( TTWO ), one of the world's leading developers of video games, reported its first quarter fiscal 2016 results after the closing bell this afternoon.Take-Two is most notable for its NBA 2k, Grand Theft Auto, and Borderlands games franchises. A series of successful games, led by Grand Theft Auto V, has put Take-Two in a comfortable position recently. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 250%.Despite a successful product pipeline, Take-Two could struggle to maintain its market advantage in the near future. Grand Theft Auto 6 isn't set to be released until 2017, meaning competitors like Electronic Arts ( EA ), Activision Blizzard ( ATVI ), and Zynga ( ZNGA ) have time to catch up. Also, Take-Two relies heavily on console-based games, with a very limited mobile library.Currently, Take-Two holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This led to solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 250%. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters, leading to an average positive earnings surprise of 88.90%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe believe that Take-Two's robust product pipeline will drive top-line growth and profitability in the fiscal first quarter. The launch of NBA 2K15, Evolve, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and Civilization: Beyond Earth will aid the top line, in our view. Further, Take-Two sales are gaining from Grand Theft Auto V, digital revenues and associated DLC revenues.Although Take-Two has a healthy product pipeline, we believe that it will be challenging for the upcoming games to repeat the success of Grand Theft Auto V. The company is rumored to release its next installment of Grand Theft Auto 6 in 2017. Despite a loyal customer base, a 2017 release will be way too slow to capture market share from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA), Activision ATVI and Zynga ZNGA . Moreover, Take-Two's overdependence on console gaming sales and the lack of mobile gaming titles is a major headwind over the near term.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Take-Two is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen.

( WFM ) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walt Disney Company ( DIS ) and Activision Blizzard ( ATVI ).Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day :Columbia Sportswear Company ( COLM ) is riding the wave of growth in active apparel and footwear. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) recently raised full year guidance as it enters the fall season with \"robust momentum.\"Columbia sells its active lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment in 100 countries. In addition to the Columbia brand, which was founded in 1938 in Portland, Oregon, it owns Mountain Hardwear, Sorel, prAna, Montrail and OutDry brands.On July 30, Columbia reported its fiscal second quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents.END", "END", "The Walt Disney Company ( DIS ) posted slightly mixed earnings and revenues for its fiscal Q3 2015 after the market close on Tuesday. Earnings of $1.45 per share topped the Zacks consensus estimate of $1.39. Revenues came in a tad light of expectations at $13.1 billion; the Zacks consensus estimate was for $13.17 billion in revenues. But nearly across the board the entertainment giant posted growth, with the exception of the smaller Interactive division.The revenue miss looks to be related to foreign exchange concerns in Europe; Disney - Paris is the only hindrance in the otherwise strong Parks & Resorts segment, which showed strength in U.S. spending and volume. Even two items analysts had expected may have given Disney a bit of trouble in the quarter -- lack of growth in its ESPN sports unit of the Media sector and a possible write-down of its unsuccessful \"Tomorrowland\" film -- proved to not be the case. In fact, Disney has now passed the $200 billion market-cap threshold for the first time in its history.Looking ahead (even though Disney does not provide specific guidance in its quarterly earnings reports), extremely high hopes for the forthcoming \"Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens\" sequel has helped stoked Disney shares year to date -- it is the top performer on the Dow for 2015 thus far -- and this slightly mixed report does not seem to threaten this. This is the 8th straight quarterly beat for Disney, and CEO Bob Iger looks to continue having operations under control.Shares of Disney are down 2 percent following the earnings report but prior to the conference call at the top of the hour, in which many investor concerns will be addressed by Iger and new CFO Christine McCarthy.

Housing recovery, rising wages and cheaper fuel are the other positives. Even though the U.S. economy faltered a bit in the first quarter of the year, it was mostly due to a stronger dollar and a harsh winter.The consumer discretionary sector has caught brokers' attention as people are now willing to spend on discretionary items, albeit conservatively. The sector manufactures products that consumers buy because they want to and not because they need to.Companies operating in this space include fast-food restaurants, providers of entertainment products and services, makers of automobiles, textiles, apparels and luxury goods etc. These products and services will only be sought by consumers if they have sufficient disposable income.Currently, low supply in the market and an improving job market are being partially offset by a tighter credit market and fierce retail competition. Amid this environment, consumers are carefully spending their savings on discretionary items. Given the scenario,  Charles Schwab Corp. gives the sector a Marketperform rating.END", "Microsoft recently made some big announcements during E3 2015.

With the deal, Hasbro will be able to use Machinima's expertise which is one of the biggest and most popular gaming companies among millennial in the entertainment industry. The Transformer franchise has been a blockbuster hit for Hasbro ever since the toymaker collaborated with the movie franchisee.The toy industry, of late, has been witnessing a change as children shift toward video games and personal electronic devices for entertainment, negatively affecting profit. Toys and video games related to popular movie and gaming franchisees have generally been successful.

The better-than-expected results came on the back of strong game line-up and consistent growth in mobile markets. Going forward, we believe that the growing digital sales and cost containment will boost margin expansion. In addition, increased consumer spending on smartphones and tablets will aid the company's online business.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock significantly gained from the ongoing shift from physical to digital versions of video games. The digital business is expected to remain a key driver for the company and should offset weak growth in traditional packaged-goods games. The company expects the digital business (50% of revenues) to continue to grow in fiscal 2015 and beyond, primarily backed by the strong mobile business. Currently, EA SPORTS titles are a major hit among mobile gamers. In addition, the company's freemium and extra content services are generating significant market traction, driving top-line growth.Nevertheless, video games have to remain popular to generate revenues. Though EA has a powerful line of games that can be repeatedly upgraded, there is no assurance that a particular game will be a hit. So the underperformance of any title would affect results, with sales and earnings missing expectations. The video game business is highly cyclical and heavily dependent on regular upgrade or new game software and hardware system launch.END", "Here are 5 stocks added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) List today:END", "GameStop ( GME ) reported an impressive first quarter earnings report for the fiscal 2015, with same store sales growth of 8.6%, compared to 5.8% growth in the same period last year. The company's net revenues rose 3.2% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $2.06 billion, driven by robust growths in new video game software sales, technology brands, as well as in the digital segment. On the other hand, the pre-owned products segment witnessed 3.4% y-o-y decline, whereas the new video game hardware segment witnessed flat growth of merely 40 basis points growth in sales. On a non-GAAP basis, digital receipts grew 17.2% y-o-y to $222.2 million, led by growth in downloadable content (DLC) for Evolve and Mortal Kombat, as well as mobile and Steam Cards. Revenues from mobile and consumer electronics grew 34% y-o-y to $137 million, owing to 70% growth in the Technology brands revenues ($102.2 million). As a result, diluted EPS grew 15% y-o-y to $0.68.Our price estimate for the company's stock is $44, which is roughly 10% above the current market price.See our complete analysis of GameStopRobust Software Sales Provide Strength To Top-line GrowthAccording to the research group NPD, gamers spent $595 million on new physical software, hardware, and other accessories, up 3% year-over-year (y-o-y) in April 2015. However, the hardware sales were down 4% y-o-y to $184 million, due to a strong comparison with last year's April sales, as well as a 55% decline in demand for previous generation consoles. On the other hand, software sales witnessed 13% y-o-y growth to $256 million. For the first trimester, hardware sales were down 10% y-o-y, whereas the software sales strengthened by roughly 5%. \n\n\n\nIn the first quarter, the company's software sales grew 9.6% y-o-y to $614 million, driven by strong sales of the new titles in the market, such as Electronic Arts' ( EA ) Battlefield Hardline and Warner Bros' Mortal Kombat X. Capturing a significant market share of these key titles led to a record Q1 new software market share of 45%. In the month of April, GameStop managed to sell 57% of all the Xbox One and PS4 software titles.GameStop expects the software sales to decline slightly in the second quarter, as the company expects that the two biggest title releases: Bewitcher 3 and Batman Arkham Knight might not sell as many units as the last year's two biggest titles in the same period: Watchdogs and Mario Kart .Sluggish Growth In Other SegmentsGameStop's new video game hardware segment grew only 0.4% in the first quarter, but the growth was 5.1% if we exclude the effect of FX. However, the little growth was driven by strong sales of PS4 handheld units. GameStop nearly doubled its Xbox One market share during the month of April, and drove nearly two-thirds of Xbox One industry growth during the month. The company sold 46% of all the Xbox One and PS4 hardware and software combined during Q1, up 610 basis points y-o-y.On the other hand, Pre-owned products segment witnessed 3.5% y-o-y decline in the revenue growth, as the growth in next-generation pre-owned products was offset by declining demand for previous generation pre-owned products. However, the segment witnessed margins as high as 49.1%, which is 140 basis points higher than that in Q4 2014.Accelerated Development In Technology Brand SegmentIn the first quarter, Technology Brands revenues increased 70% y-o-y to $102.2 million, with the addition of 65 net new stores. In February 2015, GameStop showed interest in some of the store locations of RadioShack, which declared bankruptcy earlier this year. RadioShack got the approval from a U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge to auction its 2,000 stores. GameStop, however, won the auction for the right to take over nearly 163 RadioShack stores, with a payment of $15,000 per store to take over the leases. GameStop expects a potential IRR of 25% from these stores. High margins in this segment led to a 360 basis point improvement in the margins of the mobile and consumer electronics segment to 39.8%. The company plans to open 450-550 technology brand stores in fiscal 2015.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis ResearchThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.END", "Video game retailer GameStop last week posted surprisingly strong first-quarter results .
