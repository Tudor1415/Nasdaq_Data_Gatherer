That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0 It's Friday, June 5, and we're talking about the most absurd earnings beat we've ever seen. I'm your host Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined by Fool.com's high chancellor of below averageness, Brian Feroldi. Brian, you have outdone yourself today. [laughs] Thank you. I thought you'd appreciate that one. [laughs] [laughs] There's this conjuring up of, both, royalty and self-deprecation with that one; that one 's pretty good. [laughs] I like to confuse people ... [laughs] Brian, this is a big day for you, isn't it? Yes, it is a big day. Today was the last day of my kids getting new assignments at school. They are not finished yet, next week is their last week, but it's going to be smooth sailing and fun next week. So, the pain that has been homeschooling is finally starting to be in the rearview mirror. And let me assure you, Dylan, it has been painful. Well, Brian, how does the pain of homeschooling compare to the task of entertaining for the Summer vacation; are those on par with each other? Oh, this is a weird, weird time, because I normally dread the end of school. Like, it's like, \"Oh, God! They are going to be home all the time.\" Now, because of the homeschooling, I'm like, \"God! School, please end.\" [laughs] So, it's definitely some weird emotions. Yes. I've felt very lucky right now and for the last couple of months, because, you know, we've had the good fortune of working for a business that's able to be remote and we're doing great. And we're able to keep working and be relatively uninterrupted. You and I are still able to get together and do these awesome conversations that we love doing so much. But also, I don't have kids, and so, [laughs] the stay-at-home, the quarantine, it has felt a lot easier than I think it has felt for a lot of my friends who are parents. And you're, kind of, both, parent, entertainer, and doing whatever you normally do during the day, and that's a lot to take on.Yes. I'm used to having the house to myself, to be able to think and focus, and it hasn't been that way for a couple of months so, that's OK. Yeah. Well, I'm just thrilled that you're able to find some peace and quiet so that we can record this episode [laughs] and that there isn't too much noise over at the house. Big day for you, Brian, but a big week, and maybe this is just like a big quarter, we can put it that way, for Zoom, the video communications stock; perhaps the stock of 2020. Yeah, I think that that's completely fair. This company was doing fabulous before COVID-19 and then it just caught fire, it caught the media's attention. The company was up over 200% year-to-date prior to this report, so talking about having some big expectations. And then it actually popped after the company reported earnings. So, as you, kind of, prelude at the top of the show, the numbers were stunning. Yeah. I mean, we've talked about this company plenty. And as with any company that goes through an insane amount of growth and attention in a really short period of time, they have not gone without their speed bumps and their hick-ups along the way. A lot of users flooding to this platform, particularly on the free side, and learning how to use it and the company having to adjust to all of that, there were some security concerns.With all of that going on, though, incredible headline numbers when it comes to their earnings report. Revenue up almost 170% year-over-year to just under $330 million; the guidance, Brian, was just over $200 million, that's bonkers. \"Bonkers\" is the word, I think, Dylan, to use there. And, yeah, Wall Street was expecting $202 million. So, Wall Street was above guidance, the actual result, again, $328 million; enormous topside beat. That wasn't all that surprising given how much we know the usage of this company's platform has just exploded.Some other headline numbers from the quarter that I thought were worth highlighting: gross margin actually fell during the period to 69.4%. In the year ago period, it was about 81%. Zoom CEO and Founder, Eric Yuan, came out and let investors know that. During the middle of the quarter he basically said, the usage on our platform is exploding, we have to invest like crazy to ensure that we can actually meet it, expect gross margin to decline, so it did decline. Still very healthy at almost 70%.All the company's operating costs up big time. R&D was up 66%, sales and marketing up 69%, G&A expenses up 196%. But even with all those ballooning costs, the revenue growth was so huge that the non-GAAP earnings came in at $0.20 per share, that was up 566%. They were guiding for $0.10 and Wall Street was expecting $0.09, so they doubled the bottom-line number too. Yeah. And it's tough to see a gross margin number go down. I think in the case of Zoom though, Zoom has had probably the greatest free advertising campaign of the last three months that any company has perhaps ever seen. And they have just become such a large part of the consciousness. I think you're willing to accept a slightly smaller gross margin in order to enjoy that widespread awareness. And some of that's just, you know, they have free users that are hopping on the platform, they have more usage than they're expecting, they're investing in security, they're doing all these things to improve the product. 70% gross margin is still pretty darn good. Yeah, not bad, right? How many companies would kill for a 70% gross margin, in general, let alone saying, \"Sorry, our gross margin was so terrible this quarter.\" And they called out the, kind of, \"why\" on the conference call, they said, when the pandemic started, their own data centers were overwhelmed. They just could not handle the volume to scale fast enough. So, they did outsource a whole bunch of that volume to their partners. Most notably,  Web Services is running some of this. They actually called out  as another company that they outsourced some of it too. They did guide for gross margins to return to normal eventually as they continue to invest in their platform and build it out, but still, very healthy numbers. It would be crazy for them to go through this kind of growth and not have it hit their business in some way. You know, for all the positive numbers that we're going to talk about here, there has to be some sacrifice somewhere, and it happens to be with their gross margin. This is a SaaS business essentially, right? And the number that we always look at for SaaS businesses, Brian, that net expansion rate number, how did it clock in for Zoom this quarter? So, they didn't call out the specific number, but they did say that net dollar expansion was over 130% for the eighth consecutive quarter in a row. And on the call when they were talking about their revenue growth for the period, they did say that 71% of the top-line expansion was driven by new customers, 29% came from existing ones. But again, a number of 130% shows us that even their existing customers were buying a lot more from Zoom, which is one of the reasons that we absolutely [laughs] love the SaaS business model in general.Some of the numbers that I thought were pretty exciting. The number of customers that are going to spend $100,000 with this company over the trailing 12 months jumped 90% to 769. They added a 128 of those customers sequentially in just that period. And a nutty number here is the number of minutes that people are using their platform. At the beginning of the year, they were expecting for the year to do about 100 billion total minutes on Zoom; based on April's run-rate, 2 trillion, [total minutes] that's a 20X increase in a matter of months; stunning. Those are just staggering numbers. And I think, to go back to that expansion rate figure we were talking about, from a transparency perspective, I would really like for them to break that out, that's one critique I think I have is, you know like, it would be really good to know what the number is. We like getting, because it's such a vital number, and it's so descriptive of what's going on with the business, the specifics. I'll settle for over 130%, because the number is just so darn gaudy anyways.But you think about all of the people that are flocking to this platform with what's going on, this number is saying, even without those folks, we'd be enjoying about 30% growth. All of this other stuff that's coming on to the platform is just additional growth that will wind up becoming, probably, you know, some portion of that, loyal recurring growth down the road too. Yeah. And I'm with you there. Although, I will say another company that I know and follow, , they don't give us the exact number either, what they say is we're targeting between 110% and 120%. And whenever they're within that range, they said, yes, we're within that range. The goal there is to focus on the business model that is working, not necessarily to get pinned down on one number and whether it was up sequentially or down sequentially. So, I agree with you, I prefer them to say, we had 142% or 137%, but overall, more than 130%. Fantastic. Yeah. I'm always going to nitpick, though, I want the number, I want the data, Brian. And while we didn't get that, we got plenty of other good numbers. Deferred revenue for this business grew 270% to over $500 million. RPO [Revenue Performance Obligation] -- which is probably a metric that we need to explain, because, frankly, you and I were a little bit confused by it -- also grew pretty dramatically. Yeah, this is basically, think of it as, kind of, their backlog, it's remaining performing obligations. This number is more than $1.1 billion, this was up 184%. And they did say that over the next 12 months they expect to be able to recognize about 72% of that number, so about $772 million will be converted into revenue. So, best to think of that, basically, as a backlog.And, Dylan, how is this for an impressive figure? Free cash flow, so the amount of cash that was generated at the business after subtracting capital expenditures, was $252 million, up from $15 million in the year ago period. Again, stunning. Yeah. And all these numbers are telling us basically what happened. You know, we have that RPO number, that is kind of a signal of what will come for this business; and the idea of deferred revenue is also a little bit of a forward-looking number. But the most part, we've been looking at quarterly numbers that describe the quarter behind us. What is perhaps even more impressive is what the company offered in terms [laughs] of guidance going forward and what they are looking at for their full-year 2020; just absolutely ridiculous. Yeah. Again, so everything, kind of, took off in March; that's when, you know, COVID-19 stay-at-home orders really kicked into high gear. April was kind of the peak. And so, then the quarter that we're in right now, it's just going to be another monster run for the company. So, they said to expect revenue in the current quarter to be about $495 million to $500 million, up 241% year-over-year, so that's a sequential acceleration. Again, just amazing. Prior to that, they were calling for $199 million to $201 million. So, again, they're now calling for $495 million, they were previously calling for $200 million. Wall Street was also modeling for about $223 million. So, their midpoint of our guidance is more than double what Wall Street was previously predicting. Amazing. Yeah. And it's worth emphasizing, I mean, this is a business that was already growing quickly. You go back to pre-COVID and the period that they reported ending January 31 -- the three months ended there, which is their Q4 -- they posted $188 million in revenue, up from $105 million the year prior. So, this was already a business that was really moving. And the valuation implied that it was a high growth business. And what we've seen is already insane growth rates getting even more ridiculous. Yep. And that growth is expected to trickle down to the bottom-line too. They're calling for about $0.45 in earnings per share, up from $0.10 in the prior period, Wall Street was expecting $0.10 previously, they're now expecting about $0.41, but even the numbers that we're seeing now are beating Wall Street's guidance, which was already raised. So, just amazing. [laughs] And the full year picture, I mean, it's more of the same. I think we're going to say \"amazing,\" \"ridiculous,\" \"bonkers,\" 400x during this podcast. But for the full year, the company expects revenue to be in the range of $1.77 billion to $1.8 billion, which would be up approximately 185% to 189% year-over-year; you don't hear numbers like that often. No. I mean, just obscene, Dylan. Their old guidance was $900 million to $915 million, now almost $1.8 billion. That's a doubling. And the bottom-line is also going to be absurdly good, they're calling for earnings per share of $1.21 to $1.29, more than double what they were previously projecting and more than double what Wall Street was expecting. Yeah. And if we go back to when this company IPO'd, and you and I did this prospectus show, as we love to do when companies go public, where we get a look at the S-1 filing and we can really dig into the business. The narrative with this company was, fast-growing, unicorn, and, oh, by the way, they're profitable. And it was [laughs] one of those rare moments where we saw a company that had really impressive gross margins and the ability to scale, become even more profitable than they currently were, but they were currently profitable. To take something like that and then light it on fire and then throw gasoline on to it and just say \"Grow! grow! grow!\" based on current conditions, I don't know that anyone could have seen these kinds of numbers coming. Yep. And as expected, from as amazing as these numbers are, Wall Street was basically forced to upgrade its price targets across the board. I mean, we saw almost a dozen analyst firms come out and up their numbers from, say, the $100s range to the $200 range. My favorite upgrade, though, or price target increase, comes from , which has the company rated as a \"sell,\" and even though they have raised a sell, they increased their price target from $90 to $150, but all of that forced activity certainly lit some fire underneath the stock. So, understandable, why even when the numbers came out, as impressive as they were, and as high as the expectations were that the stock still popped post earnings. Right. And I think prior to this, there were some very real concerns about what is this company's valuation really backed by? Because this has been one of the pureplay coronavirus stay-at-home stocks, and it's been so in the news, you worry about the hype getting a little bit too far ahead of the stock and the valuation getting crazy. It's a valuation of about $56 billion for the whole company right now. But, of course, we are up pretty dramatically. I mean, over the past month, even after a little dip after they announced these earnings, shares are still up about 40%. So, there's been crazy appreciation.I could see why the street and a lot of people, myself included, were a little skeptical of whether the business could live up to its valuation. It seems like, certainly for the next nine months, business is going to be booming for them. Yeah. And that's exactly what they said on the earnings call, while they did give us some forward guidance for both the Q3 and Q4, one thing that we did hear from them was that basically April was the absolute peak of demand or at least the peak so far. But given that governments have started to ease shelter-in-place orders, it's natural to assume that the company's going to not benefit from that, but they did come out and say that they're projecting that the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the year, are basically going to be consistent with what they saw in the second quarter. So, not only has the floor been raised to a very, very high level, but they're expecting that to persist in the third and fourth quarter. So, that's got to be a bullish sign and better than you would expect if you were someone that believed prior to this, that this is just a one-time thing and it was going to spike up then it was going to spike back down. Management says, essentially, the gains are sustainable. Yeah. And that's the ultimate question and kind of the existential threat to this business is, it is so center stage and so of the moment right now, there are a lot of free users that are hopping into this, there are also a lot of smaller businesses that are starting to use it and maybe some larger enterprise clients that didn't have a video conferencing product available to employees and decided to give Zoom a go.And the concern is, are those people going to stick around? You know, are these incredible acquisition numbers that we're seeing, going to continue, maybe not, but are they going to be able to service those customers once they have them, and prove their value, wind up building out these long, sticky relationships that we love to see? Some numbers in this report would suggest that that might be happening. Yeah. I think so. And how often have we heard from so many companies that are basically saying that they're going to be taking jobs that were in-person and they're making them permanently remote. And while we don't expect that to happen with every job, certainly some will. And I've also heard anecdotally that a lot of people are saying, well, I'm still going to go into the office, but I'm going to go in three times a week or four times a week, and they're still going to be doing one or two days remotely.If that's the case, the need for Zoom is still there. So, I do think that this is a permanent paradigm shift for this company. Yeah. I think that all of this has forced people to really evaluate how they're working and it's forced companies and HR departments to really think about what makes the most sense. And, Brian, to your point, say, you and I work in the same office and you come in three days a week and I come in three days a week. We might only be in the office at the same time one day of those [laughs] five days of the week. And so, we're still going to need to use Zoom.And you couple more stay-at-home with the reality that more businesses are multinational, you have people in different areas, different offices, different time zones. The need for these products is not going away. This might be just the huge step change in adoption of this technology that gets us to more people hopping in and deciding to pay Zoom some money to use it. Uh-huh. And I also think it's worth pointing out, one of the questions we constantly get about Zoom or at least I've seen in my  feed is, does this company have a moat? And it is fair, right? We've seen how many companies,  and Google [] and  Teams basically coming out and said, yep, we have a video solution too, you can go on and use it. But I think when we did the S-1 show, we concluded that the reason that Zoom had a moat and the reason that Zoom was taking so much market share in what was already a crowded market from the get-go was that, it was the only one that was built from the ground up with a video-first mentality. And they actually have some special technology that allows videos to happen even when there's significant internet packet loss, so you can still get your message across.And again, anecdotally, my kids have been doing Google Meets with their classrooms, and I've heard for the teachers numerous times to say, once it gets above a certain number of users, the quality just plummets. So, if you need a video solution that is high-quality, reliable and can support lots of users, to me, Zoom is still the premier name. Yeah. I remember when we did that prospectus show, we were talking about the advantages that this business has. And one of the things that really popped out to me looking at that S-1, and I'm actually going to read directly from it right now, \"Our architecture is video-first, cloud-native and optimized to dynamically process and deliver reliable, high-quality video across devices.\" Boom! That says it. They're competing against a lot of people who have been in this space for a lot longer, haven't necessarily developed cloud-first applications, and that's why their product tends to work a lot better.If you're not convinced based on just the description, the fact that we're using it right now to be able to do this. I think we can also pull some data. And granted this is data that has been collected recently, and so, it's a little bit of a scramble to get this stuff together. I've seen it from several different outlets, some names that I don't know as well, so I've, kind of, cobbled it from a couple of different places, but no matter who you look at when you are looking at web conferencing, Zoom is No. 1 in market share. After them, there is GoToWebinar, there is  WebEx, and they are, kind of, jockeying for second and third, it'll depend on whatever dataset you're looking at, but those three are the big three, they command the market. I've seen Zoom at 30% market share, I've seen Zoom at 40% market share, either way, they are No. 1 by a healthy margin.And they are also right there with the other big players, Cisco, Microsoft,  in 's magic quadrant. And so, Gartner is this tech consulting firm, they do a lot of market research. And they look at all these different enterprise segments to see who is leading the way, who are the visionaries that are going to shape what all these software markets look like. Those are the four that they put in that magic quadrant of not only leading the market, but ultimately shaping the direction that it's going to go in. And Zoom is very highly ranked; of those four, I think it's maybe second. And so, not only are we seeing that it's a leader in terms of market share, but it is probably someone that's going to position where that web conferencing market ultimately goes. And it's also worth remembering that the Founder of Zoom was previously working at Cisco and he was embarrassed to go into work and he was in-charge of their video product, he wanted to make it better, which required them to build it from the ground up to be different, and he was told \"no.\" He became so frustrated that he left to found Zoom, because he wanted to build it from the ground up. And if you look at their numbers and their leadership position, it's clear that he was right. Yeah. And I think there are going to be some people who naturally question, you know, OK, that you threw some names out there, and I haven't heard you talk about Microsoft. Well, we talked about this a little bit when we did our show on  last week, but there is this tension between the bundled experience that comes with, you know, an enterprise having access to everything Microsoft does under the sun and these pure play software applications that do all of those things individually and possibly do it better. And I think there are certain services that a lot of companies are willing to pay up for because the experience is better, so far, it seems like Slack and Zoom are able to fall into that category. Yep. I mean, we've seen that exactly at The Fool, right? The Fool was using previous video conferencing solutions when Zoom came out and we tried it, switched over to it. Why? It was better and it worked. We're not the only company that has experienced that. Yep. I have access to Teams and I've never used it. [laughs] I think that that says a lot. And we get the benefit; I mean, selfishly, we get the benefit of being able to kick the tires on a lot of software solutions before we even necessarily look at them as investments. And it's really fun to look and talk with our IT department and see what winds up being adopted. I mean,  is one of the things, like, we used it at The Fool, and we were it at The Fool before I started following the company as a stock, but knowing and, kind of, getting in there firsthand and seeing what it looks like, seeing how much our customer service folks love it, the ticketing system, it made me a believer in a space that I probably didn't know as well and wouldn't have been as convinced of their market leadership, and Zoom is, kind of, the same thing for me. Yep, I totally agree. And there is something to be said for a company that is hyper-focused on just one thing versus a company that offers that same thing as a bundle to another product. Yeah. You are a shareholder of Zoom, right, Brian? I am sadly not, even though I absolutely love the S-1 and Eric Yuan; this is another one that's, being value-conscious, has come back to bite me. So, I am not \"yet\" a shareholder of Zoom, I guess, I should say. Yes. So, we are both FOMOs [Fear of missing out] [laughs] of Zoom or people that have missed out, I should say, on Zoom. And you know, there are going to be people that say, \"At this valuation, is it something that's worth buying?\" Man, it's a quality business and they've experienced some incredible growth. I'd love to see them continue to do it; the product seems great. I will give the boilerplate advice that I give with positions in general, you really start small with something that has enjoyed so much share price appreciation in such a short period of time. But on the flipside, it does show you, one of the metrics that we use to judge this company is the price-to-sales ratio, and boy! Has it been high, and boy! Does it keep getting higher! But when they came out and said, oh, by the way, our sales; yeah, they're double what we thought. That really takes that price-to-sales ratio down in a hurry. Yeah. And businesses that are growing at 80%-ish, like they were before all of this happened, deserve a premium, businesses that are growing at over 100% deserve an even bigger premium, [laughs] so. High-quality companies, in general, deserve to trade at a premium, and there's no doubt in my mind that Zoom is a very high-quality company. Yeah. We believe that winners win, and I think what we have seen would be, kind of, a five-year period of winning for Zoom collapsed into [laughs] about three months, because the adoption has just accelerated so quickly out of necessity. That is not to say that the story is done for them, if anything, I think we're moving more and more to a world where this type of technology is important. They just need to hold on to all these customers that they brought in. Completely. And it's not just Zoom, we should point out, that's doing so well, how many Software-as-a-Service companies have we seen just explode year-to-date and just skyrocket? But to your point, we've seen essentially years' worth of SaaS adoption get pulled forward and compressed into weeks or months timeframes. When you factor that in, perhaps the valuations that we're seeing today are not as extreme as they appear if you're just looking at the numbers, because again, so much adoption has been pulled forward. I think that's a good point, Brian, because we have so often been stuck looking at old valuation paradigms and new business approaches and platforms, right? You know, the idea of paying 20X sales for a company, 15 years ago, would be a little ludicrous. The idea of doing it now when you have, you know, some businesses with net expansion rates that are 130, 140, they are able to do gross margins of 85%, 90%, that's a fundamentally different business than what we've seen 15-20 years ago. Yep, it's the best business model I've ever seen in my entire life. And when you look at the numbers of these companies consistently, it's just like, wow! they're just stunning. Yeah. So, I think we need to do that transition to SaaS show at some point, because you pitched that to me as, I want to do it, but I don't have the [laughs] preparation time to be able to do that today, let's focus on Zoom's earnings. But maybe that something we'll hit in the next couple of weeks. [laughs] Yeah. Sure. We've seen, just reading through conference calls of many of these great companies, we're seeing again and again executives saying, all this innovation and all this adoption has just been pulled forward. So, it would be fun to summarize that. Alright, Brian, before we wrap up today's show, I wanted to take a quick listener question. And this one comes from Jack who wrote in. And folks, if you want us to hit one of your questions IndustryFocus@Fool.com or you can hit us on  @MFIndustryFocus. Jack says, \"I'm a massive fan of the Motley Fool  podcast.\" Thanks, Jack. Listens to it every single day. Oh! enjoys the Friday mailbag show and it sparked a question. We love doing mailbag shows, in particular, so write in for those. \"A little bit about me. I'm 20 years old. From Pittsburgh.\" And he goes on to mention that he's studying finance econ and will be interning in the industry. The question is, what is the optimal asset allocation for a 20-year-old. \" ... keep-up with the stock market and follow a lot of companies. I do not know what the best stock bond ETF index fund allocation would be for me right now. I have a good chunk of money to invest and I'm going to invest all-at-once here in the next couple of weeks. If there were any way for you to answer this question on an upcoming show, that would be amazing. Thanks for time.\"Love this. I think we need to give the caveat that we cannot give personalized financial advice, Brian. But when I hear 20-year-old, thinking about investing. That's someone who's already way ahead of the game. Yes. If you are thinking about investing and you are following companies at age 20, and you're asking about asset allocation, boy! are you lightyears ahead of where I was when I was 20. So, congratulations for you for even having the thought to ask that question. Yeah. And that means that you have a lot of time for compounding to work on your side and you have a lot of time to weather economic uncertainty. What we've seen over the last couple of months, we've seen some recovery, that's awesome, but that's the kind of thing that's a lot scarier to someone who is in their late-50s, early 60s and is nearing retirement, nearing the point where they're going to start drawing on that money that they've put away. It's a lot easier, if you're in your 20s to look at that and say, \"You know, this might not be money that I need for another five, 10 years.\" If it's money to buy a house or, you know, decades if it's retirement money.And so, for someone in this position, I think the key is, think a little bit about what you want that money to go toward. If it's money that you're saying, ah, like, 10 years from now, I might want to be able to buy a house or plan on having kids and I'd like to be able to have it grow a little bit and then put some of that into education funds. You put it somewhere different than you would saying this is retirement money.So, make that decision. And then, I'm a big fan of the indexes, especially, early on, if you don't have a lot of other money invested, certainly as a base. It's hard to go wrong putting your money into a broad-based index like the  or a total stock market index. You can put that there and then start to make small decisions with individual stocks. I will say, Brian, for me, it's a lot easier for someone that's younger to focus more on stocks and not worry as much about the bond, fixed income side of the market. Yes, that's exactly right. If you have decades ahead of you that you'll be working, it makes a lot more sense to have a much higher allocation to stocks. And again, we can't give individual advice, but one of the things that I recently did was, I sketched out my asset allocation strategy for the rest of my life, and I just did it as an exercise that got me thinking.Now, in this viewer's case, we don't know so much, we don't know, do you have any debt, are you going to be buying a house soon, are you going to be moving soon, do you have an emergency fund? We don't know any of that. So, you have to keep those things in mind, those things are important when you're talking about, should I invest, in general, or should I use my money for those kinds of things?But for myself, I have basically set it up so that I am going to be 90% to 99% stocks basically from now until I'm within \"10 years\" of retiring, and I put that in quotes because I have no idea what that even means, I can't ever see myself not working, but you know that's my plan as of right now. And once I'm within 10 years of needing the money, then I'm going to start to layer-in bonds and other fixed income things on top of that. And then once I get to a retirement date, my goal is to basically have 10 years' worth of expenses either in cash or bonds and everything else outside of that number still devoted to stocks. That's something that I'm comfortable with and that fits my situation, but this decision about your asset allocation, it's different for everybody depending on a huge number of factors, including your risk tolerance. But in general, the longer you have, the longer you can put money away for, the higher exposure you want to equities. Yeah. And one of the easy ways to get something that maps out that allocation switch over time is to look at some target date funds. These are things that will look roughly when you're thinking about retiring and then over time will say, \"Alright, we're looking at a retirement date of 2050, 2060, we're going to be more in stocks for this.\" And as you get closer and closer, say, year 2045, that fund is going to have a lot more bonds in it over time.What I will say of target day funds. I'm a fan, I own some target date funds. They tend to go into bonds a little bit earlier than I think Brian would have sketched out with his personal allocation. Just pulling up one now. The 2030 fund is about 30% bonds, that's it, that's a  target date fund. And even some of the ones that are further out, I think, probably have a higher chunk in bonds than most people realize. So, you got to look at the allocations and make sure that's something you are comfortable with. But those are an attractive option, if you want to be able to go a little bit more conservative as you get older and not have to manage it quite as much. Yeah. If you think that that is too conservative or too aggressive, you can always change the date by five years, right? So, if you want to be more aggressive, just pretend you're retiring five years later, and if you want to be more conservative, just pretend you're retiring five years sooner. So, in general, target date retirement funds that do all that asset allocation work for you, are a fantastic innovation. I think it's one of the places where it's OK to lie about your age, you know. [laughs] You can decide to push things out and be young at heart a little bit longer if that's what you want with a target date fund, Brian; you just gotta make sure you know what you're doing. That's right, I love that. Well, Brian, thanks so much for hopping on today's show talking Zoom with me.

To a momentum trader, ADSK stock is unstoppable after gaining more than 300% since the beginning of 2016.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\t\nThat\u2019s certainly a powerful multi-year move and it would be imprudent to short-sell ADSK stock. On the other hand, not choosing to bet against a stock doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you need to buy it at the current valuation.Cautious traders can choose to wait for a more favorable entry point.\u00a0Autodesk is a software company that\u2019s thrived during the pandemic because of the work-at-home trend.But with the ADSK stock price at all-time highs, a pullback is warranted and would actually present a compelling opportunity.The ADSK stock price tumbled in late February and early March with the rest of the stock market. This demonstrates that even a good company like Autodesk isn\u2019t immune to market-wide panics.However, the stock\u2019s recovery was so swift and sharp that you might call it parabolic. This occurred partly because businesses are reopening, which caused the markets to bounce back generally. The tech-focused  in particular experienced a fast move to the upside starting in April.And with many businesses forced to adopt a more digitized business model, software developer Autodesk was the right company at the right time. The demand for computer-aided design software, which Autodesk provides, wasn\u2019t materially negatively impacted.Moreover, the company had already developed its reputation as a leader in digital-design software for engineering, architecture and manufacturing. Much of the company\u2019s revenue is derived from license renewals. And, even during a pandemic, companies aren\u2019t usually willing to forgo the software that Autodesk provides.In addition, Autodesk was ready-made for the work-at-home culture as the company was already in the process of . As the pandemic forced team members to collaborate remotely, cloud-based tools became a staple and Autodesk was ahead of the curve in this regard.There\u2019s no denying that Autodesk had a strong first quarter this year. The numbers are telling a story of a company that\u2019s thriving.Quarterly earnings (adjusted for non-recurring items) , which beat the analyst consensus estimate of 81 cents per share. In the first quarter of the previous year, the per-share earnings were much lower at 45 cents.Autodesk exceeded adjusted earnings-per-share expectations consistently throughout the past four quarterly reports. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to expect more growth in this area during the next reported quarter. Analysts are indeed predicting this as they\u2019re anticipating adjusted earnings per share of 98 cents for the second quarter.The company also beat expectations when it came to first-quarter revenue, which totaled $885.70 million. This outpaced the analyst consensus estimate by 1.27%. It also indicated an improvement over the $735.50 million in revenue reported in the comparable quarter of the prior year.Going forward, investors must ask themselves whether this rate of improvement is sustainable for much longer. As mentioned, the analysts expect 98 cents in adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter. Autodesk is going to have to show a marked increase in profitability in order to meet this target.Also for the second quarter, analysts  for Autodesk. Again, the expectations are high for this company. No company can have outstanding quarterly results forever. Even great companies have to take a breather and disappoint the analysts from time to time.This is not to say that ADSK stock won\u2019t push higher. That\u2019s certainly a possibility and the current market environment is decidedly bullish.Still, the share price is lofty and with expectations higher than ever for Autodesk, traders should wait for a pullback before jumping in.David Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, Finom Group, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

Net revenue retention rate is also expected to fall in the 100% to 110% range (down from the previous 110% to 120% range). Many license renewals aren't increasing usage of software at the moment, as the pandemic is leading many design firms to tighten their belts. Nevertheless, growth is growth, and full-year guidance is a rarity these days amid the COVID-19 situation. Numbers for a single quarter -- even expectations for a full year -- don't make the stock a buy, but they do attest to two things working in Autodesk's favor. First, the company's design software is an integral part of the economy; and second, new billing features and tools make the software easier for users to stomach when things head south.Image source: Getty Images.Digital design software for architecture, engineering, and manufacturing is nothing new, and Autodesk's AutoCAD and related software have been around a long time. It's the established leader in these segments, and while many projects around the globe are getting put on hold, firms are still in need of these staple services. Thus, as much of its business is based on license renewals, Autodesk is doing just fine at the moment. Strategic areas of expansion like construction management and planning are helping make up the rest of the company's growth profile.\u00a0But while a business based on renewing relationships with existing customers may not sound particularly exciting, Autodesk has a strong pipeline built up in this department thanks to new feature releases in recent years. Migrating customers to  has been particularly prescient, since work-from-home is now so commonplace. And with the cloud comes the ability to work remotely as well as collaborate with team members, a tool that has become an absolute necessity in recent months.What also comes with cloud software access is a more stable method of billing. Autodesk continues to migrate to a subscription model versus an event-driven upgrade cycle model (think of the days when you had to pay a large sum up front for  Office versus the monthly subscription it has evolved into). That makes continual payment and license renewals easier for Autodesk's users to stomach, and it's helping the company land new deals in industries ranging from manufacturing (a large semiconductor company was cited as a new customer in the first quarter) to construction (a fast-growing contractor in the southeastern U.S. also signed on). \u00a0But what of valuation? Trading for 31.6 times free cash flow (revenue less cash operating and capital expenses) as of this writing, it's hardly a value stock. However, profits are growing at a faster rate than the top line, which means the future earnings potential for the stock outweighs trailing 12-month valuation metrics. Expected free cash flow of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion this year is flat compared to last year, but strong growth in the bottom line should resume once the company transitions out of coronavirus crisis mode and back to business as usual. Besides being a better way of paying for the average customer, the cloud and subscription model is what's responsible for Autodesk's revenue growth and surge in profit margin. This transition is far from over and should keep the company's mostly customer-renewal-focused business on a steady rise for the foreseeable future. Add in the increased necessity of remote work that the company can enable, and this gives it a leg up in marketing in its growth markets.

Plants have had to be shut down, key personnel have had difficulty getting to work, and supply chain disruptions have affected the sourcing of critical products. Simply put, there's even more emphasis now on ensuring the efficient running of a factory or a logistics operation. Here's how and why that's great news for industrial software companies.The shift toward digitizing factories was already in place entering into 2020, with leading industrial software vendors like  ,  , , and the software arm of    as 2020 began. Incidentally, the three pure software plays have all outperformed the S&P 500 this year, and are significantly ahead of the industrial sector that they sell into.\u00a0Data by Industrial companies are not very high-profile among investors, so it's easy to forget that manufacturing companies are set to be  (IoT).\u00a0For example, industrial companies can create \"\" of physical assets. Using web-enabled devices, engineers can monitor, simulate, and analyze the digital twin's data in order to make the physical asset work better. Meanwhile, augmented reality (AR) solutions allow operations to be run remotely, with equipment being analyzed and serviced even with the key technical expert not on premises.Moreover, product lifecycle management, or PLM, is the process of managing a product from design and engineering through to manufacturing and disposal. Put the jargon aside for a moment and consider how important it is for  (a client of Dassault Systemes) to design and manufacture planes on budget, or an engineering contractor to deliver a power station on time. That's something that's only going to become more important as the global economy gets more complex.The lessons learned from the pandemic are only likely to accelerate their deployment. As COVID-19 broke out in China initally, a raft of manufacturing companies saw their ability to source and/or manufacture critical products impaired by crisis in the first quarter.Of course, the problem got a whole lot worse when the pandemic spread overseas, and companies were forced to seek alternative sourcing and/or shift manufacturing activity elsewhere.Many of these issues would have been alleviated if production was more automated and managed remotely using digital technologies and.\u00a0There's also the issue of manufacturing companies looking to shift production/sourcing away from China in order to avoid tariffs and the potential for trade conflict with China in the future. It all points to a pressure building for companies to onshore production and/or shift production to the country of consumption. A possible example is  decision to .\u00a0There's an opportunity for automation and software companies to take advantage of any potential onshoring because they are an integral part of making factories cost-effective enough to justify manufacturing in higher-labor-cost countries.Here's how PTC Chief Executive Officer James Hepelmann put it on the recent\u00a0: \"We expect that the new normal that follows this crisis will create stronger tailwind to the already high-growth IoT and AR markets, and will make PLM more relevant than ever,\" and that the \"AR pipeline is off the charts.\"The coronavirus has taken its toll, with PTC now expecting full-year annual recurring revenue growth of 9%-12% compared to a previous estimate of 14%-16%, but double-digit revenue growth in an industrial recession is a sign of the long-term growth potential. Image source: Getty Images.It's a similar story at Dassault Systemes. Management now expects full-year revenue growth of 12%-13%, compared to a previous estimate of 21%-23%. Turning to Siemens, its management recently affirmed that its software revenue would outgrow end market growth of 8%. That's an impressive result considering the carnage done to the economy in the second quarter.Double-digit revenue growth in a trough year for the economy would be a good result for any industry, but the interesting thing is how the pandemic could spur faster adoption of IoT, AR, and PLM solutions during an ongoing economic recovery.As such, it's reasonable to argue that the long-term valuation of industrial software companies should be increased as a consequence. That's not a conclusion you can make about many companies right now. As such, investors should look closely at Dassault and PTC, as their long-term earnings prospects are improving.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in the press release or the slide presentation on our investor relations website.Now, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew. -- Thank you, Abhey. To open, I want to thank all of the medical professionals and other essential workers who are confronting the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the front lines. Their efforts are not only saving lives but allowing many other people around the world to protect themselves, their families, and their communities. Their efforts are truly heroic. Thank you for everything you do. Our thoughts are also with everyone affected by this pandemic, and our priorities remain the safety and well-being of our employees, and the continued support of our customers, partners and communities. Many of us, myself included, are adopting multiple roles as we seek to juggle the demands of our professional and family lives in a world that has suddenly become both more complex and more constrained.Personally, I've had to learn how to home school my youngest child and while I've always had a healthy respect for the work teachers do -- I have developed an even deeper appreciation for the role teachers play in our societies. It takes a lot of patience and skill to help a young mind learn what it needs to learn. From a business operations standpoint, the transition to working remotely has been smooth. I am proud of how our employees and partners have balanced their personal lives with many commitments during these unprecedented times. Many significant product upgrades were successfully released thanks to our cloud-based operating infrastructure. One of the metrics we have been tracking closely is the weekly active average users of our products and since the pandemic started usage of our products dipped slightly, but overall remained relatively steady.In China, usage dropped rapidly in February but rebounded above pre-COVID levels by end of March as businesses started reopening in the region. And it's no surprise we saw a major surge in usage of our cloud collaboration products as people worked from home and throughout the quarter. During the quarter and into May, renewal rates held relatively steady. Among our target markets, AEC revenue held up well while we experienced a slowdown in the Manufacturing space. The resiliency of our business is anchored by the diversity of our geographic regions and product offerings, our subscription business model and our indirect distribution model, which allows us to operate and adapt locally as economic conditions evolve in different geographic regions.During the quarter we helped our customers accelerate their migration to the cloud and ease their transition to working from home. We also offered extended payment terms to alleviate their liquidity concerns. Please refer to the slide deck on our investor relations website for more details on these actions. I am incredibly proud of not only the way our employees rallied to support each other and the company, but also how they rallied to support our customers, our partners, and the communities they live in. Without their resiliency, the resiliency of our business model wouldn't matter.With that, I'd like to turn it over to Scott now to take you through the details of our performance and guidance before I come back to provide insights into our strategic growth drivers. -- Thanks, Andrew. Before I offer more details on the first quarter, I want to echo Andrew's comments thanking our heroes battling the pandemic on the front lines. Our products, partnerships and expertise helped many frontline organizations combat the pandemic, from the quick build of hospitals to manufacturing personal protective equipment, or PPE, and the philanthropic support of global, national and local communities. My own daughter has just graduated with her nursing degree and will be on the frontline next month. Availability of proper PPE for her and all the other superheroes in scrubs has been my biggest concern, so I'm particularly proud Autodesk has played a role in addressing that need.Our Q1 performance was strong with total revenue growing by 20%, subscription plan revenue growing by 35%, and operating margin expanding by 10 percentage points. Total remaining performance obligations grew 27% and current remaining performance obligations grew 18% to $2.4 billion in the quarter. We delivered free cash flow of $307 million and continued to repurchase our shares to offset dilution. Typically, I would go through our results from the quarter in more detail but today I am going to focus on the COVID-19 impacts on our business and guidance. You can find additional details on our Q1 performance on our Investor Relations website. I do quickly want to mention that we have renamed what we previously called Core business to Design and what we previously called Cloud to Make. The prior labels caused some confusion, as almost all our products have cloud-enabled functionality. There is no change to the products that fit into each of these two categories.During the quarter, renewal rates held relatively steady whereas new business not surprisingly slowed down in the second half of Q1. However, the impact on our business has not been uniform by geography or industry. Our business is not only diverse from a geographic standpoint, but our products and customers are diverse as well. Many of you have asked about our exposure to small businesses. We generate approximately 10% to 15% of our revenues from small businesses, defined as customers with less than 20 employees and with less than 15 seats. Our net revenue retention rate was within the 110% to 120% range. One of the other metrics we track for customer stickiness is partial renewals, which is a measure of subscription renewals where some, but not all, seats in a contract are renewed. Our partial renewal rate remained relatively steady as well.In prior downturns, AutoCAD LT was a leading indicator for demand. However, during the current slowdown, our mix of AutoCAD LT moved higher as some customers apparently chose to optimize their purchases. Lastly, we saw a modest decrease in multi-year deals toward the end of the quarter although many customers continued to move forward with multi-year commitments even in the current environment. Given the evolving business environment as a result of COVID-19, we are actively managing our spending, reducing travel and entertainment expense, monitoring our hiring rate, shifting to virtual events across the board, and rationalizing our marketing spend. We will continue to invest in critical areas such as R&D, construction, and digitizing the company to ensure our future success as we come out of the pandemic. Now, let me turn to our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our investment in cloud products and a subscription business model, backed by a strong balance sheet, gives us a robust foundation to successfully navigate the economic challenges.Our full-year guidance range is wider than normal due to ongoing uncertainty in the economic environment that will have a more pronounced impact on our new business. Regarding trends during the year, we expect the second quarter new business activity to be the most impacted by the pandemic. Our pipeline entering the second quarter is strong and growing, but we're cautious about new business close rates. The upper end of our range assumes a swift recovery in new business in the third quarter and continued improvement into the fourth quarter, with full-year new unit volume growing modestly. At the low end of the range, we are modeling deeper impact on second quarter sales followed by a slower recovery in the third quarter and further improvement in the fourth, with full-year new units posting a modest year-over-year decline.On the other hand, the majority of our business is renewals and we have not experienced a meaningful change in our renewal rates, which offers us resilience in an uncertain environment. Still, we are modeling a decline in renewal rates in the second quarter out of an abundance of caution. Our low-end and high-end guidance scenarios differ in the extent of the drop in the second quarter and the pace of recovery later in the year. Given our strong renewal rates, we expect our net revenue retention rate to remain above 100% but move below the current range of 110% to 120% for the rest of the year. In addition to reduced new product demand, we anticipate our billings will be impacted by fewer multi-year transactions. The lower end of our billings guidance assumes a steeper decline in multi-year contracts whereas the upper end is based on a more modest decline. The reduction in billings and timing of large transactions are impacting our free cash flow expectations.Fiscal '21 will be a significantly more back-end loaded year, which will move some of the free cash flow from this year to next. We expect our full-year operating margin to expand by approximately 2 to 4 percentage points. Looking at the second quarter forecast, we expect the pandemic to meaningfully impact our billings, which can be sequentially down by low double-digit percent. Additionally, our decision to offer extended payment terms to our customers for sales up through early August, combined with a more back-end loaded quarter will impact our Q2 free cash flow, which could end up being breakeven to slightly negative before accelerating in the second half of the year. Although our fiscal year '21 results are being impacted by COVID-19, we are confident in our fiscal '23 free cash flow target of $2.4 billion, assuming the recovery starts by the end of this fiscal year. We've built a resilient business model that will allow us to capitalize on multiple tailwinds once we exit the current pandemic.And now, I'd like to turn it back to Andrew. -- Thank you, Scott. We expect all secular trends that we have been investing in for years to be accelerated during and beyond this pandemic. People are being forced to change the way they work and in turn are experiencing the benefits that our cloud and subscription solutions have to offer. These companies are not going to go back to how they worked before, and digitization will be accelerated as businesses take all steps necessary to ensure they are more resilient. Our investments over the last few years combined with our ongoing focus on cloud-based offerings leave us with a competitive advantage and well positioned to help our customers not only during this pandemic, but also in the new world that they will be working in when it is over.In fact, some of our biggest customers are already altering the mix of our products to lean more heavily into the cloud and digitization. Although AEC spending has held up well and work is continuing, some customers are seeing project delays, cancellations and in some cases job sites temporarily shut down. However, despite these realities, we have seen continued adoption of our construction offerings. For example, MEJA Construction, a general contractor in southeastern United States, selected our products over a competitive construction management solution at their time of renewal. Their business is growing rapidly and price was becoming a concern with their current vendor. They needed a comprehensive solution that was fast and easy to implement. The multi-year deal started with PlanGrid for the field, evolved to include BIM 360 for the office and field connectivity, and ultimately included BuildingConnected for project bidding.Many construction sites were shut down temporarily, impacting our new business for field focused solutions like PlanGrid. However, our products span the complete construction value chain and our collaboration products like BIM 360 Design and Docs experienced solid growth. Our Extended Access Program allows customers to try out and experience the value of the cloud collaboration products at no cost for a limited period of time. We are seeing customers who were in the process of adoption accelerate their timelines. We are also seeing customers purchase additional seats directly through our digital store. Since early March, cumulative new commercial projects grew over 200% in BIM 360 Design and over 100% in BIM 360 Docs. This surge in usage has been a great test for our cloud product infrastructure, which has scaled up seamlessly.As you might recall, BIM 360 Design is the cloud collaboration tool that allows our customers to use our design products anytime, anywhere with data stored in the cloud. Now that customers are experiencing cloud-based solutions that allow them to work efficiently from anywhere, we do not think they will revert to previous ways of working. One of our largest customers, AECOM, significantly increased their adoption of BIM 360 and reached out to us beforehand to ensure that we were set up to support the increased usage. AECOM is the world's premier infrastructure firm. David Felker, CIO, Americas and Construction, recently commented, \"We're shifting rapidly to remote working, which is absolutely essential for the continuity of our business. Our strategic partnership with Autodesk and the BIM 360 cloud platform along with substantial investments in digital solutions and technology have enabled our successful pivot to this new way of working. We forecast that our use of BIM 360 will continue to grow dramatically in the short term and will become our new baseline for projects in the long term.\"We are not only helping our customers work remotely, we are also doing so quickly. When New Zealand went into lockdown overnight, we helped Warren and Mahoney Architects successfully mobilize their entire business to work from home in five days. In the process they doubled their number of BIM 360 Design subscriptions. They told us they would not have been able to so successfully continue their business operations while working from home without our support, and they also noted that all projects will be delivered using our platform going forward. We believe the current pandemic will accelerate digitization and automation in the AEC industry as customers look to make their businesses more resilient. At the end of every downturn there is an upturn and businesses will need our products more than ever to stay competitive on the other side of this.One segment that has historically done well as governments seek to provide stimulus is infrastructure. During the quarter we announced an alliance with Aurigo to better serve public and private owners. Capital project owners at departments of transportation, cities, counties and enterprises will benefit from this alliance and we are already receiving positive feedback from customers. This quarter we had a top architecture firm, and a subsidiary of one of the largest state-owned enterprises in China, choose our products over Bentley's. Their typical projects for domestic and international clients include healthcare infrastructure, stadiums, airports and skyscrapers. Autodesk's streamlined workflows and data compatibility allow them to collaborate across teams and bring digital design down to the construction service phase. Beyond that, they have already taken advantage of our products for generating optimized design schemes and are excited to use Generative Design in Revit, as we recently announced Generative Design is available in Revit 2021.As our customers plan to return to work safely, they need help redesigning space layouts in buildings and this is one of the things Generative Design enables people to do effectively. Although Manufacturing has been impacted by supply chain disruptions and temporary factory shutdowns, our products are enabling customers to operate under evolving conditions. Customers use our solutions to develop new products and R&D continues even when production floors experience disruption. Automation and flexible supply chains will be vital to competitiveness in the future. Our products help customers work remotely in the distributed environment, and collaborate among their divisions, customers and supply chains in the cloud.Fusion 360 is the leading comprehensive multi-tenant cloud CAD, CAM and PLM solution, and continued to gain traction during this pandemic as customers are reassessing their technology portfolio's readiness to cope with the demands of distributed work. In fact, April was the fastest growing month for new user acquisition. A good example of this is that we closed a large stand-alone Fusion 360 deal with a big semiconductor company. Currently they use the electronics design capabilities in Fusion for their printed circuit board design work, and we expect to further expand our presence with them due to the integrated functionality offered by our products at a more attractive price point. In addition, BASF, the largest chemical producer in the world, increased their EBA users of Fusion 360 to 2,000 during the quarter.They look forward to using Fusion 360 as a collaboration platform to improve the efficiency of communication between several teams, starting with equipment design and maintenance at one of their chemical plants. Growth remains strong relative to our competition across our manufacturing portfolio. Customers of our on-premise solutions report minimal disruption in the move to remote work, which has been supported by cloud features included in our subscription offering. During the quarter, we signed our first enterprise business agreement with an automobile manufacturer in China. The usage-based model was a good fit for the customer who needs flexible access to our expansive portfolio of products. COVID-19 was a catalyst for them to substantially increase their engagement with us. They made the decision to adopt the most efficient solution to ensure they stay competitive in their industry on the other side of this downturn.In addition to growing our presence in the commercial space, we continue to maintain our leadership in the education space where future engineers are rapidly adopting our products. Our new user acquisition in the education space, driven by Fusion 360, went up over 70% in April. Moving onto another high-priority area for us, we are still making traction monetizing noncompliant users. In terms of sales-led initiatives, we are being sensitive to customer situations and are often deferring the final outreach. But this does not mean progress has stopped. The first deal we closed in Wuhan after the business reopened was a license compliance transaction that we had been working on for many months prior to the pandemic. We closed an additional license compliance deal and competitive win over Bentley in Central America and the customer is now piloting BIM 360 Docs.In closing, while all of us are impacted by the current pandemic, we are building a stronger Autodesk for the next year and beyond. We have a head start over our competition in critical capabilities like cloud computing and cloud-based collaboration, and we will continue to invest in our strategic initiatives. There are three key areas that make us confident in our fiscal '23 targets and our growth after that: One, Digitization in AEC is going to accelerate in the coming years as companies seek to adopt not only BIM, but complete design-to-make workflows enabled by the cloud that not only make current processes more resilient and efficient but support new industrial paradigms for the construction site. Two, the evolution of Manufacturing to a more distributed, networked, and cloud-based workflow is also going to accelerate significantly over the next few years.And we have the industry's leading multi-tenant, cloud-based solution to address the emerging customer needs that will come with this new paradigm. And three, finally, our business model is more robust, adaptable, and resilient than in the entire history of the company. This will allow us to not only invest aggressively in the future but do so with an eye to both revenue and margin growth. We look forward to virtually engaging with many of you at Investor Day, on June 3rd, where we will have more time to share our strategic initiatives.With that, operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open. -- Okay, great. Hey, thanks guys for taking my questions here and hope everyone's doing well. Andrew, maybe just to start with you, thanks for the commentary just by area. I want to look at it from a different lens and maybe see if you can talk about what you're seeing from your customers on engineering headcount and hiring? Now, clearly that situation is going to differ between manufacturing -- between your manufacturing customers and your AEC customers, but I'm wondering if you could give us some high level observations just about how your customers are approaching headcount during these times? -- Yes, Saket, I hope you're doing well as well. Look, there is -- what I'll do is I'll give you some indirect measures of what we're seeing. If our customers were engaging in a lot of headcount reductions what we would see is a tendency toward more partial renews in our base. We're not seeing that, all right, as we mentioned in the opening commentary. So we're not seeing this increase in partial renews which kind of talks to a stable employment base and a stable team environment. The other thing that we're, that we pay attention to is the whole notion of what's happening with weekly active users, OK? That's the real measure of economic activity happening on top of our applications.This is something we didn't have during the last downturn. We weren't able to monitor weekly active use of our desktop products. That weekly active usage, while it declined a little bit as we headed into this is definitely starting to stabilize. So that's another indicator that tells us look, people are hanging on to their R&D -- their R&D and early project development team members. We're well up in front of the process here on multiple factors so people need to keep the people working on the stuff that uses our products in order to effectively, meet the demand as they come out of this. So that's what we're seeing Saket. -- That's really helpful. Scott, maybe for my follow-up for you. You touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, and I'm wondering if you could just flesh it out a little bit more, can you just talk about what you saw in the quarter on those multi-year paid up subscriptions and just talk about how you're thinking about that in the fiscal '21 free cash flow guide? -- Yeah, thanks Saket, and I hope you and your family are safe too; it's such a such a bizarre time. Well, we did see -- so, multi-year continued to be relatively strong. It was an interesting quarter. The beginning of the quarter was quite strong. Across the board demand was strong, multi-year was strong. It was really a continuation of the strong Q4 and then right around mid-March, we saw things slow down. And it slowed not evenly, as we've talked about in the opening commentary. It slowed down a little bit by -- as countries were affected at a different rate. What we saw in multi-years, we did see it come down a bit in the second half of the quarter, but not substantially and you see that when you look at the total long-term deferred balance in relationship to the total deferred revenue balance.So, well, it did come down. A lot of our customers continued to see value in buying the multi-year. Our partners continued to see value in selling that and of course we get value because those are renewals that we don't have to chase that it frees up sales capacity, so the triumvirate of good for customers, good for partners, good for us continues. I do expect to see some headwind on multi-year transaction through the second half of the year and that's part of what is influencing the change in our guidance on billings and free cash flow as an expectation that multiyear will trend down through the year. Certainly in the second quarter with some recovery toward the second half of the year. -- That's very helpful. Thanks guys. -- Thanks, Saket.Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Hi guys. Thanks guys for taking my question and glad to hear that you are well and hope that same is true for your families and your team members. Question first for you Andrew, and then a follow-up for Scott. Andrew, you talked about, obviously the different phases of the construction lifecycle and different products you have there. When you're tied to your customers, how do you think about sort of reopening -- starting to sort of impact -- call it the architecture side, planning, construction, etc? And considering the fact, particularly on the AEC side we seem to have a backlog of projects coming end of the year, what are people saying to you in terms of restarting and where sort of that backlog is especially when you think kind of on a go-forward basis and one follow-up for Scott? -- Yeah, so the backlog comes in two forms. The first backlog is projects that were just put on hold and were about to go into the pipe. We hear a lot about that from our customers is that, look, a lot -- bunch of products were just put on hold until people know where they're at. Those projects are not going away. None of them are in any kind of category that would represent a pull back from the projects. So, yes, at the front end in the design and kind of engineering side, there is definitely this queue of projects that were put on hold. The interesting thing on the downstream side in the construction side, what you saw was -- in some municipalities people actually stopped construction. Now, those construction sites are coming back on right now and in some places construction never stopped, but they're not coming back on the same, all right? So what you're seeing is people are working with distancing -- listing requirements on the construction site.So there's fewer people on the construction site. And these people are working in more shifts. So what you're actually seeing is more pickup in the digital tools and in anticipation from our customers that they need more tools to digitally manage their sites as they stand up these construction sites. The same goes in Manufacturing. Manufacturing, their biggest problem is that their output side was shut down. Their new product development and all the things that are going on there, none of that was stopping. They just couldn't push the units out because of various restrictions on them. That's all starting to open up as well and that's what we're hearing from our customers. Frankly, the one segment of our customer base that still doesn't know what their fate is, is the people making films; TV and film, they're still struggling with when the sets are going to go back up. Games, obviously, they never saw a slowdown. But people in the film business are still waiting for when the production is going to restart. -- Hey, that was super helpful. And then Scott, just a follow-up for you; obviously, we came into the year with a significant number of active users that weren't on subscription or maintenance. I'm wondering if you can tell us just sort of the trend that you saw in Q1 relative to last year in terms of conversion of those to paying subscribers and just how you're thinking about this year? -- Yeah, it continues to be an enormous opportunity for us, Phil. And it's one that we'll continue to pursue out even beyond fiscal '23. What we have seen during the quarter is we talked about this in the fourth quarter call as well. We've gotten better at the data science in identifying those passing on higher quality leads. That's led to the productivity of those license compliance teams improving and as the productivity improves we're investing more headcount there. That trend continued into the first half of the quarter. I will tell you as the economy got more difficult and as many of our customers faced shut down and very difficult situations. What we did do toward the second half of the quarter is, while we continue to pursue those transactions, we're not forcing a final transaction, a final outcome of that in many cases. So that pipeline continues to build. We continue to work that and build that up and that's an opportunity that's still ahead of us in the second half of the year. -- Great, thanks guys and stay safe. -- You too Phil. -- Thank you, Phil.Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Thank you very much gentlemen for taking the question and glad to hear you and your families and the Autodesk employees are doing well. I just had two questions. First, Andrew, you mentioned the license compliance deal in Wuhan that you closed, but I also wanted to ask -- given your global reach, how are you seeing business trends in parts of Asia -- aside from that one where the economies have maybe been open for a little while longer? And any commentary, I guess the other would be any commentary on how the first month of this quarter overall is tracking versus the month of April? And then I just had a follow-up before -- had a follow-up one after that. -- Yeah. Okay, great. So Heather, let me give you a little context. I'll kind of answer your question a little broader than you asked just so that you can a full set of the context. Scott said, we kind of entered Q1 with a roar. We had like a week to celebrate our success from fiscal year '20. And then what happened is March hit, you saw China start to decline, you saw Korea follow suit. You saw a general decline in APAC, and then kind of Europe came online after that, started to decline, then the U.S. Here's what we saw, though, as things played out. China and Korea rebounded, right? Monthly -- weekly, monthly active usage in China is now above the pre-COVID highs in that country.Korea returned and became stable. Japan was surprisingly steady through the entire crisis, all right, both from a business perspective -- from a business collections and from the weekly active usage numbers that we are tracking. And now what we're seeing is kind of the same kind of cascade happening in Europe. We're starting to see Europe weekly active usage is going up. New business is starting to go up. And you're seeing -- we're seeing a kind of a stabilization in the U.S., not any upward trajectory yet, but it's all cascading like that. And we saw this in our weekly active usage numbers. We're seeing it in our new business numbers. And another thing that stayed constant and stayed relatively steady was renewal rates.Now, we always told you that we anticipated renewal rates would decline slightly during a downturn. What happened was that renewal rates actually declined less than we expected. So, they've been -- they've held up incredibly well through this downturn, and that was consistent across geographies at all times during the crisis. There hasn't been some kind of sudden dip in renewal rates and some wavering. It's actually stayed like at a fairly consistent rate. The one thing I want to make sure you understand during the whole entire thing, our Cloud products and our Make products did incredibly well. Like, for instance, in March, during the heat of all of this, Fusion added 50,000 monthly active users in the month, right, in the heat of all of this, all right? We already told you about what was going on in BIM 360 Design and BIM 360 Docs, those products all did very well even through the downturn. -- That's great. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up for Scott, and I know you mentioned this in response to someone's question, I think, about long-term deferreds. But you had talked about, at one point, most recently, those being maybe as much as 25% of the total deferred revenue balance. I'm just wondering is there a level that you would set us at for this year that you think might be more reasonable? -- No, I think that's the right range, Heather. I think it ends up in the mid-20s. It had been slightly higher than that. You remember on the fourth quarter -- actually, on the third quarter and the fourth quarter call, I think there was concern that multiyear paid upfront product subs was going to run too hot and was going to create a problem for free cash flow this year. In fact, we thought this was going to be a year of stability as opposed to a year of a pandemic. And I have our multiyear offer actually on my watchlist, because if I got the impression that it was running to an unstable level, so hot that we couldn't maintain that percent, I wanted to make changes to the offering to kind of tamp it down a bit. We haven't made any changes to the offer. At this point, I don't think we need to. It's the same, pay for three years upfront; get a 10% discount; that it's always been. We saw it in the second half of the year come down modestly. That's my expectation for the year and that will put long-term deferred in that mid-20% of total range. -- Okay, great. Thank you so much gentlemen. Stay safe. -- You too, Heather. -- Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Good evening, Andrew or Scott. I'll ask both questions at once. So first, Andrew, you noted a number of trends and requirements that are being accelerated by the current situation. What are the implications of that, if any, for your sales and distribution model? You've been doing a lot of hiring or planned hiring for direct sales coverage, named accounts, inside sales, the store and so forth, and of course, working with the channel. So maybe you could talk about any implications there? And then secondly, looking past this current valley affecting business, looking to your longer-term road map, you've spoken, of course, often at AU, and other occasions about your new platform Plasma.What are the milestones for that internally that you'd be able to communicate over the next number of years in terms of its progress? And overlaying that at the applications layer, are there any major brands such as Revit or Inventor or anything else that you think would be prudent to rebuild or rewire in some way to take advantage of the new platform, in terms of collaboration, data orchestration, perhaps multi-core and multi-threading and all those good things? So a sales question and a technology question. -- Okay. So let me start with the sales question. So as we've headed into this and looked at the year, as you've noticed, we've continued to invest. While we're not just going to spend as much as we originally anticipated this year, we're continuing to invest in R&D and things that we think are core to our future and infrastructure. There are some areas in go-to-market we did continue to invest in, like international expansion for our Construction Solutions and things related to supporting the Fusion business. But, you're right, we probably slowed down a little bit on inside sales efforts when your inside sales teams, you don't want to hire more inside sales teams when you're having trouble getting in touch with customers when they're working from home.So we slowed down some of those efforts, but there was no across-the-board slowdown in our go-to-market activity. In fact, what we did is, we prioritized those things that we thought were most important and invested there. And I think they all would make sense to you, in terms of what we're doing there. In terms of the longer-term growth, I think you're going to continue to see us invest in go-to-market internationally around our Construction and Cloud Solutions. I think you're going to see us continue to invest in data centers and servers in our international locations that service our customers with some of our cloud solutions, because those are going to be in demand, all right? Now, with regard to your second question, OK, we don't call it plasma anymore, by the way. It's a different name, which you'll get some view of later, probably around AU timeframe.So I'm going to be careful about what I talk about there. But look, first off, I want to make sure you understand. There's a lot in our cloud, all right, a lot in our cloud platform, a lot that has been exposed, a lot that hasn't yet been exposed. Some of those things you're talking about allowing multidisciplinary collaboration, simultaneous access to a common model that updates based on different disciplines, but maintains control with, say, the architects or the engineers, you're going to hear a lot more about that in the coming months and probably around Autodesk University. So I'm not going to steal the thunder from that. What I will say at this point is, we've got a lot going on, and we're big believers in the app model.And what I mean by that is we believe that relatively modestly sized to thick clients with a really robust cloud backend are the future. And we got there in a very informed way. So, for instance, Fusion has a thick client. But it has a very, very, very fine-grained multi-tenant cloud data infrastructure hidden behind it. Fusion's cloud will get thinner -- client will get thinner over time. You could also see an evolution with Revit that's similar to that. That's going to take a little longer. And we made that choice very deliberately, Jay, because we've had lots of experience in pure browser-based applications. For instance, you might be aware that Tinkercad has 25 million users. Right now, in any given day, 11,000 people use Tinkercad. It's the K-12 de facto standard for 3D modeling out there.It's called Tinkercad, but it's actually an amazing tool. It is a multi-tenant browser-based solution, as is AutoCAD web, which has 50,000 monthly active users a month, all right, which does edits and creation of drawings as well as collaboration on drawings. Both of those solutions taught us that thicker clients are better, all right? Not totally thick clients, way thinner than our current desktop clients, way thinner, but like an app model. We learned this early on from our long years of experience with these pure browser-based tools. So that's why you see us doing that with Fusion. You'll see us do something similar in the AEC space over time. And it's winning because it helps get people to the cloud, but it has that same robust multi-tenant cloud database structure sitting underneath it. -- Thank you. I'm glad you're well. -- You too, Jay. -- Thanks, Jay.Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I'm glad you guys are well. There's always a lot of questions on construction and all the improvements you made on a product perspective there, but want to talk a little bit more about the momentum in manufacturing. We do hear really good things about Fusion 360. And I know, Andrew, you called it out on a call being a real disruptive offering. Where are we in the momentum of that business? And relative to the investments that we've made in construction, are there many more that still need to happen in this particular part of your business? -- In the Manufacturing part or the construction part? I want to make sure I'm answering the question. -- Yeah, the Manufacturing side. -- Okay, good. Because -- all right. So I'm glad you asked the question. Like I said, we're definitely seeing building momentum in that space. There's no doubt about it. Fusion is on fire. I said in March, it added 50,000 monthly active users. There's over 600,000 monthly active users on the application today, all right? It's in the very early stages of a revenue generation activity. I am going to save the total commercial subscriber base as a reveal for the Investor Day coming up. Suffice it to say, it's large, all right, and significant. In education, it's by far the leader. And by the way, it has a connectivity flow with Tinkercad.So we've got K-12 locked up with Tinkercad and Fusion's rapidly taking over post-secondary education and becoming more and more of a force in that space. I think you're going to see a lot of exciting things with Fusion over the next year, especially as we start to reveal the data layers that are hiding underneath the thick client that we use for the application. So I want to hold off a little bit until Investor Day. But I will tell you, in any given day, 60,000 people are using Fusion to solve real-world problems today. So I think it's an exciting application. It has really significant potential for the future. We are way ahead of our competition, not only in functionality, but in raw cloud power. -- So it's a bit of a teaser to get you into the Investor Day next week, Matt. -- Yeah, we're looking forward to that. And then maybe a quick call for Scott, I know renewals were stable this quarter, which is great to hear. I wanted to ask about the [Technical Issues]. -- Hey, Matt your -- Matt, your voice is breaking up pretty badly. You started off fine and then I was losing a bit of the question there. -- Sorry about that. The joys of working from home. Yeah, I guess, the question is how are VSB customers doing today? And when you look at your '21 guidance, you talked about some expectations on renewal. But what are expectations for VSB renewals in your fiscal '21 guide? -- Yeah, that's a great question because I think there's an expectation that, that segment, which we call VSB, Very Small Business but to generalize that, think of that as a single site with 20 employees or less and 15 seats or less. And that segment for us typically drives somewhere between 10% and 15% of our sales. We're not seeing a difference in the renewal rate in that segment versus the segment right above that, up through enterprise. It's a bit surprising, frankly. I would have expected that we would have seen a bigger impact there, but we're not seeing that at this point. But bear in mind, as you could imagine we're running multiple scenarios constantly on the back end. And one of the things that I've had built into those scenarios is an expectation that we do see renewal rates move from where they are down modestly during the second quarter. And then the difference between the high end and the low end of our guidance range is sort of the rate of recovery of those. But just to be cautious, even though we're not seeing it yet, I am modeling that into the guide. -- Thanks a lot. -- Thanks Matt.Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. -- Hi gentlemen, thanks for taking my question. I'll just ask two quick ones. I'll put them both out there. First one is, are you guys -- what are you seeing in terms of horizontal construction? Is there any positive impact? Or do you expect any tailwinds from the stimulus -- we'll call it, the stimulus spending. It's really the anti-recession spending the government is doing. So that's question number one. Question number two, can you give us any color around your assumptions behind new business, kind of looking back at my Autodesk model from the '09 period, your licenses, if I recall correctly, were down like mid 30%. It was pretty steep. And I'm wondering how relative to low and high-end of your guidance range, just maybe any color on assumptions you're making? Thanks very much guys. -- Okay, great. All right, so I'll start off and take the horizontal construction question. So we've been anticipating stimulus with regard to infrastructure for some time now and we've been investing in our core products for that, in particular, in road and rail. What you saw us recently do was engage in a partnership and an investment with Aurigo, and I mentioned that in the opening commentary. Aurigo is really, really strong in the early capital planning part of these types of projects, whereas we're really strong in the Design and Make parts. There's a overlap between our solutions, but they're very, very complementary. Between the functionality we've been building in our design portfolio and this partnership, it's designed to bring the departments of transportation forward in terms of their solution stacks for these various types of infrastructure engagements.Right now, they're basically on really old stacks and fairly old technology; Aurigo is a born in the cloud company, most of our stack is rapidly moving to the cloud. Obviously, the construction stack is entirely in the cloud. So we've been preparing for tailwinds around infrastructure for quite some time. We believe we're ready. We believe these partnerships we put in place are absolutely the right kind of thing. We're already seeing some returns from those partnerships in terms of engagements with various departments of transportation. So yes, we do anticipate a tailwind coming from stimulus related to infrastructure, and we've been preparing for it. -- And to the second question you had, Steve, I'll point you to -- I'll tell you what our expectations are, but I'll also point you to the slide deck that we posted on the website at the same time. I know it's a busy night, and there are other companies reporting at the same time. We actually moved to today to try and avoid a lot of other company traffic to try to lighten the load on you guys a bit. So there's a slide there, but I'll tell you what our expectations are. At the low end of the guidance range, we expect -- well, in both cases, we expect our new business to be most impacted in the second quarter. And then the divergence between the low end and the high end is the depth of the impact in the second quarter on new business and the rate of recovery, such that in the low end of the range we expect for the full year, we expect a slower recovery from the bottom in Q2, such that for the full year, there is a slight decline in new volume for the year.At the high end, a slightly less of an impact in Q2, a swifter recovery, such that for the full year, new unit volume actually grows modestly. And that's informed by what we're seeing as markets have reopened by monitoring, as Andrew said, what the weekly active usage rate looks like in each of our core markets and really getting an understanding of the usage of our products by our customers. Things like our partial renewal rate staying strong, says -- if I had 10 that came up for renewal and I renewed all 10, that means that I don't have a reduction in workforce. So I think the strength of the renewal base, plus the -- our expectation on what new volume looks like is what differentiates the low end from the high end. -- One more point, we're not seeing close to the levels of declines in new business we saw during the Great Financial Crisis OK, just to make sure you're clear on that. -- Got it. Cool. Thanks a lot, guys.Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. I know that some of the hardest hit industries like transportation are not maybe viewed as heavy design users, but any sense of your exposure to transportation, hospitality, hotels, etc, in that group? -- Yeah. Those segments tend to be users of things like LTE versus facilities planning and facilities layout. So they're -- while they're big companies, they generally tend to be down-market users of our applications. It's a facilities usage play for us. So we don't have a lot of exposure to the main line of our business from those very hard hit industries in hospitality, transportation and in food services. -- That's fair enough. And then one other question. Any thoughts in terms of what you think the impact from a number of companies I've already talked about, post COVID-19, maybe not bringing all the workers back and maybe we'll just see a change in the commercial real estate landscape permanently. Any thoughts in terms of how that might impact your business moving forward? -- Yeah. It's careful to kind of think about that question in an important way. First off, commercial business building, the commercial buildings and commercial office space, not a huge part of our business. However, I mean, we're living this -- I saw this personally, so I can speak to this with some knowledge about how this is working. There's a couple of trends I think you need to be aware of. One, when people move to more work-from-home type environments, and we will probably have that on the other side as well, they're actually going to have less dense office space. So, for instance, the current requirements in terms of us getting back in our offices are going to require us to significantly de-densify some of our office space.So, people are not -- in the short-term, certainly, not going to require less office space, they're just going to have fewer people in it, spread out more widely over the next 12 to 18 months, OK? So, we have to be very clear on that, people will be coming into offices that are much less dense. That's where we're going. It's where a lot of our customers are going, and they're going to need to reconfigure those office spaces in unique ways. And we're helping them to do that with some of the general design tools. But on a bigger standpoint, OK, there's still going to be population growth. We're still going to have workers.There's still going to be a population that needs to come into an office, but how these offices are distributed and where they are may change. We've always been talking about a trend around urbanization, but we might be future talking about urbanization and suburbanization, where you're seeing this kind of spreading out away from dense urban centers into suburban centers that also have office space and high-rise living spaces. And then they're connected by infrastructure that requires them to have a hub-and-spoke kind of flow. So, there's a lot of ways that this plays out in the future, but in our projections and our view on this, people are going to be building more, not less. Where they build it may change. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Hi, this is Hamza in for Keith. Most of my questions have been answered, but just a couple of quick ones. For you, Scott, you mentioned -- so the low end of the guidance is implying that new unit volume sees a slight decline. Is there any instance where we could see maybe overall subscription growth -- subscriptions actually decline year-on-year or is that just basically net new sub adds? -- Yeah, with the strength of our renewal rate, Hamza -- and at least I got your name right this time. With the strength of our overall renewal rate and the size of our renewal base, no, I don't see overall subs coming down. I think the new unit volume could see some pressure, and we're seeing that in the second half of Q1, but I don't see the aggregate coming down, no. -- Got it. And on the renewal rate, you mentioned it's been pretty stable. Any color you can give us as to how that has sort of trended versus sort of the historical range, I think sort of like mid to high 80%. -- Yes, it's stayed in the same range. It really stayed steady, Hamza, throughout the quarter. Even as the new business slowed down -- I talked about the difference between the first half of Q1 and the second half of Q1. Even as the new business slowed down during that timeframe, the renewal rates stayed pretty steady and stayed pretty steady across the board. -- Okay. Thank you very much. -- Welcome.Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys and thanks for taking the question. I'm glad to hear everyone's safe. Just a quick one on M&A philosophy. So, in the past, we've talked about large M&A being done on -- for the most part, on the AEC side and potential focus shifting to manufacturing. Just given the current potential market dislocations, would love to hear your latest thoughts. And I have a follow-up. -- Yeah, so, specifically, I've talked about large M&A being done in the construction side, all right? I was very specific that we felt like we got the biggest pieces that we needed on the construction side. Certainly, we are going to continue to look at all our markets. With the shakeup that will likely be accelerated over the next five years in manufacturing, with supply -- people rethinking their supply chains and numerous things associated with that, I think, our focus on manufacturing will likely continue. But don't think that we won't look opportunistically at opportunities in AEC as well. The next 12 months could present themselves with all sorts of opportunities for organic and inorganic growth activity. Fortunately, we've got a good strong balance sheet. We've got a nice recurring revenue model. We're in a good position this year to act on something that we think could be appropriate for us. So we don't see anything immediately in our future. -- Got it. Got it. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, multiuser licensing, I know that got pushed back till August. Just curious how conversations are going with customers, and any feedback or color there would be great. Thanks so much. -- I got to tell you a story. I'm not going to use specifics. It just came in before -- while we're preparing for today. There was a customer that was desperate to get rid of their multiuser licenses and move to single-user licenses, because they need a two-factor after a malware attack. So we've had people, customers coming to us now realizing that named users are not a bad thing, all right? As a matter of fact, when you're trying to move from working in an office to distributing your workers all over the place, it's really nice that you can just download the software, log on and it works. And they saw us responding much faster to their work-from-home needs.So initially, before this crisis, we were getting a lot of noise about multiuser. A lot of that has started to die down. And in some cases, people are starting to realize that multiuser was not the panacea they thought it was for the problems they were having. And, in fact, it exposed them to other things. So I don't know if that will continue. Times could change, as we head out of this. But, right now, it's been an excellent opportunity for people to understand and for us to have a discussion about what does named user really gets you and what are the benefits. And we're seeing some of that right now. So it's still early days. We've only done a few multiuser conversions at this point but there's some very interesting conversations around this. -- Great. Thanks, again. -- You're welcome. -- Thanks Adam. -- Thanks Adam. Stay safe.Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thanks so much for fitting me in. And I'll echo all the well wishes all around. My question for you guys. It's good to see the strong usage of BIM 360 Design and Docs. How much of this is temporary, given everyone working from home? And how much of it do you see as sustainable longer term? I mean, given the extended free trial, how are you thinking about paid conversion? -- Yes. So we didn't do the extended -- the only access program to drive paid conversion, as you know, we did it to help people work from home. However, our customers are being pretty definitive with us that their -- most of them are not going to go back to their old way of working. Remember, once they started up a project in these environments and found that the fluidity of what they can do and how they can work remotely, they're very unlikely to pull the project out of the system unless they feel like, I didn't really need any of that. We don't foresee that happening. In fact, one of the things I said in the opening commentary is that, AECOM was very explicit with us that we are moving to a more distributed model with these things. We're going to be increasing our usage. Are you ready Autodesk? And we told them, of course, definitively that we were. So, while some customers may revert back to their old way of working, we expect a significant number of them to come out of this changed. It's exposed them to something they really weren't aware that they could do previously. -- Thanks, Andrew. And maybe just some follow-up regarding the strength in retention relative to expectations. How much is due to a tight labor supply, forcing firms to hold on to talent and Autodesk subscriptions in anticipation of an economic recovery? -- Yeah. It's really hard to say, Brad, what the drivers are, if it's a -- I'm going to hang on to people even though I don't have them put to use. I don't think that's the case. I think more and more -- if you think about where our products are largely used in the process, it's less on -- at least today on the job site and on the manufacturing floor and more upstream in the design process. And that's had a lot less impact from the shutdown and the shelter-in-place that's taken place in the wake of the coronavirus. So I don't -- we're not sensing a significant change in headcount and we look at weekly active users. We look at, I think, one of the most compelling statistics is that partial renews -- I had 10 seats, I only renewed nine, has held steady as well. And so I'm not -- we're not picking up that there's a change in the workforce or changing the work that needs to be done underneath the products. -- Great. Thank you so much. -- The only thing -- remember, weekly active usage is starting to trend up in some of the places that were first hit by the pandemic. So we're seeing kind of the opposite where people are actually starting to use more as they come to their side of this. -- Thank you. -- Thanks for the question, Brad.Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys. Thank you for fitting me in and it's nice to hear from everyone. One quick one for Scott. As we think about the different ranges for the guidance, it looks like on the spend side, its coming down to about mid to high single-digit spend growth. How do you think about the low to mid -- high end of the guide for toggling maybe some of the spend you might do? -- The spend -- so first of all, Jason, I hope you're keeping well as well. It's such a strange time. The areas of investment don't vary between the low end and the high end of our range. We'll continue to invest in R&D, given the lead that we've got and the fact that as our customers are being forced to digitize more quickly as a result of the distributed workforce plays right to our strong suit, it plays right into some of the longer-term R&D investments we've been making over the last four or five years. So now is not the time to take the foot off the gas on R&D investments. We're also going to continue to invest in construction. I think that's proven to be a market that is dramatically underpenetrated by technology. And so there will be secular growth in that space. We'll continue to invest there.And we'll continue to invest in digitizing our own company to provide some of the value-add that we can provide to your customers. There's no change in the core focus areas. We are continuing to be diligent about spend management, as you'd expect, and there are savings. You can back into the savings that are built into our spend stream based on the range of our guidance and get a sense, there's obviously P&E spending that's going away. And by the way, I don't think it ever returns to the levels it had been historically. If the last three months have shown us anything, it's that you don't have to be sitting across the table face-to-face with someone to conduct business, whether it's a sales transaction or a brainstorming session.So I don't expect that to fully come back. We've gotten some savings through rationalization of our marketing spend. We've moved many of our events to online. I think many of those will stay online. So there's -- there are some savings built into that and I think many of those will continue longer term. But the core areas that we're investing in, we're going to continue to invest in. And we're in a privileged position. So even with the level of disruption that is happening in the marketplace to be able to show double-digit revenue growth and market expansion two to four points through the low end and the high end of our guidance. So I feel good about the position that we're in. -- Yeah, that's factoring, that we are growing revenue and margin at the same time puts us in a fairly elite category. Given the acceleration of digitization we expect on the other side of this, this is the time you want us to be investing in R&D and the infrastructure that supports getting that R&D to the customers. And that's what we're going to do. -- Okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate the color and thanks again. -- Thanks for the question, Jason.Thank you. Our next question comes from Zane Chrane with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys, thanks for fitting the new bearing and showing us some love. Really appreciate it. I was impressed with the renewal rate, the net dollar renewal rate staying at 110% to 120% range. So I was wondering regarding the partial renewals holding steady, do you have any idea of what portion of your customer base is maybe benefiting from the PPP loans? I'm wondering if churn could maybe tick up once the deadline for the employee retention passes and you have a little bit more layoffs from those customers with the PPP loans at some point in the future? And then secondly, you had pretty impressive bookings, especially when looking at current RPOs, I'm just trying to reconcile that with the roughly flat billings growth for the full year. So I'm wondering if you can give me a sense of what the average time deals tend to be in the pipeline before closing? And if you do have a weakening in the pipeline or the entry point of the pipeline, how many quarters does that take to show up, is it two, three, four quarters or is there any way to know that? Thank you. -- All right. That's a lot to cover there, Zane. I'll take the first one, and I'll let Andrew handle the pipeline sales cycle question. On the first one, of course, there's no way for us to know, but I think that you look at the benefit of that program, it was targeting smaller businesses. And those -- one of the stats that we gave earlier is small businesses and I'll define that as single-site, 20 employees or less and 15 seats or less, that small business segment has typically driven 10% to 15% of our total sales. So it's a smaller piece of our overall revenue stream. It's hard to know how many of them have benefited from kind of the short-term loan programs that have been rolled out.I don't know whether you call them stimulus or as Steve said earlier, avoidance of recession. What we do monitor though and Andrew talked about this earlier is, the active users -- the weekly active users of our product. And of course, we saw a dip across the globe, countries went into various phase of shelter in place, but then we're also seeing that come back, and I think that's also a strong sign of what we're not seeing as significant layoffs all across the board, also renewals staying steady is another sign of that. So it's hard to know to -- it's hard to give you a direct answer, but certainly the indicators we'll say, there's an issue there or not, we're not seeing that. -- Okay, got it. -- So with regards to the pipeline question, all right, in terms of how things are going, all right, on general pipeline, so from a cascading, what we've seen in terms of new business is Asia is already starting to turn up, all right. So we're already seeing the pipeline grow in APAC. We're starting to see signs of that in Europe. We haven't yet seen signs of it in the U.S. but given the cadence that we've seen around the pipeline from each region and by a country-by-country basis, watching not only the new business trends, but the weekly active user trends, which, by the way, presages the pipeline, we see building pipeline strength as you get further and further away from the start of the pandemic, which I think is a pretty positive sign for our business in terms of where we think we're going. And it's why we feel the way we do about the potential for the year. -- Yeah, I think the other bit of color that I'd add there is when you look at the change in our billings guide multiyear clearly is having an effect on that. We've seen it slow a bit in the second half of the first quarter. And what I've built into the scenarios that we've modeled out is that it continues to stay low or to modestly come down, a couple of points from where it had been throughout the year. And that does create a headwind on the billings guide. -- Got it. That's very helpful. Well, wishing you guys have a strong and rapid recovery. Thanks very much. -- Thank you.Thank you. We are now at the end of the time for the call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Abhey Lamba for closing remarks. -- Yes. Thanks, Joelle, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day next week on June 3rd. In the meantime, please reach out if you have any questions. Thanks for joining us today. -- Thank you.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Households that qualify might receive as much as\u00a0$1,200 per adult and $500 per qualifying child.If you're able to invest that money in  instead of spending it, ,  , and   should be at the top of your shopping list. Here's why.Image source: Getty Images.Alteryx is a software-as-a-service company that sells self-service data analytics tools. The company makes it easy for almost anyone to analyze large sets of data in order to make actional decisions.Alteryx has been identified by third parties like  as the market leader, which is helping it attract customers. Last quarter, Alteryx's customer base grew 30% to 6,087. Even better, its dollar-based net expansion rate -- which measures the same customer spending from period to period -- jumped 130%. The combination enabled revenue to grow 65%, gross margin to expand, and net income to surge 65%.Management doesn't think that the growth rate is going to slow down anytime soon. Management believes that revenue will jump at least 33% in 2020, although it's worth noting that the guidance was issued in February before the COVID-19 pandemic kicked into high gear.While Alteryx's stock can't be called cheap -- shares trade for 18 times sales and 152 times forward earnings -- the stock is actually down 25% from its recent high. Believe it or not, I think this company is so\u00a0high-quality and can  that the stock is actually in bargain territory today.Etsy, which is a leading online marketplace for handcrafted goods, continues to prove that  isn't the only company that is riding the e-commerce boom.Last quarter, Etsy's\u00a0active buyers grew 16% and active sellers grew 20%. Gross merchandise sales -- which measures total spending on its platform -- expanded 33% to $1.65 billion. The surging popularity enabled revenue to grow 35% to $270 million. While net income actually declined 24% to $31.3 million, the step backward was entirely self-inflicted (management is ramping up marketing costs to drive growth).\u00a0In the year ahead,\u00a0management forecasted that the top line would grow at least 27%. I think that there's reason to believe the company is sandbagging. After all, tens of millions of consumers are trapped in their homes right now due to shelter at home orders. That might be a strong catalyst that convinces buyers to give the site a try for the right time and convinces others to finally start their own Etsy business.Meanwhile, Etsy's stock is down more than 17% from its recent high and currently trades for less than nine times sales and about 37 times free cash flow. That's not dirt cheap, but I think it's an attractive price for a company that should be able to grow at a\u00a0 for many years.If you're an engineer, architect, designer, or construction professional, then the odds are good you depend on\u00a0Autodesk . Autodesk sells a suite of computer-aided design (CAD) software products that allows creators to produce 3D models of whatever they can dream up.Autodesk went through the painful transition to a\u00a0\u00a0(SaaS) business model a few years ago, which cost the company revenue and profits in the short term but sets it up for long-term success. What's exciting is that the company is still in the middle of converting its massive user base to the new model. At last count, more than\u00a018 million people use Autodesk's products, but . That gives the company a huge untapped pool of subscribers that it can gradually convince to upgrade.Market-watchers expect that Autodesk will be able to grow its bottom-line in excess of 80% over the next five years, which is a remarkably fast growth rate for a company that only trades for 37 times forward earnings. Shares are also still down more than 18% from their recent high. I think that's far too good of a deal to pass up.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With relatively common software, anyone could build a 3D printed model, opening up seemingly endless applications for everyone from hobbyists and educators to high-end manufacturers.\u00a0But the 3D printing market didn't turn out to be very lucrative for 3D printing companies themselves. Losses have mounted and stocks have been crushed, including that of\u00a0 , which is one of the industry leaders. So is now the time to scoop up the stock, or has this contender fallen short?\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.You can see the financial struggles 3D Systems has had below. Revenue is . There are a number of reasons for this, but the two big drivers are the lack of scale for 3D printing overall, and trouble the company has had turning its materials business into a high-margin recurring revenue business,  razors (low margin) and blades (high margin).\u00a0 data by In 2019, which doesn't include any impact from COVID-19, the company reported a 5.4% decline in services revenue, which should be where the company is growing most as it tries to sell more services rather than just printers to customers. Healthcare solutions, on-demand services, and software sales all fell in 2019, which aren't good signs.\u00a0It's possible these trends could change, but right now I think 3D printers, materials, and services are largely considered commodities. Sure, there are some high-end, high-value printing applications, but they're few and far between, and won't drive the scale 3D Systems needs long-term.\u00a0To understand why I think 3D printing companies will struggle long-term, I think we need to look at the process of printing a 3D part. The first step is to build a model, likely using computer-aided design (CAD) software that's made by a company like  . From there, you can print on any number of 3D printers using name-brand materials, or some generic materials will work as well.You can see the problem here: The value and scale really lie in the CAD software. That's where customers can be locked in by a system, and entire industries end up getting built around one company, like architecture is with Autodesk. Any 3D printer will work with almost any CAD file, making it a commodity part of the value stack. And with material going generic as well, there's little opportunity to build vertical integration on the manufacturing side.\u00a0I don't think 3D Systems  today. But if you're interested in the industry, the better play is Autodesk. That's the company that makes the critical software for the industry, and has both scale and consumer lock-in for many of its markets. That's better than being in the commodity 3D printing business, which looks like it's where 3D Systems finds itself.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And with the help of Motley Fool analyst, Jason Moser, we're going to answer all your questions about the current market, what's in JMos bucket, all that kind of good stuff, all that and more on this week's episode of .Well, before we get to the mailbag, why don't we chat a little bit about the week and then I can get your thoughts, does that sound good, Jason and Bro? Sounds like a plan. Alright. Well, the big news this morning, and by the way this morning is Friday, is that the U.S. has surpassed China in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases. I think we are at about 85,000; does that sound about right. We're into 90,000s now. Oh, wow! Okay, so that's my research from this morning, so things are ticking up pretty fast.  estimates that at least a 160 million people nationwide have been ordered to stay home. And when it comes to the stock market, well, it kept ticking up this last week, pinned on the hopes of the stimulus bill. Then news came on Thursday that 3.3 million people had filed for jobless claims, which is roughly about a bajillion percent more than the previous worst week ever of about 695,000 claims. That was back in 1982.So, again, now it's Friday. And I believe the stimulus bill is still plugging along, is that right, Bro? Yes, the House has passed it and the President will sign it. So, by the time you are listening to this episode, it will be law. Alright. And at this exact moment on a Friday, a random Friday afternoon, the market is down about 2%. Is that right, JMo? Yeah, I think 2.3% last we looked. In other news. I'm on day four of my sourdough starter, and it seems to be bubbling along nicely, so there's that. The bad news is that everyone is baking now and you can't buy flour to save your life. So, how are you guys doing, how are you feeling? There's going to be a shortage of eggs too soon. Eggs, why eggs? The same thing, people are baking so much. Oh, and then we're all going to get so chubby. See, I guess I'm lucky, I just don't have that itch to bake. I just don't know, it's not my thing, and so therefore I'm not stuck in the kitchen, eating a bunch of baked goods. So, that's the hot market take from JMo. Stay out of the kitchen. You want to stay fit, just stop baking. Yeah, there you go. So, yeah, Jason, how are you feeling after this week; as an investor, not as a consumer of baked goods? [laughs] I mean as an investor, you know, I'm feeling pretty good about things. I posted a note to our members and the services that I run, the  service and the , and the note was based on this stimulus package that Congress has been debating and now has passed. And I think, I mean, there's always going to be political bickering when it comes to things like this, it's too much money, it's not enough money, to put things in context this $2 trillion package; you know 2019 GDP domestically here was $21.5 trillion, just to give you an idea of how those numbers match up.So, frankly I think that number, that $2 trillion number, is going to go up in time, because I think this is probably a little more of a protracted battle then maybe some think it might be. There's not really a clear finish line. I think we got to get used to the fact that we're going to be dealing with COVID-19 in some way, shape or form in our lives for a while here. So, the health and the economic impacts will be significant and I think they'll last for a while.With that said, it is encouraging to see our government come forward in a bipartisan fashion to get aid to the folks that need it most, to the businesses that need it most. And hopefully, I mean the devil's in the details, hopefully this all does get into the right hands, and I'm sure some of it won't, and we can learn from that and hopefully do better next time. But as an investor, I'm very encouraged that we've seen our representatives in DC finally get together and make something happen. Yeah. Bro, I don't know about you, but when I saw those jobless claims numbers, I was literally speechless. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised, but wow, that was insane. What do you think? Yeah, no, it's incredible, and it's most definitely going to get worse. James Bullard, who's the President of the St. Louis Fed, told  and he said, unemployment could hit 30% over the next couple of months, which reached 10% during the Great Recession and 25% during the Great Depression. So, it'd give you an idea, that's the highest unemployment rate we would have seen perhaps in our nation's history, certainly over the last century. So, it's significant. So, when I see those numbers, I just have huge sympathy and empathy for all of those people, all those businesses that who knows if they'll be able to reopen once we solve this virus problem. So, that's the way I feel.I would certainly encourage everyone to dig into the details of this aid package, because there is a lot of aid for people, there's increased unemployment benefits, a lot of ways to defer payments. People don't have to pay their student loans now, at least, their Federal student loans for a few months. So, there are a lot of ways that the government, as well as bigger corporations are trying to help people. So, if you are in a financial pinch, definitely look at what resources are available to you. Alright. Well, should we head on to the mailbag now? Why not?! Let's do it. Alright. So, let's head to the first question, it comes from Jerry. \"To the Gardner brothers and The Motley Fool analysts ... \" that's you guys \" ... you have convinced me that investing in index funds, either domestically or internationally, is guaranteeing mediocre returns. Two examples from your own newsletter support my case. One, had I invested in just ,  and  over the last 20 years, I would have soundly beaten the S&P 500. Two, going forward, I believe that investing in just one stock, , will significantly outperform any Latin American ETF or Global ex U.S. index fund. If you agree, why does  still stick to promoting index funds? So, anti-.\" Oh, Bro, this one is coming at you. [laughs] Well, so, I would first of all say, that I think, we, at The Motley Fool, just about everyone involved thinks that index funds are a great start for most people. In fact, if you go to our  service, there's a  guide to Fool's success, step No. 4, even includes the line, \"We think index funds should be the foundation of your portfolio.\" So, to the extent that we do recommend index funds, it's generally for people who are newer to investing, and then you can start branching out to individual stocks.I will point out that he also said, you know, \"Had I invested in Amazon, Microsoft and Apple the last 20 years, I would have soundly beaten the S&P 500.\" Yes, if you can pick the stocks beforehand that are going to outperform the S&P 500, that is a great investment strategy. If only. I will point out, by the way, he's right about those three stocks, but for Microsoft, and if you look back 20 years, starting in March of 2000 and invested in Microsoft, for the next 18 years, you were underperforming the S&P 500, it wasn't until April of 2018 that it started to outpace the S&P 500. So, for most of the time, it actually wasn't beating the S&P 500.But the point being, it's very difficult to know beforehand which those stocks are going to be. If you look into our services, and we've looked at this as a company, there's sort of a pareto principle with our return. So, 80% of the returns are provided by 20% of the stocks. I wrote up an article for  a month ago, so this is before the biggest drops that we've seen recently, but even when I looked at it then, almost 30% of 's recommendations have lost money, and almost 12% had been down 50%.So, while I do agree that once you become a more experienced, sophisticated investor, you can move away from index funds, but thinking that you can put your portfolio in a handful of stocks and beat the S&P 500 is pretty risky. Yeah. Alright, let's move on to the next question from anonymous. \"Heard you discuss refinancing with Chris on .\" Jason is this coming directly at you here, it must be? I think so. Yeah, I think so. \"But what typically happens with home prices? Good idea to wait to buy, do you think? Also, you said we should all have 20 to 30 or so stocks in our accounts. What if you have more than one account? I have a personal brokerage account and a separate IRA account, should I shoot for 20 to 30, overall, across both accounts or 20 to 30 in each account. Keep calm and Fool on!\" Yes, very good question. And so, let's tackle the home question first, because there is some interesting data here. Now, certainly with the interest rate environment that we have today, it's absolutely time to at least inquire about refinancing, if you own your home. I'm in the middle of enquiring about that as well, trying to see if I can get to a point where it actually makes sense. And I'm encouraged with what I'm hearing from our lenders. So, definitely look at that, that's an easy way to cut that payment and put a little bit more cash in your pocket at a time when a lot of people could really use it.If you look at the actual behavior out there today, total mortgage application volume fell almost 30% here just last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. And purchase applications fell even more dramatically in states hit the hardest by COVID-19 today, so you're looking at New York where it's down 35%; California, where it's down 23%, 17%, in Washington state. So, there is clearly a decline there in that mortgage volume. And we saw companies like  here just recently put on hold their home-buying program, which is a new part of the business they recently introduced where they're actually buying homes and then reselling them. They've put that program on hold right now given the situation. And you know most companies are trying to conserve capital and make sure that they can weather the storm, because we don't know, really, how long it's going to last or how much of an impact, economically speaking, it's going to be.Now, Zillow also recently performed a study here, and I got this from an article that came out recently on our  website, Maury Backman published this. Zillow recently did a study on the impact of previous pandemics on housing markets, interestingly enough, and one thing they found in this study is that home prices largely held steady or declines were very modest, in most cases. And that simply was because during those times there were fewer transactions. So, if people aren't desperate to sell, then they're not going to get out there and sell at a loss, they can weather the storm and just wait until times are a little bit better. And so, they don't feel like they have to sell at a loss. And so, I just thought that was an interesting point to note there as well.I mean, housing, as they always say, it's location, location, location. And so, it does change depending on where you are. And I think that where you are at this point in time, you certainly want to look to see how your area is dealing with this crisis. Clearly, California and New York are two states that are getting hit harder than a lot. But it does seem like in times like these, pandemics in particular, there is data out there that says that housing market can stay fairly resilient because people just, kind of, pull back and wait to weather the storm. Alright. Then the second part of that question was, \"Should I shoot for 20 to 30 overall stocks across all accounts or 20 to 30 in each account?\" So, when you have different brokerage accounts. Yeah, absolutely. I'm in that same boat, I mean I've got a self-directed brokerage account and then I have just a discretionary account. I think you're aiming really, you're looking in the context of your overall portfolio, so all accounts combined. Being well-diversified, 20 to 30 is a great place to start. For some folks, that number is going to be higher. For some folks, that number might be lower; if they're a little bit more confident or if they feel like their risk tolerance is high. But, yeah, I would look at in the context of all of your accounts. Alright. Next question comes from J. \"I am in my lower 20s, and I've always been interested in personal finance investing and saving for the future. Growing up, however, my dad has always lived an extremely high consumption lifestyle. He lives in a home worth well in the excess of $1 million has owned dozens of cars including s, s and Maseratis and wouldn't be surprised if he spends close to $4,000 a month eating out at expensive restaurants. He makes between $500,000 and a $1 million a year, so it seems he is able to maintain this lifestyle. However, with his level of spending, it makes me wonder whether he has built any wealth at all. I've tried starting conversations about finance with him and he never seems interested and doesn't add much to the conversation. I know he'd been previously burned by bad investments and I don't think he really invests anything. Am I right to be concerned about his spending and financial habits and if so, how would you recommend bringing this up with him to make sure he's preparing himself for retirement?\"Alright, Bro, that one's going to you. It is. And it can be tricky because there are just some people who do not want to talk about their finances, especially with their kids. That said, I do think the current crisis actually could be a way to bring up the conversation, and I think it's always good to lead with what you're doing. Talk about, \"Hey, you know, look, things are tough right now. This is happening to my retirement savings, this is what's happened to my portfolio, what's going on with you?\" And you might even frame it as a way for advice. That might cause your dad to be more inclined to open up, if you're saying, like, \"Hey, dad, what do you think I should do? What's going on with you?\"It's also I think important to frame it as concern for him, because many parents, especially wealthier parents will interpret this as, really, \"Why are you spending my inheritance?\" So, you definitely want to frame it that way. That said, there's only so much you can do, so if he's not willing to talk about it, you may just have to let it go. From what you've told me, my guess, he's going to be OK, I mean, he does have a $1 million house that he can do a reverse mortgage on or he can downsize. Given how much he's made, he probably is going to receive the maximum social security benefit, which is about $36,000 a year, maybe $40,000 a year, if he waits till late-70, not a lot compared to what he's making, but it'll prevent him from being penniless. But I think just open up the conversation talking about current events, might be the way to get that conversation going. Alright. Next question comes from Morty. \"I would appreciate Jason explaining what his stock buckets are and which stocks are in each bucket? What is his methodology for picking the stocks, market capitalization, growth, momentum, dividends? Is he going to create a coronavirus bucket?\" [laughs] I'm probably not going to create a coronavirus bucket, that might that would be a tough on the message, I think, we're trying to find that happy medium between recognizing the human toll here and also doing our job and making sure we're looking out for our members and our listeners and helping people secure their financial freedom. But the buckets or baskets, as I like to call them, two baskets that I have I have been maintaining here now for a little while. The first one, and this all started initially with just some discussions that Chris Hill and I were having every quarter it seems, when we would do  and we would look at the returns that some of these payments companies were lobbing out there. And we thought, \"Well, why don't we own shares of these companies?\" And so, it struck me that maybe there would be a payments related basket I could form. So, the war on cash basket was born on July 24, 2017 and that basket consists of , ,  and  all in equal amounts. So, 25% weighting on each position. And the idea is, take the total amount of money that you would want to invest in this sector, split it four ways and invest in these four companies.And to-date, since that date of inception in July 24, 2017, the war on cash basket has returned 81% versus the market's 9.6%. So, clearly that baskets worked out very well even throughout this bear market and COVID-19 crisis. And as you can see, with those four companies there, MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, Square, there wasn't one particular angle as far as philosophy, because you've got two dividend payers and you've got two that don't pay dividends. Two were a bit more stable or bigger, lower-risk in MasterCard and Visa. PayPal kind of that mid-risk. And Square being a little bit more of a risky play. But that was the idea behind the basket was to give yourself a nice risk exposure there; cover all ends of the risk spectrum.And so, after the war on cash basket, it struck me that another very attractive market opportunity is healthcare. And healthcare is another space where we have a lot of different ways we can invest. I had identified some companies that I do like in the space and so I came up with the healthcare and wealth-care basket, that date of inception was February 9, 2018. And to-date the returns of that basket, the basket is up 144.4% versus the market's 2.4%.Now, I will say, one caveat here on that on that number.  is one of the components of this basket and that stock has performed extremely well since February 2018, it's up +400% versus the others, but you've got , , Teladoc Health and . And, yes, IDEXX Laboratories is animal health; we cannot neglect our furry friends particularly in these trying times, they're serving as a point-of-support for a lot of us, as the owner of three dogs it just struck me that every time I went to the vet, IDEXX was getting some of my money, so then why not own some shares of IDEXX and get some of that money back. And thus far, it has all worked out very well.And the basket approach is simply meant to identify big, attractive market opportunities and then invest in those market opportunities, instead of trying to just pick one winner from a space, because oftentimes when you find attractive market opportunities, there are a number of companies that will win and in the case of the war on cash basket and the healthcare basket, thus far all eight components of the combined effort there are performing well, outperforming the market, positive returners. So, that's the general idea, is to give you good risk exposure while being able to invest in exciting market opportunities. Jason, do you think that given Alison's new baking hobby that you need to have a bread basket. [laughs] Hey, oh. I'm not sure which one would be easier to message, Rick, a coronavirus basket or a bread basket. I just got done telling a reporter, I'm like, all people are talking about is getting puppies and baking bread, like, that's what the coronavirus is doing to us here in Northern Virginia. We're drinking, a lot of drinking.Well, beer is just liquid bread, anyway, right. Liquid bread. Exactly. Were long on yeast, apparently. Alright, next question comes from Tom. \"I have 27 years left on a $250,000 mortgage with a current rate of 4%. Should I be paying extra principal or investing the money instead with the goal to pay off the mortgage, won't I have better odds paying it off sooner by investing that money for the long-term?\" Well, as Jason mentioned earlier, folks should be considering refinancing. So, mortgage rates had touched 3.25% a few weeks ago, all-time lows, they're slightly up to 3.5% now. But one rule of thumb about refinancing is that if you can cut your interest rate by 0.5% and you're going to be in the house for several years, it makes sense. You should definitely run your numbers. But the first thing I would look at is refinancing.I certainly think that the farther you are from retirement, generally, it's better to maintain the mortgage and invest the extra money; with the goal of paying off the mortgage before you retire. I've mentioned before that that's what I had been doing, I'm paying extra payments so that my mortgage is paid off before I retire. The reason I like that idea is, imagine you were retired right now and your portfolio has dropped by 33% and you're concerned about how that's going to eat into your retirement income. Your probably No. 1 concern is going to be, can I pay for my healthcare? And then, No. 2, can I pay for my mortgage? Because that's everyone's biggest expense and that's what everyone's biggest fear, losing their house. But if your mortgage is paid off, you don't have to worry about it. That said, my wife and I are actually going to stop those additional payments to the mortgage, because I think stocks are a better value right now. So, I'm actually going to be doing more investing than I had been in the past.So, Tom, in your general situation, unless it's extremely important for you to pay off the mortgage soon, I would rather invest the money. Alright. Next question comes from Caroline. \"I've heard that it is highly unlikely for this virus or any virus to be transmitted on cash, regardless, if enough people believe it can be carried that way, I would imagine it might cause even more people to abandon cash for credit cards and/or digital payments, no? I'm thinking that while the dollar amount value of transactions may decrease in an economic downturn or even for a few months because of the coronavirus, the number of transactions may increase and therefore our war on cash baskets of stocks may at least stay flat in the coming months or year. This question was prompted by my seeing someone in my local Upper West Side neighborhood bodega this morning insisting on being allowed to pay for a purchase of less than $10 using their digital wallet, credit card is not accepted for purchases less than $10, because there is at least one reported case of corona here and using cash is not safe he argued.\" Okay. Well, I will begin this answer by telling you that I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist, although, I do like science a lot and my dad is a doctor, so that doesn't matter either way. [laughs] I have done some research on this, though. And I will say that based on everything I have found that cash, paper money, absolutely can carry the virus and is a higher risk for transmitting that virus versus non-cash transactions. The World Health Organization certainly, they have warned that the virus can be transmitted to customers via bank notes and coins. So, don't think it's just paper money, certainly coins can carry it as well.China, I think, just went through a process of deep cleaning a lot of potentially infected cash to try to limit the spread of the virus. And ultimately, while pathogens and viruses can live on most surfaces for around 48 hours, there is research out there that shows that paper money can reportedly transport a live flu virus for, get this, up to 17 days, so. What? Yeah, I'm just telling you what the data says. Now, I'm not saying that you're going to get sick by using cash; don't get me wrong. I'm not really a big user of cash anymore, anyway. Like, I just find it more convenient not to use it. As with most things in life today, you just have to sort of -- there is some judgment involved and you just have to just be safe, you know. If you don't need to use cash then why use it? And I'm sure that a lot of merchants, a lot of stores out there are trying to navigate what is a tricky environment as well as the example that Caroline just offered. And considering your war-on basket, you're like, you know what, why not use that MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, Square -- MasterCard, and Visa, and PayPal, and Square, yeah, and I mean, you know, it's -- Definitely reach for that Visa says, Jason Moser, Visa shareholder. I think, coronavirus notwithstanding, I mean, the trend is clear, we are moving away from cash transactions and more toward electronic transactions worldwide. Alright. Next question comes from John. \"I know the government allows us to put away money in a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA tax free up to an income level. I believe in 2020, the household AGI has to be less than $206,000. What I'm not sure of is, if your household income is more than $206,000, are you still able to put money into an IRA, just not tax-free, and if so, is it a smart strategy, or is that a bad idea? Since when I take money out, I will end up paying taxes on my $6,000 contribution again?\" Well, I like to think of IRAs as really three types, there's the Roth IRA, whereas, when you put the money in, you don't get a tax break, but it grows tax-free, you take the money out, tax-free as long as you follow all the rules. There's the deductible traditional IRA, whereas, when you put the money in, you get a deduction, it grows tax deferred, but when you take the money out, you then pay taxes. If you make too much money, though, you may not be eligible for either of those, but you can always still contribute to the traditional IRA nondeductible, no deduction, but it still grows tax-deferred and when you take the money out, it's taxed then.So, just to give you some numbers on which ones people are eligible for. So, the Roth, your eligibility starts to fade when you make a $124,000, if you're single. It's completely eliminated when you're at $139,000; if you're married, a $196,000. It starts to be reduced to $206,000; again, if you're married then it's eliminated completely.If you are not covered by a retirement plan at work, any contribution to a traditional IRA is always deductible. So, if you don't have a 401(k) or a 403(b) and you're in a high tax bracket, the traditional IRA might make sense. If you are covered by a plan at work and you make a contribution to a traditional IRA, it may or may not be deductible and that is also subject to income limit. So, if you're single, your ability to deduct starts to go down at income level of $65,000; if you're married it's $104,000 it starts to go down.So, really, the point is, you're always eligible for some type of IRA, it just depends on your income and whether you're covered by a plan at work.One thing that John said was, he's basically asking, \"Should I bother contributing to a nondeductible IRA, if I put in that $6,000, I didn't get a tax break, and then when I take it out, I'm going to have to pay taxes on it again.\"That's actually not true. So, any nondeductible contribution you make to a traditional IRA, you're not going to be taxed on it again, that money will come out tax-free, it's the growth that you'll be taxed on. If you do not have significant amount of assets in traditional IRAs and you're not eligible for the Roth, you can make a contribution to the nondeductible traditional IRA and do what's called a backdoor Roth IRA. You basically do an instant conversion. I don't want to go into too many of the details, google it, you'll find plenty of articles, or even just call your discount broker, they'll know how to handle it.But the bottom-line is, anyone who's working can contribute to an IRA, it just depends on what you're eligible for based on various things. And I think if you're eligible for one and you have the excess money, it's always a good idea to contribute. Alright. Next question comes from Gary. \"What are the best defensive stocks in a volatile market? Best aggressive stocks with risk to buy now?\" So, that's a tough question, just because, there's so many stocks out there and, you know, these are unique times where it doesn't seem like there's necessarily always a correlation. But I do think, in a volatile market if you're looking for stability, something that is not going to go to crazy one way or the other frame your mindset around needs, think about things that people need as potentially ways to invest.And so, I'm thinking of things like utilities and telecom, things like that, they can be a little less susceptible to these heavy market moves, given that their revenue streams are largely uninterrupted, right. I mean, most people aren't cutting off their power, right? You kind of need power. Most people aren't cutting off their cellphone service, so whether that's  or . I mean, if you look at this stretch, Verizon, year-to-date down 12.5%; AT&T down 21.5%, compare that to the greater market, that doesn't really seem like it's so bad. And they also pay really healthy dividend yields that they can afford, again, because they're businesses that are providing services that people really do need.So, I think, if you're looking for stability, think about needs.If you're thinking about more aggressive stocks, I can give you a couple of ideas. One of the things I love to focus on in times like these, when everybody's kind of in the same boat. Look for the market leaders in their respective spaces, because they're the ones that typically emerge from periods of time like this stronger. They're typically the companies that pick up a little bit more market share, even if they just maintain essentially a flat market share, the fact that competitors are typically smaller -- I mean, we're talking about smaller competitors here, but typically you see either bankruptcies or businesses that lose business and revenue declines and whatnot. You look at the market leaders in their respective spaces, they tend to walk away from stretches like this even stronger.A couple of companies that come to mind, examples there, think about something like . Travel right now, I mean, obviously getting hammered for obvious reasons, I mean people aren't traveling, but when things get better, when the dust does settle, Booking.com is still going to have this tremendous network of hotels, the biggest network out there. It's going to still be a great business that does a lot of business in the travel industry. So, that's a good example.And then another one, I think, is . Starbucks is a company that is going to be able to weather the storm financially. You know, they're going to come out on the other end even stronger I think given their history, given what they sell. Chris Hill, I think, put it very eloquently today. He said it's a legally addictive product. And you know, anytime you can sell a legally addictive product, you got to look at that as a potential investment opportunity.And then, I'll just give you a last thing here. Some ideas as far as stocks that I've personally bought myself throughout this stretch here over the past month. Companies that I bought include , which is in the AutoCAD software business. I did open my very own position in Starbucks finally, so that I can be invested in Starbucks alongside my daughter's. And , which is, I think everybody familiar with Adobe the PDF company, but it's so much more. And then also , which is a programmatic advertising.And I really do believe that when the dust settles, those are for companies that will emerge even stronger. Alright. Next question comes from Jeff. \"I was wondering if it makes sense to discontinue my student loan automatic payment plan that provides an interest rate deduction, to begin sending my monthly payments through the Virginia529 plan? I'm thinking, yes, assuming the interest rate deduction provided by the lender for automatic online payment is small compared to the, I believe, 5.75% savings on Virginia taxes using the 529 plan would provide.\" So, Jeff, let's remind the audience what a 529 plan is. When it was originally conceived, you would put the money in, you didn't get a deduction when you put it in, generally, at least on the Federal level, but then the money grew tax-free as long as you used it for qualified higher education expenses. Then a couple years ago they changed the rules so that you could use some of your 529 money for elementary and secondary school expenses. And then just at the end of last year, thanks to The SECURE Act, they now allow people to take out $10,000, lifetime limit, to pay off student loans.So, Jeff is thinking, if I put money in my Virginia529 plan, something that I also participate in, I get a tax deduction. And that's true of about 30 of the 529 plan, every state has one, 30 of the states offer a deduction on the state return, not Federal, the state return if I put the money in. He basically wants to put the money in and then take the money out quickly to pay off his loans.As opposed to what he's currently doing, he's on some sort of automatic payment plan, and most of these lenders as well as all kinds of other banks and lenders, will basically reduce your interest rate a little bit if you sign up for some sort of automatic payment plan.So, my first thing to say is, I think you can do both, you can still stick with the plan, you can put money in the 529 and then take it out, because the money you take out of the 529, doesn't have to go directly to the loan, you can take it out and take it yourself and then write the check, just have it sit in your bank account. And at the end of the year, you'll get a 1099-Q indicating that you took a deduction.I think we discussed in a previous episode, it's actually rather surprising at how little anyone follows up on whether you actually use the money for qualified higher education expenses or not.I did call the Virginia529 plan today just to say, like, \"Is there any limit on how long I have to leave the money in there?\" And the person I spoke with said, \"No,\" so. But you might want to check, everyone has their own plans, every plan has their own rules, so you might want to pay attention to that.Also, for states that do offer this deduction, they often have what they call, recapture rules. And Virginia has one and many states have this. So, for example, if you donate to the Virginia529, get the tax deduction but then transfer that 529 to another state, it might basically want you to pay back the money you got for taking the deduction.Some states do this if you use the money for K-12 expenses. The interesting thing here is, using money for student loans, it's so new that states don't have any rules about this yet. I even looked through the 60-page document for Virginia's 529 to see how they treat distributions for school loans, and there's a big disclaimer on the frontpage saying, \"We know that there's no rules, but we haven't codified them yet, so stay tuned.\" So, I would just follow-up on that to make sure that there's not going to be any sort of tax deduction recapture if you use the money to pay off your school loan. Alright. Next question comes from Jerry. \"Would you help me understand what investment managers mean when they recommend investing internationally? There are several reasons the term \"international\" seems confusing. First, if a company incorporates in a nation outside the U.S., is that sufficient grounds to call it an international stock? Does that make an American depositary receipts on the NYSE an international investment? Do managers believe opening a special brokerage account that permits trading on a non-U.S. exchanges is a must?\"\"Second, if a stock is only traded on an exchange outside the U.S., not ADRs, is that sufficient to call it an international stock? What if the company makes the majority of its sales from clients in the U.S.? Finally, what if the top ten large cap American multinationals incorporated in the U.S. and traded on U.S. exchanges received the majority of their revenues from clients outside the USA, does that make them international stocks? For example, Microsoft makes more than 50% of its sales outside the U.S.\"\"Bottom-line it seems that the  provides plenty of global diversification without the word \"international\" entering into the calculation.\" Excellent question, and I will begin with Jerry's takeaway there, the bottom-line. I agree with you that, yes, I think that the Vanguard Total Market Index provides plenty of global diversification without the word \"international\" entering in the calculation, primarily because so much money is made outside of the United States and other international locations.So, defining international investing has certainly changed throughout the years and as the world gets smaller, thanks to technology, we're all more and more connected. And so, I think international investing is very much just wanting to make sure that you get exposure to the global economy, however you do that, it is a bit of a squishy definition. I think that I personally look at it today as most big companies out there are international in nature, because they make their money all over the world. It didn't always used to be that way, but it certainly is more the norm now, and that's how I view international investing.I think the Microsoft example is a really good one. I think Microsoft can certainly be viewed as an international investment based on the revenue it generates and the locations it generates it. Starbucks, Apple, , I mean the examples just go on and on. I think international investing today is much easier than ever before, because we've got companies that are making their money in so many different places. Alright. Next question comes from Sam. \"If I sell a stock in my Roth IRA for a profit, are there any issues with rebuying the same stock immediately in my taxable brokerage account? I'd like to lock-in gains in the Roth to free up cash and move a non-dividend paying stock to my other account.\" The quick answer is, no, there are no tax consequences to selling anything in your Roth. You don't have to pay capital gains and you can't take a capital loss. So, you go ahead and sell that stock and then you can rebuy it on the outside. And it sounds like what you're doing is asset location, and that is, putting the right investments in the right accounts for maximum tax efficiency and it sounds smart. If you have a dividend-paying stock and you're not yet retired, it's better to keep it in the IRA, use your taxable brokerage account for stocks that don't pay dividends. Alright. Next question comes from Vasu. \"Following your advice, in an effort to be able to buy stocks on a discount in the situation like we are experiencing right now because of the coronavirus, each month I put aside a portion of my savings, about 5% to 7%, in a high-yield account to invest in a downturn. My question is, do you have any rules of thumb or strategies for when and how to invest in such a situation? Right now, I have about $7,000 saved up compared to my monthly contribution to my retirement account of $4,500. I primarily invest in a mix of U.S. and international index funds for my retirement savings. Retirement for me is 37 years away. So, when and how do you think I should invest the $7,000?\" So, my primary rule-of-thumb, and I've learned this from the Great Recession ten years ago, take it slow. No matter what, first-and-foremost, just take it slow. You're not in a race to try to get all of this money invested at once, because as we've seen, the market has moved a lot one way or the other for the last month here, so the opportunities are certainly there.From there, I think you take the money that you have, a good idea -- and Ron Gross turned me on this idea a while back, is take that money, split it up into four or five tranches, you know, divide that out and say, \"Okay, I've got four or five tranches of a $1,000 each and I'm going to put those to work on my given opportunistic timeframes, whether that's every week or when the market falls a certain percentage, whether it's 2%, 3% or 4%, you can determine that line for yourself.But I think taking it slow and dividing that money out into tranches that you can get to work in there will help you do that. Alright. Next question comes from Matt. \"I have very little debt and a six-month emergency fund in place. My wife and I are 30 and make good income, but should still get the full $1,200 per adult and $500 per child in the new stimulus plan. Can I take the $3,400 my family will get and invest it in my traditional IRA or my children's 529 plans and claim that as a deduction?\" The answer is, yes. So, from what I have read, the money that's coming from the stimulus plan will be automatically deposited into your bank account that was listed on your 2019 or 2018 tax returns. So, that money will just magically appear in your bank account and there's no rules against then using that money to put in a 529 or an IRA, the only limits for an IRA is it's $6,000 per year, another $1,000, if you're 50 or older, as long as you make that much money. So, as long as you're working, you can do that 529 there's really virtually no limit. So, go ahead and do that and you can still take the deduction for the 529 if your state offers that or for the traditional, if you meet the limits that I mentioned earlier in the show. Alright. Next question comes from Mary. \"Why in the world is the stock market tanking on Monday and then up on Tuesday and then tanking again on Wednesday? There really has been no news, the virus has continued to spread globally and we won't have a vaccine for another 12 to 18 months. I know that a lot of this trading is done algorithmically, but there are still humans providing price inputs. I'm so confused.\" Well, there are humans providing price inputs, but the word that was mentioned their \"algorithms,\" that really is a big part of what's going on here right now. We are seeing a resurgence in high frequency trading and , which is a publicly traded company out there, one of the largest high-speed trading firms out there actually said, that it expects to post trading income of around $515 million here in the first quarter, which is more than double the amount from the same period last year. And then Thomas Peterffy, who is the Founder [sic] of , noted that they have seen, I think, double the trading volume in this time compared with last year as well.So, certainly high-speed trading is a big part of it. I think it's also worth noting that there are folks that short stocks, obviously, as they go down. When we see shorting at some point, they start covering and that can sometimes cause a little bit of a squeeze which sends the markets back up. So, it's not one particular answer, it certainly is a combination of a lot of things, but we're definitely seeing a resurgence in high-frequency trading these days. Next question comes from Charlie. \"I'm a 20-year-old college student who has had the privilege of investing since I was 14.\" Oh, that's awesome. \"When it comes time to finance a house or car, would it be wise not to touch my investments and to let them run. I have a Roth IRA and two taxable investment accounts, one taxable account holds a small mix of ETFs and some index funds, while the other has 40 individual stock picks. Upon graduating, my plan is to gradually build up my emergency savings while still contributing to my investments. Is it unheard of, given my age, to be practically all-in with equities and use these investment vehicles to save for a down payment and other life goals?\" I personally don't think it's unheard of to use those types of investments to achieve life goals. I mean, I certainly have invested in individual stocks and sold those positions in order to make, actually, a down payment on a house as well. And so, I think that that is definitely one way to look at it. And I like, particularly when you're talking about a house, to me, that is essentially taking money from one investment and you're allocating that money to another investment where the opportunity for you is a little bit better. And in this case, if you're putting a down payment on a house, I mean, yeah, you know, you're investing that money into something that's going to put a roof over your head for the next however many years you plan to stay in that house. So, it's another investment. It's just always worth remembering the tax implications that are involved whenever you do something like that. So, just keep that in mind whenever you do plan to liquidate and allocate that money to another form of investment. Alright. The last question is for Jason. \"What is he most excited for on his future visit to Clemson University.\" Derek wants to know. \"Jason, are you going to Clemson.\" Yeah, I was so bummed, man. Derek is a guy on Twitter that he and I have talked back-and-forth about investing and stuff. And I was going to go down to speak with some folks at Clemson, some investors, some students and just talk a little bit about what we do, what I do, and you know, just talk stocks and stuff. But it's a postponement, it's not a cancellation, so I am looking forward to getting back down there. I went to college just an hour or so away from Clemson a while for college. So, for me, it's always nice to get back to South Carolina just because that's where I grew up.I've got a cousin down there, Austin, she's still down at South Carolina and I don't get to see her very often and I was really excited to get back down there and catch up with her. But again, a postponement, not a cancellation. So, Austin, I'll be down there eventually and we'll go grab some dinner. Alright. My sister went to Clemson. And back in the day it had a strong agriculture program and they had all their own homemade ice cream and it was crazy cheap and it was outstanding. [laughs] I mean, they still have very strong agricultural program there. Clemson is a big school, a good school. I got a lot of friends that have graduated there through the years and so I'm just excited to get back down there and see it.[...] Alright. Well, that covers it for our mailbag, but we can also head to the other mailbag. Okay, I don't know what's going on with the postcards, because again, we're taping this remotely from each of our houses and so there may be a stack of postcards from our listeners waiting at the office, but what I was able to do though is go to iTunes and see all the people who've left reviews for us lately.So, other than MFFan saying that the host voice is painful, I want to thank Claire in Knoxville, Rebel, Smith, Drew, Jake, What2What, Finn, Dave, Matt, King Hoser, Bunch of Liars, and then a P with a couple of asterisks and an L -- I don't know, people pick hard to pronounce names on iTunes, but that's OK, I want to thank all of you for the reviews, it helps bump us up in the rankings which helps us attract new listeners and that's a good thing, especially now.So, before we go though, as we've been doing during these troubling times, we've been closing by sharing our one recommendation for the week for our listeners to do or read or whatever to kind of take their mind off of the sadness that surrounds us. [laughs] That makes it sound so dark and sad at our house, I promise you, I'm OK. So, who wants to go first this week with their recommendation? I'll go, just because I don't have a particular good recommendation, because I was so busy all week, so I'm more eager to hear other people's recommendations. However, I did stumble upon the  account of Patrick Stewart @SirPatStew. And every day he's reading a sonnet with his outstanding English accent. So, highly recommend that. Good stuff, Bro, good stuff. Yes, so I just got done watching on HBO that limited series The Outsider, it was based on a Stephen King book. And so actually read the book a year, year-and-a-half or whatever. Really liked the book. I got to say, the series did the book justice. So, read the book or watch the series. Either way, I think it is super-entertaining, if you have any Stephen King inclinations whatsoever. Alright, Rick, how about you? You pointed out that I keep picking music things and that's my brand here, but I'm also a photographer. And so, I'm going to recommends some fun with your iPhone or whatever camera you have around the house. And that is to do some, either backyard or indoor photography. So, I'm going to rifle through a couple of tips, things you might not think to do because you're just pointing at your kids or whatever. One is perspective angle, try shooting from on your knees or from lying on the floor, try different angles, see what you can find.Light, instead of looking at the subject of what you're looking at, look at the way the light is spread across the floor or across the wall or whatever; cool things come out of that. Look for lines and shapes. Look instead of just a tree, look at the bark on the tree or look at the books on your shelf, you know, what kind of patterns are they making; look for that.Macro, get up close. Take close-up pictures, as close as your camera will focus. Bad weather. Bad weather makes good photos. It's the perfect time to do portraits of your pets and family. Try different locations around the house, either inside or outside. All of these things can feed your Instagram account and all of your socials. Have some fun with your camera, try some different things, do some things you wouldn't normally do, have fun. And you can send those pictures to us by email instead of postcards in the interim, so. Oh, there you go. Well, we have so much luck when we ask people to send us anything that's not a postcard. Bro, how many emails did we get with people giving us their moneysaving piece of advice? Not many. [laughs] As many as we got sending us our holiday traditions. That's OK. [laughs] I think we got a few holiday traditions, actually, but -- Did we?Yeah. Okay. Alright. Well, my recommendation is an artist and a writer named Charlie Mackesy. Do you guys know this guy? Nope. Okay. So, you can follow him on Instagram. He also has a recent book out called . And the book is just a lovely series of illustrations and conversations between a boy, a mole, a fox and a horse. And they're all about acceptance and love and every drawing is just like a great big hug, as we all socially distance here.So, again, you can follow him on Instagram @charliemackesy, and the book is, . Highly recommended if you need a hug.Alright. Well, that's the show, but I should probably say a disclaimer, huh, because we did talk stocks, so.As always, The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against the stocks we talked about today, don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you heard here.Jason, thank you so much for joining us this week. We really appreciate it. Thank you for having me; it's always a pleasure. Yeah, well, we made it work. We're trying to make it work doing it all remotely. So, I hope our listeners aren't suffering too much as we kind of blunder through this.Alright, the show is edited socially by Rick Engdahl, I don't know, usually Rick helps me come up with what my adverb is. Socially distantly. [laughs] [laughs] Socially distantly by Rick Engdahl, our email is Answers@Fool.com. Again, send us those pictures and Christmas traditions and moneysaving tips.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new July 2nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $190.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $190.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $180.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $196.20/share today.\n\nBecause the $190.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $196.20/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $197.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.48% if the stock gets called away at the July 2nd expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $197.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $197.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.82% boost of extra return to the investor, or 41.86% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 57%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 52%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $196.20) to be 49%.

The retailing giant has reported surging sales growth as consumers turned to its warehouses to stock up on groceries and other essentials. Core comparable-store sales jumped 11% in the U.S. in April, and they were up 88% in the online sales channel.The chain's earnings report on Thursday will include other important metrics like membership fee income, customer traffic, and subscriber renewal rates in both the U.S and international segments.

Meanwhile, look for Costco to discuss how its members are responding to the retailer's requirement that they wear masks while shopping in its stores.Investors  in recent weeks, indicating high expectations for its earnings report on Wednesday. The 's business should have held up well through the latest challenging economic conditions. It runs a software-as-a-service operating model that's digitally delivered, after all.Autodesk might still have seen reduced demand for its design products as construction work slowed in March and April. It has had to step back from its traditional in-person sales and marketing efforts too. Any weakness related to those shifts would show up mainly in its billings and deferred-revenue trends.In addition to those figures, look for CEO Andrew Anagnost and his team to discuss Autodesk's financial position -- the company said at its last quarterly check-in that free cash flow should rise to as much as $1.6 billion this year, compared with $1.4 billion in 2019 and $310 million in 2018.Ulta Beauty entered 2020 with some significant sales challenges that were likely only amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The core makeup category has been shrinking for several quarters, and that demand slump pressured both sales and profits in the fiscal fourth quarter.Thursday's earnings report isn't going to show an improvement on those weak sales trends, especially as most of Ulta's retailing and spa services were unavailable through most of March and April. The increased stay-at-home time likely reduced demand for many cosmetic and hair care products.But look for CEO Mary Dillon and her team to highlight the chain's e-commerce channel, which was supported by an aggressive rollout of curbside pickup options.

Indeed, Autodesk stock trades at a considerable discount. Given both the current market conditions and the much lower stock price, investors should evaluate the Foolishness of buying Autodesk in these conditions.Autodesk stock logged an impressive  in 2019, well ahead of the 29% gain posted by the over the same period. The full-year results backed up these gains as revenue for the software services company increased by 22%, and non-GAAP earnings more than doubled to $803 million, or $2.79 per share.However, this occurred before COVID-19 became an issue. Thanks to coronavirus-driven fear, Autodesk has seen nearly all of its 2019 and 2020 gains wiped out in just over a month. Now, Autodesk stock has lost more than one-third of its value. data by This had made Autodesk stock more difficult to evaluate. The forward price-to-earnings ratio of just over 36 may look reasonable against previous Wall Street forecasts concerning earnings growth. For now, analysts predict profit increases of 54.8% for fiscal 2021 and 39.4% the year after. As a result, the price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio comes in at around 0.9. That places the  just above a level analysts might consider \"inexpensive\" for the average company. Still, with the lowered economic activity surrounding coronavirus, it remains unclear whether those growth numbers will hold as earnings estimates continue to fall.While this may sound dire, none of this affects Autodesk's status as a long-term winner. This comes, in large part, because of one key decision the company made in the middle of the last decade.Autodesk, much like , , and , transitioned from selling a stand-alone license of its software to a monthly subscription service beginning in 2015. That made both revenue and earnings tumble in the short term. As a result, profit growth averaged 8.7% per year over the last five years.Image source: Getty Images.However, investors have to remember that the company was now earning steady, yearly revenue. Before, it saw one temporary revenue surge after the company released a new version of AutoCAD or other software packages. This has helped to drive revenue higher over the long term. As a result, Autodesk began to reap the benefits in 2019 when revenue finally returned to 2016 levels.Investors also have to remember that Autodesk has existed since 1982. Considering its longevity and the continued demand for AutoCAD and other products, I see this as a lucrative Foolish investment.For now, the worry is timing. As much of the world shuts down due to coronavirus, it could mean lower demand for Autodesk products. Investors may not want to pay more than 40 times forward earnings for a stock affected by such conditions.However, as mentioned before, the PEG at just under 1.0 may seem inexpensive, but only from an average market perspective. Some have argued that  have commanded .\u00a0However, considering the premium many of its peers command in the stock market, the PEG ratio of 0.9 seems especially reasonable for a company like Autodesk.Still, the market remains volatile, and understandably, many investors do not want to put hard-earned cash to work if they think stocks can fall further. However, this too shall pass. Companies small and large will continue to formulate new designs, and many will likely turn to Autodesk products as their platform.

The company has pumped out double-digit revenue and profit growth for years, and that consistency has made it a Wall Street darling. That's why its stock rarely goes on sale, so its recent decline -- shares are currently down 37% from their February highs -- represents a tremendous opportunity.Mastercard generates revenue by keeping a tiny slice of all the money that flows through its network. In 2019, the company processed $6.5 trillion in payments, which was up 12% over the prior year. All of those small fees added up to $16.9 billion in revenue.The beauty of Mastercard's model is that it costs next to nothing to process one more payment. This allows an ever-increasing portion of the company's revenue to flow straight to the bottom line. Management has used its profit stream to buy back stock, pay a growing dividend, and make tuck-in acquisitions.Management recently , stating that the novel coronavirus is going to slow its revenue growth to \"just\" 9% to 10% in the first quarter. That fear is a big reason why shares have taken such a short-term hit.Longer-term, I have no doubt that the convenience of paying with plastic will continue to win over consumers across the planet. Buying shares of this perennial winner while they are in the discount bin is likely to be a profit-friendly move.Square is also in the payment processing space, but there's far more to its business than just that. Square sells a complete ecosystem of hardware and software products that cater to the needs of small and medium-sized businesses. This includes tools that help sellers with order management, inventory, cash flow management, analytics, and even customer engagement.Square's products have become hugely popular, which has driven rapid financial growth. Last year, the company's revenue soared 43% to $4.7 billion. Management guided for 30% revenue growth in 2020, too.\u00a0That progress hasn't mattered to investors recently. Square's stock has been  in just the last few weeks.Square's sell-off isn't completely unjustified. More than 40% of Square's revenue comes from small and medium-sized consumer discretionary businesses like restaurants and retailers, which are no doubt feeling the pain right now. That fact is likely to curtail Square's 2020 growth.The near-term hit could be painful, but Square has a proven business model in place and management pegs its\u00a0. I'm confident that this company's hypergrowth will ramp back up once a recovery takes hold.Autodesk is a leading provider of computer-aided design (CAD) software. Its products have been used by engineers, designers, architects, construction professions, and entertainers for decades to help them create anything that they can dream up.Autodesk's revenue used to wax and wane with economic growth, which made its results unpredictable. However, a few years ago the company shifted to a \u00a0(SaaS) business model, which should go a long way toward smoothing out the ride during this downturn.\u00a0Longer-term, Autodesk has a  opportunity to grow just from its current base of users. About 18 million people currently use Autodesk's products, but only about 5 million of them have are paying subscribers to the SaaS platform -- the rest are still utilizing old versions of the company's products.\u00a0It's only a matter of time before those holdouts upgrade and become paying subscribers. That provides Autodesk with high levels of revenue and profit visibility that other businesses can only dream of.

Making its debut on the public markets in April 2017, the company priced its shares at $17.\u00a0It raised nearly $200 million in the IPO and was previously backed by private-equity stalwarts, including Sequoia Capital, Khosla Ventures, and Andreesen Horowitz.\u00a0Okta gained 38% on its first day of trading and closed at $23.51. The stock has since generated massive returns in just under three years.So how much would an investor have if they invested $1,000 in Okta's IPO? An investor could have purchased 58 Okta shares for $986. That investment will have grown to $7,306 as of this writing, yielding more than seven times the original investment.One of the key drivers of Okta's incredible returns is its revenue growth. It increased sales from $257 million in fiscal 2018 to $399 million in fiscal 2019 and $586 million in fiscal 2020.\u00a0The company continues to benefit from the increasing number of data breaches making headlines around the world. Employees now have multiple logins, which make them vulnerable to cyber-attacks and digital theft. This is where Okta comes in.

In its most recent quarter ended in January, revenue increased 45% year over year, driven by a 46% increase in subscription sales.\u00a0It ended fiscal 2020 with 7,950 customers and a dollar retention rate of 119%. The retention rate shows that existing customers are subscribing to additional services.\u00a0Okta is focused on growing its base of large enterprise customers. Okta now has 1,467 customers with an annual contract value (ACV) of over $100,000, good for year-over-year growth of 41%.\u00a0The company has managed to gain traction across various industries too. In the fourth quarter, it won over a Global 2000 power management company with over 100,000 employees where contractors and partners will be able to securely access cloud and on-premise applications. , a leader in the design software space, selected Okta's identity cloud to centralize access management for its customers.Another important win for Okta was with a European film and television studio and distributor that has over eight million subscribers. Okta is optimistic that its offerings will support peak website traffic of up to 90,000 connections per minute during large sporting events, including soccer games. The European studio has partnerships with and , and the former is bound to rely on Okta to provide a secure customer experience.Okta is a market leader in the enterprise identity access management (IAM) segment.

All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in the press release or the slide presentation on our investor relations website. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew. -- Thanks, Abhey. We closed fiscal year '20 with outstanding Q4 results with revenue, earnings, and free cash flow coming in above expectations. Recurring revenue grew 29% and we delivered $1.36 billion in free cash flow for the year. Our results were driven by strong growth in all geographies. This was a landmark year for us in construction as we absorbed our acquisitions and integrated our offerings under one platform, the Autodesk Construction Cloud. Subscriptions now represent around 85% of our revenue and we exited the year with maintenance contributing less than 10%. Fiscal year '20 marked the end of the business model transition for us and we are entering fiscal '21 firmly positioned to deliver strong, sustainable growth through fiscal '23 and beyond. It was three years ago that we first communicated our fiscal '20 free cash flow goal. We have delivered on that goal, which is a testament to the adaptability and focused execution of the Autodesk ecosystem and the power of our products. I want to acknowledge and thank our employees, partners, customers, long-term investors, and everyone who helped us achieve these results. While the path to delivering on our long-term targets was not always smooth, everyone who stayed with us and believed in the transition has been rewarded.Beyond that, the dramatically reduced upfront costs created by the subscription model have enabled a whole new class of customers to purchase our most powerful tools; opening up not only new opportunities for our business, but for the businesses of our customers as well. Before we get into our results and guidance, I want to mention that our thoughts are with those affected by the coronavirus. The safety and security of our employees is our top priority. We are also minimizing potential impact to our customers and partners. The events are not currently impacting our service levels for our customers or global R&D efforts. We will continue to monitor the situation and take precautionary steps. Now I will turn it over to Scott to give you more details on our results and fiscal '21 guidance. I'll then return with a summary of some important recognitions we received and insights on key drivers of our business including updates on construction, manufacturing and our progress in monetizing non-compliant users before we open it up for Q&A. -- Thanks, Andrew. As you heard from Andrew, we had strong performance across all metrics with revenue, earnings, and free cash flow coming in above expectations. Demand in our end markets was strong as indicated by our robust billings and current RPO growth and the sum of our revenue growth plus free cash flow margin for the year was 69%. Revenue growth in the quarter came in at 22% versus a strong Q4 fiscal '19, with acquisitions contributing 3 percentage points of the growth. Strength in revenue was driven by subscription revenue growth of 41%. For the full-year, subscription revenue was up 53% and, as Andrew mentioned, subscriptions now represent approximately 85% of our revenue. With the success of our maintenance to subscription program, we exited the year with maintenance revenue contributing less than 10% of total.Total ARR came in at $3.43 billion, up 25%. Core ARR grew 21%, and Cloud ARR grew 102% to $255 million. When adjusted for acquisitions, Cloud ARR grew an impressive 30% driven by strong performance of BIM 360 Design. Now that a year has passed since we completed the acquisitions, our entire construction portfolio will be organic starting first quarter of fiscal '21. Moving onto details by product and geography, starting with AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, revenue grew 24% in the fourth quarter, again versus a strong Q4 fiscal '19, and 30% for the year. AEC grew 30% in Q4 and 35% for the year while manufacturing rose 15% in Q4 and 18% for the year. M&E was down 5% in the quarter primarily due to a large upfront transaction in the fourth quarter of last year. M&E revenue was up 9% for the year. Geographically, we saw broadbased strength across all regions. Revenue grew 21% in the Americas and EMEA and 26% in APAC during the quarter. We also saw strength in direct revenue, which rose 26% versus last year and represented 31% of our total sales, relatively in line with the fourth quarter of last year. The strength in our direct business was driven by large enterprise business agreements and our digital sales.As we've indicated in the past, we plan to provide an annual update on our subs and annualized revenue per subscription or ARPS performance. During the year, we grew total subscriptions 12% to 4.9 million with subscription plan growing 26%. We added 181,000 cloud subscriptions due to strong adoption of our BIM 360 family products as well as 79,000 subscriptions from PlanGrid and BuildingConnected. ARPS grew by 11% for the year to $704 with Core ARPS growing by 10% to $798. With only one quarter left in our maintenance to subscription or M2S program, we have approximately 400,000 maintenance subscriptions left. I am proud to share that we have converted over 1 million maintenance subscriptions to date. We will be retiring maintenance after May 2021 and customers will have one last opportunity to renew their maintenance or trade-in their maintenance seat for a subscription between now and May 2021. Please refer to the slide deck posted on our investor relations website for additional details around the trade-in offer.As expected and consistent with last quarter, the maintenance conversion rate was 40%. Of those that migrated, upgrade rates came in at 26%. Net revenue retention rate was again within the 110% to 120% range, continuing to demonstrate the growing strategic value we deliver to our existing customers. Billings growth of 43% in the quarter and 55% for the year was driven by organic growth and, as expected, the normalization of our multi-year contracts. The strength in our multi-year commitments from our customers is an indicator of the strategic importance and business critical nature of our products. Our long-term deferred revenue ended up slightly higher than we anticipated but our multi-year business is at a sustainable level and is not creating a headwind to our future free cash flows. In fiscal '20, we delivered $1.36 billion in free cash flow with $684 million coming in the fourth quarter, delivering on a key goal we set out three years ago. We expect to post annual growth in our free cash flows through fiscal '23 and beyond as net income will start driving a greater portion of our free cash flows versus deferred revenue. Our total remaining performance obligation of $3.6 billion is up 33% and our current remaining performance obligation of $2.4 billion grew 23%.On the margin front, we continue to realize significant operating leverage due to strong revenue growth and diligent expense management. For the full year, non-GAAP gross margins were very strong at 92%, up 2 percentage points from last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 12 percentage points to 25%. We are on track to deliver further margin expansion and attain approximately 40% non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal '23. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continued to repurchase shares with excess cash. During the fourth quarter, we purchased a little over 1 million shares for $191 million at an average purchase price of $189.52 per share. During the year, we fully offset dilution from our equity plans, purchasing a total of 2.7 million shares for $456 million at an average purchase price of $168.63 per share.Now I'll turn the discussion to our outlook. We have taken into account the current macro environment and potential risks involved with any disruptions. Our direct exposure to China is small and our experience with past outbreaks showed limited impact to our sales. While we will continue to monitor the situation more broadly, we expect total revenue to grow 20% to 22% in fiscal '21 and and expand non-GAAP operating margin by about 5 percentage points. During the year we plan to deliver free cash flow in the range of $1.63 billion to $1.69 billion, up 20% to 24%. When looking at the quarterization of free cash flow for fiscal '21, given normal seasonality and strength of payment collections and large deals signed in the fourth quarter, we expect about two-thirds of our free cash flow to be generated in the second half of the year. Looking at our guidance for the first quarter, our strength in the fourth quarter presents a tough sequential compare. Given our normal seasonality, other revenue in Q1 is expected to be about half as much as we experienced in Q4. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for the fiscal first quarter and full year 2021. And now, I'd like to turn it back to Andrew. -- Thanks, Scott. We just closed a landmark fiscal year and delivered on the free cash flow target we set over three years ago when we began the business model transition. Now let me give you some details about what is happening across our business. First off, fiscal '20 was not only a year of financial achievements, but also a year where we increasingly enabled our customers to realize more sustainable outcomes in their work. In fact, we were recognized by the Corporate Knights for being in the top 5 of the world's most sustainable companies and Barron's ranked us 10th on their list of one hundred most sustainable companies, making us the highest-ranking software company on both lists. This recognition is not only a testament to how responsibly we run our own business, but more importantly, how we help our customers meet their own sustainability goals, which brings me to construction.Our construction business had an outstanding year and ended the year with great momentum. We are looking at construction in a more connected way than ever before, and our offers are resonating with our customers. The Autodesk Construction Cloud delivers advanced technology, a network of builders, and the power of predictive analytics to drive projects from the earliest phases of design, through planning, building, and into operations. Customers are excited about the unified platform and are recognizing that the breadth, depth, and connectivity across our portfolio sets us apart from our competition. For example, CRB, a design-build firm with offices across the U.S. and internationally, was using each of our four products independently. When they understood our vision for Construction Cloud to deliver a unified solution that integrates workflows connecting the office, trailer, and field, CRB signed an enterprise business agreement with Autodesk for the solutions offered under the Construction Cloud. They are aligned with our vision of a unified solution that provides the entire construction lifecycle from design through long-term maintenance with all the design and make data they need in one place so information is not siloed or lost, and work gets done more efficiently. Leveraging data efficiently is critical to CRB's new project execution concept: ONEsolution, which will bring time, cost, quality and safety benefits to everyone involved. We provide the only truly connected solution for construction and during the quarter Metropolitan Mechanical Contractors (MMC), a Revit customer, decided to go with our Construction solutions over our competitor's. Based in Minnesota, MMC is a single source solution for the design and build of complex mechanical systems focused on quality, speed, and sustainable outcomes all driving toward a lower total cost of ownership. After completing a pilot with a competitor, MMC was ready to move forward with the competitor, but they gave us one shot to demo our solutions due to our leadership in design. After one demo, they chose our PlanGrid solution and also decided to increase the deal to include BuildingConnected, two integral parts of the Autodesk Construction Cloud.The fast ramp time and ability to own their data, no matter what system a general contractor uses, were key differentiators and they were impressed by the ease of pushing awarded bids to PlanGrid. Selling synergies between our acquired sales teams and the Autodesk sales team also showed strong momentum this year and we expect it to be a business growth driver for us both here in the U.S, and internationally in FY '21. During the quarter, one of the largest mechanical subcontractors in Australia increased their deployment of our solutions. Historically, the customer was using BIM 360 Docs on some projects and was interested in using either PlanGrid or BIM 360 on additional projects. Our team explained the value PlanGrid brings to the field and BIM 360 Docs brings to the office, highlighting the long-term vision. Wanting to make a long-term investment and recognizing the power behind the integration, the customer invested in our portfolio. As demonstrated by this example, we believe we are better positioned than any other vendor to capitalize on the international opportunity and we are aggressively investing in fiscal 21 to expand our reach globally. Other notable accomplishments of the year for our Construction business include PlanGrid delivered over $100 million in ARR, beating the target we laid out at the beginning of the year. BuildingConnected crossed 1 million users. The acquired construction solutions were included in 45 enterprise deals. The product teams rolled out a comprehensive long-term product integration plan and over 300 enhancements. I am very pleased with the progress our construction business made in fiscal '20 and even more excited to continue building our world class platform.We also made impressive strides in our core architecture market where we continue to benefit from customers migrating from 2D to 3D design. Arcadis, a global design and consultancy firm headquartered in The Netherlands, substantially increased their engagement with us this quarter as they work to become a leader in AI-driven design. Involved in some of the world's most complex projects, Arcadis is aggressively transitioning from 2D to 3D collaborative workflows using Revit, Civil 3D, InfraWorks, and BIM 360. And they are not stopping there. We are assisting in their adoption of Generative Design with Fusion 360 as they are reimagining traditional processes, like facade design, by exploring the redesign of elements without restrictions of traditional design processes and manufacturability.Moving to manufacturing, we continue to gain share and delivered revenue growth of 15% for the quarter and 18% for the year. Our advanced technology solutions are enabling our customers to migrate from traditional workflows to operate more efficiently in the cloud. We added 20,000 Fusion 360 commercial subscriptions this year, establishing us as the leading cloud-based multi-tenant design and make solution provider in the market. During the quarter, Spinner Group, a German manufacturer of radio frequency technology, invested in our Product Design & Manufacturing Collection over SolidWorks. Their decision was driven by the comprehensive value of the collection and the ability to work with just one partner versus multiple vendors for various point products. In another example, one of the world's iconic guitar manufacturer standardized on Fusion 360 for design, replacing SolidWorks and Rhino. The catalyst was collaboration as Fusion enabled them to collaborate across their acoustic, electric and PCB divisions for the first time ever. We are also seeing our leadership in BIM drive business with building product manufacturers as they need to fabricate products for buildings designed by our solutions. A multinational company, well known in their industry for drywall gypsum boards, selected our manufacturing Collection and our AEC Collection this quarter to extend their offerings from drywall to pre-manufactured building components in the industrialized construction market. Our design and manufacturing solutions enable them to develop machines and factories for production, and our AEC solutions enable them to connect and work collaboratively with their customers.Adoption of generative design is also continuing to drive business. For example, Goodyear used generative design to optimize an internally produced hand tool. They were able to cut production time, design the tool 4x faster and make the part 10x faster than would have been the case using a traditional machining process. And by combining additive manufacturing with CNC machining, they reduced their overall material costs and manufacturing time by 10x. Business results like these drove an increase in their EBA investment, as Goodyear continues to drive faster innovation in design and manufacturing. Given that we just finished the Oscars, I also want to highlight some of the success we are having in Media and Entertainment. Many Autodesk customers are recognized for their industry leading work throughout the year. One such example is Laika, an Oregon-based stop-motion animation studio, recently nominated for an Academy Award and winner of the 2020 Golden Globe for best animated feature. Laika uses the full breadth of the Autodesk media and entertainment portfolio including 3ds Max, Maya, and Shotgun Software.Now onto the progress with monetizing non-compliant users. Our ongoing investments in digital transformation have helped us significantly in this area. As one indicator of this, I am excited to share that this fiscal year we signed 62 license compliance deals over $500,000 per deal and 14 of those deals were over $1 million. This is almost three times the number we did in fiscal '19. The deals were across all regions and almost 20% of the fiscal '20 deals over $500,000 were in China. We are very pleased with our success in monetizing non-compliant users so far and this remains a key long-term growth driver and area of investment. Moving forward, one of the key steps we are taking is moving to plans for people instead of serial numbers. This will allow us to better serve our paying customers and will make our solutions harder to pirate. Plans based on named users will give our customers visibility into their usage data allowing them to optimize their license costs and enable us to better understand their needs. We moved our single user subscriptions to named users in fiscal '20 and will now transition all of our multi-user subscriptions. This will mark the final milestone in becoming a true SaaS company giving us the ability to deliver incremental value and customized services to our customers. We are also introducing a premium plan that offers additional security, tailored administration capabilities, support, and reporting. Please refer to the appendix of the slide deck posted on our investor relations website for more details.To close, I would like to look back at the last few years and take a moment to highlight what we have accomplished. Three years ago, we set a free cash flow target of $1.4 billion. This year we delivered on that target. We did what we said we would do. We are executing well and know how to adapt and flex in changing market conditions. We know how to manage our journey and have proven that with our fiscal '20 results. Looking out to fiscal '23 and beyond, I am more confident than ever in our strategy and the team executing on it. We will continue to deliver great value to our customers with our connected and comprehensive platform in construction. We expect to keep gaining share in the manufacturing market as it moves to the cloud with less siloed workflows, and over time, we are going to increasingly monetize the non-compliant user base. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on March 25th, where we will have more time to share our strategic initiatives. With that, operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Your line is now open. -- Hey, Andrew. Hey, Scott. How are you guys doing? Thanks for taking my questions here. -- Hey, Saket. -- Sure Saket. -- Hey, I'll focus my questions on some of the pricing changes here and maybe start with you, Andrew. You talked about the introduction of the standard and premium plan. Could you just dig into what types of customers you think would opt for premium and sort of broad brush how big of your base could that premium plan sort of cohort be over time? -- All right, so the standard plan already exists. So remember the standard plan is just the subscription we have today and I think one of the ways you want to think about premium is kind of like a mini enterprise agreement without the consumption element. So it's going to appeal to some of our larger accounts that get serviced through the channel and it's going to appeal to them for a couple of reasons, all right. First off, some of the things that are included in the premium plan include single sign-on support through active directory. So this is a way that the customer can manage their named user set and deploy single a sign-on across it. It's easier for them to manage the users. It's more secure because you can turn on and turn off users really quickly. So that right there is a huge benefit. The other thing we're consolidating in and this is something a lot of our customers already have is something called an ETR, which stands for Extra Territorial Rights and that is something we've always sold on top of our traditional licensing to allow them to distribute licenses to subsidiaries outside of where their corporate headquarters are, all right. So that's another thing that's included in there, obviously, another thing that appeals to larger accounts that are serviced by our channel. The other thing that they're going to get is analytics capability wherever -- all of our customers are going to get analytics capability, but what's going to show up in the premium plan is much deeper. We're actually going to be making proactive suggestions with some of the analytics about how they can optimize and get more out of their investment with Autodesk or optimize their investment with Autodesk more precisely than they do. They also get a slightly closer relationship with Autodesk through the support terms that we provide. So you can see that it's going to appeal to larger accounts. I'm not going to give you a percentage of the base in terms of what that means -- it is a good try, but you know that's who it is going to appeal to and I think you can see how we've naturally introduced it at the same time that we've introduced the discussion around ending the multi-user licensing because it allows you to manage named users a lot more effectively. -- That makes sense. And that actually dovetails into my follow-up question for you, Scott. Can you just talk about that shift of multi-user to named user licensing. I guess specifically what have your studies or sort of anecdotes shown on how many sort of named accounts there are for or named users there are for each multi-user license, if that makes sense. -- Yeah, it goes Saket and as you'd imagine that's something we looked pretty hard at as we designed the end-of-sale of multi-user and what that trade-in program would look like and it runs right around two to one. In other words, two named users end up being on average being served by one multi-user license. So that's the reason we set the trade-in program the way we did. I think for some customers they will end up needing a few more single users to support their base if they were running a little hotter than that and for some, they'll probably make the trade-in program and in the future, there may be a chance for them to either right size that or take the additional budget and hop into premium with that. So it was designed right around the average of what we see in terms of actual usage today. -- You know because you asked about that trade-in program, I just want to make sure that we're all clear about the why of that program because there's a couple of customer why's and there's a couple of Autodesk why's. From a customer standpoint, a lot of our multi-user customers already have named user licenses in their accounts. They're living in what we've affectionately call hybrid hell inside the company where they're trying to manage two types of different systems. This will put them all on our new subscription back-end. So it essentially bring all of these customers that live in hybrid environments into our new back-end and provide them all the same analytics that the named users are getting. So there is going to be a lot of customer benefits associated with it especially when you layer on premium because of the control and security it is going to give you. For Autodesk, this gets us one step further to retiring older systems that are based on serial number. Systems that kind of we have to maintain, systems that has sync issues that get in the way of us knowing more about our customers. So we're going to have more knowledge about our customers, we have more information about what they're doing and we're going to be able to service them a lot better. -- Makes a lot of sense. Thanks guys. -- Thanks, Saket.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great close to the year. I just wanted to focus in on the different industry verticals that you sell into, obviously, manufacturing and obviously there is a different sort of between geos there. I wonder if you could provide us with sort of some more color on sort of how you closed out the year there and sort of how you're thinking about the forward guidance sort of industry vertical/geo. Thanks. -- Yeah. Thanks, Bill and you may not have had a chance, I know it's a busy night for everyone, but we posted some details by both geography and by product family on the slide deck that's on the website and what you see is we were really strong in both. We were strong in all three geos, both in the quarter and for the full year and across all product sets. The one anomaly and we talked about this in the opening commentary was in media and entertainment, which actually showed a slight decline for the quarter year-on-year and that was really driven by one large multi-year upfront transaction that was done in Q4 a year ago that skewed that. For the full year, media entertainment grew about 9%. So we really saw strength across the board. Our expectation, looking into fiscal '20, I mean you can see we go from an overall revenue growth rate of about 27% this year to one that's in the 20% to 22% range next year. Part of that is there was about 3 points of added inorganic growth to our fiscal '20 numbers. So, yeah, it takes it down to about 24% compared to 20% to 22% next year, which is just the law of large numbers. In absolute terms, we see growth in revenue and a strong percent growth next year as well. Any color you want to add Andrew? -- Yeah, I mean the only color is our M&E business because of its size, just continues to be sensitive to large deals, it always has been because of its size and even the sub-segments within it are sensitive to large deals. That's just the nature of that business. -- Yeah. Got it. And then also just in terms of opportunity, the non-compliant users. Obviously, you called out some pretty significant change over, notwithstanding your Analyst Day last year, you talked about I think it was about 1.7 [Phonetic] million still in the base. When you think about just the growth that you saw in your overall user base, this year, how much of it would you call sort of just your core growth versus actually shifting those non-compliant users over? [Speech Overlap] -- Sorry, Phil. Most of it is core growth, Phil, but as I've said consistently over and over again, we're getting better and better at talking to, understanding and converting these non-compliant users. That's why we gave you some of those stats that you can understand directionally how this effort is going, Every year, it's going to continue to get better and better and better, our investment, both from a systems side and from our people side in terms of people that actually handle directly non-compliant negotiations with customers are going up. So you're going to see this consistent performance and most of that growth is just the core growth, but I hope you're getting a sense for how this non-compliant usage starts to become quite an engine as we move forward. -- I meant to say 12 [Phonetic], not 1.7 [Phonetic]. Sorry about that. All right, thanks guys. -- [Indecipherable].Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a really strong end of the year. I guess for either Andrew or Scott, curious Andrew or Scott, I think you mentioned you're taking into account the current macro with coronavirus and exposure to China is small. I guess I'm wondering how you think about the broader APAC region, Japan or other regions and sort of -- or have you seen anything yet thus far a month into the quarter. -- Yeah, I'm glad you asked this question. First off, the whole coronavirus situation is a human situation, it's kind of a human tragedy and the best thing that can happen here for all of us is that it just gets resolved and contained relatively quickly and there is a vaccine next year for the next flu season, but from a business perspective, how it impacts you depends on your business and we look pretty deeply at our business and here's kind of a lay of the land I'll give you. If you are a software vendor that's exposed to a lot of big deals from especially large industrials that have kind of global supply chain disruption, you're going to feel some effects from this, all right. That's not us. In addition, if you're in the travel industry, obviously, you're going to feel some effects from this, but here's what's different about Autodesk and here's why I want to help you understand how we look at the business and why we took into account some China effects in Q1, but we don't see longer-term effects at this point, OK. Now, I will say if this becomes a pandemic, all bets are off and we'll have a different discussion, but right now, our business is what we call almost micro-verticalized. We cut across lots of different verticals and it's not just industrial verticals, it's company size verticals. We go from the biggest to the smallest. Our business, especially in the first half of the year is not heavily dependent on large deals and large companies, particularly large industrials. So we don't see that kind of sensitivity in our business, but in addition and I think this is super important for you to understand, it's one of the great things about being an indirect company, our business happens hyper locally and what I mean by that is the borrowers, especially in APAC, the transaction with the customers -- actually new to the customers. All right, you're not dealing with a situation where people travel or there is a diaspora of salespeople heading in various directions to get the business done. Customers need our software, they need our software now and the bars are there. So this combination of this micro-verticalization that spread across various companies of various sizes and its hyper locality of our business is why when SARS hit last time, we didn't see much impact on our business, but right now, what we've done, we looked at China, obviously, we just said, all right, more China. China was already having issues as well. So we prudently looked at Q1 with regard to China, looked at the short-term impact, but we don't see right now any other impacts in our business. Of course, like I said earlier, if a pandemic hits, we'll have a different discussion, but right now, I just want you to pay attention to that notion of highly verticalized micro-verticals, different customer segments and hyper-local, which is a great advantage of where we're at. -- And Matt, if I could just tag on to that because there may be some confusion also with our Q1 guide relative to what's out there. In fact, and of course what impacts that is on guidance. On a quarterly basis, it's interesting that it shows sequential growth, the consensus does from Q4, which of course is not what we experienced last year. Since we've made the shift, last year, we saw a sequential decline and even saw a sequential decline last year despite the fact that Q4 of '19 only had a month of PlanGrid included and Q1 had an entire quarter of PlanGrid included and we still saw a sequential decline. What drives that by the way, is not a recurring revenue decline and as we look at our guide for Q1 of fiscal '21, we're not seeing a recurring revenue decline. What we are seeing is, and we've talked about this in the past, this license and other line, it's always the biggest in the fourth quarter. It has to do with largely to do with some products that we sell that -- that we sell on a ratable basis, but the accounting still requires them to be recognized upfront. So if you look at our license and other line in the fourth quarter, the quarter we just announced, it was $42 million and we think it will be about half that big in Q1. That's really what's driving the sequential decline and so without commenting on how fast that got to 910 [Phonetic]. I'll tell you it's not a -- we haven't taken into account a significant headwind from coronavirus. We expect our recurring revenue actually show slight growth sequentially again. -- That's fantastic. Great color and then maybe just one more for you, Scott, you're not guiding to ARR which I think most of us expected, given it's not a perfect metric for you guys that we saw in Q3. I'm just sort of curious if you could provide a little bit more color on that. And do you still think you'll talk to like your fiscal '23 ARR targets at some point? -- Matt, we're not talking about it and you nailed it, it's because of some of the anomalies in the way we defined ARR and we talked about this extensively on the Q3 call in relation to our Q4 guide. It was a great metric as we were going through the transition and our P&L had a mix of significant amount of upfront plus ratable if you needed to see how we were building that recurring revenue base. At this point, we've built a recurring revenue base of 96% of our total revenues, right. So doing ARR -- when I gave you an annual number was in effect saying, was the fourth quarter recurring revenue and multiplying it by four, it didn't accumulate through the year. That's why we pulled back on the metric. I think you get as good, if not better insight from just tracking revenue and knowing that 96% of that is recurring. You will still be able to calculate it by the way. I don't plan on focusing on it during these calls, but if you look at our P&L, remember the way we calculated ARR was subscription plus maintenance revenue actual reported for the quarter times four. We'll continue to reporting those line items. You'll continue to be able to track it if you want, I just think it's a less reliable metric of where we're headed in revenue or current RPO, which you see in our results, current RPO is up 23%. -- Super helpful. Well done. -- Thanks, Matt.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Good evening, Andrew, Scott, you used the word aggressively during your prepared remarks, I believe to refer to internal investments you'll be making and on that point, you now have by far a record number of openings in sales related positions. -- Do we? -- Yes, yes, by far the highest I've counted in eight years and it's for territorial account execs, named account, inside sales, license compliance and so the question is, how are you thinking about that as a principal cost driver to your expense targets this year and more importantly the production or revenue production effects that you would expect from that kind of substantial on boarding of sales capacity. Number two, you used to give a metric prior to the transition of your annual license volume and the last reported number is and the way you used to calculate it were about 600,000 licenses to 650,000 licenses. If we continue to follow that method and impute the volume of your business, you are now it seems well above those last given numbers from a few years ago. It would seem now the consumption of Autodesk product licenses including in particular collections is now in the high six-figure, so well above prior levels. So would you concur with that calculation that your intrinsic demand, consumption of Autodesk product is well above what it used to be under the old way of accounting. And then finally, with regard to the changes in pricing to a single user preference, would there be an implicit connection there, Andrew to your view of an eventual consumption model, can you get there only if you do in fact have this kind of named user pricing? -- Jay, you asked two follow-ups to the question. Okay, so first off, let me start back to your first question about investment. So I'll speak for Scott and then Scott can speak for Scott. I want to make sure you are clear, we are not losing any of our spend discipline at all, all right. We're actually investing below our capacity to kind of make sure that we're staying in line with things. You're seeing some of the areas we're investing in go to market. We're also investing in R&D. We're investing big in construction. That shouldn't surprise you, but we're also investing in fusion. We're investing in the architecture with some of the things we're doing around generative and other types of things for architects and Revit as well. We're also investing in our digital infrastructure. So yes, we are investing, all right and we said we would invest, but we're investing prudently, we're investing smartly and we're excited about it all right, because we see a lot of return from the investments we make and we've been very deliberate about this. Now, on your second point about the license growth. I'm not going to comment specifically on that, but you know I can -- one thing I can tell you is it's the lower upfront cost of our products and the way we're going to market now, it makes a difference, OK. Too many people spend a lot of time talking to the customers that were our old maintenance customers and how the transition has been hard on them and they're confused and they're not sure, but there is a whole swath of customers that are just sitting there going, how did all of this stuff get so cheap, all right and that seems to be the forgotten people and yes they are coming in, they are excited about our products, some of them are using Revit when they never thought they could use Revit or they are using Inventor, they're using Max and if you seen some of the things we've done with Max where we have an indie version of Max and I mean there is a whole gamut of flexibility we've layered out there for people that really, really changes the way people buy our software and who is buying it and who is paying for it and it is an exciting change, and yes, it has impact on it, without saying more about the specifics of what you asked for there.Now your thrrd question and I remembered all three. Now about this move to named users. It's imperative for us to try to complete the transition to SaaS excellence, to be a named user company and once you get people to named users, you are also getting them on our new subscription back-end infrastructure which is super important and as you correctly said, that back-end infrastructure provides new types of flexibility that weren't available in the previous hybrid world of dangling on some of the serial number based systems and some of the other systems. So what you're going to see over the next 12 months to 24 months is increasingly rolling out more flexibility to our customers with regards to how they can apply this named user capability in multiple ways and you've mentioned consumption, the premium plans kind of a layer in that direction. So you're right in assuming that we're going to be able to do much more flexible things with our customers as a result of what we've done. It's been a heavy lift to get here, all right. It has been an absolute heavy lift, but we're going to be 24 months from here and our customers are going to look back and say, I don't know what I was complaining about because this is a better way to engage with Autodesk. Scott? -- I'd be remiss on your first question, if I didn't add besides we're continuing to maintain spend discipline. We built it up pretty diligently over the four years of staying flat in spend and that's not going away, but I think you also have to look at the increased spend not as increased spend, but we're increasing margin. We're at a point in our growth story where we can both increase spend to drive future growth and increase margin. So we added 12 points to our operating margin in fiscal '20. You see the midpoint of our guide, we're adding 5 more points to our op margin in fiscal '21 and we've said it's going to be 40% by the time we get to fiscal '23. So the conversation around spend while interesting if what you're looking for is where we are investing, that's a good conversation to have and you should know and everyone should be confident, we continue to manage that very diligently. Well, thanks very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the time. Most of mine have been asked, but I just I wanted to follow-up on the multi-user pricing change that you had and totally understand Andrew your comments about kind of you need to go to a named user pricing model, but just wondering if there was anything you could share with us about maybe the impact that helped drive in the quarter that just ended and how you're thinking about like what has the reaction been from customers who are going to convert to this. So far what's their feedback to you on it? Thank you. -- So great question, Heather, good to hear from you. Let me give you some color here. So first off, we did increase the price of new multi-user licenses, new, all right and renew is exactly the same price, all right. So there is a 33% increase in multi-user. This is going to have very little impact on our existing customers, right. The reason we did it was very simple. Between now and May, when the two for one starts in earnest, we've now set the price so that gaming is removed from the system. So what we didn't want to see was this kind of like sudden hoarding of multi-user licenses heading into the May two for one and that's why we did this. It was basically a signal like, hey, here's where we're going, we're heading into this new direction. We did not pull any materially significant business forward into Q4. This had no material effect on our Q4 results and to be very clear, I'm going to repeat that. No material effect on our Q4 results, all right. This was purely a hygienic change to line up everything to the two for one offer. Most customers will not see a huge impact on this, except for the few that are going to be adding some multi-user licenses in there.It's really too early to hear what customer impact is. We did hear from some of our early evangelists and as a result, we were able to kind of adjust some aspects of the program and do a few things that kind of addressed some of their concerns, but so far it's too early [Speech Overlap] -- Yeah, this is Scott. I wouldn't expect a huge amount of pushback on that given that we designed it to be two for one both in terms of price if you buy a new multi-user now, but at the trade-in point, because that's what we see is the average number of single users or named users that are being served by multi-user license. So it should be fairly neutral to most of our customers. -- Okay, great and then I just had one follow-up if I may just about the construction market and the deals you closed there in the quarter, could you share with people kind of is this typically a greenfield market where there is no incumbent provider except maybe Excel or Notebooks or is this one where when you're closing business now, is there any legacy replacement of a vendor and just kind of how do you look out and see the competitive environment? Thank you. -- Yeah, you know, for the most part, you're going in and you're digitizing the process from scratch for them. Now we do have a competitor we compete with frequently. We're winning and beating them more and more and we've actually kicked them out of some of our accounts because our customers do not like their business model and that will increasingly make it easy to kick them out of our accounts. It's just not a good long-term business model. So we do have competitors that go into the same accounts, but essentially what you're doing is you're replacing analog with digital or you are replacing email on mobile devices with some kind of process and process control. Now as we get deeper and deeper into pre-construction planning, model based construction management, interdisciplinary digital twins and all of the things that kind of build out on this, you actually start to fundamentally changing the customers' processes, but, Heather, you're essentially right, you're replacing analog with digital and that's where the money is and that's where we're going. -- Thank you. -- You're welcome.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Fantastic. Thanks so much. And first, I just want to follow-up on Heather's question on construction. It's great to see the enthusiasm in Construction Cloud. Can you talk about some of the learnings from combining the product portfolio and how you'll be more competitive in fiscal '21 and also, how big of a component of your mix can Construction Cloud become as we approach your fiscal '23 target. -- Yeah, OK, Brad, so first let me ask you about the customer reaction to Construction Cloud and what are the things we learned. So one of the first things we learned is that we had a winner in BIM 360 Docs because what we did, when we were building kind of this next generation platform and it just so happens that all the acquired solutions hooked incredibly nicely into this platform which is super important because if you want to compete both inside the infrastructure business with the Department of Transportation and internationally, you need what's called an ISO compliant common data environment, which is what Docs is going to be providing for our customers. So it's actually a huge competitive advantage to have this environment and we learned pretty quickly that the work that we're doing with Docs really kind of played nicely into that. We also learned pretty quickly that we have a huge mobile advantage with what we've done with the PlanGrid products and what the PlanGrid team has done and we're leveraging that advantage and expanding it into other parts of our portfolio. We also discovered that the building network of BuildingConnected that by the way is getting integrated with PlanGrid and getting integrated with some of these other solutions is an amazingly important asset not only to our customers, but to us in terms of understanding the construction climate. We also learned what it takes to go internationally. So one of the things that we're well positioned to do better than anyone is we're investing pretty heavily in this is international expansion for our construction portfolio. Construction is an international business, it always has been, its local but it's also international and between our investment in the common data environment, go to market stand up in various places, you're going to see us start to grow internationally pretty significantly and there is nobody that we compete with that can actually do some of the things that we're doing there in terms of the construction environment. Now there was another part to your question that I want to make sure I answer it because I got carried away on what we learned. What was the second part there? Brad? -- Second part was just asking how big of a component of your mix Construction Cloud could become as we look at fiscal '23 yeah. -- Brad, thanks for that. I don't certainly want to get into giving that kind of granularity on our fiscal '23 guidance. What I'll give you is a couple of comments that we've said a few times in the past and still believe. Construction is the next $1 billion business for Autodesk and I think what you see is in the wake of the transactions we did in fourth quarter last year, we've done a great job integrating those. We haven't lost any momentum in those acquired companies and in fact have seen an up draft in our organic construction business as a result of that, so it's growing on a really nice path at this point. You've seen what the inorganic piece looks like in our results. Looking at our total cloud growth gives you a good sense because BIM 360 is the organic piece of our construction business and it's the biggest piece of our cloud results. So you get an overall sense of where construction is headed for us and it's a sizable business and we'll continue to grow, but I don't want to get into trying to give you a here is a -- let me start to break down the components of our fiscal '23 targets. -- No, that's helpful, Scott. I appreciate it and if I could just sneak in a quick follow-up for you about long-term deferreds, which were much higher than we expected just given your continued traction of multi-year, how should we think about long-term deferreds going forward, especially as you make changes to some of your multi-user products? -- Now that's a great question. So thanks for asking it and obviously the long-term deferreds are a result of multi-year, right, of multi-year sales and we said this is the year we expect multi-year sales to revert back to the mean, right, what we had seen when we sold multi-year on maintenance historically and that's what you see, one of the effects of that is of course it drives long-term deferred revenue, and that's what you're seeing in our results. I thought mid-year that this was going to get that long-term deferred as a percent of total deferred revenue would be in the mid-20% range. It's a couple of points higher than that. As we've analyzed that, again, we're keeping a close eye on how multi-year is running as we've analyzed it. Still feel like that's at a sustainable level and it's below what we saw with maintenance when we offered almost the exact same offer for three years paid upfront on maintenance, long-term deferred got up to 30% of total deferred at that point. I don't see us getting to that level. In fact, I think long-term deferred moderates a bit looking at fiscal '21 as a percent of total deferred versus where it is, but we'll stay on top of that and to the extent we need to make an adjustment in that offering, we'll make that adjustment. I certainly don't want to see that run at a level that's unobtainable or unsustainable. I think what may be implied in your question that you didn't ask is, is this going to create a headwind for free cash flow and so besides the comments I've just made on kind of the steady state that I've seen multi-year getting to, bear in mind one other fact and we've talked about this, but not since last Investor Day that as we look from fiscal '20 out through fiscal '23, more and more of our free cash flow, in fact the majority beginning this year of our free cash flow will come from net income as opposed to coming off the balance sheet and growth in deferred revenue, right. So as we scale both the top line and improve our margins out through fiscal '23, more and more of the cash flow comes right off the P&L and net income versus coming in growth in deferred. -- There's just someplace where I have to chime in just a little bit since you mentioned the free cash flow ramp. One of the things I want to make sure we all kind of like think up on here when you look back three years, here we are 2 years later, OK, the business ended up free cash flow wise where we expected it to be, the path had numerous twists and turns, numerous puts and takes. We modeled it according to certain assumptions, we've adjusted those assumptions as we went along, we have an execution machine that knows how to adapt. I just want you to remember when we give you three year targets, we are fairly confident we know where we're going and we know how the free cash flow is going to ramp and we know it's going to continue to ramp and we also know how to adjust as we execute through here and how to move forward and make sure things happen the way they need to happen and I just told you before the safest assumption is to assume we're going to do what we tell you we're going to do and if there was any kind of hidden things like Scott said in that question, I want you to know we've got our handles on the controls here for this business. -- Thank you for the very complete answer. Thank you. -- Sure, thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, thanks guys. Two questions on the construction area. Excuse me, the first one is, when you look at your solutions now, where are the biggest pockets of users in your customer base. So is a GC, subcontractors, owners, etc, just to understand where you're seeing the biggest buying power at the moment? -- Okay, right now GCs are some of our biggest customers. Subs are starting to ramp up quite significantly, all right because remember with the BuildingConnected network, we have a lot of access to subs now. So you're engaged with the subs ecosystem in a way that we were never before. GCs are the biggest buyers, but you also be surprised, interdisciplinary engineering firms are big buyers as well because of their intimate connection to construction planning processes and things associated with that, but yeah, it's starting with the GCs, but it's been moving down market quite significantly as we've matured. -- We have an example in the opening commentary about a significant subcontractor. -- All right. And then the one follow-up would be, there is a lot of components that make up that construction ecosystem from project management to bid management to the financials and etc. Can you highlight with the solutions that you have where do you think your biggest areas of strength within that group is today and directionally where do you see building out that portfolio? -- Yes, so there's two anchors of strength that we have that are pretty deep. One is field execution. We are by far massively advantaged in the field execution side. The other area closer to the front-end of the process is in pre-construction planning. There is another area where we've brought tools and capabilities close to the building information model and all the things associated with that that are pretty powerful. Now, there is one kind of thin layer of technology where we've been playing catch up and actually it's not really a very deep technological mote to be honest, but it's in project management and in project costing. That's something where we've been investing a lot of -- it's where a lot of the R&D investment has gone. That gap is closing incredibly rapidly. The team is just pounding out enhancements and that's the area we pay attention to because it's not technologically sophisticated, but it's important and it's one of the areas that we've deployed to add those things and that will allow us to connect field and pre-construction planning in a way that other people simply can't. -- Understood. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks a lot for taking my question. So maybe you could just talk about this new pricing you're doing on the multi-user to named user and maybe just frame it in the context of some of the other pricing changes you've made and in terms of financial benefit, what's kind of the time frame that you expect to see the uplift play out and should we be thinking this is kind of a possible source of upside relative to the existing '23 targets which were put out before this plan was announced? Thanks. -- So, Tyler, are you referring to the premium plan or are you referring to the new multi-user price, the question I answered earlier. The pricing on multi-user, we don't see a significant upside being generated by that. That was a tactical pricing action designed to prevent gaming as we headed into the two for one exchange in May. So it's not -- that is not an accretive change that is kind of going to drive business. The bigger story is the premium plan that layers on top of multi-user plans. That will be a long-term continuing opportunity for us and it should be one of those things that increases your confidence in our ability to hit our FY '23 targets. All right. And I think that's kind of the way you should look at it. Scott did you want to add anything? -- No, I think that's right. I think the gist of your question, Tyler, was around multi-user and we did touch on that earlier and I think the only thing I'd add again is that the way we set the price and the trade-in program around multi-user moving them all to named users was in sync with our analysis of how many named users today are being supported by given multi-users. So it should be pretty much a wash for most of our multi-user customers. -- Great and as I think about the premium plan, it sounds like that's a multi-year event. I mean as I think about the existing '23 targets, I mean those have been out there for a number of years now. Any chance that come Analyst Day that maybe we look at targets beyond that or what's kind of your -- how are you thinking about kind of long-term targets now that '23 isn't that far away? -- Yeah, I'm not -- I think I feel good about the targets we've laid out for fiscal '23, let me start there and we sort of glossed over it given all the other news that's in the environment, but I'm pretty proud of the fact that we hit the number that we laid out three years ago for free cash flow at the end of fiscal '21 which was no small task given the amount of transition we still had to go through and the changes we made in execution to get there. So we probably ought to start there, that's a big stake in the ground, a big milestone for us. Looking out to fiscal '23, I feel equally confident in our ability to hit the targets that we've got out there of $2.4 billion in free cash flow. Looking beyond that, I think we will continue to see the same trends that drive growth out through fiscal '23, of course, extending beyond that I think the relative magnitude of some of those will change obviously construction will be a bigger driver as we go further out in time. I think where we're headed with Fusion in the manufacturing world will become a bigger driver further out in time, but many of the same drivers that get us to those '23 targets will extend well beyond fiscal '23. I'm not inclined at this point to put another quantitative target out there beyond fiscal '23. -- Great, thank you. -- Thanks, Tyler.Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Abhey Lamba for closing remarks. -- Thanks, operator and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at our Analyst Day on March 25th at our San Francisco office. Please reach out if you have any questions following today's call or would like to register for the Analyst Day. With that, we can end the call.

The thesis? Enterprise software spending trends will pick up over the next few quarters, and as they do, most enterprise software stocks will head higher, too.For the record, I 100% agree with this thesis. Corporations hit the pause button on robust enterprise software spend in 2019 for two big reasons. One, they spent a lot on enterprise software in 2018 (spend rose nearly ), so there wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t a glaring need to up spend further in 2019. Two, rising trade tensions created immense economic instability, and companies didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to spend big against that backdrop.Consequently, enterprise software spend rose just 8.8% in 2019 \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 one of its weakest annual growth rates in recent memory.But, in 2020, corporations will re-accelerate their software spend, also for two big reasons. First, they didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t grow spend as much as normal in 2019, so there is ample room to re-up spend growth in 2020. Second, trade tensions are easing, stability is being injected back into the global economic environment, interest rates globally remain low, and corporate spending conditions broadly remain as favorable as they\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve been since 2017.As such, it should be no be surprise that Gartner projects global enterprise software spend to rise , up about 2 points from 2019\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s growth rate.Against that backdrop, enterprise software stocks will rally. Here are my favorite picks in the group.\tOne enterprise software stock which Wells Fargo raised their price target on and which I think is a long-term winner is cloud giant  (NASDAQ:).In the big picture, there are a lot of things to like about Adobe. The company dominates in the creative and document cloud worlds, runs at sky high gross margins, has been growing revenues at a steady 20%-plus clip for several years, and is a cash flow and profit machine. But the upside bull thesis in ADBE stock is all about the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s new growth potential in the enterprise cloud.Specifically, everything in the enterprise world is pivoting towards a focus on the consumer experience, or CE. At the same time, CE is becoming increasingly visually-focused, because visuals do a much better job at immersing a consumer than words. Broadly, then, enterprises are putting more money into creating visually powerful CEs.When they do that, they are trusting Adobe to do it better than anyone else. Why? Because Adobe has long been behind the market\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s best-in-class media creation and editing tools, and is now leveraging its expertise in creative media to built robust media-based CEs for enterprises of all shapes and sizes.This trend is just beginning. In 2020, it will gain serious momentum as enterprises increase their investment into CE. Adobe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s growth rates will move higher. Profits will keep roaring higher. And ADBE stock will .\tWells Fargo really likes shares of\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) software giant\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:). They hiked their price target on ADSK stock to a Street-high $240. ADSK stock presently trades around $195.But, can ADSK stock \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 which is already up 140% over the past three years \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 rally another 25% over the next twelve months?I think so. Autodesk dominates the AEC software vertical with widely-used and largely unparalleled solutions such as AutoCAD (used for 2D and 3D modeling) and Revit (used for Building Information Modeling). This dominant positioning means that as AEC firms up their software spend in 2020 \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 and they will, because AEC markets were among the hardest hit by trade issues \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 most of them will up spend on Autodesk services. Autodesk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s revenue, margin, and profit trends will consequently remain healthy over the next several quarters, and that will provide support for continued gains in ADSK stock.It also helps that valuation isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t that much of a problem for Autodesk. Realistically, this company is looking at over $6 in earnings per share by fiscal 2022 (current Street estimates sit around $6). Based on a 35-times forward earnings multiple, which is average for application software stocks, that implies a fiscal 2021 price target of at least $210 (keep in mind, Autodesk is almost at the end of fiscal 2020).So is $240 achievable? I think so, mostly because as Autodesk keeps beating estimates, forward estimates will move up, and fiscal 2022 earnings per share estimates will shake out somewhere well north of $6 when all is said and done.\tWells Fargo also upped its price target on cloud giant (NASDAQ:) and reiterated its \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009coverweight\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d rating on the stock. I like this call, too, mostly because accelerating enterprise cloud momentum will support huge growth at Microsoft in 2020.Long story short,  (NASDAQ:) has long been the king of the cloud infrastructure market with Amazon Web Services. But, Microsoft\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s cloud infrastructure offering, Azure, has been rapidly gaining on AWS for several years now. This culminated in late 2019, when the two services went head-to-head in a competition for a multi-billion dollar Pentagon cloud contract. Microsoft won.It was a surprise victory from a company that has historically placed second in the cloud infrastructure market. And, it marks a critical pivot wherein Microsoft\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s days as second place are coming to a close. In 2020, I expect multiple enterprises of all shapes and sizes to take note of Microsoft\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s big Pentagon cloud contract win, and choose Azure over AWS as their public cloud infrastructure provider. The more this happens, the more momentum Azure will gain.That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s great news for MSFT stock. Over the past few years, as goes the cloud sector, so goes Microsoft stock.\tPerhaps the boldest move from the Wells Fargo team in its recent software stocks update was upping its price target on big data company  (NASDAQ:) to a Street-high $200, calling for another 30%-plus upside in shares over the next twelve months.Can it happen? Yes. Mostly because the data boom is just starting.In a nutshell, Splunk helps enterprises of all shapes and sizes turn their raw machine data into valuable and actionable insights through their Data-to-Everything platform. Three big trends will promote increased adoption of this platform over the next several years.First, the volume of data globally will surge higher thanks to a proliferation of data-generating devices, like smart watches, smartphones, smart appliances, smart cars, etc. Second, the ability to generate valuable insights from that data will get better and better, thanks to things like machine learning. Third, enterprise data-driven decision making will go from luxury to necessity, as companies that don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t do it will be left behind the curve.Broadly, then, Splunk projects to go from a niche data analytics platform today, to a must-have data-driven decision making companion by 2025. This transition will power sustained long term gains in Splunk stock.Of note, in 2020, SPLK stock will be pushed higher by: 1) increased enterprise software spending trends, 2) continued migration from a legacy license model, to a cloud-based business model, and 3) a 5G boom accelerating the data growth narrative.Overall, Splunk stock looks good both for 2020 and into 2025.AS of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE.\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["(RTTNews) - Autodesk Inc.

The\u00a0\u00a0fell more than 10% in its fastest correction ever.\u00a0Long-term investors know that such volatility presents opportunity as high-quality stocks go on sale in these kinds of panicked crashes. In the words of Warren Buffett, now looks like a great time to be greedy while others are fearful.

The fears about the \"retail apocalypse\" have been overblown in general, and there are some enticing bargains in the sector.To be fair, there are  types of retail I wouldn't invest in at any price. For example, companies that own regional strip malls and retailers who sell full-price discretionary products aren't going to be found in my portfolio anytime soon.On the other hand, there are some types of retail that still have a bright future. Discount-oriented retail and experiential retail are two of these, and  Tanger Factory Outlet Centers checks both boxes. Outlets often have bargains that e-commerce retailers simply can't match, and the \"treasure hunt\" aspect of shopping at the outlets adds an experiential component.Tanger has raised its dividend every year since its 1993 IPO and is on firm financial footing. With an impressive occupancy rate of 97% at the end of 2019, and same-tenant sales that  by 1.5% year-over-year, there's no indication that Tanger's business is in trouble. Plus, Tanger's stock has been beaten down to a ridiculous valuation recently. The stock trades for about six times 2020 funds from operations and now features a dividend yield of more than 12%. To be clear, I'm not saying that Tanger is going to be a smooth ride. of Tanger's tenants may go bankrupt, and we could see a small uptick in vacancies as the retail industry adjusts to the new era. However, for patient investors, the reward potential from this financially solid REIT dramatically outweighs the risks.: When you hear that someone you know has been diagnosed with cancer, it's always good news if you learn that the cancer was caught early. In many cases, early detection of cancer dramatically improves the chances that the disease can be treated successfully. The problem, though, is that there are far too many cases where cancer isn't diagnosed at an early stage.Liquid biopsies offer a solution to this problem. They're tests that identify DNA fragments that break off from tumors into the bloodstream, holding the potential to detect cancer at very early stages. And there's one company that's at the forefront of developing liquid biopsies -- Guardant Health.The company currently markets two liquid biopsy products. Guardant360 is used to help select the best therapy for cancer patients. GuardantOmni is used by biopharmaceutical companies to help screen patients for clinical studies evaluating experimental cancer drugs. Guardant Health thinks that the addressable market for these products is around $6 billion in the U.S. alone.But the bigger opportunity lies with the company's Lunar-1 and Lunar-2 liquid biopsy products, which currently are only available for research use. Lunar-1 is intended to be used to detect residual cancer and monitor for cancer recurrence. The test could have an addressable market of $15 billion per year. Lunar-2 targets early detection of cancer and could have an addressable market of more than $30 billion annually.Guardant Health , with revenue soaring 91% year over year to nearly $63 million. I expect that growth rate will slow down somewhat over the near term. However, my view is that Guardant Health could easily quadruple or more over the next decade as its liquid biopsy products gain widespread adoption.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a big fan of the  (SaaS) business model. These companies offer investors recurring revenue, high margins,\u00a0, and (eventually) soaring profitability.Autodesk has become\u00a0. The company sells a portfolio of leading software products that enable millions of engineers, architects, construction professions, designers, and entertainers to do their jobs.\u00a0Autodesk used to sell its software under licensing deals. However, the company switched to the SaaS model a few years ago and it is just now starting to reap the benefits. Revenue is growing fast, margins are increasing, and free cash flow is soaring.\u00a0The exciting news for investors is that the transition should continue to pay off for Autodesk for many years to come. The reason is that less than 5 million of its customers have become paying subscribers. That might sound like a lot, but more than 14 million people are still using older versions of Autodesk's software. Nearly all of them will have to upgrade eventually, which provides this company with a predictable stream of demand for years to come. While the stock might look expensive at first glance -- shares are trading for more than 190 times trailing earnings and 41 times forward earnings -- market watchers predict that this company will grow its profits in excess of 60% annually over the next five years. If that number is anywhere close to accurate, then I could easily see this company producing market-beating returns from here.\u00a0Roku is one of the most exciting  on the market today. This company is sure to thrive as the streaming media market evolves around the world, allowing you to invest in digital streaming as a whole without picking a winner in the so-called . The company is off to a flying start as trailing revenues more than doubled over the last two years.On top of all that, Roku's shares look relatively cheap right now. Share prices have fallen 25% over the last three months, and Roku's biggest sin in this period was to  in November's third-quarter report.Sure, Roku isn't profitable right now. That's enough to make many value-chasing investors turn away. But Roku is running its business in the red on purpose, investing every extra nickel produced by its skyrocketing revenue streams into more research, better marketing, and new growth-promoting ideas. It's all about boosting the top line as quickly as possible while the streaming market grows up, switching into a profit-taking mode later on. Spend money today to make more money in five years, you know.That's what you get from Roku, and this looks like a great time to lock in those shares with prices down.Disney needs little introduction. It's been around for generations. It's one of the \u00a0 in the world, and it's a global entertainment powerhouse, encompassing everything from movies to TV to theme parks and resorts to consumer products like toys.Disney's brand portfolio and the\u00a0 of its product ecosystem make for a solid buy case in almost any market, but now looks like an especially good time to pick up shares of the entertainment juggernaut.First, the stock is down more than 20% from its all-time high three months ago as shares have fallen on the recent coronavirus sell-off and jitters about CEO . I'm not worried about the transition in the CEO chair. Iger has been trying to get out of the hot seat, but he delayed his move until Disney absorbed Fox and launched Disney+, which it did last November. Iger didn't catch the early bird to Boca, either. He's sticking around as Executive Chairman through next year, and he'll also be leading the company's creative endeavors.It's true that Disney is taking a hit from the coronavirus. All three of its theme parks in Asia are currently closed, and other parts of its resorts business, like its cruise line, will probably see a pullback. However, this is a diversified business, and most of the company's profit still comes from video entertainment. The effect of the parks closing is only temporary after all, and the coronavirus situation in China already seems to be improving as  has reopened most of its stores that were closed. When the parks reopen, the stock should get a jolt.The second reason why now looks like excellent buying opportunity is Disney+. You may already know Disney's trademark streaming service \u00a0in its November launch. It had already signed up nearly 30 million subscribers as of a month ago, nearly all of which were in North America. On March 24, the service is set to launch in most of Western Europe, including major markets like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Based on the U.S. launch, I wouldn't be surprised to see blockbuster numbers come out of Europe as well. That will remind investors of the potential of Disney+, which had the market so excited about the stock just three months ago, and should help the stock move back toward all-time highs again.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $197.66/share today.\n\nBecause the $185.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Five years ago, this was a $50 stock. Today, ADSK stock trades up around $200, with major growth driven by a rapid uptake of Autodesk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s various software cloud subscription services across the AEC market.\tThe big rally in ADSK stock is far from done.In 2020, Autodesk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s growth trends will remain robust as the company benefits from a rise in enterprise software spending trends globally. In 2019, enterprises stopped spending big on technology related investments amid rising geopolitical uncertainties. Now those uncertainties are fading. And as they do, 2020 corporate technology spending trends will materially improve, creating a rising tide to lift all enterprise software stocks.Looking further out, the Autodesk growth narrative will remain vigorous for several years to come. The company has established dominance in the AEC vertical, and demand for software services in that vertical will only grow over time. At the same time, the company features an extremely attractive financial profile that includes subscription revenues with 90%-plus gross margins, leaving a ton of room for positive operating leverage and huge profit growth in the long run.Net net, ADSK stock looks like a good investment both today and for the long haul.Autodesk is positioned to have a big year for one simple reason \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 the company makes its money when enterprises spend on software, and enterprise software spending trends will improve over the next few quarters.For all intents and purposes, Autodesk is an enterprise software company. Yes, some students and various other individuals buy AutoCAD and other subscriptions. But the bulk of its revenue comes from enterprises buying these subscriptions in bulk. From a customer perspective, we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re talking about construction companies, architecture firms, automakers and research facilities such as Jet Propulsion Laboratory, among various other customers.Those companies curtailed their software tech spending in 2019. After rising , enterprise software spending globally rose just  amid rising geopolitical tension and increasing economic instability. Those trade tensions are now easing, and consequently, enterprise software spending trends are rebounding. According to Gartner, enterprise software spend is expected to rise .This step up in enterprise software spend will provide revenue tailwinds for Autodesk, meaning that the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s revenue growth trajectory should remain robust in 2020. At the same time, sustained low interest rates \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 central banks globally appear committed to maintaining easy monetary policy \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 should allow ADSK stock to sustain its rich valuation (nearly 70-times forward earnings).Sustained big growth plus a premium valuation equals sustained big gains for Autodesk stock in 2020.Long term, Autodesk stock looks like a solid investment given its favorable fundamentals and financials.At its core, Autodesk provides various cloud-based software tools to AEC companies. In many of the sub-verticals within the AEC industry, Autodesk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s tools are the dominant, from 2-D and 3-D modeling software AutoCAD to the building information modeling software Revit. In other verticals, such as construction administration software, Autodesk has some of the best solutions on the market.Demand in the AEC software market is only going to go higher over time, as more and more AEC companies migrate to cloud-based software solutions. A lot of that demand will flow to Autodesk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s services. Consequently, the whole ADSK growth narrative should remain vigorous, defined by steady 15%-plus revenue growth for the next several years.Meanwhile, Autodesk sells its services in subscription packages. That means most of the revenue is recurring and non-volatile. It also means that the revenue is very high margin (Autodesk runs at 90%-plus gross margins). Further, because Autodesk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s solutions are so good, they almost sell themselves, i.e. the company isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t spending big to drive big revenue growth (operating expenses have been rising at a steady ~10% rate compared to 20%-plus revenue growth).All of these favorable dynamics (big revenue growth, huge gross margins and relatively muted expense growth) should persist. As they do, Autodesk will sustain sizable profit growth. As go profits, so go stocks, and ADSK stock will be no exception.Long term, then, Autodesk stock is only going higher.Autodesk stock looks good in both the near and long term. Near term, ADSK stock will rally on rising enterprise software spending trends and sustained low interest rates. Long term, it will power higher behind sizable profit growth. When you find a stock that looks good both today and 5 years from today, that usually means it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a good stock to buy.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ugmented reality (AR), like virtual reality (VR), is a market with a lot of hype. Allied Market Research estimates the combined market for AR and VR will reach $571 billion by 2025.\u00a0Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates the two markets will be worth $80 billion in that time frame.\u00a0That's a sizable $491 billion difference in those two forecasts!\u00a0Right now the market for VR is pretty specific: it's limited to games. AR, however, has many possible applications outside of gaming. This is partially why the market projections are so wildly different. Nobody knows for sure how large AR will be, how fast it will get here, or which markets it will disrupt.\u00a0So what's an investor to do? One idea is to buy dominant platform stocks that will be able to take advantage of augmented reality if and when the  becomes widely adopted.\u00a0Two strong stocks that come to mind are\u00a0 and\u00a0 .Several years ago,\u00a0subsidiary Google tried to introduce AR to the market with its Google Glass. The device was . It was nerdy and expensive and nobody wanted it. So that's a lesson for everybody. Augmented reality might be cool technology, but that's not enough. The device itself has to be compelling to average consumers.\u00a0Unlike Google, Apple is, first and foremost, a device company. Indeed, Apple has achieved device dominance. At the beginning of 2019, the company reported that there are  active iPhones out in the world. If we include iPad numbers, that number of active Apple mobile devices out in the world is approximately 1.2 billion.\u00a0So Apple already has the devices; now it just needs the AR.Apple's CEO Tim Cook is one of the big believers in augmented reality. In an HBO documentary, he said,\u00a0\"In a few years, we're not going to be able to imagine our lives without [AR]. It's that profound a platform.\"\u00a0 In an interview with\u00a0, Cook said, \"I don't think there is any sector or industry that will be untouched by AR.\"\u00a0With that attitude from the CEO, it's not surprising that Apple is getting ready for an AR tsunami.\u00a0In 2017 the company introduced a group of AR software development tools, called ARKit, and followed it up with \u00a0last year. These tools allow start-ups and other developers to start building AR applications.\u00a0Apple's huge ecosystem of devices gives the company a serious advantage over any rivals. Many companies, both small and large, are working on AR apps for Apple devices. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Maybe one day Apple introduces its own , or maybe it . A set of AR eyeglasses that syncs to the iPhone is a wonderful idea, if it works. Or Apple could simply use AR technology to spur its customer base into buying updated versions of iPhones and iPads. Either way, Apple should win with AR.One of the more famous examples of augmented reality is Niantic's\u00a0, the game that started a craze a few years ago. However, what's perhaps more interesting than the game itself is the AR software that makes those incredible effects possible. Unity Technologies,\u00a0recently valued at almost $6 billion by venture capitalists, provides that software.\u00a0Unity\u00a0plans on going public in the first half of 2020, according to the website Cheddar.\u00a0\u00a0Unity claims that more than half of all mobile games are built using its software, making the company a big competitor to the Unreal Engine of Epic Games. Unity has made big investments in AR and VR gaming. Sixty percent of all augmented reality and virtual reality content is made with its engine.\u00a0\u00a0While AR investors can't buy shares of Unity Technologies (yet), what we can do now is buy shares of Autodesk. Autodesk is the leading platform for 3D modeling and computer-aided design (CAD), and Unity is partnering with the company to bring AR and VR technologies into that platform.\u00a0The two companies have been collaborating for a couple of years now. Now designers, architects and engineers can take their model from Autodesk's Revit, and with one click can turn it into a real-time, 3D immersive experience.\u00a0\u00a0Aligning itself with the market leader in AR gaming software is a smart move for Autodesk. The company is a\u00a0 across the fields of engineering and architecture.In the future, augmented reality will help designers visualize a project before a lot of money is spent in the real world. Improved visualization will help speed up construction and make it less expensive. As the AR market expands and grows out of its gaming niche, Autodesk will be right at the center of one of those big shifts.\u00a0While it's still early days in the transition to augmented reality, both Apple and Autodesk have dominant platforms that give them a strong advantage over any rivals. When AR crosses the chasm into mass acceptance, both companies should be right there, ready and able to profit.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Data as of Nov. 30, 2019.Amazon still has much growth potential in its existing businesses, and it will surely continue to enter new markets and industries, just as it recently pushed into the healthcare arena.\u00a0Wall Street is modeling for average annual earnings growth of 72% over the next five years -- and I'm on board with this super-optimistic outlook.In the third quarter, online retail sales accounted for \"just\" 11.2% of total U.S. retail sales, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\u00a0So, the largest e-retailer in the United States still has room to grow in this country. A similar dynamic exists on the global level, so its international business also has robust growth prospects.\u00a0Moreover, the cloud-computing service market -- which expanded 46% in 2018 -- is widely projected to post strong growth for years to come. And Amazon Web Services (AWS), the market leader, is poised to keep benefiting. AWS is powering the company's profit growth. In the first three quarters of 2019, it contributed 13% of Amazon's total revenue, yet an outsize 62% of its operating income, according to Amazon's\u00a0. In addition, the smart-home market is in its early days, so the company's business centered on its artificial-intelligence powered assistant Alexa has huge growth potential. With a forward P/E of 66, Amazon stock seems pricey. But if we take the company's projected earnings growth into account, the stock is reasonably priced. Keep in mind that projected growth is just that:\u00a0.ShockWave might be a new name to many investors, since the medical device maker just went public in March.\u00a0The company, which was founded in 2009, bills itself as \"a pioneer in the development of Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) to treat complex calcified cardiovascular disease.\" Lithotripsy -- which uses sonic pressure waves -- has been applied for several decades to break up kidney stones, but using it to break up calcium deposits in arteries is novel.\u00a0The company currently markets three products: the\u00a0M5 IVL catheter, which is used to treat peripheral artery disease (PAD) and is sold in the U.S. and internationally; the C2 Coronary IVL device, which is used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD) and is available in Europe; and the S4 Peripheral IVL catheter. The last product, which just launched in the U.S. and Europe in November, is used to treat calcified lesions in below-the-knee arteries. The company has several catalysts for growth on the horizon: It aims to obtain U.S. approval for C2 in the first half of 2021; it recently began a CAD IV study of C2 in Japan; and it has a product in clinical development, TALV, for the treatment of\u00a0calcific\u00a0leaflets in heart valves. Management believes the company has a total addressable market of more than $6 billion. In the third quarter, revenue soared 215% year over year to $11.3 million.

This result\u00a0beat the $0.51 loss per share that Wall Street was expecting.\u00a0Autodesk makes design and other software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, entertainment and media, and other industries. The company, which was founded in 1982, is widely considered to have transformed the design industry when it brought its flagship product, AutoCAD, to the PC that same year.\u00a0AutoCAD is a leading 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting tool.In 2016, Autodesk stock -- which had largely just been tracking the market over the long term -- began to take off because investors were enthused about the company's transitioning from a licensing to a cloud-based software-as-a-service business model.\u00a0This transformation has begun to pay off, as evidenced by the company's robust recent quarterly earnings reports. Moreover, there are still many customers with perpetual licenses that Autodesk aims to convert to its subscription offerings, so this catalyst has a lot of juice left.In the third-quarter results, reported last Tuesday, total revenue rose 28% year over year to ompared with a loss per share of $\u00a0in the year-ago period.

Its prior results back in August contained plenty of good news, including strong sales growth, cash flow, and earnings.The  provider extended that positive momentum into the third quarter by announcing last week that it had again exceeded management's guidance thanks to healthy demand across its product categories and across different geographic divisions. Let's take a look at a few highlights from that report.Image source: Getty Images.Sales growth was strong, as revenue increased 28% to $843 million. CEO Andrew Anagnost and his team had forecast a range of between $820 million and $830 million, and so the actual result comfortably exceeded the high end of that guidance. Autodesk executives highlighted the broad-based nature of the demand growth, which included market share gains in the construction and manufacturing industries. \"Third quarter results were driven by all regions and products,\" CFO Scott Herren said in a press release.The company's base of annualized recurring revenue, which management sees as a key growth metric in its cloud-focused, subscription business, rose 28% to mark a modest slowdown compared to the prior quarter's 31% increase.Autodesk's earnings are still being pressured by its quick shift into subscription service plans that spread customer payments out over time. Yet its finances are improving. Operating income soared to $111 million compared to $15 million a year ago, pushing operating margin up to 13% of sales from 2%.Cash flow was another standout success, with operating cash jumping to $276 million from just $39 million last year. \"We continue to demonstrate the cash generating power of our business model,\" Anagnost said, \"and this quarter [we] drove a record [trailing] twelve months free cash flow of nearly $1 billion.\" data by .Investors didn't have to squint to see signs of robust growth for the fourth quarter and likely into 2020. Autodesk managed 30% or higher sales gains in three of its five geographic regions in Q3, and the Europe segment, its slowest, still managed a 24% increase.Meanwhile, the company's billings, which represent contracted but not yet fulfilled sales, point to plenty of revenue ahead. \"Outstanding execution,\" Herren said, \"produced billings over $1 billion, a 55% [increase].\"Autodesk's guidance updates were slightly negative but didn't change the overall robust growth picture. Sales are still on track to rise by about 26% while spending stays restrained. Billings should still increase roughly 50% for the year to over $4 billion.These trends will translate into non- earnings of between $2.69 and $2.81 per share. Yet the stronger business is showing up more clearly in Autodesk's free cash flow, which is on pace to hit $1.3 billion his year compared to $300 million last year and a modest decrease in fiscal 2018.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the last two years, the number of participants from the construction industry at Autodesk University increased over seven-fold to approximately 3,500. At AU this year we announced Autodesk Construction Cloud, which combines our advanced technology with the industry's largest network of builders and powerful predictive insights to drive more productivity, predictability and profitability for companies across the construction lifecycle.Autodesk Construction Cloud is comprised of our best of breed Construction Solutions Assemble, BuildingConnected, BIM 360, and PlanGrid [software programs] and connects these solutions with Autodesk's unmatched design technology such as AutoCAD and our 3D modeling solutions Revit and Civil 3D.The announcement included more than 50 new product enhancements across the portfolio and deeper integrations, including powerful new artificial intelligence that helps construction teams identify and mitigate design risks before problems occur.Due to a slightly greater foreign currency impact than previously anticipated and the timing of revenue recognition in the third and fourth quarters, Autodesk revised its fiscal 2019 outlook on Tuesday. The company now expects full-year ARR to land between $3.405 billion and $3.445 billion, versus a prior forecast of $3.425 billion to $3.485 billion.Fiscal 2019 revenue is now expected to advance by 27%, in a range of $3.255 billion to $3.270 billion, in comparison to the previous goalposts of $3.240 billion to $3.270 billion.Autodesk tightened its earnings-per-share guidance to a band of $0.80 to $0.85 from the previous envelope of $0.75 to $0.87.

There are 95 other companies that contribute to making the NDX one of the best-performing indexes.To help investors better understand why the NDX is known for being home to some of the most innovative companies in the world, we\u2019re highlighting six lesser known constituents we think you should get to know:While many Americans haven't heard of Baidu (), millions of people in China certainly know the name. The \u201cGoogle\u201d of China, Baidu is the most well-known and used search engine on the mainland, capturing between 70-80% of the search market share in China \u2014 which is a population of more than 850 million online users.The dominant search engine by far, Baidu was even number one when Google still operated in China. After shuttering its service, Baidu took on a similar mantle in the Chinese market and economy, bolstering its search advertising business as it added services like mobile search, online wallets, maps, music, encyclopedias, news, social media and online community tools.Started in 2000 by Robin Li, its current CEO, Baidu was founded on two principles: simplicity and reliability. Also, its name is an allusion to a Song dynasty poem written more than 800 years ago, the literal meaning of the word being \"hundreds of times,\" a representation of a continuous striving toward the ideal. Such cultural cornerstones help explain how it climbed to its marketing-leading position.Perhaps not a household name, NVIDIA () is a near-legendary brand in video gaming and various tech sectors. As a leading producer of graphics units, NVIDIA has revolutionized digital technologies in several ways, with business in artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, robotics, entertainment, and much more. In fact, in 2019 it was ranked as the No. 1 most innovative company in AI by Fast Company.NVIDIA is basically responsible for the life-like graphics you see in video games and other computing applications, having invented the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999, a technology it continues to reinvent today with real-time graphics.Apart from its achievements in business, NVIDIA has also received recognition for its support of environmental, social and governance goals. Barron's annually ranks the 1,000 largest publicly traded companies on ESG factors, and NVIDIA made the top 100 in 2019.Modeling software has been a boon for architects, engineers, product designers, construction firms, public planners, animators and other professionals. And they can thank Autodesk (), a pioneer in computer-aided design (CAD), for the tools that help them create the things they envision.With tens of products across various industries, Autodesk has helped continually innovate new solutions for designing needs. It was recognized for this pedigree of pushing the envelope when it was ranked No. 15 by\u00a0\u00a0on its list of the most innovative companies in the world. Today, besides solutions for construction, civil engineering and entertainment, Autodesk is also working in the Internet of Things, 3D printing and other emerging technologies.Autodesk has had to contend with upheaval in the software market \u2014 shifting from licensing-based sales of boxed solutions to recurring revenue through cloud computing subscriptions \u2014 but has come out in pole position.Data is the lifeblood of business today, and Verisk Analytics () lives in the numbers, helping deliver insights that drive corporate decision-making. An analytics company that focuses on the insurance, financial, and energy and specialty markets, Verisk leverages its unique data sets and extensive domain expertise to provide risk assessment, intelligent compliance and predictive analytics, among other products and services.Verisk's data assets are deep, allowing it to mine billions of insurance policy transactions and trillions in consumer spending for insights. Hundreds of subject matter experts in fields like commodity analytics and GIS mapping contribute to the vast experience of the company, as does CEOForbes in 2019.While technology has led to many social and economic gains, the new digital world is also one rife with cybercrime. With threats lurking around every online corner, organizations need rock-solid defenses to protect their data and reputations. Enter Check Point Software Technologies (), a leading provider of diverse cybersecurity products.Check Point has garnered international recognition in its nearly 30 years of operation, having grown, matured and innovated alongside the wider world of tech. Check Point has collected awards and recognition for its performance in cybersecurity from the likes of Gartner, Forrester, IDC and various other publications. Most recently, it won the Security Innovation of the Year category in the 2018-2019 Cloud Awards for its CloudGuard Dome9 platform.Founded in Israel with U.S. headquarters in Silicon Valley, the company's sights are trained on combating the fifth generation of cyberattacks.These days, surgeons need a steady hand not only when using a scalpel themselves but also when operating robotic surgical equipment. Such technology has become commonplace in the operating room, if not entirely essential to the success of some advanced procedures. In those terms, Intuitive Surgical () is helping to revolutionize health care while also improving patient outcomes and safety.Founded in 1995, Intuitive builds the da Vinci system, which since its launch in 1999 has defined and advanced intelligent surgery, helping develop minimally invasive procedures. In 24 years of operation, more than six million minimally invasive surgeries have been completed and nearly 5,000 da Vinci systems installed worldwide.Intuitive, like Verisk, is also well-equipped at the helm to navigate the monumental shifts and opportunities in health care: Its CEO, Gary Guthart, was ranked as the No. 14 most innovative leader in America in 2019 in the same Forbes list.Combined, these innovative companies along with the FAANGs, represent just over 1/10th of the Nasdaq-100.

Today the technology is expected to achieve a market value of $83 billion by 2021.So pervasive is AR now that investors can tap into the field's leading \u00a0in myriad ways, even beyond the confines of what would normally be considered the field's technology moorings. ,\u00a0for example, has acquired AR and artificial intelligence start-ups to help customers virtually try on makeup before they buy.\u00a0Below are three AR companies that likely fit more closely to what investors might consider an AR stock, so read on to find out why you should consider  ,  , and \u00a0 for your portfolio.Image source: Getty Images.No one who has considered the AR space for any length of time is surprised to see Autodesk on the list of stocks to buy. Its  provides designers and creators a platform on which they can transform 2D designs into digital models that are both interactive and immersive, creating more-compelling experiences for end users.Autodesk has a portfolio of powerful software suites to augment virtually any application, such as 3ds Max, a 3D modeling program; Maya LT game development software; its automotive modeling program VRED; and Forge, a development platform for cloud-based design.The other thing most investors will associate with Autodesk is a rich valuation. At 54 times next year's earnings, the AR specialist isn't what you'd consider a bargain-basement dweller, but analysts notably believe Autodesk will generate tremendous earnings power, forecasting earnings per share can double in just a few years' time.It's able to produce prodigious free cash flow, too, making it a stock investors should look at very closely.Facebook might not be as tangential to AR as an investor might consider Ulta to be, though it's also not as grounded in the field as Autodesk. Yet many people have likely encountered AR technology on Facebook if they played one of the games it offers, or through Instagram when they used one of the filters.Facebook has been  for years now and is looking to use the technology for more than just fun stuff. It wants to expand its application to  to everything we do, making its platforms even stickier than they already are. In the process, it looks to profit from widening the lens.Last year it began applying AR to its News Feed, and it lets businesses use it to connect to users of Instagram's Stories. Its acquisition of Oculus five years ago no doubt informs Facebook's development of AR glasses, which it is creating in partnership with .For the many public relations issues that Facebook has, it remains a leader in many different fields, and AR is increasingly becoming one of them. AR has the potential to keep Facebook users wedded to its ecosystem while monetizing them, all the while expanding the exosystem's borders.Lumentum may be one of the leaders of augmented reality that few people have heard about. But when you start delving into the space, its market-leading position in telecom and 3D sensing markets, growing cloud and 5G wireless network deployments, and an improved commercial laser business quickly cause it to rise to the top of people's list.It had some setbacks earlier this year because of trade issues surrounding its largest customer, Chinese electronics giant Huawei. But that is moving toward a resolution as the U.S. and China inch closer to a trade agreement. And other companies want to use its optical and photonics products to augment their own AR ambitions.  has been another customer that has loomed large in Lumentum's growth, and though Apple has spread the wealth by bringing in other key component suppliers such as , it's likely to move in a direction that will require it to throw more business to Lumentum.Bloomberg recently reported that Apple will be unveiling a new AR headset next year while its iPhone will also feature AR capabilities.

Tuesday's report will show whether that sluggishness continued into the summer months, and the best clue to that trend will be how management updates its fiscal 2020 outlook.

That said, Autodesk will reveal some metrics that will show whether its growth rate is holding strong as it closes out fiscal 2020. These include software billings, which are projected to rise by about 50% this year, and non-GAAP expenses, which are on pace to rise just 9%.

At this time, all participants' lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Abhey Lamba, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal '20. On the line is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO and Scott Herren, our CFO.Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. You can also find our earnings press release and a slide presentation on our Investor Relations website. And we will also post a transcript of today's opening commentary on our website following this call.During the course of this conference call, we may make forward-looking statements about our outlook, future results and strategies. These statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.During the call, we will quote a number of numeric or growth changes, as we discuss our financial performance and unless otherwise noted each such reference represent a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in the press release or slide presentation on our Investor Relations website.And now, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew. -- Thanks, Abhey. Building on our strong performance in Q2, we delivered another quarter of solid execution and results, with revenue, billings, ARR, earnings and free cash flow coming in ahead of expectations. For the first time, we delivered over $1 billion in quarterly buildings outside of a fourth quarter and our last 12 months free cash flow came in at nearly $1 billion, breaking yet another company record.Broad-based strength across our entire product portfolio in all geographic regions drove these results. We have strong momentum in construction, are gaining share in manufacturing and we continue to make strides in converting the non-paying user-base.Before we dig into details from the quarter, I want to recognize the hard work put in by the entire Autodesk team, especially our colleagues in the Bay Area who ensured that our business did not experience any disruptions despite our San Rafael office and many employees homes being without power due to wildfires in the final days of the quarter. Our business continuity planning was flawless and the entire team went the extra mile to ensure that we did not miss a beat under very difficult circumstances.Now, let me turn it over to Scott to give you more details on our third quarter results, as well as details of our fiscal '20 guidance. I'll then return with insights on key drivers of our business and provide an update on the progress of our strategic initiatives before we open it up for Q&A. -- Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, revenue, billings, ARR, earnings and free cash flow, all performed ahead of expectations during the third quarter. Revenue growth of 28% was driven by strength across the board, with subscription revenue as the biggest driver. Acquisitions from the fourth quarter of last year, contributed 4 percentage points of growth. The revenue upside versus our guidance was largely driven by deals with upfront revenue recognition, including those with the federal government or that includes certain products like Vault and VRED.Some of these transactions were targeted for the fourth quarter closed early. Overall, we're very pleased with strong execution in the quarter. Total ARR grew by 28%, which is impressive in light of a tough year-on-year compare. Our cloud ARR all grew 164% tied to strong performance in construction. Excluding $113 million of ARR from acquisitions, growth in our organic cloud portfolio came in at 35%. BIM 360 Design was once again the biggest driver of our organic cloud revenue growth with strength across all regions. Indirect and direct revenue mix remained at 70% and 30% respectively. Revenue for from our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT products grew 29% in the third quarter. AEC revenue increased 36% and manufacturing rose 15%.Geographically, we saw broad-based strength across all regions. Revenue grew 30% in Americas and APAC, while EMEA grew by 24%. Our maintenance to subscription program or M2S now in its third year continue to yield great results. The M2S conversion rate increased to an all-time high of 40%. The uptick in the conversion rate was expected as our maintenance renewal prices increased by 20% in the second quarter, making it more cost-effective for customers to move to subscription. Of those that migrated upgrade rates came in at 21% in line with expectations.Net revenue retention rate continued to be within the range of 110% to 120% during the third quarter and we expect it to be within this range in Q4. Similar to Q1, some of the deeply discounted three-year subscriptions, from a previous promotion, came up for renewal. This group of customers renewed closer to list price. And we're pleased to see the total value for the entire cohort grow.Billings grew 55% to more than $1 billion. The growth was driven by our organic business, contributions from construction, annual return of multi-year contracts closer to historical levels. We believe our customers' willingness to make long-term commitments to our solutions underscores the business criticality of our products and we are closely monitoring the rate of multiyear buying to ensure it doesn't create a headwind to future cash flows.Remaining performance obligations or RPO, which is the sum of billed and unbilled deferred revenues rose 32% and 6% sequentially to almost $3 billion. Current RPO, which represents the future revenues under contract, expected to be recognized over the next 12 months was $2.1 billion, an increase of 23%, so a solid leading indicator of the strength of our business.On the margin front, we realized significant operating leverage as we continue to execute in the growth phase of our journey. Non-GAAP gross margins were very strong at 93%, slightly up quarter-over-quarter and up 2 percentage points versus last year. Revenue growth combined with our disciplined approach to expense management enable us to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by 13 percentage points to 27%. We are on track to deliver further margin expansion in Q4 and approximately 40% non-GAAP operating margins in fiscal '23.Moving to free cash flow, we generated $267 million in Q3. Over the last 12 months, we generated a record $972 million of free cash flow, demonstrating the power of our subscription model and the strength of our products. Lastly, we continue to repurchase shares with our excess cash, which is consistent with our capital allocation strategy.During the third quarter, we repurchased 856,000 shares for $124 million at an average price of $144.49 per share. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.7 million shares for $264 million at an average price of $156.16 per share.In addition, we paid down another $100 million on the term loan associated with the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 acquisitions and intend to repay the remaining $150 million by the end of fiscal '20.Now I'll turn the discussion to our outlook. Our view of global economic conditions and their impact on our business remains unchanged from last quarter. As you'll soon hear from Andrew, customers continue to increase their spending on our products even in segments experiencing some near-term headwinds.Our full-year revenue outlook has been updated for the upside we experienced in third quarter, partially offset by the early signing of some transactions initially targeted for the fourth quarter.At the midpoint of our updated guidance, we are calling for revenue and ARR growth to be approximately 27% and 25%, respectively. Additionally, currency is now expected to drive an incremental headwind of about $5 million to our full-year revenue. We are adjusting our ARR outlook as some of the expected Q4 upfront subscription revenue was recognized in the third quarter.Additionally, fourth quarter ARR is being impacted modestly by the currency headwind. As a reminder, we calculate ARR by multiplying our reported quarterly subscription and maintenance revenues times 4. Our billings forecast is updated to reflect our strong performance and the momentum behind multiyear deals.We expect long-term deferred revenue to be in the mid 20% range of total deferred revenue at the end of the year. Strong billings and operational execution are driving the upside to our free cash flow outlook for fiscal '20, which is now expected to be $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion.Looking at our guidance for the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $880 million to $895 million and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 to $0.91. The earnings slide deck on the Investor Relations section of our website has more details as well as modeling assumptions. Looking out to fiscal '21, we expect continued strength with revenue and free cash flow growing in the low 20% range. In line with our normal practice, we'll provide a more detailed fiscal '21 forecast on our next .In summary, I want to remind everyone that since our business model shift we have moved to a much more resilient business model that generates a very steady stream of revenues, less exposed to macro swings than when we were selling perpetual licenses. We're committed to driving revenue growth while expanding operating margins. We delivered revenue growth plus free cash flow margin of 62% in the last 12 months and plan to end the year at around 67%.Overall, I'm proud of our performance and confident of delivering on our near-term and long-term targets.Now, I'd like to turn it back to Andrew. -- Thanks, Scott. As you heard, resiliency of our business model combined with strong momentum in our products and great execution by the team help deliver another outstanding quarter, despite continued uncertainty in some parts of the world. In terms of the macro conditions, demand remained relatively in line with the second quarter. The business environment and our results improved slightly in the UK and Central Europe and our commercial business in China continues to perform well, despite a slowdown in state-owned enterprises.During the quarter, Robertson Group, one of the largest independently owned construction companies in the UK to cover the entire construction lifecycle, significantly increased their adoption of our BIM 360 portfolio. The company deployed our software on over 60 projects over the last three years and estimates a 28% increase in productivity. This is an incredible return on investment. We are thrilled to be partnering with a company prioritizing such impressive continuous improvementAnd another example, one of the largest automotive parts supplier in Central Europe, nearly doubled their EBA commitment with us this quarter. With the move to electric vehicles, the customer knows innovation is needed to stay ahead of the competition. So they are investing and retooling their factory and migrating from 2D-to-3D. Our customers understand the benefits of investing in growth opportunities under all kinds of economic conditions.These examples underscore the importance of our products regardless of the macro-environment, as well as our customers' commitment to investing in technology to stay ahead of competitors.Last week, we hosted 12,000 people in Autodesk's University and customers walked away excited about our current products and our vision for their industries. In fact, 32% more customers attended the conference this year than in the previous year. Across the board, customers are looking to Autodesk to help them digitally transform their businesses and make them more competitive.Before I go into the strategic updates for the quarter, let me also acknowledge that for the fifth consecutive year, AU Las Vegas was a carbon-neutral event. This sustainable effort is reinforced and expanded by Autodesk's commitment to achieve company carbon neutrality in 2020. We're also delivering and continuing to investigate ways to help customers realize their sustainability goals through automation and insights in our technology. In fact, over the next few years, we intend to ramp up our financial commitment to this work by investing approximately 1% of operating profits in the Autodesk Foundation.Now, let me give you an update on some of the key initiatives. Specifically, our continued traction within construction gains in manufacturing and success in monetizing our non-paying user-base. These are the initiatives that continue to be key drivers of our business.In construction, the breadth and depth of our product portfolio continue to make our offerings more compelling for our customers. In the last two years, the number of participants from the construction industry had Autodesk University increased over seven-fold to approximately 3,500. At AU this year we announced Autodesk Construction Cloud, which combines our advanced technology with the industry's largest network of builders and powerful predictive insights to drive more productivity, predictability and profitability for companies across the construction lifecycle.Autodesk Construction Cloud is comprised of our best of breed Construction Solutions Assemble, BuildingConnected, BIM 360 and PlanGrid and connects these solutions with Autodesk's unmatched design technology such as AutoCAD and our 3D modeling solutions Revit and Civil 3D.The announcement included more than 50 new product enhancements across the portfolio and deeper integrations, including powerful new artificial intelligence that helps construction teams identify and mitigate design risks before problems occur.Autodesk Construction Cloud is being well received by customers and supports our long-term plan. PlanGrid and BuildingConnected continued their momentum is delivering a $113 million in ARR with growth coming from new customers as well as adoption by existing Autodesk customers.During the quarter, one of Australia's largest construction and infrastructure companies expanded its relationship with us by adding PlanGrid and BIM 360 to its existing product set. The transaction resulted in the largest new product agreement for PlanGrid globally and the largest regional enterprise deal to-date.We are helping the company adopt cloud-based technologies to improve project delivery and safety. The depth and breadth of our solutions that many other vendors in the space cannot deliver is very appealing to our customers. For example, we enhanced our relationship with EBC one of Canada's leading construction companies focused on infrastructure, buildings and natural resources by adding BuildingConnected to their existing portfolio of Assemble and BIM 360 Solutions.Our sales team demonstrated how we could help manage their systems more effectively and prepare them better for the future. We were able to meet their needs for the design and construction phases of the building lifecycle for both the commercial and infrastructure industry segments. We continue to focus our investments on infrastructure, which has performed well in prior downturns. This focus could offer us greater resiliency should the macro-environment weekend. We recently announced availability of collaboration for Civil 3D, which is now included with BIM 360 Design and enables teams to collaborate on complex infrastructure projects.We also continue to gain market share in the infrastructure space. This quarter, we significantly expanded our relationship with JR Group, made up of seven companies responsible for operating almost all of Japan's intercity and commuter rail services. As part of our strategic collaborations, all seven of the Group's companies will use our tools such as Revit, Civil 3D and AutoCAD, over competitive offerings to develop a nationwide BIM rail standard.Moving to manufacturing, the business is performing extremely well as we continue to gain share from competitors with steady innovations in Generative Design and Fusion 360. We believe a large number of small and medium-sized businesses will look to upgrade their vendor stack over the next few years, which is a clear opportunity for us to grow market share.Similar to last quarter, we had a number of competitive displacements of SolidWorks, Mastercam and PTC Creo. For instance, a 3D display designer and manufacturer in North America replaced SolidWorks and Mastercam with Fusion 360, because it integrated design and CAM capabilities.In another instance, a manufacturer of plastic machine components in the UK displaced SolidWorks and another CAM vendor with Fusion 360 in their design and manufacturing workflow. The company was attracted to Fusion's cloud-based collaboration capabilities, in addition to the integrated functionality and price point.Our success in manufacturing is not limited to, small and medium-sized businesses. We are making inroads and larger organizations as well. During the third quarter, Daifuku chose Autodesk as the best design software partner to move from 2D-to-3D solutions.Based in Japan, Daifuku is the world's leading material handling system supplier, serving a variety of industries, including the manufacturing, distribution, airport and automotive sectors. With its new EBA, the company has standardized on inventors of 3D platform and is also considering Revit for future building initiatives.We continue to invest in our manufacturing solutions. In fact, some of you might have seen the exciting news coming out of Autodesk University last week. We announced a partnership with ANSYS and our customers will soon have an option to use ANSYS simulation solutions while running our industry-leading Generative Design workflows in Fusion 360.We also announced the introduction of a new end-to-end design through make workflow for electronics in Fusion, providing key capabilities such as integrated PCB design and thermal simulation. This is something our customers have been asking for as the market for smart products continues to grow.With Fusion 360, users can take those electronic ideas and physically produced them in the same product development environment, bypassing the current disconnect between design, simulation and manufacturing that make data importing and translation necessary.Lastly, we are looking forward to meeting some of you at our manufacturing event of the Autodesk Technology Centre in Birmingham, UK on Monday, December 2, at that time you'll learn even more about our solutions and strategy in the space.Now, let's close with an update of our progress with digital transformation and how it is allowing us to monetize the non-compliant user-base. Our investments in our digital infrastructure have given us unprecedented access to non-compliant users product usage patterns. We continue to learn more about these users and are in the process of expanding our compliance programs in additional regions.During the quarter, we signed 19 license compliance deals over $500,00, including three over $1 million. The mix of deals over $500,000 was equally distributed by region. And one of the $1 million plus transactions was with a commercial entity in China.Our approach to creating positive experiences for our customers as they become compliant is paying dividends. For instance, one large manufacturer in Central Europe was paying for less than 10 manufacturing collections and had some old perpetual licenses. Our data indicated much higher usage. We worked closely with our partner and senior management at the company to identify and fix and non-compliant usage, resulting in almost a $1 million contract.The experience provided during the process has opened the door for us to discuss competitor displacement to further expand their usage and they now view us as a true partner rather than a software vendor. I am excited about our year-to-date performance and looking forward to a strong close to the year. We continue to execute well in construction and are making competitive inroads in manufacturing with our innovative solutions.I am also proud of the strides we are making in converting the current non-paying users into subscribers. 20 years ago, Autodesk was known as the AutoCAD company. Today, through the rapidly growing installed base of 3D products like Revit, Inventor, Maya and Fusion 360, we lead the market in bringing the power of 3D modeling in the cloud to all the industries we serve.We are highly confident in Autodesk's ability to capitalize on not only our near-term market opportunity, but also our long-term opportunity connected to the rise of AI driven 3D modeling in the cloud, because of this, we remain committed to delivering on our fiscal '23 goals.With that, operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open. -- Hey, Andrew. Hey, Scott. Thanks for taking my questions here. -- Hey, Saket. -- Hey, Scott. Maybe just to start with you. Just on the ARR guide and the adjustment, it sounded like there was a little bit of a tie-in with the upfront deals that's signed in the quarter. I guess the question is were these upfront deals that were originally expected to come in as subscription but then came in is upfront?I guess from an ARR perspective, I just -- I imagine signing it in Q3 as a subscription wouldn't make as much of a difference to Q4 ARR. But I'd love to just understand the dynamic there around the upfront deals this quarter and how it sort of impacted the ARR outlook for the year? -- Yes, it's a great question, Saket. Thanks for putting it out there because I think you're probably not the only one scratching their head. Here's the way you've got to think about it. The -- if you step back and think of the way we define ARR, it's actual reported subscription plus maintenance revenue for the quarter and then we annualize it by multiplying by 4.So we give you a full-year ARR number, what we're really saying is this is what we think our Q4 subscription and revenue numbers -- subscription and maintenance revenue number will be times 4. What you saw in Q3 is we had a fair amount of upside in the revenue line versus the midpoint of guide, the revenue was $18 million higher than the midpoint. Some of what drove that was upfront revenue.We always have a little bit of upfront revenue. So we have a couple of products, smaller products that under ASC 606 don't qualify for ratable treatment. So we sell them just like a subscription. They look -- the economics of them look like a subscription, the customer buys it, they have to renew in 12 months, but under 606 you have to claim all that revenue upfront.It's small products like Vault that fall in this category. What happened in Q3 is we have a handful of deals with this small product set that we thought were coming in Q4, we actually got closed in Q3. And because they upfront that revenue moved out of Q4 and into Q3 and there is no tail of it -- there is no ongoing -- all of their revenue is recognized upfront.This happens every quarter, but this was particularly magnified where we had a handful of these deals that we thought were coming in Q4, actually came in Q3 instead. So good news is Q3 looks super strong. The downside is that creates a headwind to the Q4 subscription and maintenance revenue, and therefore, to the Q4 ARR calculation.So it's kind of the combination of ASC 606 and the way it treats just a small subset of our products. And then how that gets rippled through in the way we calculate ARR which is actual reported revenue times 4.What's important to remember is a couple of things. One is the way the Rev Rec works is not necessarily, I'm not -- it doesn't reflect the economics of the transaction. We sell these on a subscription basis, they look just to our customers just like any other subscription. So this change in ARR isn't reflective of any kind of change in the overall economics of our business.I think the second is, when you peel back the growth that we're going to see in subscription revenue this year, and you can derive this from the guidance we just gave you, Saket, we see subscription revenue continuing to grow for the full-year, right? Because that's an accumulated metric, it's Q1 plus Q2 plus Q3 plus Q4 when revenue moves across quarter lines, it doesn't matter when you aggregate to the full-year.For the full-year, we see subscription revenue is growing in the 29% to 30% range. So still feel strong about that, we just got this anomaly between kind of the way 606 treats a small subset of products and how that gets reflected in our ARR. That's what you see in the ARR guidance change. -- Yes, sure. That makes sense. It sounds like those Vault deals where maybe term subscriptions, which under 606 kind of requires that that upfront...? -- Yes. It has more to do with the product, Saket, than the way we sell them. We sell them just like we sell every other product, 12 months -- you -- they pay us upfront, they get access to the product. At the end of that 12-month period, they either renew and continue to use the product or they don't renew and they lose access to the product.So it's really transparent to a customer. It's more -- some of the details of the offering itself under 606 don't qualify for ratable treatments. -- Got it. If I can -- if I can ask a quick follow-up for you. Andrew, just to get off accounting. I mean really interesting development in the CAD market just with more talk about SaaS adoption. Obviously, we Onshape got acquired and clearly you compete here with tools like Fusion 360, but curious how you think about SaaS adoption in CAD? And what if anything that deal could mean for Autodesk competitively? -- Yes. First off, let me just kind of say that I have a lot of respect for Jon Hirschtick and the work that he's done over the years. I have respect for Jim Heppelmann in the work is done in the past and I think they're important forces in this industry, but the way this is all coming down and characterized is just off.Okay. So let's talk about what we all agree on and what's happening -- what's really happening in the market. So here is we all agree on, multi-tenant SaaS is the future of our business. It just is. It's the future of the entire software business. I've just been saying this for seven years now. Okay. Seven years and we've been executing on it for seven years. Fusion 360 is a multi-tenant SaaS offering. Okay. With the SaaS business model. Here's the other thing we agree on. What does the SaaS mean? It means three important things. All right. Data, the cloud is going to revolutionize data flow in the manufacturing and product development industries. It's just going to revolutionize. Multi-disciplinary data flow, data flow across various parts of the supply, it's just going to revolutionize data flow. Compute, compute power. We're able to deploy compute power through the cloud in ways we've never been able to follow [Phonetic]. We do a generative design that's all computed off the desktop. It's all -- that is all a cloud compute exercise. And then the last thing, I think we all agree on that we don't all talk about this equally, and some of us aren't actually executing on it, is that we can layer machine learning on top of this data layer and with this compute and we can start doing predictive analytics and all sorts of predictive and insight -- and insightful studies on top of what people do. And some of our Generative Design algorithms already incorporate machine learning with regards to how they integrate CAM.So we all agree on that. All right. It's been uniform grid and we're all building that to some degree. We're all I think quite a bit ahead and I'll get to that in a minute. But here's is what we don't agree on is how you do it. All right. And there's a big difference here in the way Fusion and Onshape works. Fusion is taking the strategy where we have a thin client, which is a browser and we have a thick client which is installed on the desktop and works on that cloud data layer.The thin client, the thick client see the world exactly the same. They can't operate without the cloud behind it. They're dead without it. The reason we have the thick client is we're solving an additional problem if there's end-to-end workflow, all the way from design to CAM, electronics and all these things. So we're putting a huge amount of power in there that you want to -- that you want to get in there in order to solve the bigger problem.Onshape put CAD in the browser, a thin client. We knew from our thin client experiments early on, which were like five to seven years ago, that don't work. Okay. That both don't float. And one thing, we've just seen from this acquisition is we were right. What was Onshape installed base? Eight years into this experiment, 5,000 subscribers.We did more than that. We added more subscribers to the Fusion base in Q3 than that entire installed base. So, we're talking tens of thousands of paid Fusion subscribers and we're talking about 5,000 subscribers for Onshape. We know exactly why, because that thin client only solution doesn't work, you need a thin client and a thick client. Sure, the thick client will probably get better over time, but that's what you need today and you also need the new business model with a different prices and the different options.So, we just have a different view of how to do it and we're pretty convinced, we're way ahead. I think the data now -- now that we can see the data, we are now confirming that we're way ahead, but that's kind of where we're at. We all see the world the same way, we're executing on a differently and the market is voting with its wallet. -- Very helpful, guys. Thank you. -- Thanks, Saket.Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Yes, thanks. Hi guys. I'm wondering at this part of the transition, you mentioned the increase in the maintenance pricing, but what are the additional levers that you have to drive increases in ARR growth on a dollar basis moving forward? -- Sterling, it's a along the same factors that we've talked about, right? So obviously the renewal base continues to grow. That renewal base comes to us at a better set -- price realization than that new does. We continue to drive growth out of construction. I mean you saw -- we gave you some of the data points, both in the opening commentary and in the press release. Construction business drove $113 million of ARR in the third quarter.So we continue to see strong growth there as well. Well, the core basically grows to a certain degree every year, which I'd say 6% to 8% growth in the core every year. So it's the same factors we've always talked about that will continue to drive that growth. I think one thing to bear in mind, we now are in year three of the M2S program and remember the very first cohort of M2S customers we signed, we've locked in their price for three years, but then at the end of that time we said they reverted to the terminal price which for that set of customers will be about 11% price increase.We begin to see the front edge of that even for the M2S base that's been locked in. So we'll start to ripple in in the second quarter of next year. So we'll -- besides just our annual price increase rhythm that we've gotten on there is a few embedded price increases that will be coming through over the next few years as well. So, piracy recapture, construction, renewal base growth and some embedded price increases as well drive a longer-term. -- Got it. And then the one follow up would be you kind of surpassed already what you expect in terms of long-term deferred as the mix. You talked about the percentage of multi-year deals. What I'm kind of curious about is what is the collection terms that you're offering to drive some of the collection of these multi-year deals? -- Yes, it's a standard three years upfront,10% discount. I think you see most companies that sell on a annual subscription basis will offer that kind of a 10% is obviously a bit better than the cost of money over three years, but not a whole lot more and there is no extended ARR terms. There's nothing else that goes with it.What I'd say just to perhaps get it what's underneath your question, Sterling, is we're monitoring that very carefully. And one of the reasons that I went ahead and gave you some headlights on fiscal '21 both revenue growing in the low 20% range and free cash flow growing in the low 20% range, is that I didn't want there to be this building perception that because multiyear is reverting to the mean. But that was some operating a headwind that we wouldn't be able to see the same kind of free cash flow growth next year.Obviously, it's an outsized growth this year going from $300 million of free cash flow in fiscal '19 to $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion this year, but we see that growing another 20% next year in fiscal '21. So we're monitoring the multi-year -- the percent of sales multiyear very closely and if we see it begin to run through hot, where we think it's not sustainable, and it will begin to create a headwind we'll modify the offering. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Thanks, Sterling.Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on good quarter. Just a question on the next year's outlook, just building on your comments just now. When you think about the macro comments that you've made in terms of just geographies, as well as the different verticals? How do you think about the puts and takes for 2021? And then just one quick follow-up to that. -- Yes. Did you say for '21. Yes, so first off, Phil, let me comment on kind of what -- how we do things, since we talked last quarter. There really hasn't been a fundamental change in our view of the market right now. In fact, a few things got a little bit better. All right. That the UK and Germany are still performing below our expectations, but they are growing and they showed a slight improvement in Q4 -- I mean Q3. I can't see that far in the future yet.In Q3 relative to what we saw in Q2. The same goes for China. We're still not doing any business with the state-owned enterprises. But the business continue to grow just below our expectations, so we actually saw a little bit of a firming up. Not a deterioration in the business, which is a good sign.Now as we look into next year, we're not seeing any fundamental change in the places where we've seen weakness. But more importantly, there is a trend going on that I want you to pay attention to, which is a tailwind for us as we move into any situation that we see in the next year and how we feel about next year. People are moving more and more rapidly to the model-based solutions we're deploying and the cloud-based solutions we're deploying because they see those is fundamental to their competitive shift, their competitive dynamics.We're seeing continued acceleration of BIM that is going to continue into next year. BIM mandates, BIM projects specs, especially going to continue. Inventor and Fusion 360 are growing as we head into next year and the momentum on construction is solid. In addition to that, one of the things that we always see as anti-cyclical as we head into any kind of environment is infrastructure. And over the last year, we've been investing in infrastructure capabilities in our product and a lot of those are going to show up next year and they are going to show up, both with regards to some of our construction portfolio and some of our design portfolio.So we feel pretty good heading into next year and that's one of the reasons why in the opening commentary we affirmed this low single-digits growth in free cash flow for next year. -- Low 20. -- Yes, low 20. Didn't I say low 20s, sorry. Thank you for correcting me. That would have been -- that would have definitely upset somebody. The low '20 -- the low 20% cash flow increase year-over-year. -- Great. That's great color. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on that for Scott, obviously you're not guiding to operating income or operating expenses, but also just help me think about sort of the framework for next year, because obviously this is an investment year plus acquisitions just high-level, give us your thought process on just the expense side? And then I'll go back in the queue. Thanks. -- Okay. All right. Thanks, Phil. On that one of the things that we've said is we expected growth -- spend growth and also COGS plus OpEx between '20 and '23 to be in this high-single to low double-digit range. If you look at the growth we had this year, spend growth in the guidance will be about 9%, but the overwhelming majority of that came via acquisition.So the organic business has been roughly flat now for about four years and there is some pent-up demand for increased sales capacity for continued investment in digitization. So, what I would model for fiscal '21 is something toward the higher end of that low single to double-digit -- sorry high single to low double-digit range. So closer to the low double-digit range for fiscal '21, but then averaging out in that high single to low double throughout fiscal '23. Does that get at what you were asking about? -- Yes. That's perfect. Thank you very much. -- All right. Thanks, Phil. -- So we're experiencing some digit dyslexia here.Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great, thank you. I guess just twp quick ones. But one, just following up on what Phil was just talking about. If you look out to next year, would you say that the environment that you're expecting the environment to be stronger, weaker or the same than what you had this year when you're thinking about the puts and takes of everything you were just talking about?And then just was wondering how do you think about, in the context of what you were just saying about expense growth, how do you think about managing operating margins if the macro-environment did start to go against you? I'm just trying to think about the trade-off between driving growth versus protecting margins, if you can just share with us your philosophy there? Thank you. -- So we absolutely expect things to stay fairly consistent heading in the next year. I'd like to highlight the counter-cyclical aspects of our business right now, with regards to BIM mandates, with regards to the momentum around displacing SolidWorks and Mastercam in smaller accounts for Fusion, with regards to digitization in construction, with regards to infrastructure, because these are important things to keep in mind. But our assumptions into next year is these places where we saw our soft are going to continue to be soft, relative to our expectations. And we're going to continue to see kind of the same thing heading into the rest of the markets.I'll let Scott comment on the investment model. -- The only thing I'd add to what Andrew just said before I jump in on spend management, is we do think by the way, there continues to be an accelerating opportunity that's not necessarily tied to overall macro spend environment in areas like construction and the momentum that you see us gaining in piracy recapture. On the spend management question, Heather, you've seen us really exercise good spend management muscles for four consecutive years at this point.I feel good about our ability to do that. I had mentioned that there is pent-up demand for spend, there is, but to the extent that we see the business beginning to trend lower than what we expected, of course, will tighten up on that front. I think it's a muscle that we've built that doesn't -- it's taken time, it doesn't go away overnight.So I think you can expect us to continue to be diligent on spend management. That said, with the revenue growth we're expecting next year, we will not only grow revenues, we will be able to grow spend and expand margins. We are expecting expanded operating margin next year versus this year. So I think we're pretty well-positioned from a spend management standpoint next year. -- Great. Thank you. -- Thanks, Heather.Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good evening. Andrew, I was pretty intrigued by your several references to infrastructure, which is a business that as you know at this point of time, the company broke out and it looks as I would still about a quarter to a third of your total AEC business, even after including ACS. And so I'm wondering if that's a business that you might revert to reporting out in some way.And also just talk about what you think the growth potential is of infrastructure as a proportion of the total AEC revenue? And then as a follow-up longer-term question is well regarding your sales mix. That is to say, you 50-50 mix expectations of direct and indirect, we have direct potentially be in the store on that point, could you talk about whether you're still confident in the stores becoming half of half or a quarter of the total? If it -- what are the limitations you think or risks to that trajectory of growth for the store and if it doesn't come through how are you thinking about reverting spending or redirecting spending and sales development back toward named account direct and the channel? -- Yes. Okay, so you asked a couple of questions there. So let me start on the infrastructure question. So, no, we're not going to be breaking out the business or providing any more color on what percentage, but what I can tell you is that we've made some deliberate investments in rail and road. Some of those have already showing up this year, more are going to show up early next year that are targeted at where we believe some of the sweet spots in spending are going to be in areas where we have strength.You might have also noticed that we moved Civil 3D into the BIM 360 Design environment. So now the same collaborative power that we have on Revit models is available for Civil 3D models. That's important. That was something that customers were looking for.And another thing we're doing that you'll start to see progress on is this notion of a common data environment, which is really important to infrastructure projects and it's important to particularly infrastructure projects in Europe, but even in the US. People are really, really interested in these ISO compliant common data environment that's going to be showing up really soon as well. So we've made some clear targeted investments that we believe allow us to go where the real opportunity is in that space. And on top of that, if you've been following what's happening with InfraWorks that product has really grown up, and its integration with Esri and some of the things we've done there are actually pretty compelling and pretty interesting.Now with regards to the long-term targets. All right. So you're right. Right now that we're at 30% between direct and indirect. And the reason for that is not the store isn't growing. The store is growing a lot. All right. It's still our fastest-growing channel in the company. Okay. So our digital direct channel is still the fastest-growing channel in the company, say, well it's the fastest-growing, why isn't it showing more progress toward the goal [Phonetic]. The true the matter is, is if the channel grew well too. All right. It's a -- it grew robustly and I think we should all celebrate that. And at the same time, what happened is because right now the store is essentially majority an LT channel. It's not totally true because we sell the whole portfolio there and we capture a lot of construction solutions digitally direct. It's margin neutral, right now. Because the margin we make off of LT through the channel and through the store is the same. So we're getting the same economics. Now, that said, I'm not backing away at all from the 50-50 split or the 25 for -- the half of that direct being from the digital direct channels. We're still going to achieve that.Remember, I always characterize that as a long-term target and there's lots of things that haven't lit up yet that are going to help with that. Things associated with piracy recapture, things associated with construction there's a whole set of things over the next few years that are going to going to tip the balance on that number. So we're still confident. We're getting the economics we want. So we're getting the price realization we want, especially on the things that would most likely go digital direct. So we are still committed to that mix long-term. -- Okay. Thank you. -- You're welcome. -- Thank, Jay. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The results of converting non-compliant users was impressive. I guess first of all, was this the best quarter for converting these non-compliant users? And then on a go-forward basis, should we expect more of the same of this cadence or are there in fact either additional steps that can in fact convert even more of these users? -- So, Matt. Here's a few things I want to kind of characterize here. First off, we're absolutely on the plan that we always intended for this model. Every year, we're taking a set of steps that we believe are going to materially improve our penetration into the non-compliant base. And every year, there'll be a set of new steps that we believe will provide some additional ramp up in that space as well.So what did we do this year? We've rolled out in-product communication and tracking of how the pirated user journey -- the non-compliant user journey through the life cycle of learning they're non-compliant and what options they take as they travel through that cycle.We introduced those things. We rolled it out throughout the year across more and more countries. And yes, we're seeing results that we expected, primarily through two things. One, we're increasing better leads to our inside license compliance teams and we are converting people digitally as well through some of the digital communication, but the digital communication also creates these better leads. To put in context, so that you kind of get a sense for what happened, last year we did 21 deals over $500,000 in probably whole entire year, 21 deals. In Q3, alone, we did 19 deals over $500,000.So you can see, yes, we are seeing increases in momentum and there is a whole slew of things that we'll talk about later, that we'll be doing next year that will provide us to not only get even more intelligence on this space, but make it more challenging for the base to jump to another pirated solution. Okay. And that will be a discussion for later, but this is to plan. Every year there is something that rolls out and every year, we seem to be getting the results that we want from this program. And given what we know we're doing next year. We feel confident we're going to continue to get the results we expect to get. -- Super helpful, Andrew. And then maybe, Scott, just a quick one for you. On the multi-year renewals, it is good to hear that these are renewing closer to list price. Just a quick question, I wonder if you could comment on the churn you're seeing for these is about what you expect that? Just that piece would be helpful. -- Yes. Matt, it is. And to be clear what I was talking about is, if you remember in Q3 of fiscal '18, as we started down this path of selling nothing but subscriptions. We offered a promotion for legacy customers, turn in your perpetual license and for a 50% discount you can get three years at the same product on product subscription.That was actually quite a successful promo. If you remember, we did over 40,000 of those that three-year term came due during this last quarter, while we saw we expected there to be a higher than normal churn rate and we did see that, but the aggregate value of that customer set actually grew.So I think the promotion was quite successful. It got people to try, to move over to the product subscription and the aggregate value after renewal, and they renewed closer to list, not at the 50% discount, grew over that time-frame. So it was successful, but it did create a little bit of a headwind on our volume renewal basis.Remember we started... -- On a unit basis. -- On a unit basis. Remember, we started talking about renewal also as net revenue retention rate or sometimes, I'll call it in NR-3. And our NR-3 for the quarter continued to run in that 110% to 120% range overall. So this was a -- it was accretive to that metric. -- That's great. Well done, guys. -- Thanks, Matt.Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Hamza Fodderwala in for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking my question. So I just wanted to go back to the fiscal '20 ARR outlook. So it looks like it was lowered by about a 1.5 at the midpoint. Part of that was FX and some of that was upfront revenue. Any sense that we could get for the magnitude of the greater upfront revenue? Because I mean to me, it seems like the macro situation in Europe and North America was sequentially better. So I guess why wouldn't that carry forward into Q4 and reaffirm the 25% to 27% growth outlook that you gave last quarter? -- Yes, Tom, the amount of upfront revenue that moved from Q4 back into Q3 was about $5 million. So that was -- that contributed to the upside in Q3 revenue, but remember, the way we do our subscription revenue times 4, that's that by itself was a $20 million headwind to ARR in the fourth quarter. The fact is -- remember though that's upfront revenue.So there is no tail of deferred once we put that in. And because of 606, we have to claim all our revenue upfront. There's no Q4 impact of those. It just moved from Q4 back into Q3. But you see the full-year revenue, we see we've guided that point up because float revenue is an accumulated metric, it's Q1 plus Q2 plus Q3 plus Q4. ARR is just take the snapshot of Q4 subscription and maintenance revenue and multiply by 4. So $20 million -- the midpoint of that ARR guidance change was $30 million, $20 million of it was just driven by this effect. It was about $5 million of incremental headwind from FX and about the same amount of just product mix. Does that -- is that clear up -- does that clear up in your mind the move from Q4 back to Q3 and why it's an impact to ARR? -- Yes. So I guess ex-those changes would ARR growth have been sort of reiterated if it wasn't for those one-time impacts? -- Absolutely, yes. Yes, exactly. And the interesting thing about this, Tom [Phonetic] is the economics of our business, by the way, are completely divorced from the Rev Rec issue that we're talking about here. The economics of the business are unchanged, it's just between having to claim that as non-ratable upfront revenue and moving it back into Q3 and the way we define ARR as quarterly revenue times 4, it's that combination that drove the change in Q4. -- Yes, this is an interesting collision between the way we define ARR and the 606 accounting rules. -- Yes, it's always exciting. So I guess, just I had one quick follow-up. So the billings obviously came in much stronger than expected. To what extent is the shift to multi-year deals performing better than you expected coming into the year? And should we expect that long-term DR mix to continue trending higher because it's already kind of around the mid 20% range of total that we've seen historically? That's it for me. -- Okay. Yes, thanks for that to billings growth of 55% over a $1 billion of billings in Q3, super strong. The biggest factor driving that is the growth of our renewal base. It has nothing to do with multi-year. It's just the overall growth the renewal base. Beyond that the contribution from our construction business. Construction continues to perform really well.With the noise around the ARR guide, we haven't really focused in on the success of our construction business as much as we probably should have. It continues to perform really well and it's driving upside to our billings as well. Both year is part of it. And you're right. We're already at long-term deferred at about 25% of total deferred.If you go back historically, by the way back into the fiscal '17 and '18 before we began this transition, long-term deferred ran as high as 30% of total deferred at one point, I don't think it gets back to that level. I think we keep it in this low to mid 20% range in terms of long-term as a percent of total. To the extent that it ran hot, and I said this earlier. In other words, we were selling more multi-year than I thought we could sustain longer-term.I'd like to make a change in the offering. What I don't want to do is drive volatility and free cash flow, because of the offer we've got out there for multi-year. At this point, I don't think we've done that, but if it's continuing to accelerate. That's something we take a look at. -- Got it. Thank you very much. -- Sure.Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks so much for fitting me in. Andrew, you highlighted the launch of Autodesk Construction Cloud at AU this year. What excites you most about the offering, how is the customer feedback into the launch and how do you see it driving growth next year? -- Yes. You know what excites me a lot about this is the way we're unifying the whole entire stack around this common data environment and it -- it's a real great return on the investment we made in BIM 360 Docs to that entire environment is becoming the common data environment and PlanGrid integrating into it, BuildingConnected integrating into it. The existing BIM 360 stack is already integrated into it and everybody is looking at this inside internally within the development and are saying, wow, this is an amazing opportunity for us to bring these things together. So the whole ability to have a conversation with the customers about, here is the umbrella brand and how we're bringing all these things together, so that they actually communicate is a really exciting part of this. And I think it's going to come rapidly and customer is going to be delighted. When we rolled it out, there were 50 new enhancements and there is a reason why those 50 new enhancements were in there is because we invested an acceleration of the integrations with respect to some of these things. We're moving faster not slowing down.I'm really excited about the pace of what's going on. I'm excited about what the team has been doing. And I'm frankly excited about how well we are winning in the market. People look at what we're doing. They look five years out at the landscape and they say, OK, I'm going to placement that with Autodesk, and I think that's a credit to the team and I guess credit to the momentum they've kept in here. And I think the whole story around Construction Cloud and the way they rolled it out and told it at AU is really a great piece of work by the teams. So I'm really proud of them. -- Awesome. And Andrew, if I could just add another one for you, your results seem to demonstrate continued success in executing on M&A, how should we think about your appetite for additional deals in both construction and manufacturing? -- Well, we've always said that as we look out to the business, we'll continue to be as acquisitive as we were in the past at the very least. I -- we always look at market for organic and inorganic opportunities. Right now, we feel like our construction portfolio has most of what it needs, we're partnering aggressively. We could potentially do tech tuck-ins around the construction solution.As we look into other parts of the market, we'll just have to wait and see. What you see is we've demonstrated an ability to capture significant inorganic targets, integrate them and turn them into results. And I think that's one of the things you should notice regardless of whatever we do in the future that we have become a serious machine around, focusing around what are the real inorganic opportunities, how do we bring them in, and then how do you make them successful? And that's our commitment to our customers into the market. -- Excellent. Thanks so much. -- Thanks, Brent.Thank you. And our last question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Building of the last question about the Construction Cloud announcement, it sounds like it's more of a branding -- grouping all your portfolio of products. What was some of the initial customer feedback that you heard? -- Yes. So, the customer feedback has been really solid and here is why. The customers don't react to the branding. They don't spend a lot of energy on that. What they do is they react to what we do. All right. So we like the branding because it helps us communicate simply. We were not propagating multiple brands out there. It allows us to focus our go-to-market efforts, allows us to communicate more precisely the company. The customers pay attention to what have you done for me? And what they were excited about at the Connect and Construct event and all the discussions there, is the feature velocity.All right, they're seeing us delivering on the integrations we said we were going to deliver and they are watching us closely. All right. Every quarter, they're going to see, that do we do we said we were going to do, do we do we said we were going to do. So that's what the customers are excited about. They really love the fact that we're integrating to a common data environment and we're building an ISO standard, accepted common data environment, that's something that everybody gets a thumbs-up on.They're really excited with the increased scalability and performance on BIM 360 Design, which was an area where they were kind of pushing on us a little bit. So those are the kind of things that customers are paying attention to. The branding makes it easier for us to tell the world what we're doing. So that you're going to see us basically amplify that. But the customers care about what we do, not what we say. -- Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you. -- Thanks, Jason.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $157.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.95.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $157.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $153.55 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $165.19/share today.\n\nBecause the $157.50 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $165.19/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $167.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.03% if the stock gets called away at the January 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $167.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $167.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 848 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new January 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $145.00 strike price has a current bid of $24.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $145.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $120.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $147.34/share today.\n\nBecause the $145.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 16.90% return on the cash commitment, or 7.27% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc, and highlighting in green where the $145.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $160.00 strike price has a current bid of $26.00.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $147.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $160.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 26.24% if the stock gets called away at the January 2022 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $160.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $160.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 42%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 17.65% boost of extra return to the investor, or 7.60% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 38%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 37%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $147.34) to be 37%.

The stock  after the company's recent earnings report topped estimates and it provided better-than-expected guidance for its fiscal first quarter, but the stock is still down more than 50% from its peak in 2018, meaning investors may be asking if there are more gains to be had.Nutanix may be starting to convince the market of the wisdom of its strategy of moving from hardware and appliance sales to a cloud-based subscription business, but skeptical investors may want to look at recent history in the tech world, as a number of companies have made a similar transition. The best example out of all of them may be\u00a0, the maker of popular programs like Photoshop and Dreamweaver, which transitioned from selling boxed software to cloud-based access to such programs several years ago.Though the move was challenging at times and Adobe experienced several quarters with declining revenue growth, the decision has clearly paid off. Over the last five years the stock is up nearly 300%, and the company is generating record profits.\u00a0Nutanix CEO Dheeraj Pandey sits on the board of Adobe, and sees the software giant as a model for his own company's move to the cloud, telling me that Adobe's experience served as a model for ,  and several other companies, and added, \"There's a lot to learn from them.\"Image source: Getty Images.Adobe launched its Creative Cloud in 2012, the subscription-based version of its flagship Creative Suite, which includes well-known applications like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver.\u00a0However, soon after that launch, its revenue and profits plunged, as the chart below shows. data by After the announcement came in April of 2012, revenue growth almost immediately began to fall, and operating income declined by two thirds by the end of that year. That's in part because the adoption of the subscription model tends to delay revenue collection, as it comes in every month rather than in annual lump sum payments when customers by new products.The following year, in May of 2013, the company doubled down on the strategy, saying it would only make updates to its Creative Cloud product and would not release any new versions of its Creative Suite, the equivalent boxed software sold in stores. As you can see from the chart below, the stock surged through 2013, even though revenue continued to fall and profits remained down. Taking a longer view, the shift has clearly paid off. data by Revenue has been growing by 20% or more for several years now, and operating income is up about 150% from where it was before Adobe transitioned to the cloud. Best of all, the stock is up nearly ten times from where it was before the Creative Cloud launch.While Adobe,\u00a0, and others have proven the wisdom of converting from a physical software model to a cloud-based one, Nutanix faces an additional challenge: The company is transitioning from being a hardware seller to a cloud-based software seller, a move Pandey said that no other company has done before.As Nutanix's latest report indicates, the company is still in the middle of its transition as revenue declined in the quarter, and Nutanix has not posted a profit as a publicly traded company -- unlike Adobe, which was solidly profitable before, during, and after its transition.However, Nutanix did show off some promising signs in its latest . The company said that its backlog had increased by more than 150% from the previous quarter, a sign that its new product offerings are starting to catch on with its customers. Deferred revenue, another representation of its order pipeline, was up 44% from a year ago to $910 million.It may take a few quarters for the backlog to become visible in other financial metrics like revenue, but those numbers indicate that Nutanix is on the right track. Considering the lofty valuations of many of its SaaS peers and the fact that the stock could double just by returning to its former heights, Nutanix appears to offer considerable upside potential after its latest report showed the beginnings of a turnaround.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's exactly what's happening right now with Stitch Fix, the customized, on-demand styling service that is disrupting the $342 billion U.S. .Since its recent peak on July 1, the stock has fallen about 40% even though there's been little direct cause for that slide. Instead, investors seem to have fled because of the same fears that have dogged the stock since its 2017 IPO: the simmering trade war with China and 's interest in the customized clothing space.Both of these threats seem overblown. A trade war with China and the tariffs that would come with it could actually help Stitch Fix. Much of the U.S. apparel retail industry is already struggling, getting pressured by growing e-commerce companies like Amazon and Stitch Fix, and has found itself with an excess of stores. Therefore, tariffs are more likely to have a damaging impact on Stitch Fix's bloated competitors than on Stitch Fix itself. A full-on trade war could help drive a number of Stitch Fix's competitors out of business.In the case of Amazon, the e-commerce giant has loomed as a threat to Stitch Fix for a while with programs like Prime Wardrobe, and it just launched its own copycat styling service. However, apparel has proven to be a challenging business for Amazon, because the highly fragmented industry requires the sort of soft touches and skills that have often been a weak spot for the algorithmically driven tech giant. In addition, Stitch Fix has a near-10-year head start  with its own styling service, and other  show that this is a difficult business to get right.The long-term case for Stitch Fix is self-evident. The company is primed to benefit from two huge secular tailwinds in its industry: e-commerce and personalization. It's the leader in its category. It's profitable and has been for several years, and management is targeting 20% to 25% revenue growth over the long term.However, now looks like an especially good time to pick up Stitch Fix shares, since in addition to its bargain price, there are a number of positive catalysts coming up that should help boost its next round of results and long-term growth.First, we're in the thick of the back-to-school shopping season. Stitch Fix launched its bid for the kids' apparel market last July in time for the 2018 back-to-school season, but with a another whole year to build awareness for the new segment and to expand its product selection, it's a good bet that Stitch Fix Kids will see significant growth this quarter. The  earlier this year, a leading kids' apparel retailer, can't hurt either.Stitch Fix U.K., its first foray into the international market, which , represents another significant growth avenue. The U.K. seems especially promising for Stitch Fix because online apparel shopping is already substantially more popular there than it is in the U.S., and CEO Katrina Lake has said in a previous  that the company's personalization model will make it more differentiated in the U.K. than it is in its home market.Stitch Fix shares surged 15% on the company's most recent  in June when it posted 29% revenue growth, showing that the popular short play -- 33% of its float is sold short -- is being underestimated.The company's fourth-quarter earnings report is due out on Oct. 1. Analysts are expecting revenue to jump 35.9% to $432.5 million with a boost from the U.K. launch but to see earnings per share fall from $0.18 to $0.04.With the stock sell-off over the last couple of months, a promising setup for a short squeeze, and an earnings report on deck that's expected to show strong growth following expansion with the kids' line and the U.K., there's a reasonable possibility that Stitch Fix shares could surge by 50% or more over the next month.One of the most challenging aspects of investing is finding businesses that can grow at a predictable rate for years on end. That's not easy to do in today's hypercompetitive marketplace, but I'm confident that Autodesk is up to the task.Autodesk is a software company that makes products for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, education, and entertainment industries. It is best known as the maker of AutoCAD, which is a 2D and 3D computer-aided drafting program that enables users to create highly detailed blueprints and engineering plans. But Autodesk also sells dozens of other leading products that include Revit, Maya, Fusion 360, BIM 360, and more.Autodesk sold its software by using a licensing model for decades, but a few years ago, it made the switch to a  model. That was a painful transition in the short term -- revenue, profits, and free cash flow all dropped immediately -- but the company is now reaping the rewards from the business-model change. The vast majority of the company's revenue is now recurring and growing fast, its gross margin is high and climbing, and the company is starting to crank out adjusted profits and free cash flow.What's so exciting about the \"new\" Autodesk is that its high growth rates look as if they are here to stay for at least two reasons.First, the company's existing customers find the software to be so useful that they tend to spend more on Autodesk's products each year. , management stated that its net revenue retention range -- which measures existing customer spending from period to period -- landed within management's target range of 110% to 120%. This means that the company is able to grow its revenue by at least 10% .Second, a huge number of legacy customers haven't upgraded to the company's subscription model yet. Autodesk believes that more than 18 million people use its software on a regular basis, but only about 4.3 million of them have made the switch. This means that about 13 million users are actively using Autodesk's legacy products that were purchased under the licensing model years ago. Management is actively working to convince this group to upgrade to the subscription software by sending out constant upgrade reminders and rolling out new features that make the software more useful (such as offering augmented reality and virtual reality features). The company should be able to convince the majority of them to make the switch over time.With all these factors added together, Autodesk looks poised to grow its top line at a strong rate for years to come. When factoring in steady margin improvements,  should help to grow the bottom line even faster (Wall Street currently expects 86% annualized profit growth over the next five years).Autodesk's stock isn't particularly cheap right now -- shares trade for more than 11 times sales and 30 times next year's earnings estimates -- but I've learned that it is almost always worthwhile to pay a premium to own a high-quality business. That's why I recently added a few shares of this high-growth stock to my portfolio and would suggest that you do the same. When it comes to retail stocks, there are  that I would stay away from. A wave of store closures and retail bankruptcies has swept through the industry, and it's likely not done just yet.However, when it comes to mall and shopping center owners, Simon Property Group is simply in a league of its own. This , or REIT, is one of the largest owners of real estate of any kind in the U.S. and doesn't deserve to be put in the same category as the rest of its industry.Simon owns a large portfolio of upscale malls and outlet properties. Many of Simon's malls are among the most valuable retail properties in the world -- particularly those that are operated under the company's Mills brand. Simon also has a dominant market share in the outlet industry. There are eight major outlet mall operators in the U.S., and Simon owns about twice as much square footage as the other seven .This scale gives Simon some . For one thing, it has tons of capital to invest in its properties to keep them a step ahead of competitors and, more importantly, to do battle with e-commerce and win. Simon's malls have been destinations for some time, but in recent years, Simon has been investing heavily to add mixed-use elements to its properties. For example, at many of Simon's properties, you'll find hotels, co-working space, apartments, casinos, entertainment venues, and other nonretail elements. Simon is also investing in many up-and-coming trends, such as esports, in order to keep its properties as current as possible.This not only creates a portion of Simon's revenue that is virtually immune to e-commerce and other retail-sector headwinds but also creates a built-in source of foot traffic for Simon's retail tenants. In fact, Simon's malls have been so successful in bringing shoppers in the door that many retailers who have been traditionally online only have started opening up stores in Simon's malls (Untuckit, for example). And Simon's retail tenants have reported average sales per square foot  of 3.5%, not a decline.One thing that may sound alarming at first is that Simon has a fair amount of space that is occupied by struggling department stores. The 65 remaining  stores and 25 remaining locations in Simon's malls account for more than 8% of the company's total square footage. And although I wouldn't put it in the same boat as those other two,  accounts for another 12%.However, Simon sees this as one of its biggest . By redeveloping these existing spaces as they become vacant into mixed-use elements, Simon can add valuable features to its malls at a substantially lower cost than building them from the ground up.Because of the retail headwinds and recession fears in the market, Simon is trading for just greater than its 52-week low and sports a well-covered 5.7% dividend yield. Now could be a great time to add this mall operator with tremendous competitive advantages to your portfolio at a big discount. Many successful companies often fall prey to a single error that destroys their businesses.  several years ago, and it came within a hair's breadth of going from a promising high-growth leader in the athletic apparel industry to another story of unfortunate failure. Yet unlike so many of its peers in the retail industry, Lululemon managed to mount a full recovery, and those investors who stayed the course along the way have benefited greatly from the yoga apparel company's subsequent rise back into the top echelons of the athletic apparel space.Lululemon's problems stemmed from a quality-control issue in 2013 that threatened the entire basis for the yoga apparel company's business model. At the time, Lululemon was becoming famous for its premium yoga wear and accessories, and its customers were willing to pay up for the company's products because of their status and their high quality. Efforts from Lululemon to connect with instructors at key yoga studios across North America also contributed to the company's brand awareness and built up sales.Yet complaints that some of its yoga pants were sheer enough to see through led some customers to conclude that Lululemon might be skimping on the materials that had originally earned it its strong reputation. Moreover, the yoga apparel company's CEO failed to deal with the situation quickly and efficiently, instead improperly deflecting blame onto some of Lululemon's own customers. That misstep created an even bigger uprising.In the end, though, Lululemon found a way out of its bind. Replacing its CEO was an important first step toward regaining customer confidence in the company, and Lululemon worked hard to ensure that quality-control issues wouldn't repeat. Even with all that work, it took several years for the retailer to return to its former growth trajectory.Now, things have . In its most recent quarter, Lululemon posted 20% year-over-year growth in revenue, helping to boost net income by nearly 30% from the previous year's period. Comparable sales are rising at double-digit-percentage rates, and cost management has helped Lululemon boost its margin figures as well. Customers can now find more Lululemon store locations than ever, as the retail chain has returned to expansion mode.Lululemon is scheduled to give a quarterly report in early September, and investors are enthusiastic that the yoga apparel specialist will be able to continue to grow. With strategic moves to go beyond its core market to attract a greater swath of yoga enthusiasts, Lululemon thinks it can produce considerable growth. Moreover, as athletic apparel becomes more widely accepted as casual wear for all occasions, the strong reputation that Lululemon has rebuilt should be an even greater asset.Long-time investors in Lululemon have already reaped a lot of success from the yoga product retailer, but the company has a lot more potential growth ahead of it. Now's a smart time to take a closer look at how Lululemon could overcome the headwinds that many retailers in other niches have faced and continue to produce strong returns for shareholders. This small infrastructure engineering and consulting company has seen its stock price fall sharply; it's down 27% over the past few months, and even after a strong recovery earlier this year, the stock price is still 32% below the all-time high, reached about one year ago.Why has NV5's stock fallen so far so quickly? In short, because the infrastructure projects it consults on are complex, expensive, and funded by either government spending or capital investments from cyclical industries. And with so much concern about the state of the global economy and real fears of recession, investors are eschewing companies viewed has having big cyclical exposure and prioritizing \"safer\" investments.For investors who are smart enough to look beyond next quarter or even the next year, that's created an excellent opportunity to buy. In short, NV5 is primed for many years of growth to come. There's an need for infrastructure on a global basis: By 2040,  to meet the world's infrastructure needs. This is a product of both global middle-class and urban population growth, as well as the need to modernize and improve infrastructure in the U.S. and Europe to remain competitive with the rest of the world.So why NV5? Because it has an executive team with a great track record of success, including its CEO, who's also the founder and biggest shareholder, with about a 25% stake in the company.you may ask. In short, because while I don't know any more than the next person when the next recession will happen -- nor what its impact on infrastructure spending will be -- I know that NV5 continues to absolutely nail it and represents an incredible combination of value and growth at recent prices.Through the first half of 2019, revenue is up 23%, adjusted earnings per share increased 17%, and operating cash flows surged 61%. Moreover, it's not just acquisitions driving growth; organic revenue increased 6% last quarter as the company continues to leverage its ability to provide multiple services to meet its clients' needs on big, complex projects.Another example of how its strategy is paying off is in its backlog, which has increased 43% since last year and passed $450 million last quarter.Moreover, management expects business to accelerate in the second half of the year, raising its full-year guidance and now calling for $535 million in revenue and earnings of $2.71 per share at the midpoint of guidance. That works out to 28% and 17% growth, respectively, and it trades for about 22 times that earnings guidance at recent prices.Worried the stock price might fall even further from here? Maybe another 20% or 30%? Consider this: Shares have nearly doubled over the past three years and surged an incredible 554% over the past five years because the company continues to deliver incredible results, and that's after the 30% drop from last year's high. Better to buy the excellent business at a fair price than get caught on the sidelines trying to pay the perfect price.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The shares of the developer of Splunk Enterprise, a data analysis solution, have dropped amid worries about its acquisitions and concerns about its cash flow.\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\tHowever, by buying Splunk stock at these levels, traders may get something they do not expect from data and cloud stocks today: a discount.Many of the stocks in those sectors seem to do nothing but move higher. Given the performance of many of Splunk\u2019s peers, one might think that all of the stocks in the sector, including SPLK, keep making 52-week highs and have achieved outlandish price-earnings (P/E) ratios.However, many data and software-as-a-service (SaaS) firms such as (NYSE:) and (NYSE:), have fallen below their 52-week highs. But those companies have not fallen as far as Splunk stock. While CRM stock has dropped by about 9% and SAP has retreated around 15%, SPLK stock has tumbled more than 18% below its 52-week high.One reason for the decline of Splunk stock was concern that its acquisition of  would dilute the shares. That feeling likely worsened after SPLK\u00a0 announced earlier this month that it would also buy  There is some uncertainty as to how these deals\u00a0 will affect the cash, debt, and shares outstanding of SPLK.Moreover, like (NASDAQ:) in recent years,\u00a0 SPLK has begun to switch from a permanent license model to a subscription\u00a0 revenue model. Although the change should result in SPLK generating more revenue over the long-term, such a decision usually leads to a temporary reduction of cash flow.In the wake of fears about its acquisitions,\u00a0 Splunk stock has tumbled from its $143.70 per share high in mid-July to about $116 per share today.However, I see the moves made by SPLK\u00a0 as positive. Many commentators will often criticize firms for putting their short-term profits ahead of their longer-term needs and those of their shareholders. In this case, in an effort to improve its offerings,\u00a0 SPLK has bought other companies. It also switched to a subscription revenue model\u00a0 that should increase its cash flows over the long-term.Still, instead of rewarding the company, traders briefly took SPLK stock into bear-market territory. I believe that the unjustified decline of Splunk stock has created a good buying opportunity.The forward P/E ratio of Splunk stock may look high, compared to the average forward P/E ratio. Still, given\u00a0 the high expected growth of Splunk\u2019s future earnings,\u00a0 the forward P/E ratio of Splunk stock, which currently stands at 49, looks reasonable. For fiscal 2019, analysts, on average,\u00a0 expect Splunk\u2019s\u00a0 earnings to jump 43.6%. In FY20, analysts, on average,\u00a0 predict that its profits will surge nearly 25%.Moreover, yesterday SPLK stock rose by more than 2% after JPMorgan\u2019s  the shares to an \u201coverweight\u201d rating. Thanks to the reduction in the stock price, he sees Splunk stock as attractive. Murphy has placed a $130 price target on SPLK.Like Murphy, I think there are reasons why Splunk\u2019s rapid growth should continue. For one, all things cloud are still growing almost exponentially. Moreover, as InvestorPlace columnist  \u201cmore and more customers are leaving bigger and bigger digital footprints.\u201d Consequently, SPLK\u00a0 remains well-positioned to expand its customer base at a rapid pace.Investors should also note that the price-sales ratio of SPLK is 8.6, well below the shares\u2019 average P/S multiple of the last five years, which is 11.4.The JPMorgan upgrade highlights the buying opportunity created by the weakness of Splunk stock. Although buying companies and switching to subscription-based plans will hurt SPLK in the short-term, the moves should improve its performance over the longer term.The weakness of SPLK stock gives traders the chance to buy this growth name at a below-average multiple.\u00a0 Investors should take advantage of this opportunity and consider using any additional pullbacks of SPLK stock to buy the shares at an even larger discount,As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Surprisingly, though, the  actually beat earnings when it reported its fiscal Q2 2020 results last night. \u00a0Problem was, that wasn't all that Autodesk had to say.Image source: Getty Images.Autodesk's Q2 results actually started on a pretty positive note. Sales grew 30% year over year to $797 million, with 96% of that representing \"recurring revenue.\" Autodesk earned $0.18 per diluted share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles (), and $0.65 according to the more lenient standard of adjusted earnings.(Luckily for Autodesk, adjusted figures are what Wall Street focuses on, and so by that standard, the company beat analysts' earnings estimate of $0.61 per share.)\u00a0\u00a0CEO Andrew Anagnost characterized the results as \"a solid first half of the year with a very strong second quarter as revenue, billings, earnings, and free cash flow came in ahead of expectations.\" CFO Scott Herren added that Autodesk booked its \"largest quarterly non-GAAP net income to date\" and set a \"record ... last twelve months free cash flow of\u00a0$731 million.\"Free cash flow for the fiscal second quarter 2020 itself, by the way, was $205 million -- a 754% increase over last year's Q2.So much for the good news. Now here's the bad.For the fiscal Q3 currently underway, Autodesk predicted that it would book revenue between $820 million and $830 million. (Wall Street wants to see no less than $839 million.) Adjusted profit will range from $0.70 to $0.74 per share, which is also short of analysts' estimate of $0.77. GAAP profits will be $0.24 to $0.28 per share.Likewise for the year as a whole, Autodesk now sees fiscal 2020 sales growing \"only\" 26% to 27% in comparison to fiscal 2019. (Wall Street wants 27.6%.) And on the earnings front, adjusted profits will probably come in between $2.69 and $2.81 per share. At the upper limit, that matches analysts' consensus estimate -- but should earnings land somewhere more toward the middle of the range of guidance, that would be another miss for Autodesk.And of course, actual GAAP profits for the year will be much weaker than any of the adjusted numbers -- only $0.75 to $0.87 per share.Suffice it to say that even $0.87 in GAAP EPS isn't a whole lot to support Autodesk's lofty price tag of nearly $137 per share. The P/E on calculation works out to a whopping 157.5 -- and Wall Street doesn't seem inclined to make excuses for Autodesk right now.So far,  tallies a total of 12 separate analysts cutting price targets on Autodesk shares today. Granted, most of these analysts still rate Autodesk a buy.But while the company's prediction of \"only\" 26% or 27% sales growth this year (which still sounds pretty spry to me) isn't scaring many of these bankers away from their buy ratings, the size of the guidance reduction was enough to convince at least one analyst to cut bait.This morning, Bank of America cut its rating from neutral down to underperform (i.e., sell), worried that Autodesk's \"across the board\" lowered expectations presage weakening \"manufacturing and construction\" activity in key regions including the United Kingdom, Germany, and China. Given this risk, the analyst is not only lowering its price target, but cutting its \"valuation multiples\" as well, to reflect lowered hopes for growth going forward.And I can't say I blame Bank of America. Even Autodesk's fans -- those analysts who cut their price targets while maintaining their buy ratings -- seem worried that \"macroeconomic uncertainties and trade disputes\" could hurt the company's business in the near term, notes TheFly. Credit Suisse cites further concerns that foreign exchange rates could weigh on the company's profits.Meanwhile, even 8% cheaper today than its stock sold for yesterday, I cannot say I find Autodesk's valuation attractive -- or offering much in the way of a margin of safety. The \"record\" trailing-12-month free cash flow that the company's CFO boasted of still leaves shares valued at a rich 45 times trailing cash profits. And the GAAP profit Autodesk expects to earn this year makes the stock look three times more expensive when valued on that metric.Granted, the company succeeds in growing its profits at the 50% annual rate that analysts predict for it (according to data from ), there's still a chance for Autodesk to grow into its valuation. But to do that...it has to first stop shrinking its guidance.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Our great momentum from the first quarter carried into the second quarter, resulting in strong performance, with revenue, billings, earnings and free cash flow coming in ahead of expectations. We also crossed the $3 billion mark on ARR for the first time, which was driven by solid performance across all regions and products. Our last 12 months free cash flow of $731 million is the highest amount of free cash flow we have ever generated in a four-quarter period in the company's history. We performed well in the first half of the year, demonstrating focused execution and the strength of our recurring revenue model. Although we continue to execute well and are not materially impacted by current trade tensions and macro conditions, we are aware of the current business and geopolitical environment that is causing uncertainty in the market.As we look across the next six months, we are taking a prudent approach to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '20. However, we think the uncertainty caused by macro-related events is only a short-term issue. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the fiscal '23 goals we have laid out for you. Our confidence is grounded in the value delivered by our products, their ability to help our customers differentiate via innovation and digitization, focused execution delivered by our partners and sales teams, and the significant strides we are making to capture the non-paying user community. I would also like to point out that although there are headlines of some impact from the current environment on a few industry verticals like Manufacturing, we outgrew competitors and gained share in the space. The construction industry is also holding steady and continues to invest in innovative solutions, and we saw ongoing strength in construction this quarter.Before I offer you more color on strategic highlights during the quarter, let me first turn it over to Scott to give you more details on our second quarter results as well as details of our updated fiscal '20 guidance. I'll then return with further insights on the key drivers of our business, including Construction, Manufacturing and Digital Transformation before we open it up for Q&A. -- Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, revenue, billings, earnings and free cash flow all performed ahead of expectations during the second quarter. Overall demand in our end markets was solid during the quarter, as indicated by our strong billings and revenue growth. Growth was driven by both volume and pricing, which is a result of the strong uptake of our products by new users as well as increased usage with existing customers. Sales volume of AutoCAD LT also remained strong. This has historically been a leading indicator of a potential demand slowdown. And as you can see, revenue from our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT products grew 31% in the second quarter. AEC and Manufacturing revenue rose 37% and 20%, respectively. Geographically, we saw broad-based strength across all regions. Revenue grew 32% in the Americas, 27% in EMEA and 33% in APAC, with strength across almost all countries. We also saw strength in direct revenue, which rose 38% versus last year and represented 30% of our total sales, up from 28% in the second quarter of last year.Before I comment on ARR, I want to remind you how we define it. ARR is the annualized value of our actual recurring revenue for the quarter, or said another way, it is the reported recurring revenue for the quarter multiplied by four. Total ARR of $3.1 billion continued to grow steadily and was up 31%. Adjusting for our fourth quarter acquisitions, total ARR was up 27%. Within Core ARR, growth was roughly in line with total organic growth and was driven by the strength in product subscriptions. In Cloud, ARR grew 175%, propelled by our strong performance in Construction. Excluding $98 million of ARR from our fourth quarter acquisitions, growth in organic Cloud ARR, which is primarily made up of BIM 360 and Fusion 360, increased from 43% in the first quarter to 45%, which is a record for that product set.We continue to make progress with our maintenance to subscription, or M2S, program. The M2S conversion rate of the maintenance renewal opportunities migrating to product subscriptions was in the high 30% range in Q2, which is higher than our historical rate. This uptick in the conversion rate was in line with expectations as our maintenance renewal prices went up by 20% in the second quarter, which made it significantly more advantageous for customers to move to subscription. Of those that migrated, upgrade rates among eligible subscriptions remained within the historical range of 25% to 35%.Now moving to net revenue retention rate, during Q2, the rate continued to be within the range of approximately 110% to 120% and we expect it to be in this range for the remainder of fiscal '20. As a reminder, the net revenue retention rate measures the year-over-year change in ARR for the population of customers that existed one-year ago, or base customers. It is calculated by dividing the current period ARR related to those base customers by the total ARR from those customers one-year ago.Moving to billings, we had $893 million of billings during the quarter, up 48%. The growth in billings was driven by strength in new customer billings, and strong renewals with continued momentum in our core products. And as we have said in prior quarters and in line with our plans, billings are also benefiting from a return to more normalized levels of multi-year agreements.Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which in the past we had referred to as total deferred revenue, is the sum of both billed and unbilled deferred revenue, rose 28% versuslast year and 3% sequentially to $2.8 billion. Current RPO, which represents the future revenues under contract expected to be recognized over the next 12 months, was a little over $2 billion, an increase of 23%.On the margin front, we realized significant operating leverage as we continue to execute in the growth phase of our journey. Non-GAAP gross margins of 92% were up 2 percentage points versus last year. Our disciplined approach to expense management combined with revenue growth enabled us to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by 14 percentage points to 23%, while absorbing two meaningful acquisitions. We realized significant leverage from our investments in sales and marketing and R&D initiatives during the quarter and are on track to deliver significant margin expansion in fiscal '20 and further expand non-GAAP operating margin to approximately 40% in fiscal '23.Moving to free cash flow, we generated $205 million in Q2. Over the last 12 months, we have generated a record $731 million of free cash flow, driven by growing net income and strong billings. Lastly, we continue to repurchase shares with our excess cash, which is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. During the second quarter, we repurchased 253,000 shares for $40 million at an average price of $159.54 per share. Almost all of our repurchase activity during the quarter was through our 10b5-1 plan, which we entered into before the most recent market volatility.Now I'll turn the discussion to our outlook. I'll start by saying that our view of global economic conditions and their impact on our business has been updated to reflect the current state of various trade disputes and the geopolitical environment and their potential impact on our customers. While we have not seen any material impacts to our business, we are taking a prudent stance regarding customer spending environments in the UK due to Brexit, central Europe due to a slowdown in the Manufacturing industry there, and China due to trade tensions. These items individually are not material headwinds, but in the aggregate are responsible for our guidance adjustment, which now reflects our current views based on what we know about the environment today.Our pipeline remains strong globally, including in these regions, but we began noticing some changes in demand environments in these areas toward the end of July. As such, for these affected areas, we feel it is appropriate to adjust our expectations for the rest of the year. As you will soon hear from Andrew, customers continue to increase their spending on our products even in these areas and our renewal rates are fairly steady. Additionally, we are now assuming more billings will occur later in the quarter for the remainder of the year.At the mid-point of our updated guidance, we are calling for revenue and ARR growth to be approximately 27% and 26%, respectively, which speaks to the resiliency of our model versus prior cycles. The wider than normal range of our full year guidance is a result of the greater uncertainty we are expecting over the second half of the year. Additionally, currency now offers a headwind of about $10 million to our full year revenues versus being neutral at the beginning of the year. As such, the low end of our updated constant currency guidance is in line with the low end of the initial outlook we shared with you at the beginning of the year and it also reflects the potential for a slight deterioration of the environment from the current level.While our billings guidance has come down by about $50 million, billings are still expected to grow approximately 50%, or 40% after adjusting for the adoption of the ASC 606 last year. This supports our view of strong demand for our products even in uncertain environments. Regarding free cash flow, the $50 million adjustment to $1.3 billion is primarily a result of our updated view of billings and their timing. We expect to achieve our original target of $1.35 billion trailing 12 months free cash flow during the first quarter of fiscal '21.While it is too early to give you detailed color on fiscal '21, we expect to continue growing billings, revenues, and free cash flows while expanding our margins. This is supported by what we are seeing in North America, especially in AEC, where our pipeline remains strong and we have more visibility into our business than in Central Europe and China. Construction is also performing very well, as we continue to increase the value we are bringing to our customers. And we continue to make strides with capturing revenue from non-paying users.Looking at our guidance for the third quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $820 million to $830 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 to $0.74. Third quarter free cash flow is expected to be modestly above the second quarter. The earnings slide deck on the investor relations section of our website has more details as well as modeling assumptions for fiscal '20.In summary, I want to remind everyone that since our business model shift, we have moved to a much more resilient business model that generates a very steady stream of revenue that is less exposed to macro swings than when we were selling perpetual licenses. So while we are adjusting our fiscal '20 guidance slightly, we are still expecting revenue growth of 27% for the year, margin expansion of about 12 percentage points, and we are confident in delivering on our fiscal '23 targets.Now, I'd like to turn it back to Andrew. -- Thanks, Scott. As you heard, we delivered very strong performance in the first half of the year, and despite negative headlines from Europe and Manufacturing, we are still seeing strong demand for our solutions. For example, a large European automobile company recently signed a new three-year enterprise business agreement, or EBA, despite a more challenging macro backdrop for their industry. They see the new agreement as an investment in design, and they know innovation is needed to stay ahead of the competition. They view Autodesk as a market leader in this area and count on us to provide new, innovative design solutions such as generative design.The EBA also offers them the flexibility to access our entire product portfolio, including products ranging from manufacturing and AEC collections to Alias, 3ds Max, Maya and Vault, while at the same time representing a more than 130% increase in annual contract value for us. We will continue to partner with them to ensure that they get maximum value out of our products and remain a leader in an industry that is undergoing significant change. Our customers know that at the end of every downturn is an upturn, and if they don't continue to innovate and use the latest technology tools throughout the cycle, they will be at a distinct disadvantage when growth returns. This underscores the importance of our products regardless of the macro environment as well as our customers' commitment to investing in technology to stay ahead of competitors.Now, let me give you an update on some key strategic growth initiatives we are focused on, specifically our continued traction within Construction, gains in Manufacturing and leveraging our Digital Transformation to capture the opportunity within our non-paying user base. These initiatives are key drivers of both our near- and long-term business.In Construction, BIM 360 was the primary driver of our organic growth in Cloud, led by BIM 360 Design and Build. Our customers are continually finding value in this offering. And the PlanGrid team continues to see strong momentum. For example, Tutor Perini, one of the largest general contractors in the US, selected PlanGrid, over competitor offerings, for two $500 million key projects. The team wanted to provide real-time, up to date documentation and plans to the field. Senior management for these projects had used PlanGrid before at a different firm and this relationship provided an opportunity to demonstrate PlanGrid's capabilities for these two projects. PlanGrid set up the projects by processing the drawings and pulling out title block information, categorizing the drawings with tags, and hyperlinking detail call outs for 2,000 drawings in under an hour. This was an immediate time savings for Tutor Perini. Additionally, the field teams have access to new drawings, changes, RFIs, and submittals right away in an easy to use interface. Going forward, we continue to look for opportunities to partner with Tutor Perini across all their products and subsidiaries.BuildingConnected and Assemble also performed well as we continue to focus on integrating these offerings. During the quarter, we integrated BuildingConnected's bid management solutions with PlanGrid technology, enabling the seamless transfer of data from pre-construction to the building process. The integration allows construction project managers to automatically push design and pre-construction files from BuildingConnected to PlanGrid, saving time, reducing errors and further enhancing the cost savings associated with using both platforms. And as you recall, we integrated Revit with PlanGrid with the launch of PlanGrid BIM last quarter and have received tremendously positive feedback from customers regarding the update.In the first quarter after its release, the product is also being used in over 650 projects by more than 300 customers. These integrations are steady steps toward providing Autodesk construction customers with integrated workflows that connect the office, trailer and field. We are also continuing to see outstanding cross-selling with our recent construction acquisitions. For example, during the quarter, Chick-Fil-A, an existing Autodesk customer, expanded its relationship by adding BuildingConnected and Assemble solutions to reduce the time to open new locations and downtime due to construction updates in existing locations.And as a reminder, infrastructure is an area that we have seen in the past perform well during macro-related slowdowns and we continue to focus efforts in this area. This quarter, we secured a new Enterprise Business Agreement with Gannett Fleming. Gannett Fleming is a leading, global engineering and architecture firm, ranked number 35 on the ENR Top 500 Design List. The Gannett Fleming executive team considers a strategic partnership with Autodesk to be a distinct competitive advantage. With the EBA, Gannett Fleming now has direct access not only to the full portfolio of Autodesk technology, but also to a wide range of Autodesk services and expertise that will help them achieve their corporate growth and market expansion goals.On the manufacturing front, revenue grew 20% in the second quarter, despite a more challenging manufacturing environment in Europe. Customers are seeing the benefits of our differentiated solution, and we continue to gain market share while displacing competitive offerings in the space. For example, during the second quarter, a leading Swiss watchmaker selected Autodesk's Design and Manufacturing Collection to replace Solidworks given the flexibility offered by our solutions. In addition, our investments in generative design and Fusion 360 have resulted in competitive displacements not only in the CAD market, but also in the computer-aided manufacturing or CAM space where there are lower barriers to switching vendors. As a result, we see displacements of competitors like MasterCAM. And once we're embedded in those customers' downstream processes, we are increasingly penetrating design activities within those same accounts. Customers pick Fusion over competitive offerings due to its integrated CAD-CAM functionality, it's compatibility with other CAD tools, ease of use and the attractive pricing model.Now, let's talk about progress with our digital transformation. Many of you recall that a key part of this transformation will increase the insight we have on our non-compliant user base. One of the initiatives we undertook to accomplish this started last year and has given us the ability to analyze usage patterns of our non-compliant users. Since last year, we have analyzed significant amount of data on these users, including how long they use the software and how their journey traverses across non-compliant usage to downloading free trials or using student editions. With this data, we can test different ways to convert them, including in-product messaging and leveraging our inside sales team.While still early in the conversion process, we have an increasing amount of data that allows us to take necessary actions to convert this large pool of potential customers. In the quarter, we expanded our pilot cases for in-product messaging to many international regions and enhanced our license compliance initiatives using our sales teams as well as via email campaigns. These conversations resulted in multiple deals, including two over $1 million, one of which was in China. Our billings from license compliance initiatives were up by approximately 65% versus last year, although on a small base.So, as you've heard, we made great progress this quarter that enabled us to finish the first half of the year strong. We continue to execute well in Construction where IT spending remains strong. We are making competitive inroads in Manufacturing with our innovative solutions and are making strides in converting the current 14 million non-paying users into subscribers. We are highly confident in Autodesk's ability to capitalize on our large market opportunity and are committed to delivering on our fiscal '23 goals.With that, Operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions.Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. -- Hi, Saket. -- Hey, Scott. Hey, Andrew. Hey, Andrew, maybe just to start with you slightly higher level question on the macro. I know we spoke about some of the regional items that we've seen whether it was [Phonetic] UK, China or Central Europe, but I want to maybe think about the macro from a different lens. Clearly a lot of concern out there about the manufacturing economy. And as we know, not all of Autodesk's business is levered to the manufacturing space. But for the part that is, can you just give us some color on the verticals that Autodesk sells into, whether that's auto or aerospace for example. Just to sort of get a sense for where Autodesk kind of sits with regards to different sub-segments of manufacturing, specifically? -- Hey, Saket. Before we jump into that, I'd like to clear out something, we've heard that there is some confusion in our guidance metrics from the press release footnotes. So what our current guidance for free cash flow for fiscal '20 is $1.3 billion. If we get there by saying, free cash flow from operations -- cash flow from operations will be $1.37 billion, netted [Phonetic] $70 million of free cash flow to get to $1.3 billion. So I think that the footnote creates confusion that the $1.3 billion wasn't already netted for capex? It is. So it's $1.37 billion before capex as cash flow from ops, $1.3 billion is the free cash flow guidance for the year. -- Okay. Go ahead. Scott? -- Yeah. So let me address your question about verticals and manufacturing in particular. First off just let me kind of just frame a few things. Our manufacturing business actually did pretty well, grew 20%, a lot better than any of our competitors. That has a lot to do with the way we're diversified. It also has a lot to do with the price points and the upfront, the reduced upfront cost of our offerings are pretty attractive to a lot of people. And we're also seeing acceleration in the CAM space due to the Fusion 360 portfolio and the way it integrates design and CAM along with the generative capability. So we're seeing is pretty strong performance in manufacturing, but to your point about which verticals we're exposed you know that our biggest vertical in manufacturing is what we call industrial machinery, and this is machinery of all manner and type. It's machines, you'll see inside automotive factories, but it's also machines you see the package serial, or to wrap toys, or to do any manner of things make paper in large industrial machines. It's our single biggest segment. Another really big segment for us is what's called building product manufacturers. And these are the people that build things that go into buildings and there are also the people that build things that hang on buildings in pre-fabricated components of buildings. So I think doors and windows manufacturers, think air conditioner manufacturers, think curtain wall manufacturers, if you understand how skyscrapers are made.Our smallest level exposure is actually in the auto and aerospace where other competitors have deeper exposure in terms of the engineering processes. We are definitely big in auto in some of the more forward-looking aspects of the auto industry. So we're embedded deeper in the designed departments which are several years ahead of where the current production is and where current production volume is. And we're also working closely with a lot of autos and some of their next generation production workflows. I think you've seen some of the things we've been talking about with generative with regards to some of the work we've done with GM [Phonetic] and some of the other automotives to kind of help them consolidate multiple parts -- in multi-part assemblies into a single 3D printed part and we're definitely engaged in some of that work. But that's kind of the hierarchy of exposure we have to manufacturing. It makes sense? -- That does. That does. That's really helpful. Scott, maybe if you, for my follow up, a little bit of different topic, but I'd love to talk a little bit about the remaining maintenance business. Obviously, this is the last year of M2S price increases as you've mentioned before and that maintenance ARR sort of continues to decline in that high-30% range. How do you sort of think about that decline in coming quarters? And maybe just speak to sort of the profile of your remaining maintenance customers. I guess with the last 25% price increase should we start to see a step-up in that maintenance base decline, or should we kind of think about it kind of chugging along the way how, so far? Any color there would be helpful. -- Yeah. Sure, Saket. So this is the year, by the way, it's a 20% price increase, not 25%. But this is, Q2 was the first full quarter that, that third price increase that we announced three years ago. It went into effect at the beginning of Q2. Since our first quarter with that, we actually had some interesting results, conversion rate of maintenance agreements that came up for renewal, actually increase, which is what you expect with the staying on maintenance going up 20% from what had been about one-third of those to come up for renewal converting to something in the high-30% range for the quarter. So conversion rate increased as expected the -- interestingly for those that did elect to stay on maintenance and some do. The renewal rate actually ticked up. I would have expected with the increase in price. It's a stay flat or maybe even decline. It actually -- the renewal rate for maintenance for those that did not convert actually ticked moderately, but ticked up slightly in the quarter. So we're seeing the exact same, the behavior we expected, when we laid out, the M2S program. And at this point, it's -- we have three more quarters to go, it will actually overlap into the first quarter of next year before it's finished. -- Got it. Very helpful, guys. Thanks. -- Thanks, Saket. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Winslow of Wells Fargo. Your question please. -- Hey, thanks guys for taking my question. Yeah. Thanks for the commentary on Asia-Pacific and Europe. I wonder if you give us more color on what you're seeing in the US, particularly into the quarter? And in terms of the pipeline particularly by vertical that would be very helpful. Thanks. -- Yes. The Americas in the US in particular were strong. We grew 32%. Our pipeline solid in the US, it's plus or across the whole Americas, our visibility is pretty good. We're seeing broad strength across all the segments. So we're not seeing any weakening in any kind of segment, or by any types of vertical. So the US business is looking solid and it continues to look solid right now until something changes in the environment, but we saw a great, a great, great visibility in our pipeline to the US. -- Phil, the other comments, it's worth adding on to that is, I think there was some concern that emerging markets might have underperformed during the quarter and it's actually, you have to dig into the appendix of our slides that we posted on our website. But you can see emerging markets actually grew north of 30%. And obviously there is a chunk of those emerging markets are in the Americas as well. So we continue to see -- with the exception of three areas that we pointed out, we continue to see strength geographically across the board. -- Yeah. Got it. And then also in terms of the breakdown saying -- we're saying obviously your businesses sort of like a matrix internationally, but and then my multiple verticals and the multiple sort of sub verticals within inside those verticals. Would you think about just manufacturing exposure versus let's say your commercial construction versus media entertainment? Is there one geography that's weight more let's say toward your commercial construction won [Phonetic] more toward manufacturing? Any sort of color on sort of that --? -- Yeah. Absolutely. So that's an easy place to give some color. So construction we're definitely lean more toward the US, there's no doubt about it. On manufacturing, we're definitely lean more toward Europe. We've historically been more successful in Europe relative to competition than in the US. So when you see our manufacturing slowed down in Germany, it's slowed down our overall manufacturing business. So Europe is definitely where we're more exposed in manufacturing. The US is definitely where the bulk of the businesses for construction right now, though we're growing pretty quickly internationally on the construction side as well. But that's kind of the high-level breakdown. -- Okay, great. Thanks guys. -- Thanks, Phil.Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question please. -- Thank you. Good evening. Andrew, a quarter ago, on the call you made some interesting remarks regarding what you're calling your early warning system. This was in the context [Phonetic] you're talking about digital infrastructure and your customer engagements team. The question is, what is that system telling you in terms of some of the key metrics that it's set up for in terms of usage and other metrics. And is it thus far a US-oriented system, or is it giving you signals globally that are helping you? And then secondly, a longer-term technology or roadmap question, you made some comments on the call earlier [Phonetic] about your integrations thus far with the PACS [Phonetic] acquisitions, the BIM and Revit and so forth. What about the roadmap however between AEC and manufacturing. If you are going to pursue nationalization of construction, you have to have that, that core segment integration, you haven't really spoken about it much, but perhaps you can talk about that roadmap? -- Okay. All very good questions, Jay. So first let me talk about the early warning system and what it's telling us. So it is broad geographically. It tells us about multiple products and multiple geographies. And one of the things and what is also intended to do it give us a predictor scores of at-risk renewal, so that we can go take direct action with regards to at-risk renewals. What I can tell you at a very high level is telling us that there is no slowdown in usage of our products, right. In fact usage continues to grow across all types of products and all manner of vertical. So we're not seeing any systematic declines in usage or usage activity with associated [Phonetic]. Our pirates continue to use, use our product robustly and as do our paying subscribers. But remember that the core part of that system is designed to help our teams understand, which one of our accounts are most at risk for renewal. And, yeah, you're right, we watch things like activations, we watch things like product usage, and we watch other things like access to support that allow us to kind of score these customers in terms of risk, but it's global and we're not seeing any changes in the usage trends. The usage continues to go up globally.Now with regard to integration of the construction, I think you're actually pointing to a very important area and it's one of the things that we're really focusing on behind the scenes and it has to do with creating some workflows for the building product manufacturers, which includes like I said earlier curtain wall, as well as the component that go inside of buildings. So what we've been working to do is expand the Interop between Revit and Inventor, so that you can actually take low-precision models from Revit, move them into the high-precision environment of Inventor, so that you can get, do fabrication prep for things like curtain walls and other types of manufacturing components. And then actually move them back into revenue in the low-precision world in an account slated way for the changes that happen inside of Inventor go back and update inside of the Revit model as well. We've been improving those integrations continuously behind the scenes, you're going to see more improvement in those integrations in Q4, and a continuing roadmap next year. It's not -- that's not completing fully industrialized workflows for construction, but it's a pre-requisite to making sure you have a good BIM to manufacturing or 3D solid modeling workflows, that you can actually do some of these more complex interactions between a building information model and a 3D model for manufacturing purposes. So we continue to work on those Revit and Inventor integrations and you'll see acceleration in that area. -- Okay. Thanks, Andrew. -- Thanks, Jay.[Speech Overlap] Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you. Just a couple of questions here. Andrew, I just want to make sure that your tone and your conservatism seems like you're not seeing the weakness here so to speak, but you're just being more conservative in your outlook. I just want to confirm that, but that's how we should be reading your comments. And then I guess one of the other questions would be, how is C [Phonetic] growth trending? And churn in C growth, which may be a precursor to a slowdown, if you think of the fact that your products are deployed, if increased deployment as people are hired into the industry. And then I guess the follow-up from there would be just from a linearity perspective after last quarter when you said linearity with a little bit more back-end loaded, I know you guys were going back to assuming the same linearity in Q3 this year that you did last year. Is that where it actually came out if -- if you can give us some color there, that'd be great. Thank you. -- All right. So, what I'll do is, I'll answer your middle question first. Then I'll answer your first question, second, and I'll let Scott answer the third, OK? So your middle part -- -- Thank you. -- C growth [Phonetic]. That's OK. C growth ensuring no change. All right, we're seeing the same kind of C growth where our renewal rates are solid in some places we're seeing improvements. So all of those trends are consistent right now with a fairly steady environment. Like we said earlier, we've seen some indications in certain specific markets that lead us to be a little bit more cautious, particularly Germany and manufacturing, UK and around Brexit, Brexit. And you know the state-owned enterprises in China, we simply cannot engage with them and that's going to put pressure on our expectations relative to those markets. Even though emerging in China is a small part of our business, it's a small percentage. Over a couple of quarters, we could easily add up to $5 million in missed expectations, but there is a lot of noise. You can all hear it, it's all going on, there's something new every day. All right, all you have to do is checking Twitter feed. So there is all sorts of noise and what you see us doing and I want to make sure we put this in context. What we did is we took the high end of our guidance down, so we narrowed the range. The low end of our guide on a constant currency basis is unchanged. So this is a prudent narrowing of the range to kind of reflect this noise we're seeing in the system. I think it's the right thing to do right now. I think it's appropriate.But even if you look at the worst-case scenario, on all of that. Worst case scenario, we're coming in at 96% at worst case of the numbers we set out there four years ago. I think that's pretty good. It does not just great modeling, it's actually great execution in flexible and adaptive execution and it's that ability to kind of track the business to that kind of fidelity that gives us a lot of confidence in terms of what we're looking to see out in FY '23. And I want to make sure just since you asked the question, I want to reinforce a few things that are really important drivers around some of this stuff. First off, one just five [Phonetic] comment. We could easily do some unnatural acts to hit that free cash flow number at what we stated previously in the last call, you wouldn't want us to do that. I have no interest in pushing an agenda in that direction. And we're just simply not going to do it. It's not good for the business, it's not good for the long-term health and for the long-term prospects of the business and we have to pay attention to the long-term prospects of the business. So we're not going to do any unnatural [Phonetic] things to try to drive that free cash flow number up. And I think that, that's an important point. But the resilience in the model, because remember, as we move into next year the model transition is dying [Phonetic]. We've got the resilience in the model, let's just look out to FY '23. But look at just how the midpoint of the guide changed, half of that -- half of that is due to currency FX. Okay. A total complete short-term impact on our business.The other thing I want you to be aware of, in terms of you know what's kind of guiding us with the conservatism and we're at our pipeline solid. We're looking out our pipelines and we've got more visibility to our business than we've ever had before. The pipeline looks good in countries where we historically having problems I think might remember a year ago, we talked a lot about Japan. Japan is doing great. So we're seeing things like that. But more importantly, as we look out beyond the FY '20 guide into some of the FY '23 things, construction is doing really well. We believe the construction is going to continue to do well during the downturn, IT spending construction continue to grow during the downturn last time, in '07 and '08 Revit continue to grow for us. I think you're going to see that same thing. Our performance on non-compliant users is getting better and better.And also let's just say there was a protracted downturn. Something interesting happens in those downturns infrastructure spend tends to go up. We've gotten in front of that. We've done some things in our core design product and our construction portfolio to ensure that we're good partners to the infrastructure business. So we intend to capitalize on any infrastructure spend that could come out of a protracted downturn. So you're right. We are simply being conservative and we're being prudent because of the noise out there in the system and because of the weakness we saw in some places where they can have impact on our expectation, was correct. We're growing robustly in all those places. We just have higher expectations for those places. And I think it's the right time to make that kind of adjustment and it's all short-term, but we're still very confident about what we can do in FY '23. -- And Heather, I think the other part -- -- Scott, yeah. -- Yeah. The other part of your [Phonetic] question, that was around linearity. And I think the thing that we are seeing in linearity, and again in Q2, which was consistent with our expectations in Q2 was the more sales are happening a little bit later in the quarter than what we had experienced in the second half of fiscal '19. So it's more like the traditional linearity that we had in the first half of fiscal 2019, and that's now built it into our forecast for the second half of this year. So it has a couple of effects, when you do that, obviously, and Andrew has talked about there's a big chunk of the adjusted in our guidance is all-time the FX, but holding that aside as linearity pushes out a little bit, it has an effect on billings, where billings covered [Indecipherable] quarter, and then you end up collecting some of those billings is kind of during the current quarter and the following quarter. So there's a little bit of an effect on billings and an effect on free cash flow as well to linearity. But that's the way to think about it. The midpoint of the guide is a 27% revenue growth, midpoint of the billings guide is 40% growth even normalized for the 606 implementation at the beginning of last year and the midpoint of the guide as 12 points of margin expansion. So it's a good strong year. We continue to feel good about the momentum in the business. -- Great. Thank you so much. -- Thanks, Heather.Thank you. Our next question comes from Gal Munda of Berenberg Capital Management. Your line is open. -- Hi, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is just in the manufacturing side. We see the manufacturing is going below the AEC part of the business. And I was just wondering, if it's macro-related, or is it may be got something to do with the comments you made around the shift to the new platform you mentioned that Fusion 360 is gaining market share, you mentioned that Fusion 360 is growing very, very strongly. And I'm wondering whether Fusion 360 by taking market shares also potentially taking market share from some older solutions, they have like Inventor, which might provide kind of short-term headwind to the revenue there? -- All right. So let me kind of answer that from a public [Phonetic]. First off, we grew 20% manufacturing better than any of our competitors. All right. Better than the market. So our performance in manufacturing is actually very strong. The relative difference in the performance between manufacturing and AEC is simply due to the fact that AEC is stronger. What we're seeing in AEC is relevant is not only being adopted very robustly. It's actually being mandated or BIM is being mandated in more and more countries and for more and more projects. Japan in particular is an interesting place where historically BIM was slow to be adopted and it's starting to see an acceleration of adoption and you're seeing BIM mandates showing up in Japan as well. So I want to make sure that we understand the relative performance difference between those two things and our performance relative to competitors in the overall market.Now, to your point about Fusion. One of the reasons why there is no cannibalization related to Fusion is because when every Inventor customer that's getting Inventor of the collection gets Fusion with it. All right. So they actually get both products. So if you buying subscribe to collection, you get all the things that our collection, you actually get Fusion as well. And Fusion is a design out can't do all the things that Inventor does. So there is very little cross overlap between those two applications in terms of actually complete design things.The growth that you're seeing in Fusion is actually coming more from competitive swaps -- we always like we've always given several examples of SolidWorks displacements we've seen other placements as well and this growth in the CAM space as well where the integrated end-to-end solution in the price points or just really, really attractive. So I just want to make sure that we put color on that. Manufacturer is doing great, the relative difference between AEC and manufacturing has to do with fact that AEC is doing better, and it's doing better because of BIM the mandates and BIM momentum and we're not seeing any cannibalization from Fusion in our core business perfect. -- Perfect. That's very helpful. And then just as a follow up. Could you comment a bit about the performance between the direct and indirect. So basically the channel and your own sales force, you basically mentioned that you had some significant EBA wins, maybe also comment a bit more on the e-commerce side of things, how the direct performance is going down? -- Yeah. Gal, we talked about the mix being 70% through the channel, 30% direct, which is compared to 28% direct in Q2 of last year. So it's grown a couple of points. Our direct business actually grew 38% year-on-year, so we're seeing good strength in direct. Within EBAs, we continue to do most of our EBAs in the second half of the year and within that most of them in the fourth quarter and the second half of the year. So the EBA business while we have good traction with EBAs in Q2, the quarters were really starting to see a lot more EBA businesses late in Q3 and then through Q4. The e-commerce business or e-store is actually growing very nicely year-on-year. Again growing off a smaller base are growing very nicely year-on-year and that's part of our overall digital sales approach. All right. It's not just put up a store and try to drive people to it. We also use the e-store as the back-end transaction engine for a lot of our inside sales teams. So we're seeing very nice growth through that whole digital sales channel, which comes to us at a higher net revenue per concept to Autodesk. So it's actually performing quite well. -- Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. -- Thanks. -- Thanks, Gal.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for taking the question. As you think about the uncertainty related to the second half, could you give us a sense for how you see the billings impact related to demand patterns and linearity differ, if at all between the larger EBA type customers in the smaller volume-oriented ones. And then along those lines, how should we think about the EBA renewal opportunity in the back half of this year versus last? -- Yeah. Ken, we always have, as I just mentioned we always have more EBAs in the second half of the year and in particular in the fourth quarter than we do in the first half of the year. That was -- we know when those EBAs are coming up for renewal and we have the best inside of any of our transactions on the what's happening with the EBAs. So we have a good sense of when those are going to close, that's always been pretty accurately reflected in our outlook. What you see in terms of the adjustment in billings of 50 million adjustment in billings; first of all, certain context, it's a 50 million adjustment at the midpoint on a number that's greater than 4 billion, right. So it's a little more than a 1% adjusted in the full year billings, half of that 50 million roughly, it is strictly FX. The remainder is really localized around the three areas that we talked about, around the UK with concerns over Brexit. And we saw that actually much more so in July than we did in the first two months of the quarter, same with the slowdown in the manufacturing base in Germany, and then with the state-owned enterprises in China. So the adjustment in billings is really a reflection of FX, and then those three kind of localized FX, but I think everyone's feeling not just all of us. -- Understood. And if I may, given that you've already reached about $98 million in ARR from your acquisitions. And I think you're targeting $100 million for the year. How do you kind of thinking about the contribution to the year now? -- Yeah. Super happy with the way the integration is on and [Indecipherable] this as well talk about the numbers. I'm super pleased with that. And the $100 million that you referred to was really what we talk about the PlanGrid. So it'd be slightly higher when you add building connected to that as well. I feel like we're on track, really happy with the way those are performed so far. It's -- those are two really significant transactions to pull in the same quarter and not. We haven't lost a bit of momentum in either one of those. So feeling good about our construction business overall. And I think the interesting point before I hand off to you, Andrew, is not only have we done well with the acquired products the breadth of the portfolio we have in construction now has created an updraft for BIM 360. And we talked about our cloud, our organic cloud ARR growth at 45% for the quarter. BIM 360 is one of the big drivers of that. So we continue to see not just success in construction with the acquired assets, but a bit of a halo effect because of the breadth of that product portfolio on our organic BIM 360 products.You took all my interesting points. -- I'm sorry. -- Yeah, look, the construction portfolio is performing really well. That is very unusual to get this kind of first half -- first two quarter performance out of big acquisitions like that, we're happy. On the integration side, senior leaders from the acquired companies are taking senior positions inside the construction solutions team. So we're seeing better and better alignment between those organizations. We have a lot of confidence in where we're going with these things, you see continuing stream of product integrations. Our customers are getting comfortable with our road map. The reason customers accelerated their purchasing of BIM 360 is because basically they just they see the same doing and acting in all the right ways. So they're doubling down in Autodesk and that's nothing, but an excellent sign for how this business is going to grow into next year. -- Great, thanks very much. -- Thanks, Scott.Thank you. Our next question comes from Zane Chrane of Bernstein Research. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into manufacturing a little bit more, the 20% growth in manufacturing revenue really was driven by ARR added in Q3 and Q4 of last year. If I look at the annualized value of manufacturing revenue based on number of days in the quarter, its size, looks like it's down about $4 million or $5 million in ACV compared to what it was at the end of Q4. So -- and that's in contrast to pretty strong incremental growth in manufacturing revenue each quarter of fiscal '19, is the weakness in first half on that incremental manufacturing revenue added, is that due to increased churn or lower expansion of existing customers or just a pause and adoption due to the macro uncertainty? Thank you. -- Yeah, I think it's neither, Zane. So to be clear, we -- the 20% growth in manufacturing is in line with the growth in manufacturing we've seen historically over the last two or three quarters that we're not seeing even in the markets that we talked about that the three markets that we talked about having localized impact. We're showing strong double-digit growth even in Germany, which of course is a manufacturing base in itself. -- In ACV. -- In an ACV. So we're not seeing that kind of a -- I'm not exactly sure the math that you did there, we're not seeing -- we can pick it up offline. We're not seeing any acceleration or deceleration, significant deceleration on the manufacturing side. Renewal rates were strong across the board. New product subscription growth -- with back to one of the questions that came up earlier was in line and actually slightly higher as what we see in the prior couple of quarters. So the manufacturing space continues to perform well and I think it's a bit of a stand out relative to our peers that are far more manufacturing focused when you look at that growth rate. -- Yeah, just even to comment on Germany and we'll just talk about it from a pure ACV standpoint. The ACV growth in Germany was still double-digit, high double-digit growth. What we saw was a gap between our expectations and the growth we were seeing as we headed into the end of the quarter. We have high expectations for that market and those expectations were not getting met in the same kind of pattern that we would have expected in past quarters, but ACV is growing across the board manufacturing. So I think maybe it's something that we would be absolutely good to follow-up on make sure we got the math right there. -- Okay. That makes sense. Just a quick question on the gap between the results versus your high expectations going in, is the gap more driven by lower expansion than you expected or less adoption from potential new customers? -- Yeah. So what it is mostly a cross-sell and up-sell opportunity slowing down little bit. I'll give one example as we look out into the end of the second half. Accounts in some of the European countries where we expected to see EBA conversions are looking like to be more subscription sales versus the EBAs. So what we're seeing is a little bit of change in behavior at the EBA level and at the up-sell and cross-sell level. And that's really -- that's really what's triggering our caution. And in terms of what we saw during the quarter, we expect a certain level of uptick in the ACV as we get toward the end of the quarter and for the manufacturing in Germany, in particular, we didn't see that uptick in ACV. We're still doing great growing, but we didn't see the uptick we expected toward the numbers we want to see, we took that as an indicator of some slowness. -- Very helpful, thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, thanks for being completely detailed and transparent with all the disclosures. I was also curious given that we've not seen any meaningful turn in the business so far. How confident that are you that we have levels at the estimates or is it potential no router revisions potentially based on what you might uncover and cover quarter or do you feel that you've seen enough and you've scrubbed the model enough to account for, whatever it is that you saw in July and that we should be OK from this point onwards? -- Yeah, so obviously we spent a lot of time scrubbing the numbers and looking at this and making sure that we were -- we were looking at this in a prudent way. We feel confident that we've set the guide, right? I mean, obviously we're one tweet away from something changing, unless something radical changes in the macro environment. We feel pretty confident given our pipeline visibility to what we're guiding out there right now. And again I just want to reiterate what we did is, we narrowed the range from the top end down, the bottom at constant currency stayed the same right? Prudent measured action relative to what we're seeing out there. We think we've got it right and if you look at something comes from left field, something will come from left field, but we feel like we've got it right and we scrubbed our numbers.Scott, do you want to comment anything? -- Yeah, the only thing I'd add to that, Kash, and it's a great question and I appreciate you asking it, so we can talk about it on the call is that -- as we started to analyze not just where we're headed in the -- with the strength of our pipeline and the overall strength in our renewal rates, which the renewal rate is becoming a bigger and bigger part of our business. Net revenue retention stayed in the same range, renewal rates on a volume basis if anything ticked up modestly of course that picked up slightly sequentially. So, feel good about the core business and we talked about the remaining performance obligations, even the current RPO, right? So those are they're going to turn into revenue in the next 12 months, growing 23% year-on-year. So -- who knows what the next tweet will say, but we feel like we've built in everything that we can see at this point, yeah. -- Thanks so much again. Appreciate the transparency. -- Yeah, thanks, Kash.Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord. Your question please. -- Thanks. Two quick questions. One, you had a little bit of kind of work on rationalizing kind of the overlapping features between PlanGrid and some pre-existing functionality, how far are you on that? And then on -- second question would be, share repurchase I think you said 253,000. How much is left and can you accelerate that, can you surge that or what's up that, those are two simple questions? Thanks. -- Yeah, Richard, thank you for that. All right. So first off let's talk about how we positioned the portfolio to our customers and port position the breadth of our portfolio, I made it very clear that the BIM 360 products that's going to focus on project management, project centric workflows and all the things associated with managing projects from start to finish and integrating them into the pre-construction workflow. PlanGrid is going to focus on field execution and all the things associated with field execution in the capturing of information in around field execution and communicating that information back up into the global project management environment.We made progress on multiple fronts. Like I said earlier, we've integrated BIM into PlanGrid and so there is a BIM PlanGrid integration. We've also integrated some BuildingConnected build bid management function into PlanGrid as well. But one of the really exciting things that we're working on and say it's part of the integration strategy is that both the PlanGrid team and the BIM 360 teams have seen the next generation building BIM 360 doc solution we built as being the foundation of what we call a common data environment. This is something we expect out in the AEC industry, it's called CVE. And docs is going to be the foundation of our common data environment in both PlanGrid and BIM -- on all the other core BIM 360 functionality are integrating into that platform, which gives us a great stepping stone, not only to satisfy some pretty complicated requirements around common data environment, but also to bring the products together more rapidly.So you're going to hear a lot of things from us in the second half of this year, in the first half of next year about how these portfolios are coming together, but our customers get it, they understand and they are buying in more to our solution because they see us acting in the direction of what we said we're going to do. -- And Richard on your stock buyback question, that you're spot on. So, we spent $40 million during the quarter, year-to-date we spent $140 million. There is no change in our stance on cap allocation. So we'll continue to offset the -- of course support the growth of the company first, look offset the dilution from our equity plans and then return excess cash to shareholders. We've been doing that pretty effectively with a more opportunistic buying pattern. So price grid is based on some Monte Carlo modeling that we do. And during the trading blackout window of course we have to trade under a thin Finb plan. Our trading blackout window began in early July, right, before the most recent market volatility, so that the grid that we had set up necessarily reflect the volatility that we wound up experiencing. At this point, I think you should definitely expect us to be back in the market buying back stock. -- Super. Thank you so much. -- Thanks, Rich.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. -- Hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. So you talked about how you think some of these macro issues, there are only a temporary thing or a short-term thing. I guess what gives you the confidence there. And then as you think about your lowered expectations, is it fair to say it's all coming from manufacturing or is there any reduction in your view on AEC? Thanks. -- Yeah. All right. So first off, again, let me just clarify a few things that give us confidence about the short-term impacts method is. One, half of the change in the midpoint of the guide is currency effect, OK? So, let's just make sure we all level set on that, remember it's currency effect. I think that's really important. The other thing that gives us a lot of confidence is our pipeline visibility. We have more visibility because of the changes in some of the models that we have in terms of our go-to market model with the rise of our mid-market programs and our some of our direct programs. We have quite a bit of visibility into our pipeline and we can see into our pipeline we see robust pipeline, we have visibility all the way through to the end of the year and also visibility beyond that. So we feel pretty good that some of these things are short-term effects.In addition, we don't see anything slowing down with regards to construction and with regards to our piracy conversion work. So if we just -- if we just look at a high level, those things are all kind of short-term impacts on our business. And what was the second part of your question because I thought you asked another clarifying thing about what gave me confidence on the short-term? -- Yes, that was just the confidence that it's only a short-term macro part and on the -- I think you kind of answered it, but around the guidance was it all a reduction and manufacturing or was there any incremental cost on AEC? -- Yeah, so there is no incremental view on AEC, the change in guidance came from those FX effects and our view of the impacts of the softness we saw in manufacturing in Germany, the softness we saw in the UK and the gap between our potential in China and what we're actually able to execute on. Those were really the key drivers. -- Okay, great. And if I could just sneak in one more for Scott, as you think about kind of some of the expense levers you have, if you continue to see more softness just what's kind of your willingness to maybe pull back on hiring or be more conservative you have to keep free cash flow or profitability targets in place? -- Yeah, it's a great question, Tyler. I think we've demonstrated pretty effectively over the last four years sound, spend, discipline. We continue to show to demonstrate sound, spend, discipline. We effectively kept total spend flat for X the acquisitions in Q4, we got total spend flat for four consecutive years. So there will be a bit of an opportunity for us to take up spend, at the same time we're increasing margins. If you look at this year, we talk about spend growth of 9% and margin growth of 12 percentage points of margin year-on-year. I expect margin to expand again into fiscal '21 although there is some pent-up demand percent having been flat for four consecutive years of some pent-up demand. So spending will increase, current course of speed, barring something significantly different happening in the overall macro environment, spending, we'll see a little bit of an increase again in fiscal '21. -- Thank you.Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. -- Thanks for joining us. This concludes our conference call for today. If you have any questions feel free to contact us. Thank you.Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

But make no mistake, AR is growing -- it will be worth an estimated $85 billion by 2025 -- and there are plenty of great companies betting on it.That's why investors should take a look at what ,  , and   are doing in the AR space right now.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. Your augmented reality tools won't do much unless you can feed them some virtual objects. The 3D models of proposed gadget designs had to be created by somebody. I can't think of a single company with a deeper foothold in the creative side of virtual modeling than Autodesk.Autodesk caters directly to the augmented reality industry by providing support, training, and plugins for it in many of its most popular software suites. This includes 3D modeling powerhouse 3DS Max, immersive game development platform Maya, virtual architecture tool Revit, and more. The company takes this niche seriously and is poised to profit from this opportunity for years to come.The stock isn't particularly cheap right now, but investing oracle  buying fantastic companies at a fair price rather than hunting for deep-discount bargains at every turn. Autodesk recently reshaped its business model from perpetual software licenses to a modern subscription-based service structure. With that painful change fading in the rearview mirror, Autodesk's management expects to deliver $1.35 billion of free cash flow in the 2020 fiscal year, up from breakeven in 2018.Augmented reality will play a significant role in Autodesk's drastic turnaround, not to mention the long-term opportunity it represents beyond this tipping point. It's been a rough ride for Lumentum Holdings  as its prime customer, Huawei Technologies, was banned from doing business with U.S. companies. Since the Chinese tech giant accounted for 15% of Lumentum's revenue, it was a big hit to performance.The early signs of a trade thaw between the U.S. and China have allowed Huawei to largely  with U.S. companies, although it's clear there is still risk, here, as any worsening of trade tensions could exacerbate an already tenuous situation.CEO Alan Lowe contends Lumentum is \"well positioned for fiscal 2020 and beyond\" thanks to its market-leading standing in telecom and 3D sensing markets, growing cloud and 5G wireless network deployments, and an improved commercial laser business. Of course, there's recent acquisition Oclaro's expertise, too.Apple has long been a key customer for Lumentum, but last year's $390 million investment in   dented Lumentum's hopes for more business. However, new iPhones for 2020 are expected to incorporate new laser-powered time-of-flight (ToF) 3D cameras for its rear camera lens to improve augmented reality capabilities. ToF uses lasers to quickly create 3D images of an environment.Finisar is obviously one source for the vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, or VSCELs, needed, but it may still need more from other suppliers, and it could lean more heavily on Lumentum.\u00a0In short, there's still lots of opportunity for Lumentum Holdings to experience sharp growth going forward. When Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, says things like, \"I'm a huge, huge believer in AR,\" and \"We put a lot of energy on AR,\" investors should pay attention.\u00a0Apple has been slowly, but consistently, rolling out new augmented reality features to its iPhones and iPads over the past several years, and it has also increasingly provided more tools to developers, including its ARKit, to build new AR apps.\u00a0With ARKit, developers have created apps that display furniture inside a user's living room right on an iPhone screen, and it's allowed  employees to view industrial equipment with AR and make training easier than ever before.\u00a0The beauty of Apple's AR opportunity is that the company already has hundreds of millions of devices around the world that are AR-capable, which gives Apple one of the largest AR platforms around.\u00a0In addition to that opportunity, Apple has been rumored to be working on its own AR glasses, possibly as one of its next major devices. While those plans  (no one knows for sure) investors should remember that Apple is especially adept at blending devices and software -- which is central to AR technology.\u00a0All of this means that as AR grows, Apple is likely to benefit. The company is already emerging as a leader in this space, and its plethora of AR-capable devices as well as its commitment to AR app development should keep it ahead of the competition.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This is in retaliation to the Trump Administration\u2019s plans to slap a new round of tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese imports, starting Sept. 1.In response, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 623.34 points, or 2.4% to 25,628.90, the S&P 500 index lost 75.84 points, or 2.6% to close at 2,847.11, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 239.62 points, losing 3% to close at 7,751.77.Notably, the decline came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell gave a speech at the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The President has been insisting that the Fed act to stimulate the economy as a means to counterbalance any damage the trade war might have on the economy.Powell, however, on Friday warned there is only so much the central bank can do. Powell did, however, crack the door open for a possible 25 basis-point rate cut at its next meeting in September, though he said \"the U.S. economy has continued to perform well overall.\u201dThat said, Powell tempered those remarks by saying \u201cWe have seen further evidence of a global slowdown\u201d since the Fed\u2019s last meeting in July. Following the Powell\u2019s speech, the Fed funds futures markets now sees a probability of at least a 25 basis-point cut 100%, up from 95.8% prior to the speech. The market is also betting 5% chance of a 50 basis-point cut.When the dust settled, the decline in the stock market was the fourth consecutive week of losses for the major averages.The Dow ended the week down 1%, while the S&P 500 saw a 1.4% drop and the Nasdaq lost about 2%. While stocks are becoming cheaper, it\u2019s more evident that this lingering uncertainty with U.S.-China trade makes it tough for investors to be long equities and take on additional risk, given that it is unclear how the additional tariffs will impact corporations. The issue is now even less clear after the President also referred to China's President Xi as .What\u2019s an investor to do? Treading lightly is still the name of the game at this point. Escaping macro wildcards and tweets will be hard for investors to do. Raising cash and having ample dry powder to buy on lower lows continues to be a good strategy.In the meantime, here are this week\u2019s stocks to keep an eye on.Wall Street expects Autodesk to earn 61 cents per share on revenue of $786.98 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 19 cents per share on revenue of $611.7 million.What to watch: Shares of Autodesk have been under heavy selling pressure ever since the CAD software giant reported first quarter revenue and earnings that missed analysts consensus estimates. Although Q1 revenue grew 31% year over year, the closely-watched subscription revenue of $596 million fell just below the $599.6 million analysts were looking for. Autodesk is in a multi-year transition from a licensing-focused business to a Software-as-a-Service model. While this shift has hurt its financials, the move is poised to pay strongly in the quarters and years ahead, yielding strong annual recurring revenue growth. On Tuesday the company must show that the Q1 miss was just a hiccup.Wall Street expects Box to post a per-share loss of 2 cents on revenue of $169.53 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the loss came to 5 cents per share on revenue of $148.22 million.What to watch: To what extent can Box get out of the penalty box it finds itself in. Although the company has quickly emerged as leader in the highly competitive cloud content management market segment, revenue growth has been in decline for several years. Last quarter, though revenue and EPS came in above expectations, billings growth decelerated and the company reduced guidance, eliminating the $1 billion in revenue goal by FY22, which sent the stock plunging. The company can use a healthy dose of good news. And while analysts remain broadly positive about Box\u2019s prospects, investors don\u2019t appear to have that same patience, given the high valuation of the stock.Wall Street expects Best Buy to earn 99 cents per share on revenue of $9.56 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 91 cents per share on revenue of $9.38 billion.What to watch: Retailers like Target () and Walmart () have shown they can leverage their scale and execute to withstand the lingering trade tensions that has hurt competitor. Can Best Buy do the same? The technology-focused retailer is slowly differentiating itself from with investments in omni-channel offerings as well as transformation to its supply chain. These moves, along with its increased use of technology and automation, are aimed at improving the customer experiences, while driving cost cuts. The company will announce results, however, with new rounds of tariffs that neither Target nor Walmart had to answer to. So Thursday\u2019s results will be more about the guidance than the actual numbers themselves.Wall Street expects Dell to earn $1.46 per share on revenue of $23.29 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.43 per share on revenue of $23.12 billion.What to watch: The PC market appears to be on a modest recovery, growing 1.5% to 63 million units in the second quarter,  to recent data from Gartner. \u201cWorldwide PC shipments growth was driven by demand from the Windows 10 refresh in the business market in the second quarter of 2019.\u201d This bodes well for Dell, which had a Q2 market share of 17%, trailing only HP and Lenovo. With the stock trading at around $46, or $20 below the $66 consensus price target, Dell offers an attractive risk-reward trade, especially given the company's diverse portfolio of software and hardware revenue streams.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $145.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $137.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $145.85/share today.\n\nBecause the $145.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $145.85/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $147.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.21% if the stock gets called away at the October 4th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $147.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $147.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.42% boost of extra return to the investor, or 50.69% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 45%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $145.85) to be 36%.

Q1 adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share fell 2 cents shy of estimates, while revenue of $735.5 million missed the $740 million analysts were looking for. And Although Q1 revenue grew 31% year over year, the closely-watched subscription revenue of $596 million fell just below the $599.6 million analysts were looking for.But the recent pullback in the stock could be a good buying opportunity as the Q1 results didn\u2019t dampen analysts' views of the company.

This group is broken down into the four best-rated stock picks in the small-, mid- and large-cap spaces.\nMarket value: $2.1 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.86Analysts think highly of Varonis Systems' (, $70.28) strategic plan.Like many tech stocks, the cybersecurity software company is transitioning away from selling licenses and toward a cloud-based subscription model. Although pivoting to software-as-a-service is rarely pain-free - VRNS' revenue fell 4% in Q2 - such transitions boost margins over the long haul.At the same time, VRNS is benefitting from new regulations on digital privacy such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), stricter compliance requirements and the \"ominous threat environment,\" write Wedbush analysts, who rate shares at Outperform (equivalent to Buy).\"In the numerous software business model transitions we have seen play out over the past decade, we can never remember seeing a company so quickly ramp subscription revenues in the course of a few quarters, which speaks to a massive success story so far for the company (and its investors),\" Wedbush writes.Of the 14 analysts covering the stock tracked by S&P  Intelligence, seven rate VRNS at Strong Buy, two say Buy and five call it a Hold. Their average target price of $81.46 gives Varonis implied upside of 16% over the next 12 months or so.\nMarket value: $2.3 billionDividend yield: 1.3%Analysts' average recommendation: 1.40Brooks Automation (, $32.03) has a good thing going. It's well-established in the semiconductor, solar, and chemical industries, among others, supplying clients with . But it's the firm's emergence in the life sciences sector that makes analysts especially bullish on the stock.BRKS currently has a place among semiconductor and tech stocks. But analysts think it will . That should help boost price-to-earnings ratios over time, and in turn, lift shares.\"We continue to view Brooks as one of the most compelling valuation stories with regards to Life Science investors,\" write analysts at Janney, who rate shares at Buy. \"We view the change in Brooks legacy semi/technology ownership profile will transition to primarily Life Science investors and Brooks' valuation multiple may expand.\"Stifel analysts rate shares at Buy, too, citing BRKS' emerging life sciences business, continued outperformance in the semiconductor segment and improved free cash flow generation. \"The company continues to outperform overall industry growth rates by a sizable margin, and we believe this is setting the company up for an above-average growth year in 2020,\" they write.Analysts' average target price of $42.50 gives BRKS implied upside of about 33% over the next year or so, according to S&P  Intelligence.\nMarket value: $1.1 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.38Analysts are quite taken with upstart Upland Software (, $42.73). The six-year-old software company provides cloud-based work-management software for business customers - a not-uncrowded industry.What sets UPLD apart, however, is its aggressive strategy for growth.Upland is constantly on the prowl for . It's then able to bundle the software services it picks up through M&A. Most recently, the firm bought cloud-based software provider Cimpl on Aug. 22 for $23.1 million in cash and a $2.6 million cash holdback payable in 12 months. (It also announced a guidance upgrade in concert with the acquisition.)\"Our acquisition pipeline is robust, and we are actively pursuing additional opportunities to build out our solution suites,\" said Jack McDonald, Upland chairman and CEO, in a press release.William Blair analysts, who rate the tech stock at Outperform, note that enterprise customers increasingly want bundled software, and UPLD enjoyed \"record expansion and major customer growth\" in Q2. Of the eight analysts covering Upland that are tracked by S&P  Intelligence, five rate the stock a Strong Buy, and three rate it at Buy.\nMarket value: $1.1 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.29Shares in Virtusa (, $35.35) were down 17% for the year-to-date through Aug. 21 - vs. a 17% gain for the S&P 500. Analysts spot a bargain.The company - which provides IT, business consulting and application outsourcing services - posted better-than-expected quarterly results in early August. The firm also gifted investors a share repurchase program of up to $30 million over the next 12 months.Wedbush analysts rate shares at Outperform, citing Virtusa's potential to take market share and improving margins at its Polaris subsidiary in India. \"We continue to expect a combination of pipeline strength, expanding digital mix, and record level pipeline growth in FS vertical to generate above-sector growth this year,\" they write.VRTU also wants to make strategic, niche acquisitions, Wedbush notes.Of the seven analysts covering Virtusa tracked by S&P  Intelligence, five call the stock a Strong Buy and two call them a Buy. Their average price target of $51.50 gives VRTU implied upside of about 46% over the next year or so. Analysts also expect the company to be a profit-growth machine. They forecast average annual earnings expansion of 18% over the next three to five years, according to S&P  Intelligence.\nMarket value: $7.4 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.94Dropbox (, $17.92) remains in most analysts' good graces, despite what has been a disappointing run for the cloud-storage service ever since its March 2018 initial public offering.Indeed, shares were off more than 12% for the year-to-date through Aug. 21 and now sit below their $21 IPO price. DBX beat Wall Street's quarterly profit and revenue estimates in early August, but shares still tumbled as much as 14% on the report. Weaker-than-expected billings were blamed for the selloff.Although the stock appears to have recently stabilized, it's been a tough run for the bulls.\"It's frustrating to face nearly ceaseless negativity and middling performance of the stock, but it is more frustrating to try to argue against arguments that the missing of some unguided number or deceleration of a favorite metric reflects anything other than the normal stochastic nature of real-life business operations,\" write Canaccord Genuity analysts. \"We're willing to stick with this name with a Buy rating and push back on the negative knights who say Ni.\"The broader analyst community is mixed but lean bullish. Eight analysts tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence rate DBX at Strong Buy, and three have it at Buy. But three say it's a Hold and another two say to sell Dropbox. Overall, however, their $29.64 target price gives DBX whopping implied upside of 65% - among the highest on this list of tech stocks. Earnings growth is projected to grow an average of 34% annually for the next three to five years.\nMarket value: $6.6 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.54Proofpoint (, $117.60) easily topped the Street's profit and revenue estimates when it posted second-quarter results in late July. The cybersecurity company, which enjoyed a 17% increase in billings, is seeing increased benefits from bundling cloud-based services for clients.\"We see Proofpoint as the leading cloud email security vendor, offering customers a best-of-breed messaging security solution,\" write Stifel analysts, who rate shares at Buy. \"In addition, the company has been one of the more successful acquirers within the group, leveraging M&A to drive sustained greater-than-market growth.\"Proofpoint is outperforming tech stocks as a whole, up about 40% so far in 2019 versus 29% for the sector. The pros expect more performance ahead. Their average target price of $144.50 gives PFPT stock implied upside of about 23% over the next year or so.Analysts expect Proofpoint to grow profits at 26% annually on average over the next three to five years. Twenty-nine analysts are covering PFPT at the moment - 18 rate it a Strong Buy, seven say it's a Buy and the remaining four call it a Hold.\nMarket value: $3.2 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.50Viavi Solutions (, $13.88) specializes in testing and monitoring various types of communications networks, such as broadband, copper, Wi-Fi and fiber optic. Analysts are bullish on its growth prospects, thanks partly to the rollout of next-generation (5G) wireless networks.\"We continue to believe the company's wireless and fiber test businesses are in the early stages of a multi-year investment cycle as (original equipment manufacturers) and service providers begin their transition to 5G and fiber is deployed deeper into networks,\" write Stifel analysts, who rate VIAV at Buy.The company is forecast to generate average annual earnings growth of more than 12% over the next three to five years, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Analysts average price target of $15.35 gives VIAV implied upside of about 10% over the next year or so - that small relative upside is largely because the stock has been quickly sprinting toward that price target, up 37% year-to-date. Analysts may soon need to re-evaluate and adjust.Seven analysts rate VIAV at Strong Buy, one says Buy and two have it at Hold, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nMarket value: $4.6 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.31Lumentum Holdings (, $59.71) makes optical communications devices that help power telecom networks and data center communications equipment, among a wide range of other products. But it's perhaps best known as the company that makes the 3D facial-recognition sensors for Apple's () iPhones.The relentless growth of cloud-based services bodes well for the data-center businesses of tech stocks such as LITE, as does the build-out of 5G networks. And thanks to last year's acquisition of optical-components maker Oclaro, Lumentum is set to make the most of its chances.\"Our Buy rating on shares of LITE is based on our expectation that the newly combined Lumentum + Oclaro is better positioned for continued growth in its core telecom optical market, should see improving economics in the datacom market with greater scale and the entry of new lower-cost high-speed products and long-term growth opportunities in 3D sensing,\" Stifel analysts write.All 16 analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence are bullish on this tech stock - 11 call it a Strong Buy, with the other five at Buy. Their average price target of $71.39 suggests LITE will gain 20% over the next 12 months or so.\nMarket value: $32.1 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.76Autodesk (, $145.95) is by far and away the Big Kahuna when it comes to software that allows architects, engineers, manufacturers - you name it - to design complicated projects in three dimensions.Investors are getting a bit hinky about the slowdown in the global economy, but these macro concerns haven't put a damper on analysts' enthusiasm for ADSK stock. At least not yet. We'll get more clarity after the computer-assisted design company posts quarterly results, currently slated for Aug. 27. Generally, a slowdown in manufacturing is not good for Autodesk.Keybanc analysts recently surveyed Autodesk's North American resellers. The takeaway was that the software company should hit its quarterly numbers. Keybanc reiterated its Overweight (Buy) rating on shares. Longer-term, Stifel, which calls shares a Buy, likes ADSK's opportunities in 3D printing and increasing use of digital design in the architecture, engineering and construction industries.Out of 25 analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 14 rate ADSK at Strong Buy, four say Buy, six have it a Hold and one says Sell. Their average target price of $184.29 gives shares implied upside of 26% over the next year to 18 months.\nMarket value: $129.2 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.75To say PayPal (, $109.82) garners a lot of interest on the part of Wall Street analysts would be an understatement. More equity research shops keep tabs on the digital payments company than Microsoft (), the world's largest publicly traded company by a wide margin.Fully 40 analysts cover PayPal, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. They're bullish: 21 rate PYPL at Strong Buy, nine say Buy, nine have it at Hold and one says Sell.Shares in PayPal have tumbled about 9% after hitting an all-time high in late July. The culprit? The company cut its full-year revenue outlook when it posted second-quarter results. Shares had been a white-hot tear heading into the earnings release, which set them up for a significant drawdown on anything less than a perfect report. (The broader market's tantrum didn't help.)Analysts aren't fazed. If anything, the recent drop makes PayPal even more attractive. Wedbush rates the stock at Outperform based on \"continued hyper growth from mobile payment transactions,\" the ramping up of Venmo digital wallet and contributions from Xoom money transfer service.With an average target price of $127.51, PYPL stock has implied upside of 16%. Analysts expect earnings to grow at an average annual pace of almost 19% over the next three to five years.\nMarket value: $73.4 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.64Digital payments, payments processors and pretty all things to do with financial tech are hot these days. Even Berkshire Hathaway (), whose CEO and Chairman is the typically tech-averse Warren Buffett, is making multimillion-dollar investments in fintech.Fiserv (, $107.56) is not a  as of this writing, but it does exemplify much of what Buffett likes about companies that facilitate financial transaction processing - ample opportunities for growth and economies of scale.FISV, which recently acquired First Data in a $22 billion all-stock transaction, certainly has the scale part working in its favor.\"We specifically like the company's positioning, acting as a strategic partner to large and small community banks undergoing dramatic transformation in their business model (shifting to digital-like services),\" write Wedbush analysts, who rate FISV stock at Outperform.Of the 25 analysts covering FISV tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 16 rate the stock at Strong Buy, four say Buy, four call it a Hold and one holdout says it's a Strong Sell.\nMarket value: $1.06 trillionDividend yield: 1.3%Analysts' average recommendation: 1.46It's no surprise that sitting atop this list of analyst-loved tech stocks is Microsoft (, $138.79). The folks in Redmond, Washington, have been killing it for some time now. The software king's cloud-computing business has propelled a long-sleepy stock into the stratosphere.As noted above, Microsoft is the world's biggest publicly traded company and the only one with a market value of at least $1 trillion. No. 2 Apple, a massive stock in its own right, trails MSFT by around $100 billion in market capitalization.Canaccord Genuity analysts, who rate shares at Buy, write the \"juggernaut is set to continue\" thanks to Microsoft's arsenal of growth drivers that include Azure cloud computing, Office 365 and the Xbox gaming ecosystem.\"When we hear investors get jumpy because MSFT continues to advance in 'beast mode,' we suggest they relax and enjoy what looks to us to be several more years of above-average growth and price appreciation,\" Canaccord Genuity writes.Of the 35 analysts tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 23 have MSFT at Strong Buy, 10 say Buy, one calls it a Hold ... and one bear is hanging on to a Strong Sell call. Perhaps most impressively for a trillion-dollar company, earnings are forecast to grow an average of more than 12% a year for the next three to five years - not an easy feat for such a gigantic corporation.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors in Autodesk Inc (Symbol: ADSK) saw new options begin trading today, for the September 6th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new September 6th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $160.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.30.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $160.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $152.70 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $161.63/share today.\n\nBecause the $160.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.56% return on the cash commitment, or 42.70% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc, and highlighting in green where the $160.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $162.50 strike price has a current bid of $7.80.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $161.63/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $162.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.36% if the stock gets called away at the September 6th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $162.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $162.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.83% boost of extra return to the investor, or 45.16% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 40%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 39%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $161.63) to be 38%.

While the transition was painful -- revenue has been flat over the last few years and profits have plunged -- the company is finally on the verge of reaping the rewards from the transition.In this week's episode of\u00a0, host Dylan Lewis and  contributor Brian Feroldi discuss Autodesk's financial results in detail and share why they believe the company is poised to post strong profit growth from here.To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our\u00a0. A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Autodesk wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0 Brian, one of the reasons that I love having you on the show is that you are always bringing stock ideas to the table. I think more than most of our writers, you really like looking for new opportunities, new places for people to put their money. You came to me with an idea that you were excited about. That's why we're talking about Autodesk today.Autodesk is a company that I don't think a lot of investors have on their radar or know about at all. And yet, this is a business that's worth about $30 billion. It is truly a software giant, but it does fly under the radar. For the unacquainted, what does it do? Autodesk, their flagship product most listeners have probably heard of, it's called AutoCAD. The CAD stands for computer-aided design. This software has been around for almost four decades now. It's used by professionals of all types -- architects, project managers, engineers, graphic designers, even city planners and construction professionals. They use AutoCAD to design, fabricate, manufacture countless products -- everything from small, individual products to basically city-sized projects. Users can basically draw their models in 2D or 3D, print them out, make design changes rapidly. It's a step change better than the old method of drawing things by hand. Any of our listeners out there that work in any of those fields -- engineering, architecture, etc. -- are probably like, \"Yes! Finally, they are talking about AutoCAD! They're talking about Autodesk!\" All the professions that you laid out there. They have a bunch of different types of software, but they generally operate in a very specific type of software environment.Yeah, which is I think a big reason why this company goes under the radar a little bit for most investors. They don't make consumer products. A couple of weeks ago, we talked about . I think a lot of our listeners have probably at least heard of or use maybe Photoshop or Premiere or something like that. To get into Autodesk's products, and they have a range, you really have to be a professional in that field. This isn't something that most people will play with on their own.To give listeners a sense, their main products are AutoCAD; they also have a product called Revit, which is for building information modeling; Maya, which is used for high-end 3D animations, it's used to make 3D animated movies, for example; Fusion 360 is used for product design; BIM 360 is used for construction management. And that's really just the tip of the iceberg and the most well-known. This company literally has dozens of software products that are out there. One of the reasons to love them is, they have made the tough and very difficult switch that almost all software companies have to make at some point. It's almost like going through puberty. They were on the licensing model for quite some time, and they have decided to make the switch over to software as a service. A little bit painful, but it's ultimately what you want to see for a business like this.Yeah, this is a trend that we've seen over and over again and we've talked about numerous times on the show. Adobe Systems, , , all the big software companies that have been selling software for decades under the licensing model have transitioned over to the software-as-a-service model. It is painful in the short term. Your revenue takes a hit, your net income and your cash flow sink. But after the painful transition period is over, you reap rewards for years and years. And that's exactly what we've seen from Autodesk over the last couple of years.Brian, looking at the books for this company, let's talk financials. What do you see?Autodesk was pulling in about $2.5 billion in fiscal 2016, which was right before they started to go whole hog in on the SaaS transition. The year after that, their revenue actually fell to about $2 billion. It took about three years for it to return to that $2.6 billion that it hit in 2016. The last couple of years have seen basically flat on the top line. However, now that the transition is behind them, and they are really starting to kick in on the SaaS side, their revenue is now growing very quickly. The estimates for fiscal 2020, which is the current year, is about 22% top-line growth. To give listeners some perspective, that number is about 40% U.S. and 60% international. This is predominantly an international business. That is one of the reasons right there why you read the conference calls and you look at company management. If you are simply looking at the results the company has put up over the last couple of years, you are scratching your head and wondering why we're talking about this business. It looks ugly. You need to have the commentary and understand what's going on with the transition to SaaS and the expectations for where management thinks this business will be going.One of the reasons I'm so excited about this company is gross margins, Brian. This looks like a SaaS company when it comes to gross margins. 89%, and that's been climbing quite a bit over the last couple of years.Yeah, their gross margins were exceptionally strong, as we've seen in so many software companies, prior to the transition because the licensing model is very lucrative. But their gross margin did decline after the transition was happening, mostly because revenue was plunging. But we have seen a return of gross margin rising in recent years. I do think there's reason for investors to believe that number can continue pushing higher as the scale continues to grow.Unfortunately, they are not profitable on a GAAP basis yet. Some of that tied to that transition, like were talking about. I imagine at some point down the road, you have a business that's putting off the margins that they are putting off, it's going to find a way to become profitable after these early investments have been made. So I'm not super concerned about that. There are some other things to be mindful of. They have a net debt position, so more debt on the balance sheet than cash. But there are some good things when you look at free cash flow and you look at their non-GAAP profitability. Yes, their non-GAAP numbers, as you said, which is a nonstandard accounting record, are positive. The big reason for that delta is mostly because of stock-based compensation, which is something we'll touch on later in the show. They also do have a net debt cash position of about $1.1 billion in net debt on the balance sheet. Some of that is because this company has been actively repurchasing its own stock. They also make acquisitions on occasion to build out their software offering. The numbers here wouldn't scream at you fantastic; however, once you get the idea of the transition in your mind, you actually see that now that they're in the tail end, the numbers are going to get better and better from here, and they are pumping out free cash flow. And all these numbers, I believe, are poised to rise substantially. Backward-looking financials aren't the best. Forward-looking financials look pretty darn good.If you are comparing a SaaS company to maybe a baseball player, one of the numbers that you want to see on the back of the baseball card is the net revenue retention rate number. That's pretty much like on-base percentage for a SaaS company. You want to see that they are getting customers to spend more as each cohort ages a year out. It's like a comps number for restaurants. We don't have a precise one here for this business, which irks me a little bit, but they give a range. Yeah, they say that their net revenue retention range is consistently between their target, which is 110% to 120%. As you said, we don't get an exact figure. But that is a healthy range to be in the middle of, so it does indicate that they are growing sales within their current paying-customer base at a pretty healthy clip. That range that they offer isn't the best that we've ever seen, but it is very strong for a company of Autodesk's size and scale. So I think investors should be pretty happy there. Yeah, what that says is, not only can they grow by acquiring customers once they have customers in the ecosystem, they will hopefully be collecting more dollars from them down the road as well. It seems like there is quite an opportunity here. While some customers have made that transition to the SaaS model that they are trying to push, a lot of legacy customers have not, and that remains one of the big growth levers for this business. Yeah, that was the thing that jumped off at me at the page when I was starting to research this company in depth. Again, Autodesk has had its software under a licensing model for decades. When you do that, you as a user, if you paid the hefty licensing fee, say five or even 10 years ago, that software still works on your computer. You can still design with it. When they made the SaaS transition to a subscription model, they've converted about 4.3 million of their customers over to a SaaS model, which sounds like a huge number. But the exciting thing for investors is, there are 18 million active users of their software. That means that 14 million people are out there actively using Autodesk's products, are dependent on it, but have not yet subscribed. That is a massive untapped opportunity for this business. Sometimes you'll hear numbers like that when you talk about a freemium model business. I know when I was looking at the prospectus for , they were saying, \"Oh, we have this tiny portion of paying members and hundreds of millions of people that use the service, or tens of millions of people that use the service for free.\" They always love to promote the idea that, \"We have this huge growth lever if we can just convert a slightly higher percentage of those free users.\" But these are people that are actually paying for the software, and will probably need an upgrade at some point. You can only run on legacy software for so long before it starts to become a hindrance to your business. Yeah, that's the exciting thing here. As you said, these were 18 million people who purchased some Autodesk product at some point in the past and just have yet to make the transition to the SaaS model. Autodesk is wisely investing heavily right now in R&D to make the software-as-a-service product as compelling as possible. One thing that they call out that I'm particularly excited about is, they're investing heavily in augmented reality and virtual reality functionality so that they can build that directly into their products. While those markets haven't caught on on the consumer side, I can easily see them being a big deal in the construction business. Imagine, for example, that you want to build a house and you're working with an architect. Well, using augmented reality or virtual reality, you could literally put on a headset using AutoCAD software and walk through the designed house before anything was being built at all. You as the consumer can go around and see what the lighting looks like, see what the layout looks like. That's when you can really give feedback to the designer. It will also help the designer to close on the sales process. I think the AR/VR angle could potentially be a huge growth driver for this business in the long term. Yeah, that's some Jetsons-level tech in my view. That's the kind of thing that you wildly fantasize about being possible at some point down the road. One of the other things to be excited about with this company is, they see a far larger total addressable market out there than what they are currently capturing in revenue. Yeah. They call out infrastructure, the global rising middle class, and a huge push toward, believe it or not, green design, to make buildings as energy efficient and with as few resources as possible, as all drivers to push more people into relying on AutoCAD products. For a sense of scale here, management pegs its total addressable market opportunity today at about $48 billion. They see that number jumping to $59 billion by 2023. For perspective, their revenue estimate for this year is $3.3 billion. So, literally 10x TAM potential, as management sees it.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking at options trading activity among components of the Russell 3000 index, there is noteworthy activity today in Okta Inc (Symbol: OKTA), where a total volume of 9,680 contracts has been traded thus far today, a contract volume which is representative of approximately 968,000 underlying shares (given that every 1 contract represents 100 underlying shares).

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new September 13th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $140.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $132.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $141.82/share today.\n\nBecause the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.58% if the stock gets called away at the September 13th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0Welcome to , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, July 19, and we're talking Autodesk, ADSK. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by 's Brian Feroldi. Brian, what's up?Hey, Dylan! How's it going?It's worth noting here that we are taping this episode on July 2nd. It will be live on July 19th. I have to pre-tape this one because I'm going to be out of the office for a little bit, Brian.\u00a0 It sounds like you have an interesting vacation. Where are you off to?I'm going to be heading to the Philippines with my girlfriend, Jess. She's from Manila, so we're going back to go to a friend's wedding and meet her family, and hang out there. It should be pretty fun!That sounds like a high pressure vacation you're going on there, Dylan. [laughs] I've met her mom before. I haven't met her dad yet. I haven't met her entire extended family. I'm working myself up a little bit, pumping myself up, trying to learn what I can. I watched the  episode about Manila the other night. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling ready!I like it! Way to go! Just dive head into that. See how that works out. [laughs]\u00a0 [laughs] Brian, one of the reasons that I love having you on the show is that you are always bringing stock ideas to the table. I think more than most of our writers, you really like looking for new opportunities, new places for people to put their money. You came to me with an idea that you were excited about. That's why we're talking about Autodesk today.Autodesk is a company that I don't think a lot of investors have on their radar or know about at all. And yet, this is a business that's worth about $30 billion. It is truly a software giant, but it does fly under the radar. For the unacquainted, what does it do? Autodesk, their flagship product most listeners have probably heard of, it's called AutoCAD. The CAD stands for computer aided design. This software has been around for almost four decades now. It's used by professionals of all types -- architects, project managers, engineers, graphic designers, even city planners and construction professionals. They use AutoCAD to design, fabricate, manufacture countless products -- everything from small individual products to basically city-sized projects. Users can basically draw their models in 2D or 3D, print them out, make design changes rapidly. It's a step change better than the old method of drawing things by hand. Any of our listeners out there that work in any of those fields -- engineering, architecture, etc. -- are probably like, \"Yes! Finally, they are talking about AutoCAD! They're talking about Autodesk!\" All the professions that you laid out there. They have a bunch of different types of software, but they generally operate in a very specific type of software environment.Yeah, which is I think a big reason why this company goes under the radar a little bit for most investors. They don't make consumer products. A couple of weeks ago, we talked about . I think a lot of our listeners have probably at least heard of or use maybe Photoshop or Premiere or something like that. To get into Autodesk's products, and they have a range, you really have to be a professional in that field. This isn't something that most people will play with on their own.\u00a0To give listeners a sense, their main products are AutoCAD, they also have a product called Revit, which is for building information modeling; Maya, which is used for high-end 3D animations, it's used to make 3D animated movies, for example; Fusion 360 is used for product design; BIM 360 is used for construction management. And that's really just the tip of the iceberg and the most well-known. This company literally has dozens of software products that are out there. One of the reasons to love them is, they have made the tough and very difficult switch that almost all software companies have to make at some point. It's almost like going through puberty. They were on the licensing model for quite some time, and\u00a0they have decided to make the switch over to software-as-a-service. A little bit painful, but it's ultimately what you want to see for a business like this.Yeah, this is a trend that we've seen over and over again and we've talked about numerous times on the show. Adobe Systems, , , all the big software companies that have been selling software for decades under the licensing model, have transitioned over to the software-as-a-service model. It is painful in the short term. Your revenue takes a hit, your net income and your cash flow sink. But after the painful transition period is over, the reap awards for years and years. And that's exactly what we've seen from Autodesk over the last couple of years.Brian, looking at the books for this company, let's talk financials. What do you see?Autodesk was pulling in about $2.5 billion in fiscal 2016, which was right before they started to go whole hog in on the SaaS transition. The year after that, their revenue actually fell to about $2 billion. It took about three years for it to return to that $2.6 billion that it hit in 2016. The last couple of years have seen basically flat on the top line. However, now that the transition is behind them, and they are really starting to kick in on the SaaS side, their revenue is now growing very quickly. The estimates for fiscal 2020, which is the current year, is about 22% top line growth. To give listeners some perspective, that number is about 40% U.S. and 60% international. This is predominantly an international business. That is one of the reasons right there why you read the conference calls and you look at company management. If you are simply looking at the results the company has put up over the last couple of years, you are scratching your head and wondering why we're talking about this business. It looks ugly. You need to have the commentary and understand what's going on with the transition to SaaS and the expectations for where management thinks this business will be going.\u00a0One of the reasons I'm so excited about this company is gross margins, Brian. This looks like a SaaS company when it comes to gross margins. 89%, and that's been climbing quite a bit over the last couple of years.\u00a0Yeah, their gross margins were exceptionally strong, as we've seen in so many software companies, prior to the transition because the licensing model is very lucrative. But their gross margin did decline after the transition was happening, mostly because revenue was plunging. But we have seen a return of gross margin rising in recent years. I do think there's a reason for investors to believe that number can continue pushing higher as the scale continues to grow.\u00a0Unfortunately, they are not profitable on a GAAP basis yet. Some of that tied to that transition, like were talking about. I imagine at some point down the road, you have a business that's putting off the margins that they are putting off, it's going to find a way to become profitable after these early investments have been made. So, I'm not super concerned about that. There are some other things to be mindful of. They have a net debt position, so more debt on the balance sheet than cash. But there are some good things when you look at free cash flow and you look at their non-GAAP profitability. Yes, their non-GAAP numbers, as you said, which is a nonstandard accounting record, are positive. The big reason for that delta is mostly because of stock-based compensation, which is something we'll touch on later in the show. They also do have a debt cash position of about $1.1 billion in net debt on the balance sheet. Some of that is because this company has been actively repurchasing its own stock. They also make acquisitions on occasion to build out their software offering. The numbers here wouldn't scream at you fantastic; however, once you get the idea of the transition in your mind, you actually see that now that they're in the tail end, the numbers are going to get better and better from here, and they are pumping out free cash flow. And all these numbers, I believe, are poised to rise substantially. Backward-looking financials aren't the best. Forward-looking financials look pretty darn good.If you are comparing a SaaS company to maybe a baseball player, one of the numbers that you want to see on the back of the baseball card is the net revenue retention rate number. That's pretty much like on base percentage for a SaaS company. You want to see that they are getting customers to spend more as each cohort ages a year out. It's like a comps number for restaurants. We don't have a precise one here for this business, which irks me a little bit, but they give a range. Yeah, they say that their net revenue retention range is consistently between their target, which is 110% to 120%. As you said, we don't get an exact figure. But that is a healthy range to be in the middle of, so it does indicate that they are growing sales within their current paying customer base at a pretty healthy clip. That range that they offer isn't the best that we've ever seen, but it is very strong for a company of Autodesk's size and scale. So I think investors should be pretty happy there. Yeah, what that says is, not only can they grow by acquiring customers once they have customers in the ecosystem, they will hopefully be collecting more dollars from them down the road as well. It seems like there is quite an opportunity here. While some customers have made that transition to the SaaS model that they are trying to push, a lot of legacy customers have not, and that remains one of the big growth levers for this business. Yeah, that was the thing that jumped off at me at the page when I was starting to research this company in depth. Again, Autodesk has had its software under a licensing model for decades. When you do that, you as a user, if you paid the hefty licensing fee, say five or even 10 years ago, that software still works on your computer. You can still design with it. When they made this the SaaS transition to a subscription model, they've converted about 4.3 million of their customers over to a SaaS model, which sounds like a huge number. But the exciting thing for investors is, there are 18 million active users of their software. That means that 14 million people are out there actively using Autodesk's products, are dependent on it, but have not yet subscribed. That is a massive untapped opportunity for this business. Sometimes you'll hear numbers like that when you talk about a freemium model business. I know when I was looking at the prospectus for , they were saying, \"Oh, we have this tiny portion of paying members and hundreds of millions of people that use the service, or tens of millions of people that use the service for free.\" They always love to promote the idea that, \"We have this huge growth lever if we can just convert a slightly higher percentage of those free users.\" But these are people that are actually paying for the software, and will probably need an upgrade at some point. You can only run on legacy software for so long before it starts to become a hindrance to your business. Yeah, that's the exciting thing here. As you said, these were 18 million people who purchased some Autodesk product at some point in the past and just have yet to make the transition to the SaaS model. Autodesk is wisely investing heavily right now in R&D to make the software-as-a-service product as compelling as possible. One thing that they call out that I'm particularly excited about is, they're investing heavily in augmented reality and virtual reality functionality so that they can build that directly into their products. While those markets haven't caught on on the consumer side, I can easily see them being a big deal in the construction business. Imagine, for example, that you want to build a house and you're working with an architect. Well, using augmented reality or virtual reality, you could literally put on a headset using AutoCAD software and walk through the designed house before anything was being built at all. You as the consumer can go around and see what the lighting looks like, see what the layout looks like. That's when you can really give feedback to the designer. It will also help the designer to close on the sales process. I think the AR/VR angle could potentially be a huge growth driver for this business in the long term. Yeah, that's some Jetsons-level tech in my view. That's the kind of thing that you wildly fantasize about being possible at some point down the road. One of the other things to be excited about with this company is, they see a far larger total addressable market out there than what they are currently capturing in revenue. Yeah. They call out infrastructure, the global rising middle class, and a huge push toward, believe it or not, green design, to make buildings as energy efficient and with as few resources as possible, as all drivers to push more people into relying on AutoCAD products. For a sense of scale here, management pegs its total addressable market opportunity today at about $48 billion. They see that number jumping to $59 billion by 2023. For perspective, their revenue estimate for this year is $3.3 billion. So, literally 10X TAM potential as management sees it. Yeah. A lot of big growth opportunities for this business. All right, Brian, you have a ringer that you like to throw stocks through. We have talked about some of the things that I think a lot of people would tend to hit on when they are looking at a business. Look at the books, look at some of the opportunity out there. We're going to dig into some of the things that you always make sure to check the boxes on. One of the first things, particularly in the software-as-a-services space, is customers -- specifically, do we have customer concentration? Yep. You have to think about customers from a number of angles. The entire SaaS model falls apart if you have trouble attracting, and importantly, retaining, customers. That's why we like to put any business through a checklist. On the customer side, is acquiring them expensive? Well, in Autodesk's case, I do think the answer is yes. There are significant barriers to entry to learning how to use the software, and the company spends heavily on sales and marketing to get the word out. Those investments, I think, are worthwhile because as we saw from the net dollar expansion rate, once they do become customers, they do become very sticky. So, that expense is OK in my books.\u00a0Are they dependent on the software? Well, I think the answer there is yes. Once you take the time to go through and learn it, you can continue to use it. Is Autodesk's revenue recurring? In this case, yes. Now that they've made the transition to a SaaS model, their revenue is almost all recurring in nature. Does this company have pricing power? Well, we've seen the gross margin rising in recent years, so I think the answer is yes.\u00a0Overall, I think that these are typical things that you see of any successful software-as-a-service business.Yeah, I think you're absolutely right there. One of the things, it's not a very measurable thing -- I mean, I guess you could look at market share, but the thing that I love to see with the software-as-a-service segment is, is whatever this company offering industry standard? If so, even if the acquisition costs are a little high for customers, it's going to be really hard for someone else to come in there and disrupt the model. Not only do you have all of the regular stickiness that comes with a software product, but you have a market-leading position, which is huge, and you have customers that truly need the product in the case of these designers, these architects, these engineers. So, that makes me willing to give the benefit of the doubt to a company that may have some higher acquisition costs than the average business.Yeah, and these are products that take months or even years to master and learn how to use. Once you've spent the time to do that, the switching costs become enormous. That's something that's very attractive for investors.\u00a0All right, next on the checklist, we have management and company culture. What do you see there?\u00a0Well, let's start at the top. The CEO is Andrew Anagnost. He has only been on the job for a few years. One thing that we like to see as Foolish investors is huge inside ownership. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. He owns about 31,000 shares of stock, which is worth about $5 million at current prices. That's not nothing, but this is a $30 billion business, so that is not even close to a rounding error. But, the good thing for investors is that the CEO is required to own 6X his base salary in stock. That way, his incentives are sort of aligned with investors. But, the business is almost 40 years old. This has been publicly traded for a long time, it's been a very successful company. It would be wrong of us to assume that the inside ownership rates would be very high here. But that is something that we always like to see.\u00a0Let's look at the culture. We always check out companies on glassdoor.com. This company gets four stars out of five on Glassdoor. The CEO rating is 84%. Employees seem to like working here, and they seem to give it good reviews.\u00a0So, not the best management and company culture that we've ever seen, but I think it's perfectly acceptable. When you look out big picture at the business, any big red flags for you? No. You mentioned one before about customer concentration. The company does have more than four million paying customers at this point, which, as we talked about, is a small number compared to what we think it could be in the long term. The industry itself does not face any long-term headwinds. In fact, there are significant tailwinds behind this business.\u00a0The one thing I will point out is, this business does rely on an outside force for its success, more so than we've talked about with other SaaS businesses. These guys sell their software to architects, construction managers, so there is a need for worldwide spending on infrastructure and building projects to be strong. You could see, if that industry did take a cyclical downturn, that it would be very hard for Autodesk to grow. Now, offsetting that is their amazing opportunity to convert current customers. They may be able to at least tread water, if not post modest growth even during an industry downturn. But that is something for investors to keep in mind.\u00a0And then finally, we always look at stock-based compensation, which was not insignificant. This company spent $250 million last year in stock-based compensation. That's a pretty high number for a company that's doing just over $3 billion in revenue. But offsetting that is, this company has been a buyer of its own stock pretty heavily, so that its share count has actually declined over the last couple of years, even with a pretty hefty stock-based compensation.\u00a0So, nothing that would be a red flag for me, but maybe a slight yellow coloration flag on some of these.\u00a0What gets me excited looking at a business like this and looking at the growth rates that management is throwing out there is, you think about the growth that a company might be putting out there, the subscription rates, the renewal rates, all these types of stuff. They're saying like 22% growth, that's what they're eyeing. 26% growth compounded for three years puts the company at a double, just about. So, if you're in a business where most of your revenue's recurring, you have customers spending more money, and you're growing in the low 20% [range], even though they're already a fairly large business for a niche SaaS company, I still think there's a lot of room for this company to grow, especially if they can maintain growth rates in the high teens or low 20s.Yeah, I completely agree. $30 billion, which we've talked about a couple of times as their market cap, sounds huge. But Adobe cracks $100 billion, and Microsoft is a trillion. When you think about those numbers for comparison, even though Autodesk does provide a more niche product than, say, Microsoft would produce, I believe that there is still substantial upside, even though this company is very sizable already.\u00a0You mentioned the growth rates, which are very strong. Wall Street is pricing this business for growth. Its stock has been a terrific performer over the last couple of years. The valuation here is stretched. We see about 13.5X sales right now, and about 36X next year's non-GAAP earnings. Those are high numbers. But I believe that the business has so much going for it, and there's so much visibility into this company's growth, that those numbers are not crazy. I think this stock is actually a buy today. Are you putting this one on your watch list right now, Brian?Oh, yes, this one is actually at the top of my watch list right now.

After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Autodesk wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0 All right, Brian, you have a wringer that you like to throw stocks through. We have talked about some of the things that I think a lot of people would tend to hit on when they are looking at a business. Look at the books, look at some of the opportunity out there. We're going to dig into some of the things that you always make sure to check the boxes on. One of the first things, particularly in the software-as-a-services space, is customers -- specifically, do we have customer concentration? Yep. You have to think about customers from a number of angles. The entire SaaS model falls apart if you have trouble attracting, and importantly, retaining, customers. That's why we like to put any business through a checklist. On the customer side, is acquiring them expensive? Well, in Autodesk's case, I do think the answer is yes. There are significant barriers to entry to learning how to use the software, and the company spends heavily on sales and marketing to get the word out. Those investments, I think, are worthwhile because as we saw from the net dollar expansion rate, once they do become customers, they do become very sticky. So that expense is OK in my books.Are they dependent on the software? Well, I think the answer there is yes. Once you take the time to go through and learn it, you continue to use it. Is Autodesk's revenue recurring? In this case, yes. Now that they've made the transition to a SaaS model, their revenue is almost all recurring in nature. Does this company have pricing power? Well, we've seen the gross margin rising in recent years, so I think the answer is yes.Overall, I think that these are typical things that you see of any successful software-as-a-service business.Yeah, I think you're absolutely right there. One of the things, it's not a very measurable thing -- I mean, I guess you could look at market share, but the thing that I love to see with the software-as-a-service segment is, is whatever this company offering industry standard? If so, even if the acquisition costs are a little high for customers, it's going to be really hard for someone else to come in there and disrupt the model. Not only do you have all of the regular stickiness that comes with a software product, but you have a market-leading position, which is huge, and you have customers that truly need the product, in the case of these designers, these architects, these engineers. That makes me willing to give the benefit of the doubt to a company that may have some higher acquisition costs than the average business.Yeah, and these are products that take months or even years to master and learn how to use. Once you've spent the time to do that, the switching costs become enormous. That's something that's very attractive for investors.All right, next on the checklist, we have management and company culture. What do you see there?Well, let's start at the top. The CEO is Andrew Anagnost. He has only been on the job for a few years. One thing that we like to see, as Foolish investors, is huge inside ownership. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. He owns about 31,000 shares of stock, which is worth about $5 million at current prices. That's not nothing, but this is a $30 billion business, so that is not even close to a rounding error. But the good thing for investors is that the CEO is required to own six times his base salary in stock. That way, his incentives are sort of aligned with investors. But the business is almost 40 years old. This has been publicly traded for a long time, it's been a very successful company. It would be wrong of us to assume that the insider ownership rates would be very high here. But that is something that we always like to see.Let's look at the culture. We always check out companies on glassdoor.com. This company gets four stars out of five on Glassdoor. The CEO rating is 84%. Employees seem to like working here, and they seem to give it good reviews.So, not the best management and company culture that we've ever seen, but I think it's perfectly acceptable. When you look out big picture at the business, any big red flags for you? No. You mentioned one before about customer concentration. The company does have more than 4 million paying customers at this point, which, as we talked about, is a small number compared to what we think it could be in the long term. The industry itself does not face any long-term headwinds. In fact, there are significant tailwinds behind this business.The one thing I will point out is, this business does rely on an outside force for its success, more so than we've talked about with other SaaS businesses. These guys sell their software to architects, construction managers, so there is a need for worldwide spending on infrastructure and building projects to be strong. You could see, if that industry did take a cyclical downturn, that it would be very hard for Autodesk to grow. Now, offsetting that is their amazing opportunity to convert current customers. They may be able to at least tread water, if not post modest growth even during an industry downturn. But that is something for investors to keep in mind.And then finally, we always look at stock-based compensation, which was not insignificant. This company spent $250 million last year in stock-based compensation. That's a pretty high number for a company that's doing just over $3 billion in revenue. But offsetting that is, this company has been a buyer of its own stock pretty heavily, so that its share count has actually declined over the last couple of years, even with a pretty hefty stock-based compensation.So, nothing that would be a red flag for me, but maybe a slight yellow coloration flag on some of these.What gets me excited looking at a business like this and looking at the growth rates that management is throwing out there is, you think about the growth that a company might be putting out there, the subscription rates, the renewal rates, all these types of stuff.

Even after\u00a0 last week, stock in the provider of design software to multiple industries is still priced at 33 times forward one-year earnings.Of course, consistent expansion does much to create a positive market valuation. Below, let's look at three exemplary metrics from Autodesk's first quarter that provide insight into its current financial prospects.Autodesk's direct revenue rose 36% year over year and represented 30% of first-quarter sales. As you can infer, the company's primary revenue channel is indirect sales. The indirect channel has a two-tiered structure: Autodesk sells its products to distributors, who in turn sell to authorized Autodesk resellers. Last year, indirect sales made up 71% of total company revenue.Autodesk is intent on moving its largest accounts to direct-only business. The company has created a customer-engagement team to help ensure the satisfaction of enterprise customers, while also offering additional solutions. In effect, this group doubles as a sales team. But the company is also aiming to expand its direct channel over time through its Autodesk-branded online store. During the first quarter, sales in the Autodesk store expanded by 45% year over year.Higher direct revenue will only help increase the company's profits. Since purposefully diminishing customer maintenance contracts in recent years in favor of product subscriptions, the organization's gross profitability has improved dramatically: In the current quarter,  improved by 1 percentage point, to roughly 89%. Additional direct sales will push gross margin even higher and help Autodesk overcome its relatively high marketing and sales expense, which is the company's biggest expense line item and a typical culprit behind slight but frequent quarterly net losses.\u00a0\u00a0Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, is one of the most closely watched metrics among Autodesk investors. This metric tracks the health of the company's business model, which was tweaked four years ago to favor recurring and predictable subscription revenue.In the last three months, ARR increased by 33%, to $2.83 billion, against the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and rose 3% sequentially against the fourth quarter. While this is laudable, Autodesk's recurring revenue for cloud-based products is outpacing total ARR considerably. Cloud ARR jumped by 164% year over year, to $181 million in the first quarter. After removing the effects of recent acquisitions, cloud ARR increased by a still-torrid 43%, to $98 million.Cloud ARR growth is propelled by BIM 360, the company's flagship construction software. , Autodesk believes it has a runway of several years to increase the current rapid uptake of this product. During the company's  CEO Andrew Anagnost observed that privately held co-working giant WeWork is one of BIM 360 Design's largest customers. WeWork recently expanded its 360 subscription and provides a fair example of the type of customer that Autodesk believes it can scale its cloud ARR alongside.Image source: Getty Images.Revenue retention (also known as dollar-based retention) measures the renewal and growth of services within a customer base, irrespective of the retention of actual customers. Autodesk has recently begun sharing its \"net revenue retention rate\" with investors.As defined by Autodesk's management,\u00a0net revenue retention tracks the year-over-year change in ARR for base customers (the population of customers that existed one year ago). Autodesk calculates this metric by dividing ARR from base customers in a given period by ARR from the comparable year-ago period.In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, Autodesk relayed that its net revenue retention rate fell within a range of 110%-120%, equal to the range of net revenue retention in fiscal 2019. While the company won't reveal its exact retention rate, a 110%-plus metric is quite impressive, as it means that, on average, Autodesk is increasing its spend with current customers by at least 10% on a yearly basis.\u00a0The organization believes it can maintain a high revenue retention rate, in part via its customer-engagement team. During the first-quarter , CEO Anagnost noted that net revenue retention is the primary metric by which management gauges the customer-engagement team's performance.In short, Autodesk is aligning customer-engagement team incentives with crucially important company goals. After all, it's much easier -- and usually cheaper -- to sell to a satisfied customer than it is to reel in a new prospect. Thus, an investment in customer engagement to maintain net revenue retention at a formidable level seems a wise use of Autodesk's marketing and sales resources.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will we see more selling pressure next week or will positive trade talk give stocks a lift? When one tweet can move the market, it\u2019s impossible to say. So let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades out there.The   (NYSE:) over  (NASDAQ:), but promised to look at the stock on Friday. Well, here we are and this beast has gotten even stronger. Shares are up more than 6% on the day and have risen above $95. The run has been nothing short of amazing.We\u2019ve been pounding the table on Roku, calling it a buy in Q4 and Q1. Now it\u2019s almost up to $100 a share. Should you get long now?No. Shares are up more than 70% in about five weeks. It has almost quadrupled from its December lows (not that it deserved to be that low in the first place). But the point is still the same: you\u2019ve missed the boat.I love ROKU over the long term, but to think that we won\u2019t see sub-$95 prices again is absurd. With the stock overbought in the short-term and coming into possible resistance, hedging and/or taking some profits doesn\u2019t seem like a bad idea at this point \u2026 at least until lower prices come around.  (NASDAQ:) is going splat, falling 7% on Friday . The move forced a test of the 200-day moving average, which held as support.Aggressive bulls who feel compelled to go long SPLK stock can do so against Friday\u2019s low.I would love a lower open near the 200-day on Tuesday that quickly reclaims Friday\u2019s close and goes green. Preferably, SPLK would also reclaim the 50% retracement at $120.78 in the process.If it falls under Friday\u2019s low, SPLK can go even lower. On a rally, we need to see if it can climb back to Friday\u2019s highs near $130, and/or the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. (NASDAQ:) is off by more than 5% on Friday after disappointing earnings results. Shares are bouncing off that $157.50 to $158 area, but are now meaningfully below the 50-day moving average for the first time since early January.Below $155.56 \u2014 the 38.2% retracement \u2014 aggressive bulls who are getting long on Friday\u2019s decline may want to consider stepping out. It would put ADSK below several key support levels and suggest that sellers have not yet exhausted themselves. In that case, look for a possible test of the 200-day.Reclaiming the 50-day would repair some of the damage, but beware that this level may act as resistance. That would give short-sellers an entry, with a retest of the $158 area in mind.(NYSE:) stock is up almost 4% after getting approval for its $2 million-plus gene therapy treatment.The move has NVS hitting new highs in Friday\u2019s session. The stock has been largely limited by channel resistance and buoyed by channel support. As it hits channel resistance, we\u2019ll have to watch to see if NVS will break out to a new range, or be limited in upside as a result.As long as $84.50 to $85 holds as support, NVS looks good to buy on the dips.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of  and is on Twitter .

We'll get a summer movie preview with our guest, Nell Minow. And as always, we'll give you an inside look at the stocks on our radar.\u00a0But we begin with retail, and up first is Target. Same-store sales looked good in the first quarter. E-commerce sales looked really good, Jason, and shares of Target up 12% this week. They did look very good. In a world where Amazon and Walmart are really dominating a lot of the conversation, I think Target is holding its own. And we should at least recognize that. I mean, it's not been a straight line up, of course. But I think a lot of the investments that CEO Brian Cornell has been making are really working out. You mentioned the comps -- 4.8%. That was strong, particularly when you tie it to the 4.3% growth in traffic. I mean, anytime you see that growth in traffic, you know that's going to trickle down to the bottom line. And it did for Target. Eighth consecutive quarter of comp growth. And I think really, to me, the most interesting part is the way that they've been able to evolve in this e-commerce world. They now put the stores at the center of fulfillment, and those stores handled over 80% of the company's digital volume for the quarter. So that's just really a sign that the investments they're making in e-commerce and omnichannel are starting to really pay off.\u00a0We're going to talk a lot about this, I think, when we talk about retail and the success that some of these stores and companies are having with the omnichannel, Drive Up at Target is now available in more than 1,200 of all the 1,800 stores. Jason mentioned the 80% stat. That's just really impressive, when a company is trying to position themselves to compete not just against Amazon, but all the other e-commerce players out there. A brand like Target has to be able to be more and more relevant. And they certainly are doing that. And that really is showing up not just in the comp store growth but in the e-commerce growth as well.\u00a0They've made a lot of smart investments, although it is interesting when you compare them to what Walmart, just from a consumer-facing standpoint, you look at the marketing messages from Walmart over the past six months have first and foremost been about that pickup option. You're not really seeing that yet from a marketing standpoint with Target. But clearly, they've made the underlying investment.\u00a0Yeah, they have. Same-day fulfillment services, where it's order, pick up, drive up, get it from the store, those really did perform. They drove over half of the company's digital sales growth. But we talk about that digital sales growth, it was up 42% for the quarter. But when we look at it bigger picture, it's only about $5 billion to $6 billion of the overall top line, which is $76 billion-$78 billion. So yeah, it's not that big of a deal today. But by the same token, you can see there's a lot of opportunity for them to continue picking that up in the coming quarters and years. I mean, I think you have to be at least encouraged by that.\u00a0Shares of \u00a0falling a bit this week despite a solid second-quarter report and expanding their gross margins, Andy, which is not something you necessarily think of with a business like Best Buy.Yeah, I think a lot of talk on the call has been about some of the tax issues as well, some of the trade issues that are going on now. But really Best Buy continues to deliver. We mentioned omnichannel with Target. They have done a fabulous job. They acquired GreatCall, which offers technology for seniors, both phones as well as health services. That's helped boost their gross margins a little bit. Comp sales for the quarter were up 1.1%, that was at the high end of their guidance. Revenues were basically about flat, but a little bit higher than some of the estimates there. But thinking about where Best Buy is going, they talked a lot about this Best Buy 2020 initiative to be able to reduce costs, grow earnings, focus on omnichannel, make the right investments, and that has been paying off. And I suspect going forward, that will continue to be a benefit for Best Buy and for Best Buy shareholders, too.\u00a0 After seven years as CEO, Hubert Joly is going to step down next month. He's done a phenomenal job turning around this business when you think about seven years ago and how challenged Best Buy was. Coming in, remodeling the stores, investing in high-margin things like the Geek Squad. Corie Barry, who is currently the CFO, is going to replace him, going to be the first female CEO in the company's history.\u00a0And she's been there since the late '90s. But when you think about Best Buy, again, Chris, to that point, 40% of their online revenue now is done through in-store pickup. So they are making those initiatives. I expect those initiatives with Corie to continue. Clearly there's a lot of excitement. She's the fifth Best Buy CEO in its history. A lot of excitement about transitioning over to her into the new management team there and continue to make the investments that they have been making and that they will continue to make. As you mentioned, Hubert turns into the executive chairman, to be able to stay involved in overall strategy thinking with Best Buy.\u00a0 From general retail to home improvement, Home Depot and Lowe's both out with first-quarter reports this week. Home Depot's profits came in higher than expected. Lowe's is dealing with higher costs, and they cut guidance. Shares of Home Depot basically flat this week, Jason, whereas Lowe's, down about 12%.\u00a0Yeah, I mean, there are not many retailers that can say they've actually strengthened their competitive position here in the age of Amazon. But I think Home Depot can definitely say that, because it really seems like they're doing nothing but getting better. I mean, the numbers are all pointing in the right direction. But we look at specifically during the quarter, a couple of things that stood out, big-ticket comp sales, which are those sales of over $1,000, that metric was up about 4%. That matters, because that's about 20% of the overall business. Another thing that really stands out is where Home Depot is executing on the pro customer. That pro customer is turning into a very lucrative one for the company. It's becoming close to half of the overall revenue stream for the company. And what they're doing also on top of that is really building out this rental business that several years ago, maybe 1 in 10 of those pros would rent tools from Home Depot. Now, that metric is about 1 in 4. And that's important, because if they're going back and just renting those tools as opposed to buying them, that's a pretty reliable revenue stream. But then they're also buying stuff along the way too, all of the consumables that go with those tools that they're renting.When we look at Lowe's, Lowe's is like the younger sibling, always compared to the older brother or sister that graduated med school -- they can't ever quite nail it. And even when they do OK, the market really just takes it to task. I think that's what happened here. It was less about the quarter, I think, and more about the guidance for the year. They did pull back on earnings guidance a little bit. Gross margin with Lowe's took a nice little ding of about 165 basis points. A lot of that has to do with the restructuring that CEO Marvin Ellison is doing on the merchandising side of the business. He's coming up on his one-year anniversary, and the stock actually just dipped back below where it was when he started. That has to hurt a little bit, given that he had a nice first year.\u00a0But listen, when you're going up against Home Depot, you've got your work cut out for you. One place where they're not even coming close to executing is on that pro customer. I think that's where Home Depot has been able to really differentiate. Small silver lining for Lowe's, their online sales seem to be going in the right direction. No question. They are looking at that as an opportunity. And you're right, that's a point where the business is getting better. Stepping back and looking at retail writ large. You look at the store closures that have been announced so far. When you look at companies like , Victoria's Secret, Payless Shoes. This week, we saw announce that they're shutting down all 650 Dress Barn locations. All told, that's more than 6,000 store closures that have been announced in 2019. That's more than we saw for all store closures for all of 2018. You combine that with the fact that this week, we've seen , Gap, , , , they're all hitting 52-week lows with the stocks. Where should investors be looking when it comes to retail? Because I could see some investors looking at those companies I just mentioned, hitting 52-week lows, and thinking, \"Maybe that's a value.\" Those seem like value traps to me.You have to be careful about that, Chris, because they can be value traps. The United States has been over-retailed for a long time. We have more retail locations and real estate per capita than in Europe or the rest of the world, as consumers continue to look to spend more money online. You have to make sure, if you're investing in [retail], I think you have to go to where the growth is going to go. That's e-commerce. Looking at these omnichannel players, those companies that are continuing to make the right investments. We've talked about Walmart, doing a great job with this, into the e-commerce, connecting the physical retail locations with their e-commerce space. Companies that do that well will continue to do well in the marketplace.\u00a0 Shares of\u00a0\u00a0up this week after a strong third-quarter report that was followed by the software company raising guidance for the full fiscal year. Intuit's kind of getting it done, Andy. Yeah, Chris, this was my radar stock from last week. And if you recall, the things I was looking for were their small-business ecosystem revenue growth continuing to thrive. And they have a goal of making that more than 30%. That's really tied to QuickBooks Online for small businesses. That was up 38%. That matched what it was last quarter. So overall, the business continues to do well. Revenues up 12%, that was a little higher than the estimates. That included 10% in the consumer group, which is you and me using QuickBooks or using Turbo Tax. That was two-thirds of sales. 19% growth in the small-business category. Across the board, their Turbo Tax business continues to do well, their ecosystems are growing, they're getting more and more people to the platform. They're managing their costs well. They continue to generate high profit margins and lots of growth in there. So overall, the Turbo Tax story, the QuickBooks story, the Intuit story, continues to do well. I think going forward this business, as it continues to evolve into more and more services for both corporate clients and individuals, will continue to do really well.\u00a0This is a $65 billion company. Do you see them making any sort of acquisition?\u00a0They've done such a good job of building these businesses, and as you said, managing smart growth. It seems like, if they wanted to, they could go out, make a tuck-in acquisition, and just add to their ecosystem.Yeah, I think so, Chris, but I think overall, continuing to build out that and get more and more people into the platform, offering higher and higher revenue, higher and higher margin services for all those clients, different opportunities for them to connect into those ecosystems. I mean, that continues to really show. They have more than 14 million registered users on the platform. That's up from 5 million on the Turbo Tax platform. That's up from 5 million last year, and that allowed them to generate higher profits and raise the dividend 21% this quarter. So overall, whether it's acquisitions or continuing to grow the business organically, Intuit's doing really well.\u00a0Not every software company having a great week. First-quarter results for Autodesk were weak and guidance was not exactly inspiring confidence either. Shares have had a good 2019 so far, Jason. Do you look at this as a speed bump? Or do you think they've got some legit problems on their hands?\u00a0Oh, I would say speed bump. I mean, I don't know that I would qualify that quarter as weak. We can talk about that after the show, Chris. You can be forgiven if you really don't know about the business. I mean, it certainly does keep under the radar. It's not one we talk a whole lot about. I think that the market that it serves is becoming more and more relevant by the quarter. I've talked recently about the work I've done in the augmented reality space. I will say that Autodesk is one that I have high on the list of great opportunities in that space. Autodesk makes and sells 3D design and engineering and entertainment software. They have helped customers build virtually anything, whether it's a car or a building or a movie with cool special effects.\u00a0Now recently, they did make a bit of a change to the business model. They went from selling essentially perpetual license software to a subscription model. We talk about subscriptions all the time on this show. We like them. I think it was a good move. It threw a little bit of a... A wrinkle?Maybe a wrinkle.\u00a0\u00a0A curveball? A curveball, that's a good one. Yeah, threw a curveball to the analysts, I think. It made the financials a little bit tough to model out there. But ultimately, I do think it is the right move. A key metric they have in annualized recurring revenue for the quarter was up 33%. And management does recognize that the real competitive advantage for the business stems from the suite of offerings that they have. So they continue to invest in that software and bringing new products to their customers.\u00a0If you look over the last five years, the stock has absolutely pummeled the market. It's up over 200%. I think that given the size of the company, around $36 billion today, similar to another competitor, , a recommendation in  that's done very well also. It's a great market, I think, and a company that investors should really have on their radar.\u00a0 First-quarter revenue for \u00a0was higher than expected, but shares of the data analytics company falling nearly 15% this week. Andy, Splunk is not profitable. Do they have a cash flow problem?No, they actually generate free cash flow, Chris. So it's one of those companies that's not profitable, but when you add back some of the non-cash expenses, they actually make some money. To Jason's point about Autodesk, there's been some changes in some of the billing techniques and some of the solutions that they're offering, which has caused a little bit of questions about some of the cash flows expected for this year. I think some analysts are trying to make sense of that. Also, while they added 400 new clients, now have more than 18,000 in total, that's down a little bit from last quarter. Splunk is a kind of cool company, man. It takes all this data that companies generate from all their apps, all technology, and helps those companies make sense of that data and provide better solutions internally, solutions for their customers. It's machine data learning and helps their clients get smarter. So when you take in all those numbers, adding clients maybe a little bit lower than last year, analysts still a little bit lukewarm on what this means for some of the cash flow this year. Even though the company grew revenues more than 36%, Chris, higher than estimates this quarter. Just some concerns on maybe what the growth prospects for the year may mean. I think long-term, it's a $20 billion business, generates some free cash flow, playing in a very fun, dynamic market, and Splunk is taking market share and doing well. Any concerns about the lack of profitability? Obviously, they've grown the business to this point. But at some point, investors and particularly Wall Street is going to want them to start generating a profit.\u00a0Yeah. They also invest a lot in R&D. More than 25% of their revenues go into research and development. They are making progress on both gross margins and operating margins. They're getting there. I can see the profitability curve going the right direction over the next couple of years. So I'm not quite as worried about that. As long as they continue to add more clients. I think that is the thing that we have to watch. What are the client number additions looking like each quarter?In July, unveils season three of . The show has been a hit, in part because it is set in the 1980s and has a certain nostalgia factor going for it. But season three is bringing back something that absolutely no one asked for: New Coke. \u00a0is producing half a million cans of New Coke to go along with this launch of season three of . Do you think the people at Coke are unaware that New Coke was one of the all-time debacles in terms of a new products, Jason? It really feels like there's a lot more that can go wrong with this move than can go right. That's just a personal opinion. And I'll leave it at that.\u00a0Well, and we were talking about this before the show, Andy, I think this is long enough ago that people will be forgiven for not remembering that Coca-Cola in 1985 didn't just roll out New Coke as an option. They basically said, \"Oh, this highly successful product we've been making since the late 1800s? We're stopping production of that altogether. There's no longer an option. Here's New Coke, you're welcome.\" And it was, I believe, less than three months later, they had to just take it all back.\u00a0Yeah, I think 80 days it was basically on the market. I was a fan of New Coke. Oh, you're the one! [laughs]\u00a0 Maybe I was the one person out there who liked it. I was a fan. I had my parachute pants on, drinking my New Coke, it was great. I actually liked it. But clearly, a marketing and innovation mistake there. Given Mac's love of , I do feel like we're probably missing out on a pretty sweet holiday gift if we don't get a case and put it aside for him a little later.\u00a0Put that order in for him now, JMo. Let's go to our man behind the glass, Steve Broido. Steve, do you remember the New Coke debacle?\u00a0 Vaguely. I vaguely remember it. Yeah. Didn't it come out in a different can? The can looked different, if I recall.\u00a0 It did. You'll have a chance to see that new can.I won't be buying it, though. No siree, Bob. Alright, Andy Cross, Jason Moser, guys, we'll see you later in the show.\u00a0Thanks, Chris![...]The summer movie season officially kicks off this weekend, so of course, we turn to Nell Minow. She is the film critic known as the Movie Mom. She is also an expert in corporate governance, and the vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors. She joins me now. Nell, always good to talk to you! Thank you!Before we get to the movies, let's talk some business. We have to start with Boeing. The 737 MAX remains grounded after the two crashes that killed more than 350 people. We've seen reports now that Boeing was trying to get this new model certified as quickly as possible. Engineers were under pressure from managers to limit safety testing to keep down costs. Bizarrely, to me anyway, over the last 12 months, shares of Boeing are basically flat, whereas this seems like the sort of thing that would really sink an aircraft maker's stock. Where is Boeing's board of directors in all this?\u00a0First of all, I'm going to say that I have some stock in Boeing. I spoke to the person who bought it on my behalf and said, \"What is going on?\" And I'll tell you what she said. She said, \"Where's the competition? People don't like Boeing, where are they going to take their business? ? Go to the back of the line, a very, very long line, before you get your new plane?\" The customers don't seem flustered, and therefore, the investors don't seem flustered.\u00a0I would expect, however, we may see some real corporate governance changes there. The board doesn't seem to be on top of this at all. The fact that they ignored the warning signs is very, very troubling. The fact that safety doesn't seem to be factored into the set of compensation is also very troubling. I'm hoping that we see some changes there. But I don't anticipate any changes in the stock price for a while.\u00a0I get that this is basically a duopoly between Airbus and Boeing. And yes, it's not an online advertising platform. You can't just stand up a business like this. But it also, by the same token, seems like the sort of thing whereas, yeah, if you're , and you're looking for new planes, you don't necessarily want to get in the back of the line at Airbus. But it also seems like the longer this drags out, the longer the ripple effects become. So maybe Boeing's stock isn't affected now, but as this continues to slowly drag on, it could be troublesome down the line.\u00a0Oh, I absolutely agree with you. However, I also have confidence that there will be enough customer and investor pressure that they will make some changes before that happens.\u00a0Housing is obviously such a big industry. \u00a0 is the biggest home builder in America. They've been making headlines recently for some deals, not necessarily on the up-and-up. What is going on with the children of the chairman at D. R. Horton.\u00a0The children are doing fine. I'm not sure the shareholders are doing so well. It reminds me, I grew up in Chicago, under the original Mayor Daley, the first Mayor Daley, who gave a lot of the company's insurance business to his son who was just out of school. And he said, famously, if you can't do good things for your children, what's the point of being mayor?And that's kind of how I feel about this. [laughs] The problem is, in a public company, hello, you're supposed to be acting on behalf of the shareholders. There seems to be no evidence that that's the case here. What you want to see in any kind of insider transaction is, you want to see the company bending over backwards to show you that it was an arm's length transaction, that they shopped it around, got the best price. That doesn't seem to be the case here. There's all kinds of stuff going on with sweetheart deals for the kids, guaranteed returns, and personal loans from the dad. Once again, this is yet another company that wants the access to capital of a public company, but they want the control and the insider bennies of a private company. And that can sustain itself very long.\u00a0Shares of Disney recently hit an all-time high. The early reaction to the Disney+ streaming service seems to be positive, especially when you consider it's not going to launch until sometime time this fall. CEO Bob Iger is making $65 million a year. Abigail Disney, who is the granddaughter of Walt Disney, is not at all happy about this. She called that amount of pay insane. I know you're a fan of Bob Iger's leadership. I'm curious what you think of this compensation.Well, I'm a fan of both Bob Iger and Abigail Disney, who herself is a very fine filmmaker, has made some excellent documentaries. She also puts her money where her mouth is. I spend my time getting upset about people get paid too much for doing a bad job. I put people who get paid too much for doing a good job on another level. I also do own some Disney stock. I want to point out that they've done quite well this year with a little movie called  and buying the Fox content. So yeah, he is getting paid too much. I do think it is bad for the employees as a whole. I don't think it's good for the company to have the CEO get paid that much. On the other hand, he's getting paid too much for doing a really good job.\u00a0Since you mentioned , which at this point has made more than $2.6 billion worldwide, are you at all surprised at the success either of this one film or the entire package that Disney has put together under Kevin Feige's leadership going back over the last 11 years starting with ?I'm really happy that you mentioned Kevin Feige. He deserves to go down in Hollywood history with Irving Thalberg and some of the really great producers. Everybody tried to make comic book movies before that. Some of the worst movies ever made were people's attempts to make  movies. And still, they haven't quite figured out how to make a  movie. It was really Kevin Feige who brought in the vision, the love for these characters, the understanding of the symbiotic relationship between bringing all the characters together. This was his real genius -- he had the wisdom to allow each of the franchises to develop their own personality. You've got something like , which is hilarious; you've got something like , which was a throwback to the 1970s movies of political paranoia; and yet, still make them all cohesive. If you're going to watch for the third or fourth time, you will be able to tell that each of the individual musical themes for each of these characters come together just as the characters themselves do. So, yes, I was surprised, but very pleasantly surprised. There has never been a franchise like this in the history of movies. And I don't expect ever to see anything like it again.\u00a0Well, and add to Kevin Feige's list of accomplishments, and you touched on this with , his selection of directors. The fact that someone like Taika Waititi, who to that point was just known for these small -- Quirky, little -- Yeah, almost cult films. And then he gets handed this enormous budget with .\u00a0Yeah. And that worked out really, really well.  worked out very, very well. It really is astonishing, what he's been able to do, that he's been able to give, particularly these young directors, as you said, their own imprint, and yet keep it as a cohesive whole. Imagine if they did the  franchise, and Hermione had her own movie, and Professor McGonagall had her own movie, and yet they kept bringing them back together. It's just mind blowing!I want to go back to the Disney+ service for just a second. One of the things we're starting to see in the wake of, obviously, the rise of Netflix, but also Disney rolling out their streaming service, is almost a land grab among these different companies. with NBC, this week reportedly looking to buy Starz from . And Disney is taking over Hulu. What do you think are the prospects for Disney+, and how nervous should the brain trust at Netflix be?\u00a0Well, Netflix really surprised us all with the strength of their content. As long as they keep that up -- they've really abandoned their original business plan completely, which is heartbreaking to me, because what I loved about them originally was that the most obscure films that I wanted to see were always available on Netflix. And that's just not true anymore, I guess, unless you want to do DVD. But they have more than made up for with creating original content. They've gone from being, Blockbuster to being MGM. They're going a different way. Disney, of course, is now going in the opposite direction, from being a content creator, to the streaming service.\u00a0The thing that Disney has is the built-in perpetual audience. They can just keep putting out the original , the original , and they're going to have a new generation every seven years. That's a really solid basis for them. They're very, very good on content. I'm pretty impressed with the way they're going.\u00a0All we need now is, each of us, an extra 40 hours a week to watch all this stuff.\u00a0 [laughs]\u00a0Let's get to the summer movies. I'm curious what you're looking forward to with all of the options this summer.\u00a0Well, as usual, we have a lot of sequels, a lot of blockbusters. I have to say the guilty pleasure I'm most looking forward to, doesn't  look amazing? The spin-off of the  franchise. That looks incredible! I mean, anytime that you've got car chases, Jason Statham, The Rock and Helen Mirren, you're pretty much good.\u00a0Also, we just talked about . The two stars of  are teaming up for another one of my favorite franchises, . The trailer looks absolutely amazing! We've got .  looks wonderful! I'm very excited about that!And then, every summer, what I look forward to are the little surprising indies. We've already got one opening up this week. It's called . It could not be more adorable. It is about two very, very, very bright high school seniors. It's the last night before graduation. They've done everything right. They have given up all fun and just done all their homework. They've gotten into their dream schools. And on that last night, they decide to go out for the last time and have some wild adventures. And they do. If it sounds a little bit like , then let me tell you that the star of , Jonah Hill, his sister is the star of , but this is a much sweeter story. And yes, it's very raunchy, but it's absolutely great! Looking forward to having everybody see that!Well, I was going to ask you if there was an under-the-radar movie that we should be looking for. Sounds like you've already answered that. I'm curious, of all the big movies you mentioned, and certainly some of those are on my list, one you didn't mention, I'm curious if you have any early sense of this movie, particularly in the wake of the Academy Awards, any buzz on , which is the Elton John movie? Yeah, the buzz that I've heard so far is that it is not a straight biopic, and that it goes off and uses kind of fantasy sequences, which sounds appropriate for what it's doing. There is one other little neglected indie that I think everybody will be talking about this summer. It's called , with last year's breakout star, Awkwafina, who stole the show in and also in\u00a0. This year, she plays a young woman whose grandmother, with whom she's very close in China, is going to die. But they decided they're not going to tell her that she's going to die. They're just going to pretend that they're having a family wedding, so that gives everybody an excuse to come see her before she dies. And it's about what happens then. It's called . It is absolutely great! That's another one I want everybody to be on the lookout for.\u00a0I and all of our listeners will forever be indebted to you for the conversation you and I had this time two years ago when I asked you, is there a movie this summer that we can skip? And you told us yes, you don't need to go see Tom Cruise in . Thank you from the bottom of my heart!That's both time and money that I saved, and apparently based on the box office receipts, time and money that lots of other people saved as well. Everyone listened to me, thank you! With that in mind, this summer, they can't all be hits. What is something we're probably better off skipping?\u00a0I have not seen it yet. Take that under advisement. But I have to say the new looks awful.\u00a0After all of the things I just said about Disney, yeah... Wow, OK! I'm clearly shaken by this one, but not as shaken as the Disney people are going to be. I hope I'm wrong! Last thing, then I'll let you go. Roughly 40 million Americans are going to have some type of road trip this Memorial Day weekend. I know you're going to be traveling back home to Chicago. With that in mind, what is a road trip movie or two that you enjoy?\u00a0Well, you cannot beat  with Robert De Niro. I always say that road trips are the oldest story of all, going back to Odysseus. They always work because they take people out of their milieu and they get to know each other.  is a classic. And then, of course, the greatest road trip movie of all time, . One of the best reasons to be on so you can follow Nell Minow and get her thoughts on movies and corporate governance and so much more. Nell, have a wonderful time with your family this weekend!Thank you! Bye-bye![...]It's Memorial Day weekend. We want to help you get ready for your summer vacation, not just with the awesome summer theme music that our man behind the glass, Steve Broido, has been playing. Also by encouraging you to check out The Motley Fool's podcast swag shop. You can get T-shirts, ball caps to keep the sun off your face, coffee mugs, and a lot more. Go to .\u00a0Time to get to the stocks on our radar this week. Our man behind the glass will hit you with a question. And you know what? You can hit him back with one if you want. Jason Moser, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?\u00a0Sure. Well, perhaps we have listeners tuning in to this week's  via my radar stock, , SPOT. Obviously, as we've discussed before, the economics of the music business are pretty brutal. But when we get back to the whole content-is-king thing, let's also remember that distribution plays a very important role as well. And I think that's actually where Spotify is starting to show they have a leg up on everyone here. Recent quarterly results came out. Monthly active users grew 26% to 217 million. Premium users grew 32% of 100 million. Where I think they're starting to differentiate themselves is they're going beyond just music. They're building out, I think, a platform of all sorts of different content, and that includes podcasts. The acquisitions of Gimlet Media and Anchor will help them build out those offerings. An interesting partnership, which is going to result in Spotify being pre-loaded on all these new Samsung devices coming out. I just think there are a lot of opportunities in the future here for Spotify to become that default operating system for folks' entertainment on their mobile devices. Obviously, Music will play a role. But when we look at Android's position there, that's the dominating operating system, and that's where Spotify, I think, can really exploit that advantage there.\u00a0Steve, question about Spotify?If you ask 10 people on the street if they knew what Spotify really did, do you think they'd be able to answer correctly?\u00a0Sure, I think so. I mean, I can ask my daughters what Spotify does, and they can answer it. I give credit to people just walking the street. Most people have a Spotify account now, don't they, Steve? Don't you?I did. I don't now. They all blend together. There's so many of them!\u00a0 Andy Cross, what are you looking at?, a human resources software company, and provides finance solutions as\u00a0well, reports earnings next week. It's a $46 billion company, so very large. It was founded by Dave Duffield and Aneel Bhusri, who worked at PeopleSoft, that was acquired by years ago. It's a company that serves more than 2,600 clients, including 40% of the Fortune 500, and, Chris, half of the Fortune 50. So it's really a growth story, it's been able to grow more than 30% per year. So I want to see if that growth is slowing and what they are seeing with the client additions. That's an important factor for them to be able to continue to grow the business. So symbol is WDAY. Steve? How would a company like The Motley Fool use Workday in our day-to-day? There's a lot of competitors. How you interact with payroll, it handles a lot of the things that client and client employees need to be able to interact with to basically just do their everyday work job. So I think it's an important software solution for lots of different clients out there.\u00a0What do you think, Steve?\u00a0I think I'm going with Spotify. I'll give it a shot! I don't know if I understand it, but I think I'll go with it. Alright, Andy Cross, Jason Moser, guys, thanks for being here! That'll do it for this week's show. Our engineer is Steve Broido.

The problem, however, is that it can be tricky to find stocks with the right balance of lower risk and enough upside to generate solid returns. We asked three Motley Fool contributors for stock picks that could help pad your kids' college funds and they came back with  ,  , and  . Software has historically been sold through retailers, distributors, and resellers, but times are changing. The advent of cloud computing now allows software makers to sell their products directly to consumers through a pay-as-you-go model. This not only leads to a better experience for consumers, but it also allows software companies to cut out the middleman and generate higher profits.Lots of established software companies have made the switch to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model and have  benefited from the change. Autodesk is  of a recent success story.Autodesk sells a range of computer-aided design products that helps engineers, architects, construction professions, designers, and entertainers to create anything that they can imagine. A few years ago, Autodesk made the switch to an SaaS business model. While that was a painful decision in the short term (some customers were upset and revenue, cash flow, and profits all took a hit), the company is currently reaping the rewards of the transition. The majority of revenue is now recurring in nature, margins are on the rise, and profitability has returned.Autodesk is currently producing . Revenue is growing in excess of 20% annually and profits are growing much faster. Margins are rising and free cash flow is soaring.Investors have been hugely rewarded over the last couple of years for their patience, but I still think that the best is yet to come. Autodesk has converted \"only\" 4.3 million of its users to its subscription model. Another 14 million users are still using outdated software that will have to be upgraded eventually.That opportunity -- when combined with a lot of  -- helps explains why Wall Street is currently expecting 68% annualized profit growth over the next five years. That's a screaming high growth rate for a business that is trading around 35 times next year's earnings estimates. If you're looking for an investment that can help send your kid to college, you'll want to start with well-established companies with plenty of growth left for the decades ahead. One such company is Electronic Arts, one of the world's largest video game publishers with franchises including , and , among many others. The stock has taken a hit after some backlash from its microtransaction business practices, but it remains well-positioned in a booming industry.  data by .Here are just a couple of reasons for investors to buy into EA's long-term growth story: More and more games have digital distribution and streaming, which enables EA to cut out traditional brick-and-mortar middlemen and drastically reduces the need for packaging and retail distribution -- all factors that make video games more profitable. Another , where people watch the elite players in a slew of games play competitively, and even professionally. While that may not be your cup of tea, it's booming and the audience demographics are especially interesting to advertisers. Further, the growth potential globally and on mobile -- the latter is the fastest-growing gaming platform in terms of revenue -- means there is plenty long-term growth remaining.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.A recent aspect that could help boost EA's stock in the near term is new info about its  game. After  initially started out as a blockbuster, it  and failed to live up to the expectations EA had for the title. EA is now preparing to launch the second season, called , which introduces a new weapon and a new legend character, and fixes many complaints from the first season, including adding a ranked mode and challenges. EA has hit some speed bumps recently, but it's well-positioned as a large publisher with strong franchises in a booming industry. If management optimizes its evolving business models, embraces and monetizes esports, and expands globally, it should be a great stock to own over the coming decades. If you're looking to build up savings to send your kids to college, you're going to want to put a few high-growth stocks in your portfolio, the kind that can deliver ten-bagger returns by the time junior turns 18, and MongoDB looks like just the ticket.Like many of it software-as-a-service (SaaS) peers, MongoDB -- which calls its core cloud offering MongoDB Atlas, a database-as-a-service (DBaaS) -- is experiencing exponential growth. In its most recent quarter, revenue surged 78% to $89.4 million, driven by an 82% increase in subscription revenue, which makes up the vast majority of its sales, and revenue growth is actually accelerating thanks to the  of MongoDB Atlas, which saw revenue jump 340% in the most recent quarter. Atlas now makes up 35% of the company's revenue. The stock has also delivered impressive results as shares have jumped more than 400% in less than two years since its IPO.MongoDB is still operating at a loss as the company spends aggressively on sales and marketing in order to boost its top-line growth and market share, and on research and development in order to fuel the next wave of products.The stock also trades at a lofty valuation, with a market cap of $9.2 billion and a price-to-sales ratio of 24 based on this year's expected results. Considering the breakout growth of MongoDB Atlas and the company's long-term opportunity, that valuation seems warranted.MongoDB has already delivered impressive returns to early investors.

We started off fiscal '20 with great momentum, accentuated by continued acceleration of recentconstruction acquisitions and strong growth across all geographic regions. Our billings and free cash flow came in at or above expectations and reflect the strength of our business. We are on track with the integration of PlanGrid and BuildingConnected and have exciting achievements to share with you.Although, our first quarter revenue came in at the low end of our guidance range, we are on track to achieve our fiscal '20 ARR and free cash flow guidance and are reaffirming our fiscal '23 targets. Our pipeline for the rest of the year is strong and growing, and the underlying demand strength we've seen in prior quarters continues to drive growth in our business. There is no change to our view of the strength of the business or the current spending environment in our end markets.Before I offer you more color on strategic highlights during the quarter, let me turn it over to Scott to giveyou more details on our first quarter results as well as our guidance. I'll then return with further insightsinto some of the key drivers of our business, including construction, manufacturing and digitaltransformation, before we open it up to Q&A. -- Thanks Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, our leading indicators, billings and free cash flow, performed well. Total revenue of $735 million was up 31% and 28% excluding our recent acquisitions. It was within our planningassumptions, although at the low end of our guidance range. This was primarily driven by linearity, as we closed more business later in the quarter than anticipated, which affected the amount of ratable revenue recognized in the quarter.Overall demand in our end markets was robust, as indicated by our strong billings and revenue growth. Our subscription volume also grew steadily across the board. Sales volume of AutoCAD LT remained strong. And this has historically been a leading indicator of potential demand slowdown. As you can see, revenue from our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT products grew 37% in the first quarter, slightly better than the 36% growth rate in Q4. AEC and manufacturing also rose 37% and 24%, respectively.Geographically, we saw broad based strength across all regions. Revenue grew 35% in EMEA and APAC, and 27% in the Americas, with strength across almost all countries. We also saw strength in direct revenue, which rose 36% and represented 30% of our total sales, consistent with last year. Within direct, our eStore grew 45%.Looking at ARR, total ARR continued to grow quickly, up 33% versus last year to $2.8 billion. Adjusting for our recent acquisitions, total ARR was up 29%. Core ARR growth was in line with our total organic growth, while Cloud ARR grew 164%, propelled by strong performance in construction. Excluding $83mm of ARR from our fourth quarter acquisitions, organic Cloud ARR, which is primarily made up of BIM 360 and Fusion 360, grew a record 43%.We continue to make progress with our maintenance to subscription, or M2S, program. The M2S conversion rate in Q1 was consistent with prior quarters, with approximately one-third of maintenance renewal opportunities migrating to product subscriptions. Of those that migrated, upgrade rates among eligible subscriptions remained within the historical range of 25% to 35%. As a reminder, this is the last year of the M2S program, and we are continuing to incentivize customers to convert.In addition to strong new customer billings, the growth in ARR was supported by continued expansion of our renewal base. And as we introduced at our Investor day in March, the net revenue retention rate is a key metric to monitor the health of our renewal base. Net revenue retention rate measures the year-over-year change in ARR for the population of customers that existed one year ago, or base customers. It's calculated by dividing the current period ARR related to those same base customers by the total ARR from one year ago.During Q1, the net revenue retention rate was within the fiscal '19 range of approximately 110% to 120%, and we expect it to be in this range throughout fiscal '20.In Q1, some of the deeply discounted subscriptions from our global field promotion we ran three years ago came up for renewal. We were very pleased with the renewal rates of this group of customers as theyrenewed closer to list price, and the total value from the entire cohort grew.Moving to billings, we had $798 million of billings during the quarter. On a normalized basis, billings rose about 40%. Recall that last year we adopted ASC 606, which resulted in adjustments of approximately $160 million to our deferred revenue balance and impacted billings, since billings are calculated by taking the sum of revenue plus the change in deferred revenue.The growth in billings was driven by strong renewals and continued momentum in our core products. We also benefited from some customers renewing early in the quarter due to upcoming price increases. Our recently acquired construction assets contributed nicely to the billings increase. And in line with our plans, multi-year contracts moved higher, helping our total billings. Recall that multi-year payments are good for our customers as they benefit from stable pricing and a single approval process. Our partners like them as they can sign higher contract values and maximize their cash flow. And we benefit from a more predictable revenue stream and upfront cash payments.The second and third year of those multiyear agreements are recorded in our long term deferred revenue, which grew by 12% and ended the quarter at 17% of the total deferred balance. As we indicated at our Analyst Day, we expect to end the year with a long term balance in the low 20% range of total deferred revenue, in line with the historical range.On the margin front, we realized significant operating leverage as we have entered the growth phase of our journey. Non-GAAP gross margins of 91% were up 140 basis points versus last year. Our disciplined approach to expense management combined with revenue growth enabled us to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by 13 percentage points to 18%, despite absorbing two significant acquisitions.Moving to free cash flow, we generated $207 million in Q1. Over the last twelve months, we have now generated $550 million of free cash flow, positioning us well to hit our full year target of $1.35 billion. Note that Q1 benefited from the very strong Q4 of fiscal '19 that we had. As you may recall, we had over $1 billion of billings during Q4, some of which was collected in the first quarter of fiscal '20. As such, I expect our free cash flow in Q2 to be down sequentially.We continue to repurchase shares with our excess cash, which is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. During the quarter, we repurchased 582,000 shares for $100 million at an average price of $171.84 per share.Now I'll turn the discussion to our outlook. I'll start by saying that our view of global economic conditions and their impact on our business is unchanged from the last several quarters. We are not seeing any noticeable impact from Brexit and the various trade and tariff disputes.For the full year, we are reiterating our fiscal '20 free cash flow outlook of approximately $1.35 billion as well as our outlook for ARR of about $3.5 billion, up 27% to 29%. In line with our initial plans, we expect billings of about $4.1 billion at the midpoint, driven by the strength of our renewal base, new subscription growth, continued normalization of multi-year billings, the flow through from unbilled deferred revenue, and our acquisitions.When looking at the quarterization of free cash flow for fiscal '20, we continue to expect about three-fourths of the free cash flow to be generated in the second half of the year.Looking at our guidance for the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $782 million to $792 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 to $0.63. The earnings slide deck on the Investor Relations section of our website has more details as well as modeling assumptions for the fiscal second quarter and for full year 2020.Now I'd like to turn it back to Andrew. -- Thanks Scott. Now, let me give you an update on some of the key growth initiatives we highlighted at Investor Day, specifically progress made in construction, manufacturing and digital transformation. These initiativesare key drivers of our business both near and long-term.First, in construction, we are seeing continued strength across the portfolio as we execute on our strategy to deliver a comprehensive, integrated platform that seamlessly connects the office, the trailer, and the field. We had significant accomplishments during the quarter as we integrated PlanGrid and BuildingConnected into Autodesk. Both acquired companies showed impressive growth, which is important to call out considering that acquisitions typically see a slow down during the integration phase, whereas we experienced accelerating momentum. Post-close, we have won fifteen head-to-head bids against leading competitors in this space. Other milestones included the launch of our first product integration and the realization of revenue synergies.Q1 was the first full quarter where we had the entire construction portfolio in place, as we closed PlanGrid in December 2018 and BuildingConnected in January of this year. Feedback from customers has been very positive regarding the addition of these best-in-class solutions to our comprehensive construction portfolio, which now includes BIM 360, PlanGrid, Assemble Systems and BuildingConnected, in addition to the design tools we have always sold into that market.On the technology development front, we were able to accelerate the product roadmap for PlanGrid, which resulted in the introduction of PlanGrid BIM last month. This is a new product integration between Revit and PlanGrid that allows customers to immediately access BIM data in either 2D or 3D directly within PlanGrid on their mobile devices. We were able to deliver this frequently requested feature at an accelerated pace now that PlanGrid is part of Autodesk. In fact, when PlanGrid BIM was launched we hosted a webcast and the demand was 5x what PlanGrid had normally seen for prior product launches, and the number of customers who requested to be contacted by a sales person following the webinar was also more than 5x what they normally experience following a product-focused webinar.We've also seen synergies begin to develop on the sales front. For example, APTIM, a leading construction services vendor and joint customer of Autodesk and PlanGrid, tripled its PlanGrid users as part of the Enterprise Business Agreement for its Digital Foreman Initiative. Other Autodesk products they use include AutoCAD, Civil 3D, Plant 3D, Map 3D and Revit. And because we have been clear with our customers that PlanGrid will be focused on field execution and BIM 360 on project management, there are a lot of synergies between the two offerings that our customers have yet to realize. We are also seeing BuildingConnected thrive within the Autodesk construction ecosystem. Since the acquisition they have grown their user base from about 700,000 to over 800,000.Now, I'd like to elaborate on the impressive growth comment made earlier. When we made the acquisitions, I said that we were focused on keeping the strong sales momentum going, and that is exactly what happened. At PlanGrid, the sales teams are continuing to perform strongly with both new and existing customers. For example, they expanded their relationship with Rosendin Electric, a long standing PlanGrid customer with plus 6,000 employees and annual revenue of about $1.5 billion.The company recently extended its contract for three years and significantly expanded it, in part due to Autodesk's long-term vision. PlanGrid sales have also started to benefit from being part of the Autodesk family.During the quarter, Jacobs, a global leader in professional services sector and a long-standing Autodesk customer, decided to further enhance its relationship with us by adding PlanGrid to one of its divisions. In making this decision, Jacobs pointed to its current speed in the field, ease of use, and integration with the rest of the Autodesk suite as determining factors in adopting the software.The Company is currently utilizing PlanGrid on $1 billion infrastructure project. PlanGrid also ended Q1 with its largest ever pipeline of deals. And the momentum continued at BuildingConnected too. BuildingConnected has introduced new features that continue to make its platform more and more valuable to larger and larger portions of the market. In fact, they had their best quarter ever in Q1 in terms of new business and are seeing their flywheel continue to drive new business on both the general contractor and subcontractor side.BIM 360 also continues to demonstrate strong growth. In fact, our organic Cloud ARR, of which, BIM 360 is the largest component, was up 43% in Q1. This was driven by strength across the entire BIM 360 portfolio, especially BIM 360 Design, which is our real time collaboration tool for Revit users. We also saw both existing and new customers increase adoption of BIM 360. A good example here is WeWork, with 485 locations and 466,000 members around the world, WeWork provides spaces and services to help people work, learn and collaborate in more meaningful ways. They expanded their subscription with Autodesk this quarter and are one of our largest BIM 360 Design customers.We are excited to work with them and look forward to further enhancing our relationship over the coming years. Overall, all parts of our construction portfolio are performing at or above the plan and showing strong growth. I am extremely proud of all the teams involved. They remain focused and dedicated to helping Autodesk grow and drive positive change in the construction industry. And lastly, I wanted to note that for those looking to get a more in-depth view of our construction business, we are hosting an event on June 4th here in San Francisco, where you'll have the opportunity to hear directly from AECOM, Webcor and DPR in addition to our construction team regarding our portfolio and go-to market opportunity. I hope to see all of you there.On the manufacturing front, revenue grew 24% as customers see the benefits of our differentiated solution, we are gaining share and displacing competitive offerings in the space. For example, a large manufacturer of locomotives and rail equipment further expanded its relationship with us, they are in the process of deploying our manufacturing solutions across their various divisions and are relying on Inventor, our CAM solutions and factory design utilities to automate their workflows.Our solutions displaced competing our products due to our simplicity and short implementation cycles, which is in line with their rapid product introduction requirements. Our investments in generative design and Fusion 360 have resulted in more than 100% year-over-year growth in monthly active users for our commercial customers. Users love the cloud-based, comprehensive solution of Fusion 360 and it is disrupting the industry.Fusion 360 offers unprecedented value and out-of-the-box productivity for concept to production workflows, and that appeals to a large swath of our customers. A US-based specialty pharmaceutical company purchased Fusion 360 to replace SolidWorks for designing and manufacturing auto-injectors.After reviewing various options, they decided that Fusion 360 provided superior collaboration and data management capabilities in the cloud with no setup or maintenance complications. A Midwest metal fabrication company chose Fusion 360 to replace separate instances of CAD and CAM solutions. They were impressed by our integrated CAD/CAM functionality and collaboration features. With Fusion 360, they were able to replace CATIA, Creo, Mastercam, and PTC Windchill, allowing them to rely on fewer platforms and to promote collaboration.Then when it comes to digital transformation, we are seeing the positive impact it is having on our business. We are also making progress in using digitization internally as part of our plans to convert the large number of non-compliant users into paying customers. All new single user product subscriptions are already using identity-based authentication and we continue to move existing customers to this new system. We are on track to migrate all eligible single user subscriptions to identity-based authentication by the end of the current fiscal year, which will provide a much better user experience for our customers and help us in combating non-compliant usage of our software.Beyond that, we are already starting to see results from our efforts to engage directly with customers using non-compliant versions of our software and expect our ongoing learning to increase our effectiveness in FY '20 and beyond.As you heard, there's a lot of activity happening toward the growth initiatives highlighted at Investor Day across construction, manufacturing and digital transformation. These drivers, as well as the large opportunity we see in converting the current 14 million non-paying users into subscribers, should result in an acceleration in profitability and cash flow metrics and sustained growth going forward. We are highly confident in Autodesk's ability to capitalize on this large market opportunity and are committed to delivering our FY '20 and FY '23 targets.With that, operator, we'd like to open up the call for questions.Thank you. (Operator Instructions)Our first question comes from the line of Phil Winslow of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on great start to the year. I just wanted to drill into your comment about just the linearity of the quarter, Scott you mentioned that the quarter's billings and it was well within your assumed range with revenue at the low end just because of linearity, but your full year expectations are unchanged. Wonder if you could just drill into that, where was the linearity different was it something about specific industries or more geographies, and sort of how are you thinking about the go forward there? -- Yeah. Thanks, Phil. It was -- it's certainly within the range of our guidance and our planning, $735 million was the low end of our guidance range. So it wasn't a significant variance from what our expectations were. So we did see those both Q3 and Q4 had -- but I'll call better linearity. So earlier, linearity in each of those quarters, as we came into Q1, Q1 actually ended up with the linearity of similar to last Q1, as opposed to the improved linearity that we've seen in Q3, and Q4, which I guess is not really surprising, given that, beginning of the year, people don't have budgets yet, sales teams are going through sales kickoff, et cetera. So we ended up with the same linearity we had in Q1 a year ago as opposed to kind of the improved linearity we've seen in Q3 and Q4 and that's what pushed us to the low end of the range.I'll go ahead and answer your follow-up question, which is our assumption for Q2. Some (ph) linearity is that it'll look more like Q2 '19 as opposed to the improved linearity that we saw in Q3 and Q4, it doesn't really have an effect on the full-year, you see full-year guidance remains unchanged, and you see, actually, Q2 guidance shows a pretty nice step-up sequentially as a result of getting some of that, and that came in a little bit later in the quarter, obviously we have it for the full quarter of Q2. So it doesn't really change our view at the year. That was a good strong start to the year. Just had linearity more in line with what we had seen a year ago as opposed to what we had seen in the prior two quarters. -- Got it. Then just a follow up for Andrew. It was great to hear some of those wins on the PlanGrid side, BuildingConnected, wonder, if you can provide just more color on this early feedback you're getting now you provided some earlier, but how you think about bringing this into the product line and maybe even also using BuildingConnected even almost as a funnel for PlanGrid as well. Just some more color there that would be great. -- Yeah. So what was the second part you said about PlanGrid there Phil. -- Sorry to say (ph) as a funnel, potentially you're seeing bid management, actually you've been using that as a sort of lead management, so to speak for PlanGrid? -- Yeah. That's exactly, and actually you've hit on one of the points that's important about this coming (ph) year. The PlainGrid folks and the BuildingConnected folks immediately found some synergies between how they approach the market and their individual businesses. So there's a strong flow of leads and discussion back and forth between those two teams, and that plays a pretty integral part. Remember, BuildingConnected has visibility to the whole entire project bidding environment within the US. And obviously, PlanGrid is super eager to go and talk to those projects about how they can improve site execution and effectiveness and success for their particular projects. So that's one of the big uplifts we're seeing is some of the connection between those two offerings.And frankly as we brought BuildingConnected in, we saw a very nice surge in their business. Like I said, they had their best Q1 ever in terms of new business, because people just like the fact that they're part of Autodesk and that -- what they're focusing on with the bid management is -- it's a good tool, they added a lot of features in there during Q1. And it's a solid result. -- Great. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue. -- Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays Capital. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe first for you Andrew, just picking up off the last line of questioning on PlanGrid. Clearly, it seems like it's off to a good start. And I believe the initial approach here was to let them operate largely separately at least for the vast majority of sales. But it seems like you were able to really cross-sell to some mutual customers relatively early on. So can you just talk about how you sort of envision the combined company maybe looking by the end of this fiscal year PlangGrid plus AutodeskBuildingConnected, and within that maybe touch on on the -- just a very minor overlap you might have with some products with Autodesk versus PlanGrid, and how you plan on sort of handling that? -- Yeah. So first off, all let me comment on some of those synergies we found in shared accounts. So one of the things we did very quickly as we established how we were going to go-to market with our named account side of our business, and a lot of the places where we're seeing like joint shared updates (ph) are in our named account business. So that was a place where we have a named account rep, where we can come in and say, hey, look you know what, we can augment your solution with PlanGrid and we can do some -- we can get this project, put it up on PlanGrid, we can get this project put it up on BIM 360 that's where you're seeing a lot of collaboration, that fits within our standard salesforce, and it's functioning really well, and we have an interconnect strategy between those two, and a quarter retirement strategy that allows people to cross-sell and get benefit in terms of quarter retirement for both sides of the equation.Now what you see that PlanGrid team being highly effective at is doing land and expand in new accounts in the construction ecosystem. And we focus a lot of that team on going out and reaching construction companies that we historically did not touch. And that's where they're spending a lot of energy. So they leverage our named accounts team for some of these synergistic sales and they go out and they find new business out there using their existing infrastructure, which works very effectively.As we move across into the year, what you're going to see is basically -- we're going to maintain that essential structure, but we're going to make sure that we coordinate sales more tightly within the Autodesk construction group as we move toward the end of the year. But we're going to continue to have that synergistic relationship between our named account program and the salesforce that sits inside of the construction group.And we just -- we just think those synergies are going to increase as the year progresses. Remember, we just rolled out a tokenized version of PlanGrid as well, and you know how effective we are at driving usage within some of the named accounts underneath our EBA, so you're going to see that have a synergistic factor as well and it's all brand new. I mean, we're very, very early on, in that. -- Got it. That's really helpful. Maybe for you Scott, just to peel back the onion a little bit on ARR. It was actually a little funny, the maintenance ARR number actually came in a little bit below what I was expecting, but I think the consensus is actually a little bit higher. Maintenance at this point is getting to be such a small part of the business, but I guess maybe just to better help -- better calibrate, maybe the pace of decline, any sort of idea for how we should think about that pace of decline in maintenance ARR, maybe through the rest of this year or some broad brushes? -- Yeah. So it's a great question, Saket. The M2S program, of course, just entered its third year, right, at the beginning of Q2, we just entered the third year of the M2S program. And this is when the more significant price increase goes into effect for those who want to renew maintenance.Ahead of that what we've seen is the maintenance renewal rates, we're not talking subs in renewal rates anymore, but if we were the maintenance renewal rates have held up very nicely in that space. And so we continue to see both success with conversions. I said that on the -- during the script that was in the range that it had been historically, of those that convert the upsell, the collections continues to be good. We're down to at this point just short of 700,000 maintenance customers left, and that I'm super pleased. We started this with a little more than 2 million maintenance subs, and we've now moved all but at about 700,000 over to product subscription. I think this year is the year where we'll see a lot more of the remainder move over. So what I would -- my expectations is we'll continue to see good success with that moving over. And of those that elect to say -- to stay what we have seen is the minus renewal rates are holding up nicely. -- Very helpful. Thanks guys. -- Thanks, Saket.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good evening. Andrew, let me start with you. One of the things that you've talked about with respect to digital infrastructure is your usage telemetry, your ability to observe and collect data about how customers are employing the products, particularly now the -- it's mostly subscription. Can you talk about any trends or key observations that you're getting from the use of telemetry (ph) particularly in the growing collection space.Second question there's been quite a bit of commentary in the call thus far with regard to direct sales, and how you're handling the integration of the construction acquisitions. A broader question perhaps about customer engagement, you like some other companies have created a new customer success group, and this has become increasingly common in software. What do they do? And how do you measure the success of the customer success group? -- Okay. All right. So let me start with the first question about the kind of the insights we're seeing. So we'll -- there's a few things I can tell you, one of the insights we're getting is, usage is continuing to go up, it's going up nicely across numerous product sets. And that's really great to see.The other thing we're seeing is that collections are seeing usage patterns better than the old suites in terms of how many products people are using, which shouldn't surprise you, because there's more offerings inside -- more diverse offerings inside the collections and we're seeing some of those things.And one of the other things I'll tell you is that the ramp up of quote (ph) new releases that were moving away from what we would like to consider major releases. People are ramping up on to the latest capabilities relatively quickly including the people who don't pay us, which is important for us to talk about, because it says, that cohort of non-paying users continues to follow us into some of the newer capabilities. And I think that's important in terms of the future capability of capturing some of that opportunity as we move forward.So yes, we are seeing some more fidelity in terms of usage, and we are seeing some interesting trends and some things that looked a lot better than they were in the suite days.Now in terms of the customer engagement team. The first thing I want to talk about is what is the team measured on? They're measured on net revenue retention. Okay. That's their job. Their job is to go in there and renew and help grow those accounts, and that's the primary metric they track. They also have metrics around NPS (ph) for the interaction that they have with the customers, not kind of global NPSs, but relationship NPSs and network net promoter scores around the various interactions.But, primarily, we measure them on how well we capture money from the renewal base and net revenue retention in particular. The way they function is a function along the spectrum from low touch -- low human touch digital relationships all the way up to high touch engagements.One of the digital infrastructures we built that's facing this team is what we call the early warning system, it's an umbrella of a lot of metrics that basically give this team a sense for how healthy an account is how healthy are they on their usage capabilities, how healthy are they on their adoption of learning tools, on other tools, has there been a drop off, and it helps them kind of spend their time with the accounts that need the most assistance and the most engagement with Autodesk. It is a new practice, we've beefed it up, it consolidates several things in the area, but I just want to emphasize the number one thing they're revenue -- they're measured on is net revenue retention and that's how we track the success of that organization. Scott, Do you want to add anything ? -- No. I think you nailed it. That's -- We -- the customer success team under Ray has actually done really nice job so far, and one of the things we mentioned Jay in the in the opening commentary is that our net revenue retention rate has stayed right in the range that we talked about at Investor Day. Last year, all year, it was in that approximately 110% to 120% range, and it stayed right there again in Q1. So Ray and his team are off to a really good start. -- Very good. Thanks very much. -- Thanks, Jay.Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you very much, gentlemen. I had a question about -- I know your referenced to linearity in your prepared remarks. I was wondering, if you could share -- if you noticed any impact or what you're hearing from your manufacturing customer base in the quarter just due to the kind of ongoing tariff war that seems to be going on, and if they've given you any sense of whether or not that's impacting their own spending plans?And also -- I'm just also just because I'm getting asked myself, you obviously had very good outperformance, it seemed on long term deferred versus some people's expectations. Could you share with us kind of how did short-term DR track versus your expectations? And that's it. Thank you. -- So I'll take the first part, then I'll hand the second part over to Scott. So you saw our manufacturing business grew quite nicely during the quarter, really strong growth. Now that doesn't mean we aren't hearing from our manufacturing customers that they're seeing pressure in terms of the commodities they use to build their products and things associated with that. They absolutely are. All of our customers are paying more for certain basic things to bring into their business.But you have to understand what we sell to them isn't a commodity, it isn't a metal or a fabrication or a supplier. It's a mission critical tool and it's a mission critical digital process. And a lot of our customers see these tools and expansion of their investment with us as helping them be more efficient and be more effective when they're seeing cost pressures rise in other areas. Like a lot of those competitive wins I talked about are really focused on consolidation of multiple tool sets into the single solution we offer, which is easier to deploy. It's lighter touch. It's got more and more end to end things, the different types of price points. So customers are actually looking to us to help them get more efficient, while they're seeing the cost of things that roll in the door to make their products go up.So we have not seen any kind of backing away of expenditures in our software space. We're seeing no signs of it. We haven't seen it yet, it doesn't mean things can't change. But we also -- we do know that our customers are turning to us to make them more efficient. And I think that, that puts us in a good position when they're seeing the cost of other parts of their business go up.Now I'll turn it over to Scott for the second part. -- Sure. On the second one, it's interesting, Heather, of course what you see showing up in long-term deferred, the sequential growth. There's some of the success we're having in -- having multi-year payments get closer to the mean that they had been in historically. We're still not quite there, right? So there's still a little more headroom in long-term deferred to get to what we talked about at Investor Day as that being kind of a low 20% range.If you look at the growth rate year-on-year, the long-term deferred grew 12%, short-term deferred actually grew 21% year-on-year. So we're seeing really nice performance as you'd expect when you see the billings line grow the way it as has. We're seeing really nice performance across the deferred revenue spectrum. When you add in unbilled, total deferred revenue grew 24% year-on-year. So it was a obviously strong billings quarter that led to both good revenue results, but in particular, strong growth in deferred. -- Great. Thank you very much. -- Thanks, Heather.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question please. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Andrew, we continue to hear positive feedback from channel partners around generative design, it really transforming the whole design process. I know this remains a focus for you guys. Wondering about a little bit of an update there on this momentum and really customer receptivity to this -- sort of this new way of designing ? -- Yeah. Well, there's a lot going on there, and we're rolling out a lot more in generative tools, especially to the Fusion platform. Manufacturer going to see some new capabilities in terms of generative geometry creation tied to 2.5 axis milling constraints and more of the mainstream kind of CNC applications the customers use. So we'll probably going to see a little bit of an explosion of use of some of these tools as we roll some of this out. But you're right, we're getting a lot of adoption. And the partners are excited about it, because they can go in and have a very, very differentiated discussion with their customers about what they can do with these tools.Now one of the things we're seeing, and I want to make sure that people understand this, because people thought, well, these are really advanced things, isn't just like 3D printing focused, and isn't this just for people that want to create organic shapes for 3D printing. The biggest usage right now that we're seeing with regards to generative design is people exploring new types of design options for things that they either had existing or they are building from scratch, and then taking those explorations and turning them into things they can build using their traditional manufacturing methods.So they're essentially using generative design as a tool to show them new solutions to problems that they wouldn't have naturally found in the first place. And that's one of the exciting things about what's going on right now is that, it's having a real impact in the mainstream (Technical Difficulty) customers and in the customers that are kind of looking out on the cutting edge of things. So you're absolutely right, there's lots of reasons to be excited and our partners are really getting engaged in our manufacturing portfolio, because of generative. -- That's great. And then maybe just a quick one for Scott, obviously, a lot of questions on the construction opportunity. I'm curious when you think about adding sales capacity to this year, how do you kind of think about into the overall pace, and then, how do you think about putting that sort of like more or so in the construction versus A&E or the manufacturing side, just sort of wondering about, just sort of how you kind of allocating your sales capacity adds this year ? -- Sure. Construction is such a massive opportunity for us Matt, it won't surprise you to hear that we rotate a lot of investment into it. Coming on the heels of the acquisitions we did in the fourth quarter, we've also increased spend in each of those. It wasn't the normal buy them and go through a bit of a downsizing, we've actually done the reverse. We've acquired those companies, integrated them nicely into Autodesk and at the same time increased the investment in construction. So great results out of the gate as Andrew mentioned in the opening commentary, and I think you can expect to see us at this level of performance, and what the market really beginning to turn this direction, you can expect to see us continue to invest in construction. -- Sounds good. Thanks, guys. -- All right. Thanks, Matt.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So for the customers that are still on maintenance, do you have a sense for how the percentage of that group who might upgrade to collections compares to the folks who are already converted? -- What I'd say Ken is really haven't seen the needle move much on that. We've had great success at the point of people moving from maintenance over to product subscription, we've had great success having them kind of cross grade and instead of going single product to single product, going single product to collection. And that really hasn't changed over the last six quarters or eight quarters now that we've been tracking into us. So I'm not expecting a significant change.The one thing I would note in the demographic which is quite not surprising to you, the bigger customers that aren't EDA (ph) eligible, obviously the bigger customers that were on maintenance were some of the first to adopt into us and move over. It's not as bigger skew as you might think from the biggest to the smallest, but there is a little bit of a bias to the larger customers. As we get down to the smaller and smaller customers, we might see a point or two difference there, but I wouldn't expect it to be significant. Andrew, anything you'd add? -- No. I think we've seen a consistent pattern, and we don't see anything that would indicate that changing. I agree with you. It's probably going to make a point or two different as we get deeper into that base. Just because of the size and because maybe a mix shift inside that what's left to the maintenance base. -- All right. -- Great. And are you seeing any non-payer conversion from the shift to a serial number free licensing model. -- We always see non-payer conversion every year. So one of the things I just have to say, because I say it every call, this non-paying conversion thing isn't going to be this big explosion, all right. It's an ongoing process. Some of these people have very clever ways. They continue to not pay us. But what I will tell you is that we've successfully rolled out some really interesting ways to have conversations with these customers and engage with them directly. And we are learning a lot that we think is going to play pretty significantly into our long-term strategy with regards to converting these people.We have direct engages with them. We can track where they go after an engagement whether or not, they continue to pirate or they pursue some kind of other path. So we're learning a lot. And that's what we expected to do this year. Every year, we convert non-paying users into users, every year, we convert more than we did the previous year. But more importantly, every year, we're learning more about how to effectively engage with these customers. And that should give you a really good feeling about the long-term growth prospects as we start looking at those 14 million non-paying users and converting them over the next few years. -- Great. That's helpful. -- Thanks, Ken.Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Yeah. Thanks. Hi guys. I think you gave commentary that you saw strength across geographies, obviously see the pie chart with the percentages. But just wondering for -- about some colored commentary. Looking at the PMI results coming out of Europe today, there's been questions in other areas of software around possible squishing as here in North America, what are you seeing from just the macro by geography ? -- So we're not seeing any kind of geography-based slowdowns. And by the way, the PMI in EMEA has actually been in contraction territory for a while. So it isn't like a new phenomena. And for us, we see the PMI as measuring a different side of the demand curve. It's much more focused on the purchasing of kind of the core assets that kind of go in the door and come out as product. We're selling efficiency in digital transformation. So right now, we -- and what -- actually let's just look back historically, we've never seen a strong correlation between the PMI and near-term impacts on our business.Long term, as the PMI phasing (ph) contraction territory, you absolutely, eventually would see an impact on our business. Short-term what people do is they tend to buy more of our software to try to invest in digitization and kind of getting their processes more aligned, more efficient. So we're not seeing any slowdown in any geographic areas. And the ongoing PMI results don't signal anything to us in terms of our demand environment. -- Okay. And then one follow up, do you mind as where are we in terms of the various pricing or discount changes both on maintenance and other parts that you had outlined at the beginning of the transition. What changes recently went into effect if any? And what were the impacts ? -- Yeah. Sterling on the -- you're talking about the maintenance to subscription program that we're -- -- Yeah. -- That we just began or if you remember, we started that program actually kind of middle of Q2 a couple of years ago. So we just began the third year of that. And at the third year, what we have said then and just went into effect at the beginning of May is the cost to convert -- the price to convert would go up by 5%, the price through renew maintenance from last year, the price through new maintenance have got up 20%.So both of those increases went into effect in early May. So we're sitting three weeks into that right now, not expecting to see any significant change in terms of renewal rate. I do think at this point, it probably becomes a lot more attractive for those that have gone under maintenance, to actually make the conversion. Through the first quarter what we saw in conversion rates, as they kind of held in at that roughly a third that are converting at about the point of renewal. We'll see now with the difference in -- pretty significant difference in price. We'll see how that goes in this quarter and through the end of the year. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Thanks, Sterling.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Matthew Broome of Mizuho. Your line is open. -- Thanks very much. You recently launched 2020 additions (ph) to AutoCAD, Revit and some other products. Just curious how early feedback has been for that. So that which new features you believe will have the biggest impact? -- Yeah. So like I said earlier, we've seen pretty rapid adoption of these capabilities as they rolled out, which actually bodes well for how customers are reacting to those things. I don't have any feedback on particular feature sets. Because we're working like a big lumps of areas, like in one area we're working on in Revit in particular, is on rail and things associated with rail and adding capabilities that make it more efficient for rail. So there's going to be lots of areas and each one of these products that are broadly accepted. But when it comes to AutoCAD in particular, customers are starting to embrace the multi-platform nature of what we've done with AutoCAD, and the way we're making it easy to integrate not only our own storage environments, but third-party storage environments like Dropbox and Box, and other types of environments, so that our customers can efficiently use AutoCAD data in multiple types of storage environments.One of the features we rolled out and it doesn't get a lot of visibility is that when a customer is inside the Dropbox environment, and they go and they click on a DWG files, it actually launches the AutoCAD -- AutoCAD web, the viewer -- and it put its full AutoCAD web, and it actually says, you are subscriber, if you're a subscriber they get the edit experience. But it is the -- AutoCAD web version inside these applications, that kind of reach that we're getting with some of those things is actually exposing more and more customers to the power of the mult-platform view we've taken with some of these applications. So I think you're going to hear more and more about what we're doing there.On the Revit side, you're going to hear more and more about some of the things we're doing around rail and other areas, where we're extending the capabilities to be not just Revit, but in InfraWorks such as more specifically say it's on the InfraWorks side. You're going to hear more and more about some of those things as well. But those are some of the areas that are getting a lot of interest and a lot of traction. -- That's interesting. Thanks. And I guess, could you provide a brief update on the media and entertainment business. It looks like there was a little bit of revenue deceleration there during the quarter. -- Yeah. So there's a couple of things you want to know about the media and entertainment business. One, it's very sensitive to large deals. All right. So for instance in Q4, we had a couple of really big deals in M&E. So there was a quarter or a quarter change around media and entertainment just related those deals. Last Q1, we also had a big deal that came in. And like I said, the media and entertainment business of all our businesses is very sensitive to these large deals. So there is a quarter over compare to that large deal, but in addition and this is something I want you to pay attention to over a multi-quarter scenario, similar to what we did in our manufacturing business, we've retired certain products in that space that we're no longer collecting revenue on and you'll see some kind of year-over-year declines associated with that. So for instance, we don't charge for sketchbook anymore that product is out there, it's completely free, it's available to people to anybody who wants to use it. That, that money isn't in there anymore, and it shows up in the year-over-year. But those are things that are affecting the M&E business.We actually had a pretty robust M&E quarter, right? But as I said, there's sensitivity to large deals and this idea that we feel kind of retired certain products especially things like sketchbook that are going to have year-over-year impacts. -- Okay. Thanks very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Oliver of Baird. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you guys, appreciate it. I wanted to take it back to the construction side if I could Andrew, and talk a little bit about the pricing side. I know you've said you guys favor the named user bundles. How is pricing playing out so far relative to your expectations coming in? And on those 15 deals in particular, where there was head-to-head competition, did price play a role at all? And then I have a very quick follow-up? Thanks. -- Yeah. So first off, like I said, we're really happy with the results of construction in Q1, we hit all our goals we're looking good heading into Q2, we're really happy with things that are going on. So let me tell you right out of the gate, that the pricing models are working in their form, but I think I know you're asking a different question.So like -- when we go in against the competitor, let me tell you about the two things that help us win. The first thing is competitors just like the story, they see us with a best-in-class field execution solution at one end, they see us with a best-in-class design collaboration solution at the other end, all cloud-based. And they just look at us and when we tell them look, we're going to connect the building information model all the way from design through to site execution, and we're going to do it with these things in between, they believe us, and they see it and they expect it all of its functionality is going to roll out over time. And when we do things like accelerate the rollout of PlanGrid BIM into the PlanGrid environment as quickly as we did, people start to say, OK, thank you Autodesk, you're showing us the evidence that we're heading in the right direction.So they buy the vision, they buy Autodesk role, they don't see anybody else able to do this end-to-end kind of connection the way we're doing, and that's been something we've been consistent about.And yes, when they go in and look at the business model that we come to market with, they say look yours is a much more customer-friendly business model, this is one I can grow with. This business model over here is this going to penalize me as I grow. So yes, we do see those things. But I want to just make it clear, primary reason we win is the big story. And that's the thing that is getting customers excited. It's the thing that's engaging them, and it's the thing that's bringing more people into our ecosystem and we are seeing that. -- Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks. And just as a quick follow up, and Andrew, you had mentioned on the last call and Scott just reiterated. Did you guys not only absorb the planned R&D at PlanGrid and BuildingConnected but you've ramped that R&D. And aside from platforming and integration, and this -- and I apologize because this maybe leading on to the -- to for the ramp (ph) of other areas that you're seeing from the end user functionality perspective, that are interesting to you as a possible recipient of those R&D dollars. Thank you guys very much. -- Yeah. So one of the things, I want to make sure I reiterate. I mentioned this during the last call, but I think it bodes restating, we've definitely applied clear missions to the two product stacks and the two teams frankly and we've actually swapped people back and forth between the two teams. PlanGrid is very much focused on field execution and being the best-in-class tool for field execution. So they're looking to accelerate the roadmap that they had in place for field execution both customer-driven and internally driven, and that's where they're spending their dollars.On BIM 360, we're focusing the BIM 360 team much more on closing all the gaps around project management and things associated with project management, RFI flow and all of the things that go -- connected to that and then connecting those things back to the PlanGrid environment and the customer see a seamless flow. So we've -- this mission-based assignment of teams has been super important. It has resulted in additional R&D dollars going in.We are absolutely accelerating PlanGrid's roadmap, not decelerating it, and we're accelerating BIM 360's roadmap with regards to project management capabilities. So that, that you will hear more about in June. But I think it's important to just reiterate, where we put the money and how we're spending it to moving forward. Because we really do want these solutions to survive, thrive, grow and connect together rapidly inside Autodesk. So we're committed to that and yes, we spend more and we brought them in and we got the results we wanted. So I think we're going to keep doing that. -- That's great. Thanks again, gentlemen. Appreciate it. -- Thanks, Rob.Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thank you very much, gentlemen. My question Andrew for you is when you look at the maintenance subscription conversion program, can you just give us an update on how much of that installed base has accepted the price increase versus converting to subscriptions and what is left in that third bucket? Any strategy or plans you might have in place to convince the last set of holdouts to get on the program. Thank you very much. -- Yeah. So we never, we never expected that every subscription -- that every maintenance customer was going to move to subscription during this program. I think one thing that's important to note is we basically converted two-thirds of them already at this point. So there's really only one-third of the subscription base left from when we started this program. And as we told you over and over again, we've -- everyone we've moved, we're growing the value of those customers through consolidation and through other efforts associated with that.So we have to pause and look at well how far have we come here with regards to this program. And I think it's pretty impressive results given what we're trying to accomplish.We have always expected that by the end of the year, there were going to be a set of customers left in, and there are going to be a set of customers left in maintenance. But I think also what you heard from Scott earlier is that the renewal rates for maintenance are holding up quite well, incredibly well actually even with the price increases that are in front of customers. So customers are going with us along the journey. There are going to be some left at the end of the year still on maintenance, and we'll look at what we do in terms of working with those customers as we get to that point. But we're already two-thirds in there, we'll be more than two-thirds by the end of the year, we've been successful in increasing the value of those customers and most of those customers that have moved over are happy and the ones that are still on maintenance are renewing it at robust rates. So the program looks like a success to me. -- Thank you very much. -- Thanks, Kash.Thank you. Next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Hi, this is Hamza Fodderwala in for Keith Weiss. Just a couple of quick questions from my end. The first one, so the manufacturing revenue growth really accelerated this quarter and it's been up double-digits for a few quarters now. I'm just wondering what's the inflection point there as far as you starting to really put up growth that's faster than many of your peers, what's driving some of that share gain? And what's the roadmap there going forward? -- So Hamza what you're seeing there is the strength that was always there underneath that you couldn't see, because of all the product retirements we did. Alright. So we've been doing this for several quarters in the core part of our business, which is one of the reasons why we're so excited about, how we're doing in manufacturing in general right now.You saw declines or slowness in the manufacturing business, because we retired a whole set of products. Some of them we just retired completely, some of them were transitioned into the collections environment, some of them were combined with other products, we did some large consolidations, and this resulted in some revenue that is essentially disappeared. But it showed up eventually in other places, so now what you're seeing is the underlying strength in the core manufacturing business that was always there. And we're -- like I said excited about it and when you look at some of the things that are in the roadmap, what you're going to see is tighter and tighter coupling of this design to make workflows. You're going to see more showing up in Fusion with regards to end to end design all the way through to machining workflows and new generative algorithms that take not only 3D printing workflows, but -- workflows for 2 axis, 2.5 axis, 3 axis milling operations and automating the geometry creation. You're also going to see more workflows between Inventor and Fusion. So that Inventor customers can take advantage of the downstream production workflows that are built inside a Fusion. Customers are starting to look inside the manufacturing and -- the product design and manufacturing collection and they're cracking it open and they're seeing some things that they think are pretty amazing. That's part and parcel of what's driving our growth.Customers are consolidating on what we have because they see us. I can take these eight weird things that I had against consolidating this as one thing. And by the way I've got this cloud workflow that makes all my data problems a lot cleaner and it's just working. And I expect you'll see it to continue to work in the future. So I'm just happy you can now see the underlying strength in the business that we knew was there all along. -- Got it. And just a quick follow up. We did hear that there was a price increase on multi-user licenses in May. Just wondering if that caused any pull forward business from Q2 to Q1. That's it from me. -- So we did see and we referred to this a little bit in the opening commentary, Hamza. We did see a little bit of early renew activity, but really the same percent that we've seen historically. So if you add up our total sales what percent were early renews where you'd see people trying to front run the price increases earlier renews. So as we looked at that, it was really in line from a percentage basis with what we've seen historically.So I don't -- I'm not anticipating any change or any kind of an impact to the full year model from that.

Since we're still inside earnings season, quarterly results are driving much of tonight's post-market trading.   reported its Q1 figures following market close, around the same time as corporate cousins  and  unveiled their respective Q2s.Outside of quarterly results,  , it seems, was the focus of some good news from its most important regulator.A Boeing 737 MAX 8 in use by Air China. Image source: Boeing.Boeing's controversial plane might be flying again very soon. According to a report from Reuters released in the late afternoon, citing \"three people with knowledge of the matter,\" Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) representatives said that the 737 MAX jets might be allowed to fly domestic routes as soon as late June.The comments were apparently made in a briefing on the plane that took place in Montreal between the officials from the U.S. regulator and members of the governing council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The ICAO is the United Nations' aviation agency.Reuters' sources added that there is not yet a precise timetable for the un-grounding to occur.The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March, following two crashes that occurred in close succession with nearly new models of the aircraft. Although the FAA initially defended the plane, it soon followed by grounding it in the U.S.The FAA, the ICAO, and Boeing have not yet commented officially on the Reuters report.\u00a0The company's stock is up cautiously in post-market trading Thursday evening.Autodesk, maker of popular design software, hasn't gotten off to a pretty start in its fiscal 2020. The company reported Q1 results that didn't meet expectations.For the quarter, Autodesk's net revenue came in at $735.5 million, 31% higher year over year, on billings that increased 40% to $798 million. Adjusted net income rose considerably, landing at $99 million ($0.45 per share) against Q1 2019's $14.4 million ($0.06).\u00a0Subscription revenue improved markedly. The company also attributed the overall growth to factors such as the strong performance of its solutions for the construction industry.In spite of the big improvements, the headline figures were under analyst estimates. On average, prognosticators were modeling $740 million on the top line and a per-share adjusted net profit of $0.47.Autodesk's Q2 and full-year guidance, however, broadly met expectations. The company predicts it will book $3.25 billion to $3.30 billion in revenue for the latter period, and earnings of $2.71 to $2.90 per share. Analysts have estimated $3.29 billion and $2.83, respectively.Evening traders don't seem impressed by these numbers. Autodesk shares are down by nearly 9% in after-hours action.Two peas once in the same corporate pod, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise both reported their respective Q2 2019s late afternoon Thursday.If we go by after-market trading, HP had the better quarter according to investors. Here's the side-by-side scorecard:Data Sources: HP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Barron's, HDNet. *Adjusted. YOY = year over year.\u00a0For HP, no one product segment stood out as an over-performer, with some declining in revenue and some advancing. In the latter dynamic, commercial revenue increased an encouraging 7%.Hewlett Packard Enterprise's segment performance was similarly mixed. One bright spot was the company's Aruba wireless networking unit. Its services revenue rose by 16%, although this was partially offset by an 8% decline in its product revenue.HP is winning the post-market trading race just now.

There are some stocks that might just shrug off the summertime blues though. Granted, they\u2019re few and far between, but if a company is able to prove it can grow rapidly even if the economy bumps into a headwind, traders just might gravitate to these names and push them higher.To that end (and in no particular order), here\u2019s a run-down of ten companies boasting outsized growth when other outfits can\u2019t exactly say the same.

How about companies that are trying to disrupt the market, potentially generating substantial rewards if they get it right? Here we take a closer look at three top-rated tech stocks primed to outperform in the coming months. By using  data we can also dive in to the latest recommendations from best-performing analysts to gain their investing insights into these top 3 stock picks. ( \u2013 )In essence, AutoDesk makes products for people who make things. Its groundbreaking technology enables everyone from architects to engineers to create digital prototypes. And by optimizing plans from early in the process customers can save both time and money. Indeed, ADSK already operates as an industry-standard, must-have technology in nearly every industry it operates in.However change is afoot. For the last two years, the company has been steadily shifting its business model, moving from the sale and maintenance of software packages and installations to a SaaS mode, selling subscriptions to cloud-based products. The move has been successful; subscription revenues now count for $2.2 billion, 83% of the $2.57 billion annual total. In terms of customer numbers, Autodesk has 4 million subscribers of whom 3.2 million are subscription-based. At current growth rates, AutoDesk could double its subscription rate within three years.What\u2019s more, the company is at the cusp of a major opportunity in the construction industry. According to estimates, the rapidly-growing construction software market could reach $10 billion market by 2020. So it\u2019s no surprise that Autodesk has worked hard to boost its construction offering recently.ADSK snapped up construction software platform BuildingConnected for $275 million back in December, supplementing its previous $875 million purchase for PlanGrid the previous month. As CEO Andrew Anagnost explained: \u201cWe are investing in digitizing and automating construction workflows. Autodesk\u2019s goal is to connect construction processes across design, build and operations.\u201dGladly, the deals received the thumbs up from the Street. Most notably, five-star Oppenheimer analyst Koji Ikeda () writes: \u201cWe believe the business is well positioned in a large but lightly penetrated construction industry that is yearning for next-generation technologies, like Autodesk's, to help digitize the industry, which should act as a pillar for Autodesk's next leg of growth beyond FY2020.\u201d He has a buy rating on the stock, and recently ramped up the price target from $160 to $190 (24% upside potential). ( \u2013 )Apple has already demonstrated that its willing to shake things up this year with its much-hyped press event on March 25. The company\u2019s \u201c\u201d special event ushered in a new wave of monetization opportunities. It also provided users with even more reasons to inhabit Planet Apple in the coming years- all while reducing Apple\u2019s much-slated iPhone dependency.The only physical product announced at the event was a titanium credit card, but there was still plenty for investors to get excited about. Alongside the new reward card, Apple revealed new media subscription services including the $9.99/ month Apple News Plus (magazine), Apple Arcade (mobile game), and Apple TV Plus (TV and movie streaming). In terms of timelines, Apple News Plus is immediately available while other services will launch later in 2019.\u201cApple is offering more user-friendly subscription services to its installed base (largely in North America). We see clear benefits and differentiating features that may appeal to niche audiences\u201d commented five-star Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz (). However, as Uerkwitz points out, there is still much we need to know. Most critically, the price of Apple TV remains one of the biggest unanswered questions- and ultimately could make or break the product in the face of so many rival streaming services. Not that this has dimmed the enthusiasm of Monness analyst Brian White (). He writes in his post-event report of the new TV offering- dubbed the Netflix killer- \u201cwe believe this new service lays the foundation for a significant revenue stream for Apple over the next decade and provides the company with a blank canvas to experiment with original content.\u201d ( \u2013 )CarGurus\u2019 mission is to be the world\u2019s most trusted and transparent auto marketplace. It currently offers consumers the largest used cars inventory (5.4MM units), with an active network of over 40,000 US dealers. So far the company is excelling thanks to its savvy consumer focus. Just one example, CARG\u2019s monthly audience size are over 2x competing marketplaces, with traffic continuing to see healthy growth.\u201cCARG\u2019s differentiated, consumer-centric marketplace is enabling it to quickly grow site traffic while rival platforms seem constrained in their ability to respond/follow\u201d cheers five-star SunTrust Robinson analyst Naved Khan (). The analyst has a $52 price target- suggesting shares have 38% upside potential to run in the coming months. And recent investor meetings have only served to drive more positive attention from the Street. On March 26, DA Davidson analyst Tom White \"enthusiastically\" affirmed his Buy rating and $54 price target. From current levels that indicates upside potential of over 40%. Management is confident of having \"the wind at its back in virtually all elements of its business in 2018\" and fully expects 2019 momentum to continue.White believes CarGurus can generate significant audience/connections growth thanks to a \"growing contribution from upselling\" newer products. Just a handful of these innovations include SEM, Dealer Display, Delivery, enhanced listings, and Audience Re-targeting. At the same time, the analyst anticipates that CarGurus delivery offerings for dealers should grow increasing popular with paying customers.This review wouldn\u2019t be complete without mentioning a recent upgrade from Goldman Sachs. Analyst Daniel Powell upgraded CarGurus to buy after assuming coverage from Heath Terry. Citing traffic growth and marketing efficiency, Powell also boosted the firm\u2019s price target from $43 to $48.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (Symbol: IGV) where we have detected an approximate $93.8 million dollar inflow -- that's a 3.6% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 12,600,000 to 13,050,000).

I am excited to share with you our impressive close to fiscal 2019 and the strong momentum we experienced closing the year. Consistent with the prior two quarters, we experienced strong performance across all geographic regions and in all product categories. In fiscal '19, we achieved multiple milestones putting us in an excellent position to deliver on our fiscal '20 targets and advance the company to the next chapter of growth. Here are some of the key accomplishments we achieved this year.Recurring revenue was 95% of total revenues for the full year and has reached a steady state. Our total revenues of nearly $2.6 billion were the highest ever in the company's history. Our total subscription plan subs are now greater than total maintenance subs were at the peak of the prior model. We returned to positive free cash flow and earnings. We significantly expanded operating margin, and we strengthened our construction portfolio and now have an unrivaled breadth of construction solutions. Beyond that, I couldn't be prouder of the Autodesk team that delivered these results. They worked hard, and they deserve all the credit, and it's my honor to represent them.Now before I dig deeper into our successes in the quarter, let me take a step back and revisit the five key priorities I laid out for the company at the beginning of last year. Our top priority entering fiscal 2019 was the continued execution of the business model transition. We now have less than 20% of our revenues coming from maintenance agreements, and I am happy to report that we are effectively finished with the model transition and look forward to executing on our growth strategy.We continue to invest in digitizing the company to provide our customers with a better experience as they go through their own digital transformations, which is a recurring theme we hear from all of them.We have a focus on driving the Building Information Model through the design and make process in AEC. And during the year, we highlighted a number of customer wins that are using BIM to manage their design and make processes in the AEC industry. We look forward to executing on that theme further in fiscal '20 as BIM momentum remains strong. We are continuing to invest in automating the process of design to manufacturing. And we are seeing early signs of the convergence of construction and manufacturing processes.Looking at our Q4 performance, we built upon the broad-based strength of the last couple of quarters by achieving 34% growth in annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, which remains the most important metric for us. We are becoming a more strategic partner for all of our customers, but in particular, for our larger customers, a fact reflected in the strong growth of our enterprise business. Within product categories, we continue to see greater adoption of Industry Collections and our BIM 360 solutions. In line with our expectations, our free cash flows accelerated in a meaningful way as our billings topped $1 billion for the first time in the fourth quarter.Scott will walk you through more of the financials, but I want to spend a little bit more time talking about our progress in various areas. Expertise in our products remains in high demand and is growing rapidly. According to Indeed Hiring Lab, AutoCAD expertise is featured among the top 10 fastest growing skills in technology job searches. In addition, according to Upwork's latest quarterly index, Revit expertise is featured among the top 15 hottest skills for freelancers in the US job market. These are important indicators of the on-going opportunity we have to grow our subscription base and to turn more and more of our users into subscribers.During the year, we strengthened the foundation of our construction business with both organic and inorganic investments. In addition to investing in our BIM 360 portfolio, we purchased Assemble Systems to bolster our preconstruction capabilities, PlanGrid for document-centric workflows and field execution, and BuildingConnected for bidding and risk management. This year, our focus is on integrating these businesses to deliver even greater value to our customers. The broadened product portfolio will help us expand our presence with general contractors, sub-contractors, and building owners. The feedback from our customers regarding these acquisitions has been overwhelmingly positive and they are excited about the expansion of our portfolio.For instance, Clayco, a leading construction and design firm based in Chicago, has been an Autodesk customer for many years. As users of BIM 360, Assemble, PlanGrid and BuildingConnected, they have fully embraced the digitization of construction. They rely on the breadth of our portfolio to deliver value to their customers by automating their design and make activities throughout the pre-construction and construction processes. We look forward to strengthening our relationship with Clayco by investing in solutions that span their workflows. Additionally, we see opportunities to expand our relationships with other leading companies in the space.Beyond that, BIM adoption remains one of the key drivers of investments in the infrastructure space. Mandates for using BIM drove another seven-figured enterprise agreement with a large European infrastructure provider during the quarter. We doubled our contract with the customer as they look to expand their adoption of BIM for building and managing their infrastructure projects. Our unique portfolio of design tools is allowing them to expand from products like AutoCAD and Inventor into Revit, the world's leading BIM design tool, BIM 360 for site execution, and other advanced analysis tools. We look forward to strengthening our partnership with them and many other organizations that are looking to rely on advanced technologies to drive efficiencies.On the manufacturing side, generative design and our investments in Fusion continue to attract global manufacturing leaders to partner with us. During the quarter, we signed an enterprise agreement with Hyundai Motor Group who plans to leverage our technologies to create innovative designs. Hyundai is very interested in utilizing our capabilities in generative design and we look forward to partnering with them to drive innovation in the automotive space.In summary, I am extremely pleased with our fiscal '19 performance and I'm excited about the future. We are entering fiscal '20 with strong momentum in every geographic region and across all product categories. This sets us up well to achieve our target of $1.35 billion of free cash flow this year. We also expect to see acceleration in our construction business this year and beyond. When combined with continued execution in the core, this will drive strong ARR growth into the future and help us reach our FY23 goals.Now I'll turn it over to Scott for more details on the financials. -- Thanks Andrew. Before digging into the numbers, I would echo Andrew's excitement entering fiscal '20 as we are experiencing great momentum in our business, driven by strong execution. Record billings of just over $1 billion in the quarter, coupled with better than expected cash collections, drove free cash flow of $294 million. For the year, we ended up generating free cash flow of $310 million. This kind of powerful leverage in the model drives our confidence in achieving our fiscal '20 cash flow target.Before discussing more detailed financial metrics for the quarter, let me highlight the impact of the fourth quarter acquisitions on our results. The acquisitions contributed $27 million to ARR, $7 million to total revenue, and $43 million to billings for the quarter. Recall that we calculate billings by adding the change in deferred revenues from the balance sheet to our reported revenues. The acquisitions contributed $36 million to deferred revenue on the balance sheet and $61 million to unbilled deferred, for a combined contribution of $97 million to total deferred revenue.The acquisitions also increased our total expenses by $12 million, resulting in a negative impact of $5 million to our operating income, or 85 basis points to our non-GAAP margin for the quarter. The acquisitions negatively impacted our non-GAAP Earnings Per Share by $0.03. Lastly, they contributed 127,000 subscriptions that are included within our reported Cloud and total subs numbers. Please refer to the earnings slide deck on our website for more information on the contribution from acquisitions and our adjusted results for the quarter. Now, I will discuss the remaining financial metrics excluding acquisitions as our fourth quarter 2019 guidance did not include their contributions.Our Q4 ARR growth of 33% benefited from a 17% increase in total ARPS, and a 13% increase in subscriptions. Our strong performance across all product lines and geographic regions drove the results for the quarter. There was approximately 1 percentage point of benefit to the ARR growth related to upfront revenue recognition of some products, such as VRED and Vault that do not incorporate substantial cloud services and are recognized up front. Before I go into more details about our subs and ARPS, let me reiterate that this is the last time we will be disclosing subs and ARPS on a quarterly basis. Going forward, we will use events like our annual Investor Day to report on these metrics that will help you build your long-term models.Looking at subscriptions, we grew total subscriptions by 13% to 4.2 million. In the quarter, our subscription plan subs grew by 291,000 organically, led by growth in product subscriptions. We added 51,000 cloud subs driven by the continued adoption of our BIM 360 solutions. For core subscriptions, our net additions of 74,000 were driven by strong adoption of our Industry Collections, which continue to grow as a percentage of net new product subscriptions sold. Industry Collections now represent approximately 28% of our total product subscription installed base.Moving to the Maintenance to Subscription program, or M2S, we continue to make solid progress. In Q4, 110,000 customers migrated from maintenance to product subscriptions. We now have converted nearly 800,000 maintenance customers to subscription since the inception of the program. Similar to the last few quarters, the conversion rate remained strong with approximately one-third of the maintenance renewal opportunities migrating to product subscriptions. Of those that migrated, upgrade rates among eligible subscriptions remained within the historical range of 25% to 35%. We expect the number of M2S migrations to moderate in fiscal '20 as we have less than 800,000 maintenance subs remaining.Maintenance renewal rates experienced a modest decline versus a year ago, which is as expected. Product subscription renewal rates ticked up year-over-year. Overall, we continue to experience very high renewal rates for M2S-related subs. And, Industry Collections continue to command high renewal rates. We expect the renewal rate for product subs to keep increasing as the product mix shifts toward higher value products. Now let's talk a little more about annualized revenue per subscription, or ARPS.Total ARPS posted another quarter of strong growth as it continues to benefit from the same drivers we discussed at last year's Investor Day and that has manifested in the previous few quarters. These drivers include continued growth of the renewal base, which comes at a higher net price to Autodesk; the increase in digital sales, also at a higher net price to Autodesk; the product mix shift to Industry Collections; the maintenance price increase for those customers who don't take advantage of the M2S program; and less discounting and promotional activity.Contributions from our direct business rose by 2 points sequentially to 30%. Our eStore, which is playing a bigger part in our digital sales, grew by more than 50% in fiscal 2019. For the past six quarters, our eStore has generated over 20% of the new product subscriptions. Q4 also marked the ninth consecutive quarter of more than 30% growth in our enterprise business, demonstrating greater adoption within our largest customers. In fact, our EBAs posted over 60% revenue growth in the quarter.Looking at the balance sheet, total deferred revenue grew by 13%, which also includes the unbilled amount. Unbilled deferred revenue increased by $80 million sequentially to $530 million due to strong EBA performance. Our long-term deferred revenue posted sequential growth for the first time in seven quarters driven by multi-year subscriptions, which we expect to normalize back toward historical norms during fiscal '20 and beyond.While our stock repurchases slowed down in Q4 as we were conserving cash for the acquisitions, we used $293 million in fiscal year '19 to repurchase 2.2 million shares at an average price of $130.15. We remain committed to managing dilution and reducing shares outstanding over time.Now I'll turn the discussion to our outlook. I'll start by saying that our view of the global economic conditions remains unchanged from the last few quarters and we continue to monitor the potential macroeconomic impact from Brexit and the various trade and tariff disputes. There has been some foreign exchange volatility, but our hedging program has succeeded in smoothing out the bigger swings.We are reiterating our fiscal '20 free cash flow outlook of approximately $1.35 billion. Our across the board strength and momentum exiting fiscal '19 will help us drive ARR growth in the range of 27% to 29%. On an organic basis, we expect our total non-GAAP expenses to grow by only 2% while the acquisitions will drive another seven points of growth. In-line with our initial plans, we expect billings growth to accelerate to about 50% due to continued normalization of our multi-year billings, flow through from unbilled deferred revenue, strength in our renewals, new subscription growth, and acquisitions. Recall that our fiscal '19 billings were negatively impacted due to the adoption of ASC 606 accounting standard, which combined with the recent acquisitions is offering a little over 10 percentage point tailwind to our billings growth in fiscal '20.When looking at the quarterization of free cash flow for fiscal '20, given normal seasonality and strength of payment collections and large deals signed in the fourth quarter, we expect about three-fourths of our free cash flow to be generated in the second half of the year. Lastly, the non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal '20 is expected to be 18%, or a point lower than fiscal '19.Looking at our guidance for the first quarter, our strength in the fourth quarter presents a tough sequential compare. Given normal software seasonality, other revenue in Q1 is expected to be about half as much as we experienced in Q4. Normalizing for the upfront revenue recognition in the fourth quarter subscriptions and contributions from recent acquisitions, our expected sequential change for the first quarter revenue growth is in line with our historical trends. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for the fiscal first quarter and full year 2020.Before we start the Q&A part of this call, I want to summarize by highlighting that fiscal '19 was a year of milestones for us. We exited the year with strong momentum in our free cash flow that drove our revenue growth plus free cash flow margin to 37% for the year. Going forward, we continue to focus on growing our free cash flows driven by ARR growth and margin expansion. I could not be prouder of the accomplishments of the Autodesk team and I want to acknowledge our fantastic employees, customers, and partners around the world.We look forward to seeing most of you at our analyst day on March 28th where we will discuss our plans in more details. Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press the * then 1 key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the # key. Again, that's * then 1 to ask a question. In the interest of time, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.Our first question comes from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Thanks, guys, for taking my questions and congrats on a great close to the year. Andrew, I just wanted to focus in on the tone of business. Obviously, Scott mentioned your view of the economic video conditions were still positive on change from the last couple of quarters. If you do a drill down into the industry, AEC manufacturing, what's the feedback that you're hearing from customers about their spending intentions? Anything that you want to call out there? And then just one follow-up for Scott on that. -- Yeah. All right, Phil, thanks. Look, like we said, we're seeing strength across all the geographies and all the industries. Everyone is growing well, and everyone is signaling an intention to keep buying. So, right now, we don't see signs of a slow down in anyone's purchasing activity. And you know, we probably told you previously many times that we watch the AutoCAD and LT revenue streams fairly carefully to see if we see any signs. Those grew 36% year over year and they're still robust and strong. So, right now, all of the industries are looking good, Phil. They're all showing signs of continued growth. So, nothing is slowing down right now. -- Yeah. Phil, from a revenue standpoint AEC growth was 25% for the quarter and it's flat sequentially. So, AEC has been continually been strong for us all year and continues to be strong. Manufacturing growth actually kicked up from 20% in Q3 to 29% in the quarter we just closed. So, if anything, we're seeing it stay on path and get stronger. -- Definitely. And Scott, just a follow-up on your comments on ARPS and just wondering if you could help us just kind of frame this fiscal year. Obviously, you've got a lot of positives in fiscal '19, your maintenance pricing, M2S, Collections. How are you thinking about ARPS this coming year and maybe just kind of walk us through the push and takes of this year compared to fiscal '19? -- Yeah. So, I think we'll continue to see the same trends that we've in ARPS. The long-term drivers of ARPS growth are still in place, that's the continued shift to Industry Collections obviously drives ARPS up. We gave you some stats in the opening commentary that the Industry Collections were now 28% of our total product subscription base, which is huge. So, that's driving ARPS up. I think that trend continues. We'll see higher net from continuing growth in renewal base. And you know renewals come to us at a higher net price. We will see the continued shift to direct sales, which also comes to us at a higher price. And then, you know, smaller pricing changes and less discounting.So, some of the core trends that we saw driving it, and we talked it last investor day, and we saw it driving it this year. Those things will continue into fiscal '20.Thank you. And our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, here. Maybe just to shift gears to construction and start with you, Andrew. Realizing it's still early for PlanGrid, can you just talk about how you're thinking about pricing strategies here down the road? I know that we've talked about the benefits of the per-user model, but if I think about other packages like EBAs, which has been so successful as of late and think about potential with PlanGrid, I'm curious just how you're thinking about PlanGrid pricing strategy with what you've learned with some of the innovations with Autodesk pricing strategy down the road. -- Yeah, Saket. That's a really good question. I think you probably know that PlanGrid's current pricing strategy is basically packaged to have unlimited project access and limit the number of sheets being accessed. So, they have a nail gun, dozer, and crane kind of purchase level. We have named user models. We also have a project-based model and then we have the pay per use EBA model.One of the things that is important to recognize about the construction ecosystem is projects involve multiple people participating on trying to create an outcome. And generally speaking, what people want to do is get as many people into the project using the software as possible. And they want to do it in a predictable and economical way. So, you see lots of models being played within this space. One is the project-based Monday where people charge you as a percent of the project value and every project they add, they keep charging you more. We found that model to be very problematic as you get deeper and deeper into your customer's because the customers basically start to push back on this idea of paying more and more based on the number of projects you're putting into the ecosystem.Named user bundles are attractive because you can essentially pay charged discounted pricing for thousands of users at once. You'll probably see that showing up in the PlanGrid model moving forward. And you mentioned, lastly, the notion of pay per use pricing. So, imagine being able to sign up for a project and just pay for what you use as you go along through the project. You'll probably see us start to experiment with those things as we move out into the later years. At the very least, PlanGrid over a period of time will start integrating with our EBA model and our EBA customers will be able to do pay per use models.So, looking forward, start to imagine the PlanGrid models lining up with some of the models we already have and start seeing us looking at more of a pay per use type models as we move into bigger and bigger project ecosystems. -- Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe on that same topic for you, Scott. Can you just remind us how the billings work for PlanGrid and BuildingConnected? And similarly, how that could change over time just as those businesses become more integrated with Autodesk. -- Yeah. Additionally, with both PlanGrid and BuildingConnected, we're leaving the sales team intact so we can maintain the momentum in each of those businesses. So, they will flow, and they will be consolidated, obviously, with our total results, but they'll flow in through their own sales teams. And I expect to see for the full year I expect to see those billings come driving somewhere around the mid-single digits of our year on year billings growth. So, it's a notable amount of billings growth for the year.The one exception to that is we will have the PlanGrid sales also incorporated through our named accounting, the people that sell to our largest customers, sell the EBAs. They'll also be selling PlanGrid. So, a little bit of it coming from our own sales team, the remainder will continue to come through the sales teams that are there. And we are investing, by the way, to grow those sales teams post-acquisition.Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two just related to collections and then on the construction side. You guys have obviously seen a pretty steady mix shift over to collections skews. I'm just wondering if you could share a little bit with us what's driving those conversions? And specifically, are you doing anything to help incent that with maybe special promotions around collections? And is there any change in terms of the mix? I think you used to say you expected it to be 30% of the mix. Any update on that would be helpful.And then, I had a follow-up on the construction side, which obviously now you've got a more robust offering. I'm just wondering what you're seeing, if anything, different from a competitive standpoint. Thank you. -- All right, Heather, I'll start. I'll make a comment on the collections thing and I'll let Scott weigh in as well and then we can come back to the construction point.So, what's happening with collections is kind of what we expected. As customers are looking at their options, they're looking at upgrading from maintenance to subscription. They're looking at how they move their new seed into new types of mixes. They're just looking at the collections and saying, \"Hey, you know what? This is a better way for me to consolidate my offering. My typical user uses this application and this application. I'm just going to true-up on collections.\"We saw a similar phenomenon with Suites. We're just seeing it accelerated and at a somewhat larger scale with collections. And we expect that to continue as we move forward, which is a good thing. One, it simplifies our relationship with the customer. It increases the value of the account on an account by account basis. And it gets more of our technology on our user's desktops. So, it's all good news from our perspective. Scott, do you want to add something? -- Yeah. The only thing, Heather, to the question of what's driving that. Why is it going faster than Suites? We've talked in the past about a lot of work that was done to simplify from Suites. There were some different Suites, and each had three different versions, a good, better, best version. Down to three. I think that simplicity has made it not only easier to sell and more efficient for our sales team, our sales partners, but it's also been easier to buy on the buy side. So, I think that's the biggest driver behind it.There's always an occasional promo. There's nothing we've done explicitly to try to drive this much faster. I would say, at the point of conversions, as Andrew just talked about, when you convert to maintenance to product subscription, that is a very attractive price point at that point to go from individual products over to collections. That's why we're seeing that upgrade for then that 25%-30% of those eligible are actually taking advantage of it and going to a collection from a single product. -- You know, Heather, you actually hit on something. Back in the Suites days, we did lots of cross-selling promotions around Suites. We've done few if any around Collections, which is a really big difference between that program and what we're doing now. And I think it talks to the maturity of the model and its connection with subscriptions.Now, on your construction comments with regards to competitive dynamics, we've kind of surged into these acquisitions really pleased with what we're seeing. One way, we feel like we've consolidated a pretty broad and exceptional solution and it's right on track with some of our long-term strategic objectives. So, when we go and talk to customers right now, the conversation isn't really about competitors. It's about, OK, what's going to happen with the PlanGrid roadmap? What's going to happen with the BIM 360 roadmap? How are you going to get the Building Information model more entrenched into my profits?Our conversations with customers are excitement about what we're doing, not about what our competitors are doing, which is a really great conversation to have. And I just want to remind you of a couple of things so that you can kind of get a sense for what we're doing here. With regards to both PlanGrid and BuildingConnected, we acquired these companies and we did not change their run rate with regards to R&D. We didn't change the run rates at all. In fact, we've layered more R&D investment into PlanGrid and into BIM 360. So, what we're doing is we're accelerating the roadmaps of both of those products with much more targeting.So, PlanGrid is going to focus a lot more on-site execution and the things associated with site execution. BIM 360 is going to focus a lot more on project management and project flow. These are two incredibly sharp teams that are just going to kill it with what we've been able to do with the acceleration we're layering in. That's why you're seeing things like Construction IQ coming out right now, which we're really excited about because it's completely differentiated in the market. That's using data that only we have to aggregate it, layer machine learning on, and actually provide predictive outcomes of what could possibly happen in a construction project moving forward. Nobody else has that kind of stuff.So, you'll see a surge ahead of the competition not using any momentum at all. This is a big area for us and we're taking it really seriously and we're investing more.Thank you. And our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Andrew, for the six quarters since you've been highlighting your own internal digital infrastructure, is there some way for you to characterize or quantify or otherwise describe how that infrastructure, particularly in terms of transactional and license activation capabilities, has evolved? It's clear that your imputed license volume is already well above where it was before the model transition. You've got some pretty ambitious plans to multiply the size of the eStore. So, in terms of what's occurred and what still has to occur, could you talk about that infrastructure? And then I have a follow-up. -- Yeah, so, Jay, yeah. There is actually something really exciting I can comment on in regard to the infrastructure. It doesn't get a lot of news but what's happening now is that every new purchase of a single user license that happens out there in the market, whether it happens from a partner or directly to us, is going into a completely new backend and it is serial number free. So, all of our customers that buy these single-user licenses that used to manage a large spreadsheet for serial numbers? That is all gone. So, they are actually buying licenses that are completely identity based and that is a powerful lubricant to how our customers manage and use Autodesk software.Now, at the same time, the existing licenses they have that are sitting on the old model, serial number based, are being progressively migrated over to the new system. So, by the end of the year, every single single-user license is going to be sitting on this new system and serial numbers are gone from our single-user business. Now, if you know anything about how people manage our software, this is a non-value-added activity that sucks lots of time and dollars away from managing your relationship with Autodesk. That is getting removed. And that is a direct result of the investment we've made in the digital infrastructure.You're going to see similar moves as we look at how we do multi-user licensing in the future. That's something I'll save for another day. Now, the other thing that we're able to do and you're going to see coming out more and more is usage analysis. And it's not just for our EBA, but we're actually going to be projecting usage behavior back to our customers so they can see who is using what and to what degree the software is getting utilized. That will allow them to better control their relationship with Autodesk. It will also allow us to better understand what they're using and what we can recommend to them next.So, this year is a big year for lighting up infrastructure changes that we've been investing in over the last 18 months. And customers are going to see real benefits, Jay. These are not trivial changes in the way they manage their relationship with Autodesk. So, we're actually pretty excited about it. -- Okay. Thanks for that. The follow-up is, you know, we track pretty closely your headcount, your open reqs, and where you're investing, and sales, and R&D, and so forth. You have quite a number of very interesting sounding Senior Management positions that you're looking to fill. And maybe you could talk about the thinking behind some of those. For instance, a Head of Building Design Strategy, a Chief Data Architect, Head of Brand Strategy, Brand Activation, a Head of Self-service Transaction, multiple things that sound pretty interesting. Maybe just put that into context of where you're going this year and beyond. -- Yeah. So, look, we are dead serious about having every aspect of Autodesk be completely digital, end to end. From when the customers fist touch, to when they get the product, to when they use the product, and when we provide layer automation on top of those.We manage and deal with mountains of data from our customers. So, for instance, what you heard about the Chief Architect role there. That's all about making sure that the infrastructure we're building behind the scenes takes that data from cradle to grave so that it adds value to the customer at every single touch point. And does it in such a way that it's highly trusted, high integrity. The data is used in the service of the customer and not in the service of anyone else. So, those roles, what you're seeing is basically how we're translating the maturity of our investment into new types of automation activity. And we're just looking at, hey, we need this talent set. We need this talent set in order to layer on this automation.So, we're hiring to our roadmap is what we're doing. And you're going to see more of that. And frankly, we're getting really interesting people coming on board that are interested in some of these positions. So, very astute observation and yes, you are correct. That precedes pre-stages other types of automation and activity that are yet to come from us, which we believe are kind of game-changing in our industry.Thank you. And our next question comes from Gal Munda with Berenberg. Your line is now open. -- Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I just have, Scott, for you maybe on the cost side of the guidance for the next fiscal year. It's kind of high single-digit growth in terms of the cost base. Is that something we should be thinking more sustainable going forward considering the fact that we've had a few years kind of flattish cost base? Or is that something that's more of a one-off? -- Yeah, Gal, it's a great question. If you peel back the guidance was 9% of total spend growth for the year. And if you peel that back, it's about 2 points organic. So, maintaining kind of the cost discipline that we've had, but of course, you layer on what Andrew just talked about in not just the inorganic growth but also the investments we'll make in those businesses. That's another 7 points of spend growth overall. I think that's probably not a bad range to think as you look further than beyond fiscal '20 to '21-'23. High single-digits is probably not a bad range to think about spending going forward. It all depends on what opportunities are out there and what's going to drive the long-term top-line growth for the company. -- Thank you so much. And then, if I just kind of shift gears toward manufacturing a bit. Construction has been getting a lot of the highlight recently, but in terms of the manufacturing can you give us any color in the adoption of Fusion 360 when you look at some of the competitors and they are still growing pretty healthy in state. How is it that this growth maybe if you look throughout 2018 and call in the terms compared to what you see in maybe the years before? Because the product is kind of more mature now. It's had several iterations. How do you feel about it? -- So, Gal, let me tell you -- This is Andrew. Let me say just a couple things. One, nobody is growing at 29% in manufacturing segment right now. That kind of growth is on share taking. -- Besides us. -- Besides us. Right. Besides us. So, and by the way, the reason you're seeing that growth is we talk a lot about year over year compares that people were questioning for a while. Because we were retiring some manufacturing products. So, we were actually taking revenue out of the system as we retired and consolidated some products. Mostly consolidating some of those products into the Fusion stack and into the Fusion platform. So, now what you're seeing is the compares that actually show it was sitting underneath all of that. And you're seeing robust growth in our manufacturing segment.What you're also probably seeing if you're looking around in various forms, is that Fusion is really on fire. It's really, in terms of user growth, probably the fastest growing platform in the industry right now. And we're happy with where it is at right now. What you're seeing is this expiration of what we've integrated into the platform with generative design. People are poking into this and using it in ways that frankly we didn't really foresee. And I'll give you some examples.There's traditional hard line manufactures that using the generative capability inside of Fusion to kind of explore a series of design options that would traditionally kind of have been 3D printed natively. And now, what they're doing is saying, \"Wow. This is as better as I ever had, and they turned it into a weldment.\" So, they're actually using the capability inside of Fusion to explore design space they never explored before. And they're doing it with constraints in their manufacturing methods and other things and then turning it into solutions that they can use right with traditional methods they have. Really unique workflows, really unique things. Stay tuned.I think we've been very clear with you that construction was the first priority. We've established a strong construction portfolio. We're happy with what we've got there. In terms of major acquisitions, we're done. But as you look over the next 12-18 months, watch this space. You're going to see us start to make the kinds of organic and inorganic moves in the manufacturing space that just accelerate the position we already feel like we have.Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Excellent. Thanks so much and congrats on great results, guys. I've got one for Andrew and follow-up for Scott. So, firstly, something that came up in our conversations with partners this quarter was some confusion about the go-to-market strategy with PlanGrid. Can you just remind us of your strategy for integrating it into the broader construction portfolio? Whether we should expect PlanGrid to continue being sold stand alone or perhaps bundled with Build or ultimately integrating it with the BIM 360 platform longer term? -- Yeah. For the foreseeable future, you're going to see PlanGrid continue to be sold stand alone. We are rolling out a program where if a partner finds a deal, they get a commission on the deal. They get a finder's fee essentially for participating in the deal. But PlanGrid is going to continue to sell directly. We are also looking at ways to appropriately create offerings that combine capabilities from BIM 360 and PlanGrid where customers might be confused about which solution is best. Stay tuned. You'll see some of that.But for the most part, we're letting the solution run and continue on its own. Remember, PlanGrid reached into a part of the construction ecosystem that we weren't spending a lot of time on. Neither were our partners, frankly. Okay? So, we're actually deeper into the construction chain than we were before and we're letting them continue to go into that chain, renew their deals, and actually find new deals. And that will continue. But we're definitely going to make sure that a partner if they find something, we want them to tell us about it and we want to make sure they make some money off of it. -- Great. And just for Scott, Cloud subscriptions by my math grew about 35% organically. Can you maybe rank order the different drivers there? And I think organic Cloud ARPS was up only about 4% year on year. Was that in line with your expectations? And can you remind us of the levers that drive confidence in ARPS growth? Thanks. -- Sure. On the Cloud side, the biggest drivers organically of the Cloud subs continue to be BIM 360 as number one and driving the biggest chunk of that growth. Fusion 360 would be second. And then there is a handful of smaller products beyond that. Shotgun is in there. AutoCAD 360 is in there. But those two drive the majority of the Cloud subs.The ARPS growth is in line with our expectations for the BIM 360 product set. And you know with Fusion 360 we also made a price change on it recently. A quarter and a half ago we had a price change on Fusion 360. So, you'll begin to see that price increase start to flow its way through into the Cloud ARPS as well. So, I feel pretty good about where we are on the Cloud side and you can see the inorganic contribution with the slides we posted. You can see it. It was also a positive to the Cloud ARPS for the quarter.Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks. Hi, guys. I guess I missed it, but I'm going to ask the question anyway. What is PlanGrid and the other acquisition actually going to contribute in terms of this fiscal year's guidance? Because I didn't see it anywhere. -- Yeah, Sterling, we didn't spend a lot of time working that out. We set up a point of acquisition with PlanGrid that it would drive. We expected it to drive about $100 million in ARR this year. And that's consistent with what's built into the guidance that we gave. I broke out the spend. Between the two of them, they drove 7 points of spend growth year on year. So, you can do the math on what that looks like. That's probably about as much as we've done.The other thing is, you're doing your own calculations that I saw on some of the preview notes. People are trying to do the calculations. The other thing just to bear in mind is a swing in interest. The poured-on interest on the cash spent and the added interest expense for the $500 million short-term long agreement we picked up. So, all in all, just slight headwinds on EPS for fiscal '20. A slight headwind for us on free cash flow for fiscal '20, but we feel good about being able to contain it. -- All right. Excellent. And then just one quick follow-up, Scott. As we think about your cash flow guide, I think multi-year agreements were going to be decent contributor to that. What's been your experience minus when you put the multi-year back into place? What's your experience and what does it need to do to hit that $1.35? -- It is one of the contributors. There're several things, obviously, that drive the cash flow growth year on year. We posted $310 million free cash flow this year but remember that included about $130 million of one-time cash outflows tied to the restructuring that we announced a year ago and the exit tax in moving our European hub out of Neuchatel. So, the free cash stated actually reflects $130 million of one-time payments that won't repeat themselves in the fiscal '20.The remainder of the growth is the two things we talked about with net income. You can back into the net income increase year on year from the guidance points we gave you. But net income grows strongly driven by top-line growth. And then billings growth. And it will grow for all the reasons we've talked about. And ARPS, an element of it is multi-year, which is what you're touching on. We reintroduced the 10% discount for three-year paid upfront multi-year products subs. We hadn't previously offered any discount on that although we did still have some multi-year sales of it. There was no discount.We've reintroduced that in Q4. And if you noticed, I know it's a bit of an eye for you guys, but if you look at our balance sheet, you'll see our long-term deferred actually grew for the first time in seven quarters as we saw a pretty good uptick of people buying that three-year product subscription deal. So, we expect to see that continue to grow next year and get back into the range that it historically has been. And I think in terms of what long-term will represent our total deferred revenue, we think it gets back into that 20%-21% range that we talked about at Investor Day last year.Thank you. And our next question comes from Zane Chrane with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. Congrats on the great quarter, gentlemen. I was speaking with developers in one of the new skyscrapers in New York and they were telling me how adopting Revit recently, they're expecting that to generate a 3x return on the multi-million-dollar contract they signed with you guys. That wasn't so much surprising so much as the fact that it sounded like a fairly recent decision.It made me wonder, how penetrated do you think your customer base is in terms of Revit adoption for those customers that may potentially use it or could benefit from it? -- I think, Zane, you're actually hitting on something that's important to discuss. People think that Revit is already fully mature and has penetrated the market. It's actually still very much the early kind of majority type market for Revit adoption. We are actually seeing massive growth in Revit usage, Revit adoption. That's why I highlighted the increasing visibility of Revit skills as one of the skills that are important moving forward into the years. Revit has got a long way to go in terms of growth and it really is the new engine of how architecture and building design is going to be done. And it has not even begun its journey very much into the infrastructure space. So, look for Revit to keep going, and going, and going. And watch how the skills referenced on Revit climbs up that list from where it is today well into the top 10. That's just to be expected. Especially in Europe where Revit adoption is taking off from the very early, early stages. It was much more mature in the US. -- That's helpful. And as far with the adoption, do you think that will be driven more by the adoption of Collections or do you see a lot of Enterprise customers buying it stand alone? -- You know, Enterprise customers almost all buy it through EBAs. So, they get access through the EBAs. It doesn't hurt that the Collections have Revit inside so the users can immediately start moving projects to Revit. But frankly, the big driving force for Revit has little to do with how we package our software. There are a couple of things that are driving it. One, the return you heard from those customers in New York, you basically see a fairly significant return. Owners, in particular, see a significant return and are more and more starting to mandate BIM for particular projects. Governments are doing it. Owners of the developers are doing it. People are just starting to expect BIM to be part of the process because they are seeing the ROI.That is more of a secular driver in terms of where things are going, this kind of digitization of the whole design through the construction process, than how we package our software or sell it.Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hi. This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. Thanks for taking my question. Just one from me. In our survey work this quarter, we had a reseller bring up a large deal that came from previously pirated software. I know before at one point you had mentioned 4 million pirates in mature markets. Can you just remind us what this opportunity is, kind of how you go about identifying and pursuing it? -- Just to put it all in scale. We have 18 million users of our products worldwide. There are 4 million subscribers. All right? So, you can kind of see it as big delta between users and subscribers right now. Now, the way we look at this, especially in mature markets, is we look at people who are using the software and maybe have a few illegal copies or a few illegal serial numbers inside their environment and we go, and we have conversations with them. For the most part, when you hear about big deals like that, that was somebody that was probably really stressing the limits of what was legal with regards to our software.Long-term, what you're going to see with this whole entire process, and like I said, I've said this over and over again on calls. There is no big surge that's going to happen at any one point. And as a matter of fact, if we tried to create a big surge, I actually think what we'd do is create a big backlash. What you're going to see is a gradual kind of continuing add and penetration of that 18 million user base as we add more capability of the product to help us understand who is using licenses validly, who isn't. And also, as users start to realize that it's better to be part of the legal ecosystem than it is to be part of the invalid ecosystem.So, just continue to see that momentum over time. Don't expect big spikes. Deals like what you just described are not the norm. All right? So, I want to make sure that we're clear on that. But especially as we move into fiscal '21 and '22, we're getting further and further down from our last perpetual release and we move more and more to pure named user licensing as a company, you're just going to see more and more of these people coming into the paid ecosystem. -- And Matt, you know we have our investor day at the end of March, actually, a month from today, March 28th here in San Francisco. This is obviously one of the topics that we'll update everyone on and give you a sense of not just the numbers but more importantly, the things we're doing, the changes we're making in both processing and the product you buy for chasing that opportunity. -- All right. Thanks for the time, guys. -- Thank you, Matt.Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Hi, this is Hamza Fodderwala in for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question asked about the integration between PlanGrid and the core BIM 360 product. What's the timeline for that and is there any risk of customers perhaps being more cautious on purchasing BIM in advance of that integration? There have been a lot of changes in that product in recent years, mostly positive. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any of that. -- One of the areas we're paying attention to, Keith -- It was Keith, right? -- No, it was actually Tom. -- Tom for Keith. Okay. One of the areas we've been paying attention to, Tom, is moving very quickly on making it clear where the focus areas of those two products are. We've already kind of internally established that. PlanGrid is absolutely focused on site execution and all the things that make site execution just awesome. And they are incredibly talented, as Tracy likes to say, beautiful, simple software that helps people be more productive. And we're doubling down on that for them. So, all of the additional R&D investment we put in there is all going to accelerate their site execution roadmap. And customers are going to start to see that very quickly and start to understand, \"Okay. So, the site execution stuff that I saw in BIM 360 I'm going to see more of it in PlanGrid and I'm going to see these things kind of expand out.\"What we've done on the BIM 360 side is we've been very focused with that team aligning them around project management and project management capabilities. And there have been gaps that our customers have been asking for quite a while around project management and project flow capabilities and they're going to see an acceleration of those capabilities inside of BIM 360. So, we moved very, very quickly based on our own analysis pre-acquisition and some of our post-acquisition moves to be very clear with the organization where they should run and how fast they should run in those areas. Customers will start to see that and we're already starting to communicate some of this to our customers and I think they're starting to understand it as being not only the right thing to do but intuitively makes sense. -- All right. That's helpful. And a follow-up question, perhaps for you, Scott. It looks like ARR growth is pretty strong sustained in the low 30%, but the subs were a bit below that of the original guidance at least on an organic basis. Is that just the continued migration to Collections or is there any other factors behind that? -- No, no. It is. You know, as we've said in the past, we've focused much more on driving top-line growth and driving ARR than we have on driving the individual components of that. I feel really good about the continued strength in Collections, not just at the point of migration from maintenance over to product subs, which has continued to stay strong, but also in new sales. We see industry Collections at this point at 28% of our total product subscription install base. It's run faster than we expected to get to that point.Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for the percentage of your existing customer base that you're targeting for construction-related sales in fiscal '20? And then what if any level of cross-selling success you're factoring into the fiscal '20 guidance? -- Well, Ken, one thing I say is anybody who works in the AEC space is a target for our construction portfolio. When you look at our strategy, our strategy is to connect the end to end flow from the early design process all the way through down to site execution, and essentially get the building information model and the date that's attached to it moving through that entire process. So, basically, our entire AEC ecosystem is a target for some part of the construction staff, be it BIM 360 design all the way through to PlanGrid and all the way through to BuildingConnected on the bidding side. So, we see a fairly open field with regards to who we're targeting.Now, what was the second part of your question? I just wanted - -- What you're factoring into the fiscal '20 guidance. -- Yeah. So, Scott, why don't you take that? -- Yeah, Ken, what we talked about is we expect ARR to be in that net $100 million range and that is what is factored into the guidance for fiscal '20. I think what I'd add though to the first part of your question of who we are targeting... You know one of the things that we were excited about when we got PlanGrid was not just the technology which is beautiful, simple, easy to use, which is what is required in that site execution space. They also have a strong base in a part of the ecosystem, the construction ecosystem, that we didn't have a lot of touch point to, the subcontractors and the trades. So, it's not just selling to our existing customer set in construction, which we obviously will continue to do.We also got a nice reach ahead with PlanGrid into a part of the construction ecosystem we didn't previously touch. And BuildingConnected, by the way, brings that same thing. If you look at what BuildingConnected does, it connects general contractors to trades and to subcontractors and to the people below them. So, it's actually a nice expansion of the people that we can target with our construction solutions. -- Great. And if I can follow-up quickly. Can you give a sense of how to think about the adoption rate of construction software in the event that we see an economic slowdown? Are you having the kind of high-level conversations that suggest that this is a top priority regardless of economic backdrop? -- Yeah. So, excellent point, Ken. So, look, what I'll do is I'll tell you about what happened at the last downturn. And I'll tell you about the sense of urgency the construction customers have around digitization. So, in the last downturn, construction IT spend continued to increase even though that downturn hit construction incredibly hard. And the reason for that is very simple. The most digital vendor, or the most digital contractor, won because they were able to more accurately predict what their total cost were going to do. They were able to get their bids in tighter. They were able to basically manage their costs better. So, digitization wins.The whole ecosystem in construction understands this right now. It's imperative across almost all of our customers at this point. They're all looking to figure out how they can digitize their workflows, how they can extract more efficiency, how they can get more accuracy, reduce project risk, manage the timeline, reduce safety risks. That continues to be a highly visible aspect of this. So, we anticipate that even in a downturn, construction IT spend is going to go up and we're super excited about things like what we're doing with Construction IQ where we're actually using some of the data that we collect from our customers to provide predictive outcomes, which is going to become more and more valuable.So, digitization wins. All of our customers know that, and we anticipate the spend to continue even through a downturn.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session for today's call. I would not like to turn the call back over to Abhey Lamba for any further remarks. -- Thanks, Operator. And thanks everyone for joining us today.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This design software company is expected to pos  of $0.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +566.7%.Revenues are expected to be $707.09 million, up 27.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Autodesk, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Autodesk will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Autodesk would pos  of $0.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of +11.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Autodesk doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Shares ended trading on Monday at $25.51 a share, giving it a market capitalization of roughly $6 billion.Zayo also had about $6 billion in debt. If the private equity firms succeed in acquiring Zayo, it would represent one of the largest leveraged buyouts of the year.Sachem Head has not threatened to launch a proxy fight but that option remains on the table, the people said. The hedge fund, which is run by Scott Ferguson, a former partner at William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, owns a 2 percent stake in the company, making it the 12th largest shareholder, according to Refinitiv data.Sachem Head had success at pushing for changes at companies such as Autodesk Inc and Whitbread Plc in the past.Zayo had announced last November it would break itself up into two companies, but said last week it no longer believed it was in the company's best interest to pursue a public spinoff as part of its strategic review.Zayo, based in Boulder, Colorado, operates a fiber network in the United States and Europe that helps connects data centers and also serves wireless and landline phone companies.It generated revenue of $639.1 million last quarter, which missed Refinitiv estimates of $642 million.

(Symbol: ADSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $159.00, changing hands for $159.54/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 18 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Autodesk Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $76.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $200.00.

In the las  ed quarter, the company's earnings of 29 cents per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents per share.Revenues of $660.9 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $642 million and also increased 28.3% year over year.For the fourth quarter, Autodesk expects revenues between $700 million and $710 million. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the range of 40-44 cents per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at 42 cents per share, indicating year-over-year increase of 566.7%. Further, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $707.1 million, up roughly 27.7% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Autodesk's business model transition from perpetual licenses to cloud-based subscription is expected to boost revenues in the near term.The company witnessed robust growth in total annualized revenue per subscription (ARPS) and annual recurring revenue (ARR) in the last reported quarter. ARR, which was up 33% year over year, validates the success of the company's business model transition and the overall health of the company..Subscription plan ARR increased substantially driven by growth in product subscription coupled with robust performance of enterprise business agreement (EBA). Moreover, cloud ARR grew more than 36% year over year in the last reported quarter. The biggest contributor to cloud ARR was BIM 360 family of products, with the company adding 53,000 subs in the BIM 360 space in the previous quarter.The company is benefiting from growing traction in BIM 360 products. Autodesk stated that customers are deploying all modules of the BIM 360 platform. The construction management solution has been adopted by large clients like AECOM, Arcadis, Swinerton and Layton. The continued momentum is expected to boost the top line in the to-be reported quarter.Autodesk acquired PlanGrid in the quarter under review, which solidifies its construction portfolio. Notably, the integration of PlanGrid software with BIM 360 will enable seamless exchange of 2D and 3D project information. The enhanced feature is expected to help Autodesk win more clients in the long haul.In the previous quarter, Autodesk's e-store accounted for a significant portion of the company's digital sales and generated 20% of the product subscriptions. Management stated that e-store grew 65% year over year and captured a significant portion of the company's AutoCAD business. Additionally, Autodesk's direct and indirect business channels are growing at the same pace, which is a positive.Nevertheless, the ongoing business model transition is expected to negatively impact the company's revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Sluggish Maintenance revenues (22.7% of total revenues in the third-quarter) due to continued migration of maintenance plan subscriptions to subscription plan is a headwindMoreover, rising expenses on the back of increased hiring and acquisitions are expected to hurt the company's profitability in the to-be reported quarter.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

PlanGrid adds cloud-based, document-centric workflows to Autodesk's construction design solutions, which center on its BIM 360 computer model-centric workflows. BuildingConnected gives Autodesk entry into the bid phase of construction via its network of more than 700,000 construction professionals. Essentially, the software helps real estate owners and contractors manage the bid process in the preconstruction phase.Image source: Getty Images.Construction belongs to one of Autodesk's four major product families, which it terms \"industry collections.\" These collections are Architecture, Engineering, and Construction; Manufacturing; AutoCAD (computer-aided design) and AutoCAD LT; and Media and Entertainment. Of these, Architecture, Engineering ,and Construction products account for the lion's share of total company revenue -- roughly 42% in fiscal 2018.CEO Andrew Anagnost believes the construction industry is a logical area to achieve the company's ambition to become a \"design and make\" company. Focus within this discipline also fits within a larger strategic initiative undertaken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, a reorganization Autodesk will complete by the end of the current fiscal year.The reorganization plan calls for completion of Autodesk's business model transition from term licenses to subscription-based revenue streams, the digitization of company processes, and the \"re-imagining [of] manufacturing, construction, and production.\" The plan also specifically anticipates increased spending in digital infrastructure, customer service, and the construction portfolio over the next few years.Industry growth statistics appear to explain some of Autodesk's enthusiasm for the construction market. In its 2018 investor day presentation, the company highlighted estimates indicating that the global construction industry will need to add another 200 million jobs by 2030 to keep up with new demand.In addition, the company projects that its total addressable market in design- and construction-related software opportunities will reach $22 billion by 2020. Based on the rapid uptake of its construction flagship BIM 360 software, Autodesk envisions several years in which it can increase share within an expanding construction products market:Image source: Autodesk March 2018 investor presentation.Autodesk's use of bolt-on acquisitions to supplement core Autodesk construction technologies like BIM 360 (as well as the AutoCAD and Revit software offerings) can be seen as a tactic within the overall reorganization strategy. By presenting its construction platform as, if not a \"one-stop-shop,\" an indispensable suite of products for middle-market and larger construction contractors, Autodesk enhances its recurring revenue potential and validates its business model transition.The company's most recent earnings report, which covers the fiscal third quarter of 2019, exhibits the strength of the revenue transition (which began in earnest roughly four years ago). In this  , Autodesk achieved record year-over-year growth in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of 33% during the quarter. Annualized revenue per subscription, or ARPS, also hit a record.As Autodesk continues to convert maintenance plan subscribers over to product subscriptions, the improvements in ARR and ARPS are translating into diminished losses on the company's income statement. Autodesk's fiscal-year-to-date net loss of $145.5 million represents a 63% improvement over the $393.4 million loss during the same three quarters in fiscal 2018.The organization is intent on pursuing higher subscription revenue (which currently represents 68% of total revenue), especially within its construction concentration. In the company's most recent  in late November, CEO Anagnost noted that Autodesk has historically considered itself an acquisitive company and that the last two years of relative quiet on the M&A front represent an anomaly.Anagnost advised investors to expect a return to frequent merger transactions, primarily in construction. The company followed these comments up with news of the BuildingConnected purchase in December, and investors can expect that more deals will bulk up Autodesk's construction product line in the quarters ahead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Autodesk's customers can use the tools to save time and money.Moreover, BuildingConnected's network of more than 700,000 construction professionals' helps general contractors to find and hire qualified contractors for their projects. Further, the company offers TradeTapp, a subcontractor risk analysis platform, and Bid Board Pro, a platform that helps subcontractors manage and win more bids.The addition of these solutions expands and strengthens Autodesk's construction portfolio. The company's focus on connecting construction processes across designs, buildings and operations is a major long-term growth driver.BuildingConnected will be integrated into Autodesk's construction solutions team that includes Autodesk BIM 360, Revit, AutoCAD, PlanGrid and Assemble Systems. The deal will help Autodesk further penetrate the construction market, which is currently worth $10 billion.BuildingConnected is expected to have no material impact on fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. For fiscal 2020, Autodesk expects immaterial contribution from BuildingConnected toward annualized recurring revenues (ARR). However, it is expected to be slightly dilutive to profitability and cash flow.Notably, in the last reported quarter (third-quarter fiscal 2019), total ARR jumped 33% from the year-ago quarter to $2.53 billion. Cloud business ARR increased 36%, driven by robust BIM 360 sales that added 53,000 subscribers. Moreover, subscription plan ARR surged 108% year over year to $1.93 billion, driven by growth in enterprise business agreement (EBA). | For fiscal 2019, Autodesk maintained its earlier guidance for subscription additions of 500-550K. Total ARR growth is still expected to be 30-31%.Acquisitions like BuildingConnected,  and Assemble Systems expand Autodesk's portfolio. The company is also benefiting from rapid adoption of the BIM 360 product that is rapidly replacing legacy document management tools and preconstruction planning software. In fact, Autodesk expects BIM 360 to encompass the entire construction process from start to finish over the next five years.Moreover, Autodesk is benefiting from solid growth in product subscriptions and the surging maintenance-to-subscription program.

The company has always generated substantial revenues from its cards because of the significantly higher functionality.In its last reported quarter, revenues at the GPU business grew 25% year over year to $2.77 billion on the back of strong Datacenter, Professional Visualization and Automotive segments. | Moreover, growth in the company's AI business, backed by the Turing T4 Cloud GPU launch during the last reported quarter, was a feather in the cap.Notably, NVIDIA's other Turing-architecture based GPUs - the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 - have received a positive response from a wide range of customers, including the major movie studios and game developers.Furthermore, the NVIDIA RTX Server, an integral part of the architecture of the Titan RTX GPU, designed for photo-real rendering in the datacenter opens a new market for GPUs. Notably, it has been adopted by key developers like Adobe  , ANSYS  , Autodesk  and Dassault, among others.Management is optimistic about expanding its addressable market with Turing and the recently unveiled software offerings. Growth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, rendering, high-performance computing, AI and self-driving cars are expected to be the company's consistent tailwinds.We note that weakness in the Gaming segment, due to an excess inventory of midrange Pascal products, is an overhang on the company.

Shares have lost about 5.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Autodesk due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Autodesk reported non-GAAP earnings of 29 cents per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 against a loss of 12 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Revenues of $660.9 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $642 million and also increased 28.3% year over year. The figure was better than management's guided range of $635-$645 million.Notably, billings of $654 million surged 30% year over year.Moreover, total deferred revenues increased 17% to $2.24 billion, with short-term deferred revenues up 14% due to strong billing in the reported quarter. Total recurring revenues were 96% of its total revenues, reflecting a significant increase from 92% reported in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk's business model transition continues to be on track. Subscription revenues (72.8% of its total revenues) soared 108.3% year over year to $481.3 million, driven by strong growth in subscription plan revenues and well supported by higher product subscriptions.However, maintenance revenues (22.7% of its total revenues) declined 38.6% from the year-ago quarter to $150.1 million, primarily due to continued migration of maintenance plan subscriptions to subscription plan.Revenues were also impacted by a 25.9% year-over-year decline in other revenues (4.5% of its total revenues), which totaled $29.5 million in the quarter.Geographically, revenues from Americas increased 25% from the year-ago quarter to $269 million. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) revenues jumped 30% to $267 million. Revenues from Asia-Pacific soared 32% to $126 million.Autodesk acquired PlanGrid in the reported quarter, in a bid to expand its presence in the construction space. The deal is financed with cash on hand and a short-term pre-payable loan of $875 million.For a smooth exchange of 2D and 3D project information, the company aims to integrate workflows between PlanGrid software and BIM 360 construction management platform in the near term.Total annualized recurring revenues (ARR) were $2.53 billion, up 33% from the year-ago quarter, driven by both product and cloud offerings. Core business ARR [combination of maintenance, product, and enterprise business agreement (EBA)] subscriptions were up 33% year over year.Cloud business ARR increased 36%, which was mostly from BIM 360. Autodesk added 53,000 subscribers in the BIM 360 product line.Subscription plan ARR of $1.93 billion increased 108% year over year, driven by growth in all subscription plan types, primarily supported by product subscription, with a meaningful increase in enterprise business agreement (EBA).However, maintenance plan ARR of $601 million declined 39% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the ongoing migration of maintenance plan subscriptions to product subscriptions through the M2S program.Subscription plan subscriptions increased 252K sequentially to 3.12 million in the third quarter. Subscription plan subscriptions benefited from new product subscription and 71K maintenance subscribers that converted to product subscription under the M2S program. Total subscriptions increased 143K sequentially to 4.08 million.Autodesk is also benefiting from its investment in digital infrastructure. The company's e-store generated nearly 20% of products subscription revenues and grew 65% in the reported quarter.Notably, growth in total ARR and annualized revenues per subscription (ARPS) was the highest in the reported quarter, since the beginning of the business model transition.Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 390 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 90.3%.Research & development as well as sales & marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined 910 bps and 670 bps, respectively. Whereas, general & administrative expenses increased 60 bps in the quarter.As a result, non-GAAP operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined to 76.4% from 91.6% reported in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk reported non-GAAP operating income of $92.2 million in the quarter against the year-ago quarter's operating loss of $26.2 million.As of Oct 31, 2018, Autodesk had cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $1.08 billion compared with $1.29 billion on Jul 31, 2018Total long-term debt at the end of the third quarter remained flat sequentially at $1.59 billion.The company generated $39 million of cash flow from operating activities compared with $43 million of cash outflow in the fiscal second quarter.On a year-to-date basis, Autodesk repurchased 2.1 million shares for $270 million.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2019, Autodesk expects revenues between $700 million and $710 million. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the range of 40-44 cents per share. Additionally, the company expects cash flow to accelerate in the fourth quarter.Moreover, the company expects to see continued sequential increases in ARR, ARPS, billings, revenues, spend and earnings.For fiscal 2019, management now expects revenues between $2.53 billion and $2.54 billion, reflecting growth of 23-24%. Billings are projected in the range of $2.61-$2.64 billion, reflecting growth of 17-19%Autodesk maintained its earlier guidance for subscription additions in the range of 500-550K. Total ARR is still expected in the range of 30-31%.Non-GAAP spend growth (cost of revenues plus operating expenses) is expected to increase 3%. Moreover, non-GAAP earnings are now expected in the range of 95-99 cents per share.Additionally, the company now expects operating margin for the year to be higher by one percentage point compared with the previous guidance.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted 10.85% due to these changes.Currently, Autodesk has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

Subscriber growth is an essential metric for Autodesk investors to keep track of, because sales from this business account for nearly three-quarters of the company's total revenue.Additionally, investors may have been pleased to see Autodesk's purchase of PlanGrid for $875 million, which will allow the company to expand its construction productivity software services.Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost said on the  that the purchase \"expands our expertise, presence, scale and reach in the construction space\" and that PlanGrid already has 120,000 paid users.

But in attracting these candidates, many companies struggle to achieve a gender balance -- an imperative today given that diverse, inclusive workplaces generate  and  .There are many hurdles in the way of recruiting and retaining women in technical positions, not the least of which is that women make up only 18% of computer science grads, and the proportion of women in STEM drops the higher they go in seniority. But despite the odds, there are still certain companies that have managed to rise above these challenges.Image source: Getty Images.In Glassdoor's recent eBook,  , we spoke with three top employers --  (NYSE: NOK) ,  (NYSE: MMM) and  (NASDAQ: ADSK) -- to learn how they're recruiting and interviewing diverse candidates, and, ultimately, how they're creating better workplaces for women. Here were some of their best tips for attracting women in STEM and creating an inclusive environment in which they'll want to grow for years to come.If you only focus on diverse hiring for a short period of time, you can't expect to see results immediately. The lack of women in STEM fields is a complex, multifaceted issue that requires persistent, long-term action in order to see results. Knowing this, the leadership team at telecommunications company Nokia has created a multiyear plan with publicly stated goals in order to demonstrate its commitment to diversity and hold itself accountable to its stated objectives.\"Nokia is executing on a five-year strategy on gender balance, empowered by our leaders' conviction and actions,\" said Mohamed Habib, global competence head at Nokia. \"Awareness is a first major step. We have been taking it very seriously, training our leaders, managers, and employees on gender balance best practices.\"True to their word, the company has trained 4,200 leaders and employees since 2016 on gender balance, and publishes key metrics along with targets, performance, and achievements -- one of its goals is to increase the proportion of women in leadership by 25% by 2020.To prove its dedication to the cause, Nokia has gone above and beyond to not only create change within its company, but also chip away at the root causes of gender inequality in STEM. Last year, Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri signed a letter of cooperation with UNESCO committing Nokia to promote gender equality, women's empowerment, and women's leadership. In 2018, they are continuing to work with Greenlight For Girls to inspire girls and young women in science and technology.Companies have a hard enough time attracting women in STEM fields to their open positions -- the hiring and interview processes shouldn't pose an additional hurdle. Too often, though, they do. Implicit bias is often embedded in job descriptions, interview questions, interviewer attitudes, and more. This is something that design software company Autodesk is deeply aware of.In order to more fully leverage the  , Autodesk actively considers how to minimize bias, \"from the way we write job descriptions to how we interview candidates,\" said Danny Guillory, head of global diversity and inclusion at Autodesk.One way you may want to consider reducing bias in job descriptions is by leveraging a service like Textio , which identifies biased language and allows you to correct it. You would also do well to separate required skills from \"nice to have\" skills -- research show s that women are unlikely to apply for a position unless they meet 100 percent of the requirements, while men will apply if they meet just 60 percent of the requirements. A/B testing job descriptions on Glassdoor is also an effective way to identify unbiased verbiage.It's also worth becoming familiar with some of the most common forms of bias in interviews so that you can combat it. Consider taking steps like:Diversity without  is a recipe for failure. If you're unable to maintain an inclusive environment, you'll encounter problems with diversity at every stage of the recruiting funnel. Women seeking STEM roles will be less attracted to your company in the research process, while female STEM candidates will be less likely to accept an offer from you following the interview process. Even if they do accept a job offer, women in STEM who don't feel supported will be less likely to stay at the company long-term after they've been hired.Because of this, manufacturing company 3M makes inclusion a top priority. The company offers employee resource networks such as the Women's Leadership Forum, which \"strengthen leadership skills and enhance collaboration across cultures, lifestyles, and genders,\" said Ann Anaya, chief diversity officer at 3M. It has also been recognized with accolades like the Catalyst Award, which honored efforts like 3M's \"I'm in\" inclusion initiative, employee resource networks, leadership development platforms, workplace flexibility policies, and mentoring and community engagement programs. Benefits and programs such as these all contribute to women's long-term engagement with their jobs, which can not only boost retention, but also your reputation for being an excellent employer for women in STEM.Hiring women in STEM is certainly not without its challenges, but as the three examples above show, employers are far from helpless when it comes to recruiting and retaining phenomenal women in technical roles. It may take time, but making a public commitment to champion equality, identifying and reducing sources of bias in the hiring processes, and creating programs and policies that support women can go a long way toward helping you become a more diverse and innovative place to work.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

(It was up 9.7% on Wednesday alone.)Anagnost did not make changes blindly: Before becoming Autodesk CEO in June 2017, the former rocket scientist worked in product and marketing for 20 years at the 36-year-old company, based in San Francisco.Anagnost and Chief Financial Officer  wanted to flip Autodesk's reliance on software licenses, which accounted for 60% of its total revenue as recently as 2013, to a subscription model, while at the same time implementing a cloud-computing platform to make it easier for contractors, architects, and engineers to collaborate on building projects. Today, 96% of Autodesk's revenue is via product subscriptions.The story is eerily similar at Herren's previous employer, Citrix.Another long-time employee took over the reins as CEO about a year ago, and devised a plan to transform the virtual-private-network company to a hybrid-cloud solution one while also shifting to a subscription model.CEO , a 15-year company veteran who previously was chief financial officer and chief operating officer, told  that Citrix is \"well ahead\" of its plan to double revenue by 2020.The 29-year-old company's third-quarter  marked its fifth consecutive quarter of beating Wall Street expectations. Citrix recorded earnings of $1.40 per share and revenue of $732.5 million. Subscription-based revenue jumped 37%, year-over-year, to $112 million, and now accounts for 15% of total revenue, versus 10% a year ago.The results pushed shares of the company up 2% the day after it announced results. In the past 12 months, Citrix has gained more than $2.5 billion in market value, to its current $14.4 billion. Shares closed up 0.7% on Wednesday, to $106.89.The secret to its success? \"We want to help customers face the future of a mobile work force,\" Henshall told  noting a recent  that predicts a shortage of 90 million to 95 million medium-to-high-skilled workers globally by 2020. \"Companies want to embrace the cloud, but it takes a while to manage the past while embracing the future.\" Jon Swartz at The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise nearly 10% on the day.

I have two exciting things to share with you today. First, we closed another fantastic quarter with strong performance across all key metrics. Second, we are expanding our capabilities in the construction space by acquiring PlanGrid to complement our construction portfolio as well as to enhance our reach within the industry.Looking first at our Q3 performance, we built upon the strength of our Q2 results by posting accelerated growth driven by strength across all product families in major geographies. We generated 33% growth in total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, with both product and cloud offerings delivering great performance.There are several key areas that I want to highlight on the call today. We have record growth in total ARR and total ARPS. In fact, this is the highest growth quarter for both, since we started our business model transition over four years ago. We experienced strong growth in our enterprise business during the quarter, which speaks to the strategic importance of our products and a healthy demand environment. We hit a milestone of 4 million total subscriptions. The Maintenance to Subscription program continues to perform well and we're seeing an increase in the adoption of collections.BIM 360 delivered broad based strength driving cloud ARR growth in the quarter, and we are enhancing our construction offering with the acquisition of PlanGrid. First, let's look at ARR, which is the best proxy for measuring progress in our business model transition and the overall health of our business. The strength in ARR was a result of accelerating growth in all geographic regions and across all product families. All geographic regions posted revenue growth of at least 25%. Subscription plan ARR has more than doubled on a year-over-year basis for seven out of the last eight quarters.Growth in ARR was driven by strength across all subscription plan types, and once again product subscription led the group while EBAs also accelerated meaningfully. ARR for our core business, which represents the combination of maintenance, product subscription and our EBA sales also grew at 33% in line with total ARR as our core business drives the overwhelming majority of our revenue, ARR and billings growth. Now as you know, I've made construction one of the Company's critical near-term priorities, and that's why I'm incredibly excited to talk about the acquisition of PlanGrid, which expands our expertise, presence, scale and reach in the construction space.You have heard me say many times that the construction industry is a key focus area for us in becoming a design and make company. It's hungry to deploy more technology and we're ready with compelling solutions. At PlanGrid, Tracy Young, Ralph Gootee, and the rest of the management team have built a leading construction tech company and we look forward to welcoming them to the Autodesk family.PlanGrid has built an innovative mobile SaaS solution that's focused on document-centric workflows for field execution and project management. This is an excellent complement to our focus on model-centric workflows through Revit and BIM 360. On the field side of construction management, PlanGrid enables those working on the site to make informed decisions with real-time information. PlanGrid's solutions also empower project managers to ensure jobs are delivered within scope and on budget. The company currently serves approximately 12,000 customers and has approximately 120,000 paid users. Its products have been used on over one million construction projects. PlanGrid's quality and value are reflected by the many large customers it serves, like LPR Construction, Devcon, Granite, Nvidia, and Target and we intend to capitalize on its strength to further advance the state of the art in construction technology and better meet the needs of our customers. The combination creates a more comprehensive cloud-based construction platform for general contractors and will expand our relationships with subcontractors and building owners. Over time, we will integrate workflows between PlanGrid's software and our BIM 360 construction management platform for a seamless exchange of 2D and 3D project information.Additionally, we will be able to leverage our global reach to accelerate adoption of PlanGrid's solutions. There are many GCs who have deployed both solutions. For example, DPR Construction is a commercial GC using Autodesk BIM 360 and PlanGrid software. Atul Khanzode, DPR's CTO, said, and I quote, one of the biggest challenges in the construction industry is data flow, how you get the most current and accurate information to the right people, at the right time. We're excited about this acquisition because it will improve the way information can be shared on project, and that leads to greater productivity and predictability. Using BIM 360 has made our project planning better. We're able to reliably plan, forecast and measure project tasks that support lean construction practices and reduce waste. And, we're using PlanGrid to help everyone in the field build off the most current data set, end quote. We're tremendously excited about joining forces with PlanGrid and I believe this will further position us for success as we move further into the $10 billion construction opportunity. Scott will cover financial details of the transaction in a few minutes, but I would like to turn our attention back to Q3 performance.Particularly, I'd like to highlight the performance of our BIM 360 portfolio. We had a strong showing for the entire offering which helped us post 36% growth in cloud ARR in the quarter. Customers are deploying all modules of the BIM 360 platform, and I am excited to share that large customers like AECOM, Arcadis, Swinerton, and Layton have already started adopting our new platform and we look forward to more customers doing the same.A great example of the convergence of design and make was a significantly expanded deal we signed with Daiwa House Industries, one of the largest construction companies in Japan. They sell pre-fabricated homes in the region and are working to expand globally. Their processes are a clear example of how manufacturing and construction are converging. They utilize a wide range of our product portfolio from AutoCAD and Revit to BIM 360 and Inventor. Our new EBA with them is one of the largest we have signed and it increases the account value by 16-fold. We now have three of the largest five general contractors in Japan on EBAs and we are not done. These transactions also highlight the progress we have made in Japan as a region where we saw broad-based strength across all customer types.On the manufacturing side, our growth rate for the product family accelerated to 20% from 10% in the second quarter. During the quarter, we transitioned a major customer, Ford, to an EBA. It is yet another example of how our relationship has expanded with our large enterprise customers where we've evolved from a vendor to a collaborative thought leader. We are partnering with Ford to help them explore new workflows utilizing our most advanced software functionality such as generative design and Fusion, and our flexible token-based EBA, which will allow them to benefit from the breadth of our product portfolio. We expect a 4x increase in subscriptions as a result of our new EBA contract.In summary, I am extremely pleased with the progress we've made with the transition and I believe we're positioning the Company to expand our technology leadership in the construction space. Many of you attended Autodesk University last week and I think you could feel the buzz and excitement in the air around both our core offerings and our cloud technologies like BIM 360 and Fusion. We are making terrific progress while remaining committed to our FY20 goals. In particular, I am also excited to see that we crossed the 30% mark for the sum of revenue growth and free cash flow margin. We look forward to nearly doubling that number in the next few years.Now I'll turn it over to Scott for more details on the financials. -- Thanks Andrew. Digging deeper into the numbers for the third quarter, I'll start with a few more details on our strong ARR performance. ARR benefited from a 17% increase in ARPS, a 14% increase in subscriptions, and a 30% growth in billings for the quarter.Looking at subscriptions, we added 143,000 subs in the quarter and hit a milestone in total subscriptions as we crossed the 4 million mark, which is nearly twice the number of maintenance seats we had at the peak of the previous business model. Subscription plan subs grew by 252,000, led by product subscriptions. Core sub adds once again increased by 3% sequentially. We also added 53,000 cloud subs, which is a nice step-up from the 31,000 we added in Q2 and 18,000 in Q1. Strength in cloud was led by broad-based adoption of the BIM 360 family.Moving to the Maintenance to Subscription program, we continue to make solid progress. In Q3,customers migrated 71,000 maintenance subs to product subscriptions. While the number of M2S subscriptions is down sequentially, the conversion rate remained strong with approximately one-third of the maintenance renewal opportunities migrating to product subscriptions. Of those that migrated, once again over 30% of eligible subscriptions upgraded from an individual product to an Industry Collection. We expect the number of M2S subs to increase in Q4 as our maintenance renewal opportunity is higher. The renewal rates for both maintenance and product subscription ticked up slightly from Q2 and were in line with our planning assumptions. Helping to bolster renewal rates for product subscription are the M2S related subs, which have, as expected, very high renewal rates because the program was designed to be sticky. We expect the renewal rate for product subscriptions to continue to increase as the product mix shifts toward higher value products.Now let's talk a little more about annualized revenue per subscription, or ARPS. Total ARPS posted another quarter of strong growth as it continued to benefit from the same drivers we discussed at Investor Day and that we saw in Q2. These drivers include the growth of the renewal base, the ongoing strength of Industry Collections, and various pricing adjustments we made earlier in the year and are now having a greater influence on ARPS. The pricing adjustments include the price increase associated with the M2S program, lower channel discount on AutoCAD LT, and an increase for multi-user subscriptions. Long-term ARPS drivers will continue to be the growing renewal base, which comes at a higher net price to Autodesk, the increase in digital sales, also at a higher net price to Autodesk; the product mix shift to Industry Collections, the maintenance price increase for those customers who don't take advantage of the M2S program, and less discounting and promotional activity.We expect total ARPS to continue to increase for all the reasons I just discussed as we progress through the transition and well beyond fiscal '20.Our eStore, which is playing a bigger part in our digital sales, grew by 65% year-on-year. For the past five quarters, our eStore has generated over 20% of the product subscriptions. Q3 also marked the eighth consecutive quarter of greater than 30% growth in our EBAs. In fact, our EBAs posted over 50% growth in the quarter highlighting strong execution as well as adoption and expansion of EBA contracts. What's interesting is that while the growth of our total direct business accelerated even from the record levels in Q2, our indirect business expanded even faster. We continue to believe that over time the mix of direct business will outpace the growth of indirect leading to a more even split between direct and indirect revenue.Moving to spend management, our total non-GAAP spend was up 5% and was slightly higher than expected, as we have done a nice job filling the open positions created by last year's resource rebalancing, cloud costs are higher year on year, and due to the impact of ASC 340, which requires us to capitalize sales commissions. If we normalize for ASC 340, the growth in total spend would have been less than 4%.Looking at the balance sheet, total deferred revenue grew 17%. Unbilled deferred revenue increased by $45 million sequentially to $451 million due to strong EBA performance. We expect unbilled deferred revenue to increase meaningfully next quarter, with seasonally strong enterprise transactions. While we continued to experience an expected decrease in long-term deferred, our short-term deferred revenue grew by 14% due to strong billings in the quarter.Looking at cash flow, we generated $39 million in operating cash flow, as we benefited from growth in billings and strong cash collections. We expect our cash flow to accelerate in the fourth quarter. We used $103 million in the quarter to buy back roughly 800,000 shares at an average price of $131.42. Year-to-date we have repurchased 2.1 million shares for $270 million, an average price of $129.86. We continue to be committed to managing dilution and reducing shares outstanding over time.Before I turn to the outlook, let me run through some details about our acquisition of PlanGrid. As announced this afternoon, we are paying $875 million net of acquired cash. We will finance the deal with cash on hand and a short-term, pre-payable loan. The transaction is expected to close during our fiscal Q4. Since we cannot be sure of the exact timing, we have not included any impact in our guidance. That said, we would expect it to contribute slightly to revenue growth and be modestly negative for profitability and cashflows for the quarter. For fiscal '20, we expect PlanGrid to contribute approximately $100 million in ARR but create a slight headwind to our profitability. The transaction and associated financing costs will have some dilutive effect on our cash flow, but we believe we can achieve our goal of $1.35 billion in free cash flow for the year. There are more details about the company and our rationale behind the acquisition in a slide deck on our investor relations website.Now I'll turn the discussion to our outlook. I'll start by saying that our view of the global economic conditions remains mostly unchanged from the last few quarters but we're monitoring the potential macroeconomic impact from the various trade and tariff disputes. There has been some foreign exchange volatility, but our hedging program has succeeded in smoothing out the bigger swings. As we look at our outlook for Q4, we expect to see continued sequential increases in most metrics including ARR, ARPS, billings, revenue, spend, and earnings. We are raising our outlook on all of those key metrics for the year. We expect our hiring ramp to continue as we finish the rebalancing of resources to the most strategic projects, and as such, we expect our spend to increase slightly sequentially. However, the sequential uptick in total operating expense in the fourth quarter will be lower than previous years due to the adoption of ASC 340 that requires capitalization of commissions, which historically had been very heavy during Q4. Even though our full year expenses are moving up modestly, our operating margin for the year will be higher by one percentage point versus our previous target. Also, our new margin forecast for the year represents nearly 17 points of improvement over last year. And we expect a sizable uptick in cash flow in Q4.Regarding subscriptions, I'll reiterate that next quarter will be the last time we will report on subs and ARPS on a quarterly basis. After that, we will use events like our annual Investor Day to report on important metrics that will help you build your long-term models. For fiscal year '19, we continue to expect subscription additions to end up at the low-end of our guidance range, primarily related to the success we're having with the adoption of Industry Collections and the consolidation we're experiencing with the M2S program.Before we start the Q&A part of this call, I want to summarize by highlighting the great progress we have made on driving the sum of our revenue growth plus free cash flow margin, which is a key metric for driving shareholder value under the rule of 40 framework. We ended the quarter with the sum of both metrics at 32%, a level we have not seen for four years. As Andrew said, we plan to nearly double this metric in the next few years.Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays Capital. Your line is now open. -- Hi, guys. It's Saket from Barclays. Thanks for taking my questions here. First, maybe for you on -- maybe for you Andrew on PlanGrid. Nice addition to the construction portfolio. I guess, longer term as you think about the construction software market, how important is it going to be that Autodesk has both the underlying BIM data as well as the PlanGrid capabilities versus others in the space that maybe don't have that underlying BIM data? -- Yeah, that's an excellent question, Saket. So let me kind of give you a sense for where we are right now. Right now, a lot of the projects out there in the construction ecosystem are very document centric and that's where PlanGrid plays a very, very strong role. But there is a growing percentage of projects that are very BIM centric and these projects start with BIM data and move BIM data for the entire process. What you'll see us over time be able to do is capture the BIM centric projects, the document centric projects and bring the two together. PlanGrid really understands the document centric and sheet centric workflow and they really have the hearts and minds of the end user in that space. We really understand the BIM data and as those 2 things come together over time and over a five year period or more when more and more projects are BIM based, it is obviously going to allow us to cover almost 100% of the project ecosystem. -- Got it. That's super helpful. Maybe staying on PlanGrid with you, Andrew. Can you just talk a little bit about the pricing model and maybe how it compares to others in the industry? I know you talked about general contractors and subcontractors and we've heard others in the industry that perhaps base pricing on seat (ph) versus total value of a particular construction project. So can you talk a little bit about PlanGrid's pricing model? -- Yeah, so PlanGrid like us right now is predominantly a named user model. Now, Saket, you probably know, we have experienced in all the model types here. We have named user model. We have a pay-per-use consumptive model and we have the project-based model. And what we found over time is that the models that are tending to be the predominant play are going to be named user and consumptive or pay per use. The project-based models, they help in the short-term, they allow you to kind of land and account, they provide short-term growth. But long term, the customers basically just push back on this whole percent of turnover model, it's not an attractive model to the customers. So we absolutely see the pendulum swinging toward named user and pay-per-use and that PlanGrid is well aligned with that. -- Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. -- Thank you, Saket.Thank you.Our next question comes from Philip Winslow of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. As you mentioned this is probably the strongest quarter that I can think of having both net add growth as well as a pretty impressive margin increase. What do you think about sort of what's driving that even in the context of higher cloud subs that typically came at a higher -- lower ARPS? Kind of walk us through sort of where we are in the sort of the ARPS lifecycle? Obviously you've given your guidance for next year that implies an increase versus what you guided to this year. But kind of help us through like what are the drivers that were there this year, which one of those continue into 2020, then just have one follow-up to that. -- Yeah. So, this is Scott. I think on the subs, you touched on them, we had another good quarter of sub adds for core and cloud had a -- reaccelerating the sub add in the cloud business. So really driven by BIM 360, 53,000 sub adds to the quarter. So that's on the subs front. On the ARPS front, we're continuing to see the trend that we saw and we -- initially that we talked about in the Investor Day back in March and that we saw in Q2. So there is some effect from the change in channel discounts for AutoCAD LT that rolled out at the beginning of the year. We are seeing -- we made a slight adjustment to our multi-year -- our multi-user product pricing at the beginning of this year, that's coming through as well. And more importantly, we're seeing a bigger renewal base, which comes at a higher net price to us. We're seeing an increase in direct sales. The eStore one of the stats I gave on the opening commentary was that eStore grew 65% this quarter. So that drives higher ARPS. The move to collections continues to be strong. Collections are a notable percent of our total base both of new and of conversions on M2S and less discounting over time. So all those factors drove ARPS last quarter and again this quarter and almost all those will continue out not just in the fiscal '20 but out into fiscal '23 as well. -- Great. And then a follow-up for Andrew on PlanGrid and first off, congratulations on that deal and really reinforcing your leadership position defining construction lifecycle management as a market here. What do you think about PlanGrid and just the idea of construction lifecycle management? Where do you kind of put the dividing line between sort of where Autodesk us is going to play versus, call it, traditional we're more financials applications? When you think about, budgeting et cetera (inaudible) getting on to the financial side of construction. Is that where you kind of separate how deep Autodesk wants to go in construction or is it eventually something like, hey, look, we're going to be a player in the entire life cycle? -- Yeah, so I think you're actually touching on something that's important here. If you look at the way that's evolved in the manufacturing space what happened was that there was a rise of what we call, product lifecycle management systems. And they basically handle the entire data flow from the design phase, all the way through the delivery of the products and the manufacturing floor but ERP systems continued to fill the void in terms of the whole financial planning and budgeting aspects and some of the financial aspects. That's the way we see this unfolding in the future. We're not going to go into the ERP space of construction. We're going to stay on the whole life cycle from design, all the way through to site execution, and we think that's well aligned with our vision of how construction is going to industrialize over the next 10 years. So don't look -- don't see us getting into construction financials and budget management and those kind of things in the future. -- So the best idea is just sort of like PLM evolved from the design software player to becoming the leaders in PLM. Similar idea with you guys here, design and the construction life cycle management but financials being a separate area. Is that a fair assumption? -- Absolutely. I see it playing out exactly the same way and there is really no reason right now to not see it playing out the exact same way. -- Great. Awesome guys. Thanks a lot. -- Thanks, Philip.Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Andrew, let me start with you on this big dose of Vitamin C that you are buying with PlanGrid? Could you talk about two things? One, how do you foresee the integration into the portfolio? And maybe talk about the technology roadmap here. And also what connection do you see if any of this acquisition to the manufacturing side of the portfolio? In other words, as we heard last week at AU there is the growing connection to manufacturing to ADC and construction. Does this have any bearing on that and could this also lay the groundwork? Does this imply a future construction collection? Then a follow-up. -- All right. So let me start -- it was actually three questions, Jay. That's good. I'll answer all of them, OK. All right. So first off, let's talk about the product integration strategy. So let's kind of just pause and talk about what is each product family good at. All right. PlanGrid has built an excellent fast mobile native platform for document centric workflows and sheet centric workflows and project management layers. They capture issues, change orders and things in these document centric workflows. They've done an absolutely exceptional job and you can tell by how far they've reached down into the construction ecosystem and the products beloved by the end users.So they have really nailed this notion of document centric flow. You can see on the BIM 360 side, we have always been very BIM centric. All right. We've focused on how do you get BIM data deeper into the construction process, how do you explod it so that it can be useful to more teams. So I think what you're going to see us doing with this portfolio integration, especially over the next year and a half or so is, we're going to pull their document-centric view up into BIM 360 and they're going to pull our model-centric view down into their application. So basically you're going to see us close the loop between the document flows that go on in PlanGrid and the BIM data flows that go on in BIM 360. And you'll see each team kind of double downing on what it's best at. So you will see the BIM 360 team start to continue to move further upstream in its efforts on pre-construction and the PlanGrid team continue to execute more deeply on the document based flows and gaining insights from those flows.Now in terms of the manufacturing integration, I think one of the things you're probably aware of is, as manufacturing industrializes more and more, what we classically call building product manufacturers are going to show up more and more in the construction world. They're going to be delivering products into the construction space. They're probably going to be one of the larger prefabricators out there in terms of what we think. These are the companies right now that builds things like ducting systems, air conditioning systems, curtain walls, prefabricated modular buildings , they're going to get more and more important. And as such, they will be a trade quotes in the workflow and they'll likely be consuming some of these applications too as the owners propagate their construction flows into these applications.So you're absolutely see an overlap between what we classically call our product data management application and these construction life cycle applications. Now your last point on the construction collection, I wouldn't look for anything like that soon. The collections have primarily been targeted at the desktop products and integrating cloud-based capabilities with the desktop products. We think we have the appropriate layer of overlap there. Right now we are just going to keep rolling these products out separately and satisfy the needs of individual projects in the construction ecosystem one at a time. -- A quick follow-up on M2S. Could you talk about -- this one is for, Scott, any material differences you're seeing in adoption or conversion by geo? For example, within Europe, are you seeing any notable differences there or Asia or here in terms of rates of adoption of M2S? -- Yes, I'd say we are. So let me start by stating the conversion rate on M2S was unchanged this quarter. It's still staying at about a third maintenance agreement that came up for renewal that converted. So even though the number in absolute terms is smaller, just means that the number that came up for renewal is small, so no change in conversion rate. There is a difference for geo as you just pointed out. It's less so at the country level, it's more of what we typically see as new technologies roll out, where North America seems to be the earliest adopters followed by Continental Europe and then some of the emerging markets in Europe and then APAC comes in at the -- after Europe though. So that's exactly what we're seeing in our Maintenance to Subscription. We're furthest along in the US, we're about where the US was within the last two or three quarters in Europe at this point and APAC is behind.Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Great, thank you. I do have follow-up on collections. You guys mentioned that there were notable percentage of your total base. I'm just wondering if -- you said, I guess total base, and so I'm just wondering are collections tracking faster than you thought and then what do you think it is now that's driving adoption for existing customers to look at collections when you had (inaudible) in the past what's caused then people to get more interested in them? And the other, I guess just real quick one would be your eStore progress, is that progressing faster than where you thought you would be right now? Thank you. -- Yeah, Heather, I'll start on the eStore. It's progressing right along with what our expectations are. We gave this data where 65% year-on-year during the third quarter that we disclosed. eStore continues to drive 20% or so of all of our products subs. So eStore is progressing nicely. I think there's more ground to cover there but the eStore is progressing nicely.On the collections, they have moved faster than we had initially planned. And I think it's all upside. It's definitely good news. We spent, I think you've heard me say this, an enormous amount of time and Andrew both in his current role, but also in his prior role, spent an enormous amount of time ensuring that we put the right content in those collections that we simplified it. We went from seven suites, which each had a good, better, best versions of 21 suites down to just three collections. So it's easier to sell, it's easier to buy and easier to pay and consume. But we also spend lot of time getting the product mix inside those collections right.It's moved faster both for new customers and certainly it's moved fast on people converting from maintenance over to product subscription and stepping up at that point of collection. It's been a quite an upside. -- And Heather, one of the things that's very different about the collections from the suite day is the integration with multi-platform in the cloud is a pretty significant delta from what we had in the suite day. So for instance, the AutoCADs you get in the box with a collection have a mobile version, they have a web version and also they're all integrated with a common data platform in the cloud so people can share their data. So it's a very different offering than what we had during the suite days. -- Great. Thank you so much. -- Thanks, Heather.Thank you. Our next question comes from Gal Munda of Berenberg Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks for taking my question. The first one I have is about PlanGird. Can you talk a bit about the growth profile of the business and the way you expect maybe the contributions of sales to come into FY '20? When you look at that, how does that contribute to kind of your target for FY '23? That's my first question. Thanks. -- Yes. I'll start and then let Andrew chime in. They are running on a $60 million to $70 million revenue run rate right now and growing about 50% year-on-year. So that's what underpins one of the comments that I gave in the opening script that we expect it to contribute around $100 million ARR next year. There's likely to be some small haircuts, deferred revenue haircut as we work through all the purchase accounting. But that's -- so that will drive a small amount of upside in ARR for fiscal 2020. And actually between that the small amount of headwind on profitability and a small amount of financing costs would be a little bit of a headwind on cash flows. We think we can contain that and still achieve for fiscal 2020, the $1.35 billion in free cash flow we've put out there.Do you want to talk about longer-term? -- So now, if we look out at the FY '23 targets, Gal, remember one of the things we said very explicitly when we talked about this target was that the cloud and specifically construction was one of the things that was required to hit those targets. So what you're seeing us do right now is executing on the strategy that allows us to hit those numbers we put out there for FY '23. So organic and inorganic tactics are actually how we're getting those numbers we've put out there and that's how we're going to -- that's how we are going to succeed in construction. -- Perfect. And just if I talk -- if I think about the customer overlap and the way you guys and they go to the market today, first, maybe, if you think about the US, that's where they're mainly based in, how much is the -- how much customer overlap there is? And in the past, you talked a bit about the stages of adoption in BIM. You start with the project and expand into division, maybe go companywide, entitywide, where is PlanGrid as compared to BIM 360 today? Thank you. -- Yeah. So here's what's really exciting about this. We do have quite a bit of customer overlap, not a lot, they go deeper down into the system than we do. But what we don't have is project overlap, right. And what happens in the construction space is technology is sold on a project-by-project basis. So for instance, in accounts where we do overlap BIM 360 is on a completely different project and PlanGrid is used on another project. So what you see is, PlanGrid is built to go-to-market machine, it's very good at selling on a project-by-project basis. We've got a lot of success with BIM 360 selling to the IT departments in the large GC and the mid-sized GCs. So there is a really great complement between their project-centric go-to-market approach and our IT or top of the market go-to-market approach. So you can see it's actually coming at some of our companies in different ways.The other growth synergy we're obviously going to see is taking the PlanGrid technology international, into EMEA and into APAC. So, yes, there is an overlap but the overlap is by account, not by projects. We do not share any projects. -- Perfect. Thank you so much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Yes, thanks. Hi guys. You mentioned in the prepared remarks talking about the outlook and your commentary on macro is that it hasn't changed, but ahead of the G20 and a lot of concerns over trade discussions, et cetera, kind of what are you hearing specifically from customers in EMEA and APAC and what are your thoughts here going into next quarter from a macro perspective? -- Yeah, Sterling we are not seeing any impact on macro at this point, it's something that obviously I think everyone is looking very closely for. We've been watching since the beginning of the year, frankly, to see if there's any effect in the UK or across the northern Europe from Brexit. We're not seeing that, we're not seeing it in demand. We're not seeing it in pipeline build. We've also been watching very carefully with the trading tariff situation, the way it's escalated over the last couple of months, we're not seeing any impact there. There is the anecdotal here and there, we're not seeing any impact on demand and we're not seeing any impact on pipeline build at this point. So, to this point the demand environment still remains robust and from what we can see it will continue that way through the end of the year. -- Yes, Sterling. I just came off of Autodesk University, and I spend a lot of time with construction and manufacturing customers and yes sure some of them are seeing increases in the material costs, but they are all seeing increases in material costs. So really it's not affecting their ability to execute on projects relative to their competition. So they're still investing in technology from our side because they are all seeing the same kind of small impact in their material costs, but it's not translating into any kind of impact on our business because the people have to get their job done. -- That makes sense. And then my follow-up on PlanGrid, as you look at that space given the number of competitors that are in it, can you help us by comparing and contrasting what you think PlanGrid's, particular strengths were versus the other competitors in that space? -- Yes, you're right, it is a very competitive space, Sterling. There is lots of competition in this space. What we look at is a couple of important things. One, PlanGrid built an excellent SaaS native application, that's where our focus is on the BIM 360 portfolio. Everything started SaaS native, they've got an excellent set of technologies that are well tuned in mobile workflows, so they started with a stack that's highly scalable, highly SaaS-focused, highly mobile-centric and that's super important moving forward because that's the paradigm that you have to go with. You don't want to have to retool some underlying architecture to be more SaaS or mobile friendly. So that was number one, right.Number two is, they are covering a set of project requirements that we don't necessarily cover as well with BIM 360. So they have that really robust document-centric flow, we have that really robust BIM-centric flow. Another thing that's super important, they're right down the street. All right, they're right here in San Francisco, it allows us to tap more robustly into the San Francisco talent pool, it's highly synergistic with our location strategy, so we're able to build up a stronger construction presence here in San Francisco.And then finally there is big synergy with their business models. The business models are nicely aligned. As we discussed earlier when Saket asked, there is pluses and minuses to the various business models out there and we felt very strongly that the named user in pay-per-use models are the winning models and project-based models hit a brick wall. So it was really important for us to look at all these things out there in terms of execution. That what lead us in this direction. They really got the right application in the right space at the right time. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys, thanks. I'll offer my congrats as well. Scott, can you help us how we should think through the impact of multi-year contracts to your -- you reiterate fiscal 2010 free cash flow targets, but is the plan to get back to more historical levels, is that primarily channel incentives to drive that behavior? -- Yeah, Matt. It's a great question. You remember this is one thing that I talked about as we were laying out the road to the $1.35 billion free cash flow for fiscal '20 when I walked though that back at our Investor Day. And it really is about seeing multi-year sales kind of revert to its historic mean. We artificially depressed multi-year sales, we launched the Maintenance to Subscription program because we shot up all multi-year maintenance, we had to given three years of visibility to price increases that we're going to happen there. So I'd say it's more returning to the norm that it has been, which if you recall, I said, is about 20% of our sales. And that is focused on product subscription getting to that multi-year point. What that will mean is long term deferred will get up to less than it has been historically but probably into that 15% to 20% range below where it had been historically closer to 30% of our total deferred revenue. So it really is just about reverting that and that's both a channel play and through our mid-market team. -- That's great. And then just maybe just a quick one. As we think forward to Q1, what's the right way to think about sort of like a cost of living price increase across the subscription portfolio of products? Is that kind of the right way to think about on an annual basis, just kind of like a cost of living increase? -- It is Matt. That's not a decision that we've made or rolled out yet, but what we've said is over the long term expect to see us have annual price increases that are in that low-single digit kind of cost of living range longer term. We haven't talked through or made the decisions on what kind of a price increase to look like beginning next year. -- Right. Now as you know, we have published long-term price expectations for our M2S customers. So anyone who have taken the M2S offering has a 10-year visibility to how the cost of their subscription is going to trend over time, which is something we felt was really important to do for some of our best customers. -- Absolutely. Thanks again, guys, congrats. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Thanks so much and congrats as well on PlanGrid and on a great quarter. I wanted to ask about the strength in EBAs and as well if you can comment about where we are in the shift to annual billings for EBAs and on penetrating within the enterprise? -- Yeah, Brad. Thanks for that question. EBA -- our EBAs business continues to grow strongly. So if you remember the stat we gave -- when we haven't updated this at a mid-year point, but I would expect to see us updated on our Investor Day last year and we are about 45% penetrated through our base of EBA eligible customers. So obviously we made a little more progress on that. I expect to update that penetration rate when we come to the next Investor Day next March. What I'd say is we see great benefit as do our customers see great benefit as they convert over to EBAs.Usage goes up significantly at that first renewal point. Because of the increased usage of that first renewal point, we see anywhere from 40% to 45% higher renewal at the first renewal point because the usage goes up so much during that period. So, the EBA business continues to grow strongly. I think statistically gave -- earlier was that the enterprise business grew about 50% during the quarter we just closed and it continues to be a focus area for us. -- Excellent. If I could just follow up on PlanGrid, you had said that you expect it'll be dilutive to fiscal '20 cash flow, but yet good to see you're maintaining your fiscal '20 target, but I guess it's fair to assume it's going to be accretive to fiscal '23. Anyway to quantify that? -- Yeah, so it doesn't make sense for us to update those fiscal '23 targets at this point. We haven't even closed the transaction yet. So I don't want to -- I don't want to get into addressing fiscal '23. It clearly is a part of the strategy we have laid out to get to our fiscal '23 targets. In terms of fiscal '20, to back up to that piece they are bringing along a fairly robust revenue stream in addition, so it will be slightly dilutive to profitability in fiscal 20 and slightly dilutive to free cash flows but we think we can contain it within our fiscal '20 target of $1.35 billion of free cash flow. -- Yes, Brad, one of the frequent questions I get when I am now talking to the investment communities, they ask us also how are you going to get to those construction numbers in the fiscal '23 target. Well, now you know, it's going to be a combination of organic and inorganic actions like what you just saw. -- Excellent. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Tout of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. Just firstly, on the BIM side and kind of more the concept of BIM, are you seeing any more government or agency mandates coming through that may act as sort of general catalysts for the BIM market and your attack on the market first of all? And then on the manufacturing side, you mentioned the interesting Ford example and how this was at least driven in part by generative design. We've also got concepts like digital twin and IIoT getting a lot of attention on the manufacturing side. But do you maybe see these initiatives in manufacturing as a little bit further out than the construction opportunity? Just your thoughts there on kind of how quickly those opportunities are developing relatively speaking. Thanks. -- Right. So, Alex. Remind me what your first question was, because I got -- -- Sorry. -- Yeah. BIM mandate, OK, thank you, yeah, because I got -- (inaudible). All right. Let me talk about the BIM mandate. So we're absolutely seeing more momentum around governments and owners mandating BIM as part of their building process and as part of their specification process. We expect this to continue as time goes on. You remember what happened with the UK mandates and how that drove some pretty intense adoption of Revit in the UK markets and surrounding markets. You're going to see more and more of those. It's just part of what's going to happen. We are very interested in seeing BIM based permitting processes, getting the government entities as well. That's going to be something that we'd like to be part of helping people understand and do. Now, when it comes to the manufacturing opportunity, what you said there about it being somewhat further out, I think what you're seeing right now, especially with our execution is on the construction side, you've got this perfect storm of technologies ready, the mobile platform as it is today and the cloud is absolutely 100% suited to what the construction industry needs. The customers are ready. They know they have to digitize and the products are ready. That's why you see this intense doubling down on the construction opportunity in the near term right now.You look at manufacturing, tools like generatives and some of these other tools, IoT by the way we just see IoT as an input to generative, that's how you collect data and you use it to put information in. It's something we pioneered with the Hack Rod initiative a couple of years back. These initiatives are all very much in the exploratory stages of manufacturers, large and small. And what they're doing is they are sitting there going well. I know that these technologies, the cloud, high-performance computing in the cloud, connected workflows generative, all of these things are going to have a big impact on my business. I just don't know how I am going to deploy them yet. So you'll see those start to get much more traction over an 18 to 24-month horizon whereas construction is kind of a now opportunity. -- Great. Thanks. -- Thanks, Alex.Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord. Your line is now open. -- Hey thanks. Maybe a longer-term question. You may or may not want to name names, but when we think about kind of how the growth, the unit growth will come as you kind of go through your transition, subscription in cloud, how should we think about the mix of you guys chipping away market share from your competition versus kind of acquiring because we've talked about this before, acquiring and/or kind of getting people that are laggards to pay -- to become more sustainable but paying customers, is that 50-50, is it 60-40, or how you think about that? -- All right. Well, so, Richard, I can't give you a percentage, but here is the philosophical answer I'll give you, right? In the short term what you're going to see is piracy or what we call, in -- -- Non-genuine users. -- Non-genuine users, thank you. Piracy in your non-genuine users and legacy users are going to be a more important driver. But in the long term as you head out three to five years, you are absolutely going to see us chipping away competitors in this space, especially in the manufacturing space. The growth infusion is prefacing what's going on in terms of our ability to execute in that space. There is an absolute change in the manufacturing market and that change favors the cloud native. And we've invested, we've been patient, we've worked hard on that and it's going to pay off in terms of share shift long term. So the way I have you think about this is, the one to three-year horizon you're going to see a lot of these non-genuine users and legacy users coming in. When you look out to the three to five-year horizon, you're going to see some share shift coming into the mix. -- Yeah. And what I (ph) want to add to that Richard is on the construction market, this is Phil, we see it as a $10 billion opportunity over time, but it's probably less than $1 billion today. The last time we did our own surveys, we thought it was around the $500 million market today. So I think a lot of the growth going ahead is not necessarily reclaiming non-paying users whether they are legacy or pirates or share gains frankly in that space where we have to take it from someone else. Like in the construction market there is just an enormous amount of growth that's going to happen in that marketplace ahead of us and we're really well positioned, but it's a big market and there's a lot of competitors in that space. I think there is enough market there for all of us to grow. -- Yeah, I agree, that's good -- good thoughts. Thank you so much.Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Hi guys. This is actually Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith. Just a quick clarification. When we think about the fiscal '23 targets and the M&A, the inorganic, I guess, contributions to get there, beyond PlanGrid should we be expecting similar type of transactions in the future? And then a quick follow-up on the cloud part of the business in the quarter. Thank you. -- So we've always been acquisitive, all right. We've been an acquisitive company. The last two years were an anomaly. What you're seeing is entering back into a period where we'll actually be acquisitive again. So we're going to make disciplined choices between inorganic and organic execution over the next five years in all of the new markets we're participating in. Construction being the first, manufacturing not being immune either, so I think you'll continue to see us doing appropriate organic and inorganic actions. And I can't remember -- what was your second question? -- I didn't originally state it. The official -- the official question, so the 53,000 cloud subs that we just saw in the quarter was a nice uptick versus the trend that we saw in Q1 and Q2 and you specifically mentioned that it came from BIM 360. But maybe just digging into that one, what is it about BIM 360 that really drove such a strong result within the cloud, a portion of the product? Was it better renewal rates, maybe just help us to unpack that number a bit. -- There's two factors. One, and you might recall a year ago -- the infamous year ago, we had stopped doing promotions that were pushing kind of low-end BIM 360 products into our channel. We now have clean year-over-year compares from those days. So what you see is the year-over-year compares are more representative of where we're going with the business. The other piece that I think is really important to pay attention to is that you know that six or nine months ago we rolled out the new platform for BIM 360 that was integrating our field and planned functionality on a single platform. That platform is now starting to get adoption in some of our largest customers and what you're seeing is the pull through in the BIM 360 business as a result. -- Perfect. Thank you so much. -- You're very welcome.Thank you. Our next question comes from of Zane Chrane of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thanks for fitting me in and congrats on a great quarter guys. You had really strong growth in EMEA and APAC and that's really impressive given the fact that these regions tend to lag in cloud and subscription adoption versus North America. I'm just wondering is the strong growth you're seeing in those regions being driven more by customers getting more comfortable with these types of deployment models or is it more macro-driven such that there is maybe an uptick in construction or manufacturing demand? Thank you. -- Yeah, Zane I think it's a little bit of both. I think -- and it's a little bit of different story between APAC than it is in EMEA. I think in EMEA we are seeing better penetration, we're seeing better uptake both of the new model types and of cloud across EMEA. I think in APAC what you see is more -- the fast growth rate we're seeing there is more common on the year-earlier quarter where as you recall we had struggled for a couple of years in Japan, made several changes there, changes in our market structure, changes in our own team frankly to drive execution. And we're really seeing Japan turn around very nicely and that's fueling a lot of the growth that we see in APAC. So it's a little bit -- a little bit of a different story between the two. -- That's great. And just a quick follow-up, any difference in the macro outlook in those regions versus North America? -- No, not at this time. -- Got it. Great. Thanks very much, guys. -- Yeah.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So first off, when you look at the construction opportunity, what if anything do you need to do to better address the building owner constituent who may not be as familiar with Autodesk because they are with say a traditional ERP vendor? -- Yeah, so we actually have a very quiet product that we have out there in the market already, it's called BIM 360 Ops. And one of the big value propositions of BIM in general is that it leaves behind a 3D model that is a huge asset to the owner in terms of managing, maintaining and using their asset as time progresses. So we've been experimenting in that space. What you're going to do is see us getting deeper penetration there from a couple of fronts. Frankly some of our lead customers are actually starting to become more owners because they see opportunity for them in managing building spaces. Some of the customers that are using BIM Ops now -- BIM 360 Ops are in that category. So you'll see us getting more awareness in that space simply because some of our customers are starting to participate more in that part of the market. -- Okay, great. And then as another question, could you give us a sense for some of the factors that drove your renewal rates up and what levers you might have going forward? -- Yeah, Ken, we just -- we continue to see in -- so let's just take maintenance effort from (inaudible) product subscription, we continue to see maintenance rates hold up despite the move from maintenance to subscription and we gave you the stat that 30% of those eligible actually moved from an individual product to a collection, which means they probably took more maintenance subscriptions and fewer industry collection subscription. So despite that fact and despite the price increase, we continue to see maintenance renewal rates hold up nicely. So that's a positive, little surprised we're not seeing faster migration frankly from maintenance over to product subscription. But at this point, the price difference between the two is still pretty nominal. That price gap will expand next year.But again product subscription is just -- it's continued adoption and deep adoption and building that product subscription into your workflows such that it becomes an indispensable tool, much like the products have been back in the perpetual license world.

In the last reported quarter, the company reported earnings of 19 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by couple of cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported a loss of 11 cents.Revenues increased 22% year over year to $611.7 million in the last reported quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $601 million. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by strong growth in subscription plan revenues, well-supported by higher product subscriptions.For the third quarter, Autodesk expects revenues between $635 million and $645 million and earnings in the range of 24 and 28 cents per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at 26 cents per share, indicating year-over-year increase of 316.7%. Further, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $642.3 million, increasing 24.7% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.In the last reported quarter, Autodesk achieved robust growth in annualized revenue per subscription (ARPS) and billings, Billings of $605 million surged 27% year over year.Notably, Industry Collections generated significant ARPS coupled with a high renewal rate for the company, which increased 60% year over year and accounted for 40% of the total product subscriptions in the last reported quarter, which is a positive.The company is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing in both its domestic and overseas markets. We believe that higher demand for its cloud-based products, mobile products and design suites will drive the top line over the long term.Autodesk benefited from growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) from all major geographies, with APAC exhibiting the strongest growth. Subscription plan ARR increased substantially driven by growth in product subscription on both a year-over-year and sequential basis in the second quarter. Moreover, cloud ARR grew more than 20% year over year and 10% sequentially.Additionally, the biggest contributor to cloud ARR was BIM 360 family of products, with the company adding 31,000 subs in the BIM 360 space in the previous quarter. We expect this momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, Autodesk acquired Assemble in the second quarter to enhance market positioning for BIM 360 across the design and construction phase, which is expected to boost revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Autodesk's business transition from perpetual licenses to cloud-based services is expected to benefit it by boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues. Also, in order to encourage customers to move from maintenance subscriptions to product subscription, management is offering discounts, which is increasing its subscription base. However, this is expected to negatively impact top-line growth in the near term.In the previous quarter, Autodesk's e-store accounted for a significant portion of the company's digital sales and generated 20% of the product subscriptions. Management stated that e-store grew 70% year over year and captured a significant portion of the company's AutoCAD business. Additionally, Autodesk's direct and indirect business channels are growing at the same pace, which is a positive.However, the on-going business model transition has impacted top line of the company. Revenues have been adversely impacted by the movement of perpetual licenses to cloud-based services, as well as migration of maintenance plan customers to subscription plan offerings. This is expected to have a negative impact on the company's revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.Autodesk has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

For the iShares Morningstar Large-Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: JKE), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $197.32 per unit.With JKE trading at a recent price near $173.96 per unit, that means that analysts see 13.43% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of JKE's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Worldpay Inc (Symbol: WP), Autodesk Inc. (Symbol: ADSK), and Baxter International Inc (Symbol: BAX). Although WP has traded at a recent price of $90.11/share, the average analyst target is 19.50% higher at $107.68/share. Similarly, ADSK has 17.65% upside from the recent share price of $135.55 if the average analyst target price of $159.47/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BAX to reach a target price of $73.69/share, which is 16.09% above the recent price of $63.48. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of WP, ADSK, and BAX:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n  \nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["utodesk (ADSK) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This design software company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +316.7%.Revenues are expected to be $642.33 million, up 24.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Autodesk, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Autodesk will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Autodesk would post earnings of $0.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.19, delivering a surprise of +11.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Autodesk doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

But don't let that send you off course. Sure, if a stock has little prospect of an uptime, it's a good idea to get out - and the sooner the better. This could be because of a fundamental shift in the stock's prospects like a long-term decline in demand trends. However that isn't the case with the stocks below.True, all five of these stocks have endured a tricky month. All these stocks have seen prices fall considerably of late But with the long-term outlook still intact, now's not the time to sell.Indeed for some investors not currently in these stocks, now could even be the time to buy.Here we use  market data to get a better look at the Street's perspective on these stocks. As the site ranks analysts, we can focus our energies on the analysts who tend to outperform rather than underperform! Let's take a closer look at why they are sticking to their bullish perspective on these five hot stocks now. As you will see, all of these stocks share a \"buy\" Street consensus right now- and sizable upside to boot: (NASDAQ:  ) fundamentals have improved significantly over the past few months, as it has expanded its dominance in e-commerce and the cloud, while growing its presence in advertising and offline retail. Yet, the stock has dropped recently.Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth (  ) believes AMZN stock continues to leverage its strong retail, e-commerce and web hosting platforms to develop new business lines and penetrate new markets. As such, he views the recent pullback in its share price as a buying opportunity.Just some of these big potential-money makers for AMZN stock include the following:The conclusion: \"AMZN continues to make ongoing incremental investments that drive an increasing Return on Capital that will continue to drive further gains in its share price.\"Feinseth forgoes setting a price target, but he does write the following: \"We believe significant upside exists and view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity.\" And we can get an idea of the upside from the kind of price targets published by other top analysts. Right now their average price target stands at $2,185, giving the stock a return potential of over 22%.Net net, the Street backs Feinseth's bullish bite into the online retail titan. TipRanks analytics exhibit AMZN as a strong buy. Out of 41 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 40 are bullish on Amazon stock versus only one analyst who remains sidelined. Interested in AVEO stock?  (NASDAQ:  ) has plunged just over 14% in the last month. Now isn't the time to start selling however. This stock still has a lot more to give - especially with Hyperwallet, Simility and the $2.2 billion iZettle (dubbed the 'Square of Europe) in hand. In fact, we now have a very attractive entry point lined up.William Blair analyst Robert Napoli (  ) has just reiterated his PYPL \"buy\" rating. He says that while recent acquisitions and the credit business sale \"could complicate near-term visibility, PayPal's (PYPL) fundamentals remain strong.\"In particular, the drop in the PYPL stock price from its highs, taking the valuation to 17 times 2019 EBITDA, brings a compelling entry point for long-term investors, says Napoli. He sees earnings growing at a high-teens to 20% rate in the medium term.Meanwhile, the company's earnings report is fast-approaching on Oct. 18. Deutsche Bank's Bryan Keane (  ) also advises buying on weakness. He commented, \"We est. PYPL to report 3Q18 net revs of $3,661m (+13% Y/Y, +12.7% cc) and pro-forma EPS of $0.55. We believe the key swing factor will be PYPL's preliminary guide for 2019, given the rev hit from the US consumer credit portfolio sale and the dilution from acquisitions.\"Bear in mind this is a \"strong buy\" stock according to the Street. In the last three months, 24 analysts have published PYPL stock buy ratings vs just five hold ratings. This is on top a $99.32 average analyst price target, which suggests 28% upside potential lies ahead. Poor  (NYSE:  ). In the last month, prices have sunk over 8%. The company is the U.S.'s largest home improvement retailer with over 2,200 retail stores. But don't pay too much attention to these short-term stock movements. This is still a \"strong buy\" stock with a bullish $221 price target (16% upside) and killer long-term potential.Word on the Street is that HD stock still represents a key play on long-term upward DIY trends. \"Concerns regarding interest rates/health of the housing market have limited the stock's momentum YTD, but we remain bullish on the home improvement segment of the housing market and continue to recommend shares of HD\" writes RBC's Scot Ciccarelli (  ).He notes that housing macro data indicates rising spending within the home improvement sector. Plus: \"We believe the company's earnings guidance is conservative, and we think there could be upside - particularly if recently improving housing trends continue.\" Ciccarelli says HD stock should also benefit from fundamental operational improvements and market share gains.Most notably, the company has a savvy five-year strategy to provide a premium delivery service for both its pro and DIY customers. As part of this plan, Home Depot just launched same-day and next-day local delivery for more than 20,000 items in 35 US cities- a move that should also pay off longer-term.The analyst has a $218 price target on the stock. Warren Buffett's favorite airline stock has taken a beating recently. Over the last month, prices are down 10%. That's despite third-quarter earning results topping expectations. On Oct. 11,  (NYSE:  ) reported adjusted EPS of $1.80, easily beating analysts' estimates of $1.74.CEO Edward Bastian put the beat down to strong revenue momentum, tax reform benefits, and a 4% lower share count. \"Demand for the Delta product has never been greater\" he told analysts on the , adding: \"We have seen continued success in addressing fuel cost increases and offset roughly 85% of the $655 million impact of fuel cost for the quarter.\"Post-report, DAL stock scored multiple bullish calls from the Street. Top Stifel Nicolaus analyst Joseph DeNardi (  ) believes shares can spike an incredible 83% from current levels. That would take prices all the way to $95. He explains that a 3%-4% capacity-growth outlook may not be as low as investors would have wished, but \"if any airline has a pass to cheat, it's probably Delta.\" According to DeNardi, Delta is a leader in revenue visibility, reflecting robust demand for the higher-price premium seating.Overall, nine analysts have published buy ratings on the stock in the last three months. No hold or sell ratings here. This is with an average price target of $69.56, indicating eye-catching upside potential of almost 34%. This groundbreaking 3D design company makes software for people who make things. This includes software for architects, animators, builders and engineers. In the last month  (NASDAQ:  ) prices have snapped back 11%. But remember: its growth trajectory is still impressive, with prices soaring 29% year-to-date.Canaccord Genuity's Richard Davis (  ) is the No. 1 analyst ranked by TipRanks. So you can bet that he knows a thing or two about stock picking. And he is firmly in favor of ADSK. Davis has just ramped up his price target on the stock from $165 to $180. His Street-high price target now suggests over 30% upside potential. He is encouraged by the shift in investor dialogue towards longer-term strategy like the opportunity in construction, operation digitization, sales alignment, and full subscription adoption.Meanwhile Evercore ISI's Kenneth Talanian (  ) spies gold in ADSK's 12 million non-paying users. \"This population of users represents a substantial opportunity for increased subscription sales over the years to come\" says Talanian. He sees it as one of the many 'levers' available to Autodesk management to exceed its longer-term targets. The analyst reiterates his Buy rating with a bullish $175 price target.In total, the stock has a \"moderate buy\" consensus, with a $160 average price target (16% upside potential).

The company has leveraged its position as a business software supplier to add products and customers and made a change to a subscription business model that should stabilize revenue and add long-term value.It was a bit of a rocky road to get here, with revenue falling from mid-2015 to mid-2017 and net losses still piling up,  . But there might be enough of a light at the end of the tunnel to make this stock a buy.Image source: Getty Images.Autodesk's core business has always been the computer-aided design (CAD) of buildings and manufactured parts. It's a standard product in the architecture industry and has been a player, although not the dominant leader, in 3D modeling for part designers.What's changed over the last decade is Autodesk expanding its products to include more of the value chain than just modeling. In architecture, that means moving beyond just architectural drawings to the fabrication of parts, quality control, and even commissioning of a building. The company calls it the building information model, or BIM, and it's a full stack of services that make work more efficient, from architecture through the final inspection of a building.Modeling parts is a very different end market but operates on a similar business model. Autodesk's 3D modeling software has allowed for parts to be built for more than a decade, but Autodesk has added injection molding optimization, milling design, and stress analysis to its software package. For designers, this allows them to predict and optimize how parts will be produced and perform in the real world before spending thousands or millions of dollars on production equipment.This ecosystem of products is what gives Autodesk an advantage in the software business, and management is expecting the financials to start showing the underlying value of the business very soon.You can see below that revenue has been stagnant, and net income is down over the past five years. But this is largely because Autodesk is switching from a software sales model to a subscription model. Subscriptions should  , but the transition results in lower short-term sales and even losses. data by Subscription growth projections are high, but if management hits them, Autodesk's stock could be a huge winner. Between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2020, management expects subscriptions to grow from 2.6 million seats to 4.9 million. Annualized recurring revenue is expected to grow from $1.4 billion to $3.4 billion over the same time frame. If those targets are hit, free cash flow should be $1.4 billion, according to management's projections.I like Autodesk's business model, how it's moving to subscriptions, and the revenue and free cash flow growth projections from management. The biggest flaw as an investment is that Autodesk trades at a $33.4 billion market cap, which is 24 times expected 2020 free cash flow. That's a big premium to pay for a company that hasn't yet proven it can generate more than a billion dollars in cash per year.With that risk pointed out, I'm still cautiously optimistic about Autodesk's stock in the long term. I see nothing but growth for CAD technology in architecture, manufacturing, and other areas. For a leader in the industry, I think there's plenty of long-term growth to justify a premium for the stock today, but investors might have to wait for a return given the great performance already priced into the stock.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We believe that higher demand for its cloud-based products, mobile products and design suites will drive the top line over the long term. | Autodesk's business transition from perpetual licenses to cloud-based services is expected to benefit it in the long run by boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues. Also, in order to boost customers to move from maintenance subscriptions to product subscription, management is offering discounts, which is increasing its subscription base.However, Autodesk's top-line growth over the last couple of years has been negatively impacted by the ongoing business model transition. The continuing movement from perpetual licenses to cloud-based services, as well as migration of maintenance plan customers to subscription plan offerings, has severely hurt revenues. The trend is expected to continue in the near term.Nevertheless, a satisfactory revenue growth of 22% in second-quarter fiscal 2019 and a 24.7% expected revenue growth per the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the ongoing quarter justify this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock's retention in investors' portfolio.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.  , Paycom Software, Inc.  and NetApp, Inc.  , all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

(Symbol: ADSK) saw new options become available this week, for the December 21st expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new December 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $130.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $130.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $122.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $132.18/share today.Because the $130.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $132.18/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $135.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.11% if the stock gets called away at the December 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $135.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Notably, earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time.Earnings acceleration, however, works even better when it comes to boosting the stock price. Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a rally in stock price.Basically, earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company. In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be referred to as earnings acceleration.In case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven't caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

For  (NASDAQ:  ) it's business as usual lately. But for how long will the good times keep up for ADSK stock?Bulls argue that Autodesk is another  (NASDAQ:  ) in the making. ADBE stock is up more than 500% since 2012 on the back of a wildly-successful conversion from a one-time sales to subscription-based business model. If Autodesk can pull the same feat, ADSK stock could run much farther.Bears, on the other hand, argue that Autodesk is taking great risk. In particular, Autodesk's move looks like a cash-grab that could send clients into the arms of competition. Additionally, Autodesk's valuation is getting rather steep. : Autodesk has been in business for more than 30 years now. It has huge mind share in its field. Autodesk partners with institutions such as high schools to educate the next generation on how to use Autodesk in design and construction functions. As such, it seemingly has a huge moat. Professionals rely on Autodesk's products to get work done.However, Autodesk has ruffled a ton of feathers with its move from a licensing model to a subscription model. It has made long-term usage of its software far more expensive. That's obviously great news for shareholders - if customers stick around. But there are plenty of cheaper alternatives to Autodesk. A lot of companies, once their licenses are up for older editions of Autodesk, may defect to competitors' products. Autodesk built up a huge deal of goodwill with its decades of leadership in its niche. It remains to be seen how much of that advantage the company will lose going forward. : Autodesk hasn't notched a full-year positive earnings figure since 2015, when it earned 35 cents per share. In 2016, earnings went into the red. Last year, even free cash flow and EBITDA went negative as well.Now there's an understandable reason for this. The company used to earn fatter one-time sales off its licenses. Going forward, it will rely on subscription revenues to make money. In theory, once enough of the old license users decide that they need the latest version of AutoCAD and upgrade to the subscription model, the company will start generating robust profits again. However, the stock price has gone vertical while profits, EBITDA and cash flow have tanked. ADSK still has a lot more subscriptions to generate before reaching, let alone surpassing, prior levels of profitability. : Even leaving aside the concerns about a lack of profits or cash flow, ADSK stock looks crazy-expensive. It is trading at 15 times sales. The general rule of thumb is that things almost never turn out well if you buy a growth company above 10x sales. ADSK stock is  above that mark.What should come as a particularly troubling sign is that Autodesk isn't a new IPO or early-stage growth company. It has dominated its field for many years. Given this, there is no reason to expect rapid growth once the subscription-based business model conversion ends. Historically, ADSK stock has traded between 3x and 6x sales for many years. It fell to as low as 1.5x sales during the financial crisis. You can say it is worth more now if the subscription model pays off. But to what degree? This is a fairly mature business now. It's hard to justify a 200% or more premium from its price/sales ratio when it was a younger company with more growth potential. : Autodesk created a large number of outraged clients when it forced folks into the subscription model. It's a real threat to the long-term business.But let's not overlook the positives. Autodesk is able to charge more, much more, by making people pay monthly rather than paying for a perpetual license. Some comments I've seen suggest that, to an average small- to mid-size business, Autodesk is effectively charging three times as much per user as it did under the old model. That's a massive boost. : While it is debatable which business model is better over the long-haul, there's one thing that can't be denied: Wall Street loves subscription revenues right now. The market is paying far higher multiples for software and tech companies with recurring revenue rather than one-time sales.Across the industry, in everything from data security to video games, if a company is growing its recurring subscription revenues, it is getting a far higher market multiple. Thus, it's not hard to see why the ADSK stock bear thesis simply isn't working. Autodesk pivoted to an all-subscription model just in time to ride a big wave of momentum higher. Perhaps the company will have to make adjustments to retain clients. Even if so, it now has far easier access to capital to make investments, acquisitions, and the like as necessary. A high share price is currency, and Autodesk's treasury is loaded. : ADSK stock ripped to new all-time highs following its latest quarterly release. It's not hard to see why.For all the concern about the subscription model, management's plans are continuing to pay off. The company's annualized recurring revenue more than doubled, while the company smashed expectations for both the top and bottom line. They also put up favorable forward guidance. For now, momentum is still clearly with Autodesk's bulls.There's a case to be made for ADSK stock as a long-term buy-and-hold. The company's move to a recurring revenue model appears to be paying off in spades. And it appears that Autodesk will soon return to profitability. Once subscription revenues become more entrenched, a larger share buyback or even a dividend wouldn't be surprising.That said, in the short run, ADSK stock is really overbought. Historically, it's hard to find a time when investors have been this excited about Autodesk. The company has been public dating back to 1993, and only in 2003-05 did it make a run similar to what it has done over the past three years. From 2006-on, the stock would go no higher until 2014. That's a troubling precedent. Given that the revenue gains from switching business models are a one-time event, it is unclear what the next huge driver for ADSK stock will be. For short- and intermediate-term traders, ADSK stock looks like a good profit-taking opportunity here.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shares of  (NASDAQ: ADSK) outpaced the market last month, rising 20% compared to a 3% increase in the  , according to data provided by  .The boost extended a significant rally for shareholders, who've seen their stock jump over 40% so far in 2018. data by  .Investors  , which was published in late August.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Medtronic  , EOG Resources  , CSX Corp.  , Analog Devices  and Autodesk  .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Medtronic, EOG Resources and CSX Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Products industry in the last three months, gaining +9.9% vs. +4.3%. Medtronic posted better-than-expected numbers in its first-quarter fiscal 2019.All major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful achievement of synergy targets. The Zacks analyst likes the company's solid growth trend in the United States after adjusting for the divestitures as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies.Also, gradually stabilizing CRHF market holds promise. The company is also focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. Medtronic is highly positive about its foray into the $1 billion standalone CGM market with its Guardian Connect.Yet escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on Medtronic's bottom line. The company's 2019 guidance remains conservative on apprehension of significant currency headwind.(You can  ).Shares of  have gained around +38.7% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Oil & Gas E&P Industry, which has gained +23% over the same period. The company holds premium acreages in the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford shale plays where it has identified 17,000 premium wells that could lend access to almost 11.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves. In the Eagle Ford alone, EOG identified 7,200 locations that will drive the firm's oil production.During 2016 and 2017, almost 50% and 85% of the wells drilled by EOG Resources met the standard of premium wells. Notably, the firm expects almost 90% of the wells to meet the standard in 2018. EOG Resources recently reported strong second-quarter 2018 results, supported by higher oil price realization.However, the Zacks analyst thinks escalating lease and well operating expenses are hurting the company. Also, limited exposure to international resources is a drag.(You can  ).Strong Buy-ranked  's shares have gained +52.4% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry, which has gained +34.6% over the same period. The Zacks analyst thinks CSX is being aided by lower costs under the Precision Scheduled Railroading system.Notably, this system was implemented by the company's former CEO - E. Hunter Harrison - who died December 2017. Designed to improve operational efficiency, the system is being backed by CSX's current CEO Jim Foote. Also, improvement in operating ratio is in tune with the company's cost control efforts.The metric has been steadily declining (lower the value the better) over the past few quarters. Volume growth, efforts to reward shareholders and lower tax rates are added tailwinds. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 9.8% over the last 60 days, reflecting the positivity surrounding the stock. CSX's high debt levels, however, raise concern.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Analog Devices and Autodesk.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

The company recently launched an advanced 3D printing technology - HP Metal Jet - that aids cost-effective high volume manufacturing of production-grade metal parts.The company also launched the Metal Jet Production Service that allows customers to quickly imitate new 3D part designs, produce the final parts and incorporate the HP Metal Jet into their future production plans.HP, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has been gaining traction in the 3D printing market, driven by its innovative and expanding portfolio. In fiscal 2017, the company earned 36% of revenues from its printing business that includes 3D printing solutions.Last year, HP launched Jet Fusion 3D Printing Solution in a bid to establish a stronger presence in this intensely competitive market, dominated by well-established players like Stratasys  , 3D Systems  and Voxeljet  .However, what sets HP's 3D printing solutions apart is the fact that unlike 3D Systems and Stratasys, which target all kinds of consumers, the company is emphasizing only on premium industrial markets.The 3D printing technology is seeing a surge in popularity among major industries. With the robust adoption of the technology among major industries like aviation, healthcare and energy, this business is gaining serious traction, slowly but steadily trickling down to other industries as well.To satisfy premium industrial customers, HP has collaborated with various companies like BMW, Nike and Autodesk  with an aim to develop more advanced 3D printing technologies for a wide array of industrial use.In this regard, HP Metal Jet is an important solution for the company due to rising demand for these kinds of 3D printing systems. Per Wohlers Report, approximately 1,768 metal 3D systems were sold in 2017 compared to 983 systems in 2016, reflecting an increase of nearly 80%.Per Gartner, the global 3D printing market is projected to be worth $17.7 billion by 2020. Top players like Stratasys, 3D Systems and Voxeljet, which already have a stronghold in the 3D printing business, are positioned to benefit immensely from the market's prospects.However, HP is not far behind due to its expanding portfolio. This threatens the dominance of the market leaders. However, aggressive investments by these companies along with partnerships will make it significantly difficult for HP to gain an upper hand, at least in the near term.Stratasys witnessed 4.8% growth in its consumables segment revenues in the last reported quarter. This growth was primarily driven by additional installations of the J700 Dental 3D Printer at dental labs, and strong utilization of installed base of 3D systems. The company also recently announced that its 3D printers will be used by automotive giant Audi. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  . | 3D Systems, which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reported a whopping 41% increase in its printer revenues in the last reported quarter. Notably, printer unit sales surged 37% year over year. The company recently launched an e-commerce site for its new entry-level industrial printers, FabPro 1000. Its continued efforts to stay ahead in the market make it well positioned to take on the new competition thrown in by HP. | However, Voxeljet's top-line growth remained flat on a year-over-year basis. 3D system revenues represented 27.2% of total revenues compared to 37.4% in the year-ago quarter. The company recently launched new speciality materials for its High Speed Sintering line of 3D printers, which is expected to drive growth.

Shares have added about 11.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Autodesk due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Autodesk reported second-quarter fiscal 2019 non-GAAP earnings of 19 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by couple of cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported non-GAAP loss of 11 cents.Revenues of $611.7 million beat the consensus mark and increased nearly 22% year over year. The figure was better than management's guidance of $595-$605 million.Billings of $605 million surged 27% year over year, driven by growth in subscription plan billings, particularly product subscription.Moreover, total deferred revenues increased 20% to $2.21 billion in the quarter, which reflects growing strength of the business model. Total recurring revenues were 96%, a significant increase from 91% reported in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk's business model transition continues to be on track. Subscription revenues (68.8% of revenues) soared 114.5% year over year (111% at constant currency) to $420.6 million, driven by strong growth in subscription plan revenues, well-supported by higher product subscriptions.However, maintenance revenues (27.2% of revenues) declined 36.4% from the year-ago quarter to $166.4 million, primarily due to continued migration of maintenance plan subscriptions to subscription plan.Revenues were also impacted by a 43.7% year-over-year decline in other revenues (4% of revenues), which totaled $24.7 million in the quarter. The decline was primarily attributed to decrease in license revenues.Geographically, revenues from Americas increased 16% from the year-ago quarter to $248 million. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) revenues jumped 25% to $248 million. Asia-Pacific soared 31% to $116 million.Revenues from Emerging Economies jumped 38% year over year to $74 million. Emerging economies accounted for 12% of revenues in the reported quarter.Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) revenues increased 28% year over year to $243 million. AutoCAD Product Family and AutoCAD LT revenues jumped 30% to $177 million.Both Manufacturing, and Media and Entertainment (M&E) segments' revenues grew 10% from the year-ago quarter to $146 million and $42 million, respectively.However, other revenues declined 33% year over year to $4 million.Total annualized recurring revenues (ARR) were $2.35 billion, up 28% from the year-ago quarter, driven by higher product subscription. Core business ARR (combination of maintenance, product, and enterprise business agreement (EBA)) subscriptions were $2.27 billion, up 29% year over year.Cloud business ARR increased 21% to $75 million, which was mostly from BIM 360. Autodesk added 31,000 subscribers in the BIM 360 product line.Subscription plan ARR of $1.68 billion increased 115% year over year, driven by growth in all subscription plan types, primarily supported by product subscription including the maintenance-to-subscription (M2S) program (revenues of $342 million).However, maintenance plan ARR of $666 million declined 36% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the ongoing migration of maintenance plan subscriptions to product subscriptions through the M2S program.Subscription plan subscriptions increased 290K sequentially to 2.86 million in the second quarter. Subscription plan subscriptions benefited from 117K maintenance subscribers that converted to product subscription under the M2S program. Total subscriptions increased 119K sequentially to 3.94 million.Autodesk is also benefiting from its investment in digital infrastructure. The company's e-store generated nearly 20% of products subscription revenues and grew more than 75% in the reported quarter. New customers represented about 25% and contributed a significant portion of subscription additions.Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 310 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 89.8%.Research & development, sales & marketing, and general & administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined 810 bps, 310 bps and 50 bps, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 80.7% from 92.4% reported in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk reported non-GAAP operating income of $55.6 million in the quarter against the year-ago quarter's operating loss of $28.8 million.As of Jul 31, 2018, Autodesk had cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $1.29 billion compared with $1.46 billion as of Apr 30, 2018.Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $1.59 billion.The company generated $43 million of cash flow from operating activities compared with $17 million of cash outflow in the previous quarter.Autodesk repurchased 1.1 million shares for $147 million in the quarter.For third-quarter fiscal 2019, Autodesk expects revenues between $635 million and $645 million. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the range of 24-28 cents per share.For fiscal 2019, management now expects revenues between $2.485 billion and $2.505 billion, which reflect growth of 21-22%. Billings are projected to be in the range of $2.580-$2.640 billion.Autodesk maintained its earlier guidance for subscription additions in the range of 500K and 550K. Total ARR is still expected to be in the range of 28-30%.Non-GAAP spend growth (cost of revenue plus operating expenses) is expected to increase 1-2%. Moreover, non-GAAP earnings are now expected in the range of 87-95 cents per share.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted -25% due to these changes.Currently, Autodesk has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. Notably, Autodesk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: ADSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $156.88, changing hands for $157.20/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 17 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Autodesk Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $64.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $200.00. The standard deviation is $27.363.But the whole reason to look at the  ADSK price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ADSK crossing above that average target price of $156.88/share, investors in ADSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $156.88 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Our strong Q2 results, led by 28% growth in total annualized recurring revenue, not only reflect a healthy demand environment but also continued execution as we move further through our transition to subscription. We also achieved strong results in ARPS, billings, revenue, and earnings. There are several key areas that I want to highlight.We have record growth in total ARR and total ARPS on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. The same goes for core ARR, which grew 29% and core ARPS. Recurring revenue advanced to 96%. We continue to see steady migration of maintenance customers to subscription with the maintenance-to-subscription program, or M2S, and we've bolstered our presence in the construction market with the acquisition of Assemble Systems.First, let's dive into ARR. I'll repeat that we view ARR as the best proxy for measuring our progress and the overall health of our business. I noted last quarter that we expected ARR growth to build as we move through the year and we're absolutely seeing that in the second quarter. The strength in total ARR was once again broad-based with all three major geographies showing growth, with APAC showing the strongest growth.Subscription plan ARR more than doubled for the sixth time in the past seven quarters, driven by growth in all subscription plan types, led by product subscription. We continue to drive impressive growth in product subscription ARR on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Looking at our core business, which represents the combination of maintenance, product subscription, and EBA subscriptions. It's not surprising that core ARR grew in line with total ARR as our core business drives the overwhelming majority of our revenue, ARR and billings growth.Simultaneously, customers continue to engage with our solutions for reimagining construction and manufacturing. That progress is reflected in cloud ARR, which grew more than 20% year over year and 10% sequentially. You have heard me say many times that construction is our key initial focus for becoming a design-and-make company. The market is ready and we have compelling technology and products.The biggest contributor to our cloud ARR is our BIM 360 family of products, our project delivery, and construction management software that connects design and construction. A great example of how BIM 360 is being utilized in the field comes from Webcor, a large U.S.-based general contractor. They are utilizing a range of advanced technology to support an innovative and efficient approach to construction. The company is using Autodesk BIM 360 on the UC Merced 2020 project, which will expand the University of California's Merced campus by over 1.2 million square feet across 14 structures.BIM 360 is enabling Webcor to gain greater efficiency in delivering documentation and coordinated models to the field. They are also using the Forge Platform to integrate and connect project data with BIM data, resulting in a single source of information and enhanced project delivery and performance. We continue to aggressively pursue the $10 billion construction opportunity. And last month, we expanded our product offerings with the acquisition of Assemble Systems, a cloud-based solution offering combined 2D and 3D quantity takeoff for the construction market.Assemble is doing something very unique and was one of the first companies to recognize the power of BIM for preconstruction planning and developed ways to efficiently get information out of the model and into the planning process. They extract the information and make it useful and accessible for contractors to help them with bid management, estimating, project management, scheduling, site management, and finance. They were also an early adopter of our 4D platform. Assemble is a team of about 50 people fairly evenly split between sales and engineering.Their products are used by over 200 companies including one-fourth of the ENR 400 and have been used on more than 7,000 construction projects. Assemble will enhance our market positioning and contribute to making BIM 360 a more comprehensive solution, spanning across the design and construction base. We believe this will be a great fit, both from a product and people perspective. We know them all well at Autodesk through our Forge fund with a lead investor in their Series A round last year.We're also seeing nice progress with the adoption of Fusion in the manufacturing market. An exciting Fusion customer is Fabric, makers of award-winning cycling products. Fabric's mission is to bring innovation to its industry by leveraging unique manufacturing methods. The Fabric team was initially introduced to Fusion by another customer and started using it for the complex industrial design requirements of bicycle saddles and Forge's ability to link the designs directly to manufacturing and 3D printing.Then they expanded their uses of Fusion into design, simulation, and validation. Recently, they have begun using generative design infusion to explore hundreds of practical design alternatives that delivers superior performance and can be manufactured efficiently. They're a great company and they illustrate how manufacturers are innovating with the use of advanced tools like Fusion. Now I'll turn it over to Scott for more details on subscriptions, ARPS, and other financial metrics. -- Thanks, Andrew. Before getting into the Q2 numbers, I want to comment on the terrific progress we've made since we started down this path to transform our model to subscription and cloud back in calendar 2014. We've added over 1.7 million net subscriptions over that time period and it's now been two years since we sold our last perpetual license. The mix of our business has also dramatically shifted as Maintenance now makes up less than 30% of the subs and ARR bases and the new model has allowed us to add a significant number of new customers to Autodesk.We've also migrated over 600,000 maintenance customers to subscription. From a financial standpoint, we're now firmly back in the growth stage. We're back to non-GAAP profitability, positive cash flow and we've transformed our business from less than 40% recurring revenue prior to the start of the transition, to a highly predictable 96% recurring revenue in Q2. We still have some ways to go to achieve the fiscal '20 targets we've laid out and believe the best is yet to come, but it's worth noting the meaningful progress we've made today.Looking at Q2 now, I'll start with a closer look at subscriptions. Subscription plan subs grew by 290,000 in Q2, with growth coming in all three categories: cloud, enterprise and product subscriptions. Core subscription additions were 88,000 and increased 6% sequentially. We added 31,000 net cloud subscriptions, which is a nice step up from the 18,000 we added in Q1.It's important to note that net subscription additions continue to be impacted by product consolidation from the adoption of industry collections. Again, the good news is that many of these customers are increasing their total spend with Autodesk, contributing to solid increases in ARR and ARPS. The adoption of industry collections is happening through the regular run rate of new business, the renewal process, the legacy promo and the M2S program. New subscriptions for industry collections increased 60% year over year and represented 40% of the net product subscription additions in Q2.Industry collections now make up 27% of the total base of product subscriptions, up from 14% in Q2 last year, that's great progress. This is important because industry collections generate higher ARPS and have a much higher renewal rate compared to stand-alone products and it also signals a deeper relationship with the customer as they are able to utilize more of our solutions. Speaking of the M2S program, we continue to make solid progress in migrating our maintenance customers to subscription. In Q2, customers migrated 117,000 maintenance subs to product subs.While that's less than what we've converted over the past two quarters, remember that the pool of maintenance subscriptions gets smaller each passing quarter. The conversion rate remains strong, with over one-third of all maintenance renewal opportunities during Q2 migrating to product subscription. Of those that migrate once again, about 30% of eligible subscriptions upgraded from an individual product to an industry collection. The renewal rate for maintenance declined slightly sequentially as expected.This is consistent with our long-term model, where we've projected a decrease in maintenance renewal rates as we've progressed further into the M2S program. The renewal rate for product subscription experienced another sequential increase and we expect it to continue to rise as the product mix shifts toward higher value products. Helping bolster that renewal rate are the M2S related subscriptions which have a very high renewal rate as expected because the program was designed to be very sticky. To go a little deeper on this topic, when we've first announced the M2S offer, we provide a three-year price outlook to our maintenance customers who converted.As time went on, we heard customer feedback on extending this pricing outlook so they can plan for their long-term business needs and investment in Autodesk solutions. So in June, we announced that we're extending our price commitment to 2028 for customers who continue to renew after they switched to subscription. For these converted customers, the renewal SRP will increase by no more than 5% every other year, starting in calendar 2021, subject to currency movements, of course. This has nothing to do with the adoption of M2S but rather, putting customers at ease regarding their No.1 concern, that Autodesk will significantly increase pricing once they moved to subscription. This action simply puts into writing what we've been verbalizing since we lost the program. The cost-of-living type adjustments would be implemented after the initial three-year price freeze and is consistent with our long-term financial goals. Each quarter, the vast majority of the new subscription plan subs are added through traditional means.However, we continue to make progress in converting legacy users into subscribers. In Q2, the legacy promo added 17,000 product subscriptions and 35% of those were industry collections, which is the highest percentage we've ever achieved for the legacy promotion. Once again, the average age of the licenses that are turned in with the promo is about seven years behind the current release, indicating there's still a very long tail of legacy customers to convert. There continues to be about 2 million of these legacy users that are actively using an old perpetual license without a maintenance plan.We believe that over time, we'll convert a large number of them, utilizing our inside sales teams to concentrate on converting this important cohort. A consistent attribute of the transition is that new customers continue to make up a meaningful proportion of the product subscription additions and represented over 25% of the mix for the quarter. These new customers come from a mix of market expansion, growth in emerging markets, converting unlicensed users and people who have been using an alternate design tool. Now let's talk a little bit more about annualized revenue per subscription or ARPS.ARPS continued to inflect up in Q2. Various pricing changes we've made in the past two quarters have the greatest influence on Q2 ARPS. These have been relatively small adjustments such as the price increase associated with the M2S program, lower channel discount on AutoCAD LT and an increase for multiuser subscriptions. Long-term ARPS drivers will continue to be growing renewal base, which comes at a higher net price to Autodesk; the increase in digital sales, also at a higher net price to Autodesk; the product mix shift to industry collections; the maintenance price increase for those customers who don't take advantage of the M2S program; and less discounting and promotional activity.We expect ARPS to continue to inflect up for all the reasons I've just discussed as we progress through the transition. Our eStore, which is playing a bigger part of our digital sales grew over 75% in Q2. For the past four quarters, our eStore has generated over 20% of the product subscriptions and Q2 also marked the seventh consecutive quarter of greater than 30% growth in our direct to enterprise business. What's interesting is that while the growth of our total direct business accelerated to its highest rate in over two years, growth in the indirect business grew even faster, leaving the mix of indirect business to tick up 1 point to 72% of total revenue.We continue to believe that over time, the mix of direct business will outpace the growth of indirect, leading to a more even split between direct and indirect revenue. Moving to spend management. Our total non-GAAP spend came in at $556 million for the quarter, which is slightly higher than expected. However, if we normalize for ASC 340 and foreign exchange rates, the year-over-year growth in total spend would have been less than 2%.The sequential increase in spend was related to the continued hiring ramp that we've been calling out for the past few quarters as we near the completion of the resource rebalancing we announced in Q4 of last year. Our intent for fiscal '19 remains to keep non-GAAP spend roughly flat at constant currency relative to our fiscal 2018 budget at about $2.2 billion. Looking at the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue grew 20% as reported and 24% under ASC 605.Unbilled deferred revenue decreased by $6 million sequentially to $406 million. It's important to note the impact of ASC 606 here because 606 requires early renewals to be captured in unbilled deferred revenue. Early renewals in Q2 were $20 million lower than in Q1 when some maintenance customers renewed early, ahead of the M2S price increase. So while traditional unbilled deferred revenue related to moving our large EBA customers to annual buildings increased by $14 million sequentially, it was more than offset by early renewals.Looking at cash flow, we returned to positive cash flow as expected in Q2. Operating cash flow was $43 million, which benefited from growth in billings and better-than-expected billings linearity and cash collections. We used $147 million in the quarter to buy back roughly 1.1 million shares at an average price of $131.52. We continue to be committed to managing dilution and reducing shares outstanding over time.Now I'll turn the discussion to our outlook and I'll start by saying that our view of the global economic conditions remains mostly unchanged from the last few quarters, but we're monitoring the potential macroeconomic impact from various trade and tariff disputes. There have been some FX volatility but our hedging program has succeeded in smoothing out the bigger swings. Overall, we're really proud of the results we achieved in Q2 and the first half of the year. As we look at our outlook for Q3 and the second half, we expect to see continuing sequential increases in most metrics, including ARR, ARPS, billings, revenue, spend, earnings and subscription additions.We expect our hiring ramp to continue in the second half as we finish the rebalancing of resources to the most strategic projects. And as such, we expect our spend to increase sequentially and will likely be at the high-end of our guidance range for the full year. Keep in mind, the adoption of ASC 340 capitalizes commissions, so we won't have as big of a step up in spend in Q4 compared to historical trends. I'll also point out the remodeling cash flow could decrease moderately sequentially in Q3 related to the shift in billings linearity that I mentioned earlier, which resulted in more of our Q2 billings being collected in-quarter.We continue to expect a sizable uptick in cash flow in Q4 and that we'll be cash flow positive for the year. And the acquisition of Assemble will not have a material impact on our overall results this year. We are confident in achieving our fiscal '20 goals. That said, subscription additions for this year likely will be at the low-end of our guidance range, primarily related to the success we're having with the adoption of industry collections and the consolidation we're experiencing with the M2S program.And one side note with regard to subscriptions, we will continue to report out on subs and ARPS for the remainder this year but are not planning on reporting those metrics on a quarterly basis starting in Q1 of fiscal '20. Of course, we use events like our Annual Investor Day to report out on important metrics that will help you build out your long-term models. Now I'll turn the call back over to Andrew for a quick closing comment. -- Thanks, Scott. I wanted to note that I've recently completed my first year as Autodesk's CEO. It's been an exciting four quarters and we've made a tremendous amount of progress. The three primary focus areas that I outlined at this time last year have not changed and all are on track, so allow me to remind you what the organization is focused on for driving success.The first is completing the subscription transition. We remain focused not only on the financial results but on enhancing the subscriber experience and delivering more value to our customers, and customers are acknowledging that we're absolutely providing greater value with subscription. Second is digitizing the company. By that, I mean that we are investing in our own digital infrastructure to create opportunities for our customers to transact and engage directly with us, increase their level of self-service for a wide range of customer needs and increase our ability to instantly and reliably understand how successful our customers are being with our products.We've made progress in this area and we've expanded the self-service capabilities in Autodesk accounts, allowing customers to easily manage users, add seats, align billings and take advantage of the flexibility inherent in our subscription model. We've also rolled out a broad set of capabilities that help our inside sales and support teams understand the status of the customers they interact with every day. The third is reimagining construction, manufacturing, and production. You should have no doubt that we are absolutely committed to winning the construction space and winning in the new world of digital manufacturing.We've done well to establish an early leadership position in construction and we're not going to slow down. Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thank you, good evening. Andrew, let me start with you and ask a question regarding the alignment of your sales and distribution model to your product and market strategy in two respects. With respect to the growing intersection of manufacturing that you see through your strategy, can you talk about how you're aligning, particularly the indirect channel to do that? You've typically separated the AEC from the manufacturing specialties and indirect. Would it make sense for you to increasingly combine or converge the channel specialties in that way to be more directly aligned with your product and market strategy that you spoke -- there that you spoke of? And then secondly, with regard to the self-serve model, when would you expect that the eStore could be at least half of the direct business? And then lastly for Scott, your AEC and manufacturing segment revenues were largely in line with our models.So the upside was as it turned out in AutoCAD for the repackaged AutoCAD, would you expect for the remainder of the year that the relatively better growth or upside might occur in this repackaged AutoCAD as compared with the AEC and manufacturing segments? -- OK. So Jay, let me start answering your question by just kind of summarizing how we structure the sales force, because I think it actually talks directly to what you're talking about. So at the beginning of this year, we realigned the sales force along a series of new models. First, what we did is we, of course, maintained and invested a little bit more in our major account team.And as you know, the major account team is basically account-based. So account-based is kind of an industry type model but it focuses on what's most important: The account, which by the way, is the most valuable way to go-to-market with anything, because accounts blend many different things. You know some of our biggest accounts are both AEC customers and manufacturing customers as they have buildings and maybe they design products. The other thing we did is we build out what we call a midmarket team, which is one level below our major account team.This is still a team that fulfills indirectly but it's structured like a named account team in that the reps have a series of accounts assigned to them that they then work with designated channel partners to satisfy. Again, this is the best way to try to scale a business when you see -- because some of our businesses coming together because the accounts are already identified either as manufacturing or construction or architecture accounts or engineering accounts or as holistic AEC accounts. So that model actually allows us to expand the account paradigm deeper into our channel network and actually sort of align the channel on an account based methodology and thinking. The next tier down below from that is what we call territory sales.And the territory sales is essentially split into two, kind of the more generic horizontal part of our business where it's more picked up by ambient demand, there's not specific accounts called out but we do market along specific segments. And what we've done in that area is we've got the bit that's completely driven by channels, the channels are in the lead there and then we've got the digital piece, the piece that encompasses our inside sales teams and our eStore, which can be highly somewhat verticalized just like what we've done with named account sales where a particular inside sales rep might call on just have an e-account or just manufacturing accounts or AEC accounts. We believe that structure combined with some intermediate steps around accelerating opportunities, say, in construction and manufacturing is the right structure going forward, and aligned with some of the constructs we're saying where a lot of things that our customers do are getting closer and closer together. So that answers your first question.The second question, I'll answer this way: our long-term target for our business is half direct, half indirect. We anticipate that, that direct piece is going to be half eStore, half major account direct. Our eStore grew over 70% this quarter year over year. That -- we're posting impressive growth numbers down there.More and more of the LT business is being captured in that channel. And I can't give you a specific number of when that mix becomes 50-50. You can see what the investment is doing, it's driving a lot more growth in that channel and we expect that growth to continue to be robust, especially as it starts to get more and more robust in say, Europe and then APAC first to pick up. There's still lots of room to grow down in that channel.And Scott, I'll turn the last question over to you. -- Sure. Your question on AutoCAD upside. We repackaged all the AutoCAD verticals and AutoCAD together into one AutoCAD. I launched that earlier this year, and the whole goal of that was to make it easier to sell, easier to buy, easier to consume AutoCAD.And so some of the benefit we're seeing is from that for sure, and I think we'll see some of that benefit continue through the year. I think the second is as I think most of you know, we made changes in our channel marketing structure for AutoCAD LT, which also rolls into the AutoCAD family where we reduced the channel margins on AutoCAD LT with the goal of having the channels [Inaudible] focus on selling collections which we see as having quite a nice outcome. Although when you layer in both the acceleration from one AutoCAD and the change in the channel margin on LT, those are the two things that are fueling the growth in the AutoCAD family. -- Thanks very much. -- Thanks, Jay. -- Thank you.Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks, guys, for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. Just have one question for Scott and then a follow-up for Andrew. Scott, obviously, another strong quarter in ARPS here and you laid out a lot of the drivers that we should see over the next multiple years to continue to move that higher. But I was hoping you could give us some color as you're thinking sort of the next few quarters here, how we think about sort of the incremental drivers and ARPS versus what we've seen in the first half of this year.Then to your comment about sort of collections being strong, obviously, a positive to ARPS. Could you also maybe just provide some color on just the impact to the subscription unit number? And then like I said, just one quick follow-up for Andrew. -- Sure, Phil. On the drivers of ARPS, I mean long-term drivers of ARPS are going to be the same ones that we've talked about at Investor Day and that I highlighted in the opening commentary. The growing renewal base, which is higher net to us, the digital sales continues to grow, that's a higher net to us. M2S and M2S both is a long-term driver of growth and also had a significant impact on Q2.As you know, the beginning of Q2, the -- we got into year two of maintenance to subscription which meant the maintenance price indexed up another 10% and the conversion price indexed up 5%. So that's a long-term driver, that's also a specific Q2 driver for us on ARPS and the greater -- or less discounting and promotional activities, so greater net yield to us across the board. The LT channel discount change that we made earlier in the year, we're seeing that now flow through. Obviously, it goes first into deferred revenue, from deferred revenue into the P&L and then X ARPS.That was a benefit to ARPS in Q2. Industry collections continue so we continue to have great success. And 40% of the net product subscriptions added in the quarter were industry collections, which is a high-water mark for us. That's driving ARPS, it is having an offset.To the second part of your question, Phil, it does have an offset to subs obviously, but I think that's a -- in most cases, the customers end up spending more money with us when they make that change from stand-alone products to industry collections. So we drive more ARR and of course, higher ARPS and trade off faster subscriptions growth, I think that's a good trade-off. And then finally, we made a slight price adjustment on our multiuser products. We also saw the benefit of that for the first time really flowing through deferred revenue and into reported results during Q2.So it's a -- it was a lot of things that all moved the right direction on ARPS in Q2. To probably get ahead of your next -- your follow-up on this, when you look at our guidance for the full year, you can see we do expect to see continued ARPS growth in both Q3 and Q4 throughout the year. -- Got it. And then Andrew, obviously, you highlighted the acquisition of Assemble and if I think about just your construction management portfolio as a broad number, so you started on the design side but then you had BIM and then Assemble being able to connect that BIM data into planning systems that you've got. You have planning, construction, and management TAM when you think about the sort of life cycle CMS, so how do you think about how sort of deep Autodesk wants to go onto the CMS side? Because it seems to be you're inching further along kind of that life cycle but still being grounded in the design side, kind of CAD and PLM. -- So long-term, our goal is to capture every aspect of that cycle, all the way from design to preconstruction to site execution on to operation. We're very interested in that whole process and the reason I said this multiple times is because it's moving in the direction that the manufacturing cycle moved in the past. The model is going to become the currency that moves from one aspect of the design process to the next aspect to the make process to ultimately, what you do to retire or manage the asset and make the next asset. So when you think the model is going to be a critical piece of this process moving forward and we intend to manage the flow of that information across the entire process.You're correct in what you said around Assemble Systems. That was a classic move for us to double down on the area of preconstruction where we're trying to help people take BIM data and turn it into actionable information in the preconstruction planning cycle. That's exactly what Assemble does and it helps us basically drive open the opportunity in an area that we feel we're highly competitively advantaged in the space. -- Got it. So CLM, not just PLM? All right, guys. -- [Inaudible] Thanks, Phil.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open. -- Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. First, maybe for you, Scott. Nice job on the billings this quarter. I think clearly, the acceleration in ARR is the main driver but you touched on some other items as well as.So just wondering if you could talk about some other factors there like duration and linearity and how you think about -- how you thought about some of the drivers of billing strength in the quarter. -- Yeah. Thanks, Saket. The duration really didn't have an effect during the quarter on billings. If you look at our weighted average term length of our deferred revenue, in fact, you see on the balance sheet, you see our long-term deferred actually declined again sequentially.So we're not seeing a change in duration that's driving billings. It does get back to a lot of the things that I just talked about in response to Phil's question about the drivers of ARPS. ARPS, the layering on of greater growth of industry collections, some of the changes that we made on channel margins. The growth through the channel, frankly.We had a really strong quarter in direct as you heard in the opening commentary and we actually ticked down 1 percentage point in the percent of direct because the channel grew really strongly during the quarter. So it was a combination of those things, much more so than any kind of one-time benefit that hit billings during the quarter. -- That's very helpful. Andrew, maybe for my follow-up for you. I know we've talked about renewal rates a little bit but I'd like to zoom in a little bit on subscription renewal rates in particular. Now that we've gone through a couple price increases, how -- I guess the question is, how have those trends -- and I think we've touched on it a little bit, but can you recap for us how those have trended and more importantly, how have you thought about those renewal rates for subscription in the long-term model? -- All right, Saket, let me answer that question from a couple of angles. First, one of the things that we watch very, very closely here as we watch the transition, is the maintenance renewal rate in particular, all right? We know that the prices were going to be going up, we modeled in certain changes in maintenance prices -- maintenance renewal rates over time. So we've got a long-term model on what we expect to happen to maintenance renewal rates as the prices ratchet up on maintenance and as the M2S program progresses. What I can tell you right now is those renewal rates are smack dab in line with what we've been modeling and what our goals were with regards to that.Now do the model numbers create the outcome or are we just really modelers and predicting customer behavior? We can debate that, but what we're seeing is behavior that's right in line with what we were remodeling. The same goes from what we're seeing in the product subscription area, the pure product subscription area. We're seeing nice increases in renewal rates, what we expected, what we have built into our models. So I think the important headline here is we're seeing things that are consistent with our expectations.And one of the things that was also very gratifying, and Scott mentioned it earlier in the opening commentary, is the M2S program was designed to be very sticky. It's designed to incent our maintenance customers to come over and feel great coming over. And what we're seeing is really high -- our highest renewal rate for customers that took on the M2S program, which by the way, is an important fact pattern in terms of taking care of our best customers but also making sure we retain that base in the future. -- Very helpful. Thanks, guys. -- Thanks, Saket.And our next question comes from the line of Richard Davis of Canaccord. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks. You know, BIM has been around for -- I mean, I've been hearing people talk about it for at least a decade, but it's doing well. And so, the question I have is so when I talk to some of your customers, some bought it because it was like -- a very few bought it -- there you go -- some bought it because of the digital transformation. Others were more kind of I guess, cold-blooded and saw hard-dollar ROI.So when I kind of think about how markets evolve, is this a market -- and you guys have much more visibility in this than I will. So is this a market that kind of starts with like, a hard dollar ROI sale and then as you kind of get momentum and people say this is like really important, you'll start to get the kind of bigger deals because you'll hear this digital transformation discussion? And this is exactly what we saw with Salesforce, it's what we were seeing with ServiceNow and other industries in the sector. So I guess, I wonder if that's how this market's going to play out. -- Here's how these markets generally play out. There's always a first mover and when you're talking about BIM, I want to distinguish whether or not you're talking about BIM as in the whole -- the discipline of building information modeling or BIM 360 in terms of the construction [Inaudible] we have. What you're seeing is actually true for -- yes, so what you're saying is [Inaudible] but let's just talk specifically about BIM 360. What you're seeing right now in the space is that there is a pressing problem to digitize the site.So the mainstream problem, that's the problem that just about every construction company sees is this idea of I need to digitize my site, I need get model information to the construction site, I need to get up-to-date drawing information of the construction site. There's a lot of load in that segment of the market right now because the technology is ready, the customer is ready, they want it and they need it. That's getting that kind of classic adoption curve that we typically see in any kind of technologies out there. More and more people are buying and now they're starting to ask the questions about, OK so what's the next step? So if I go and I look at some of our more forward-looking customers, especially some of our largest construction and general contractors, they're already looking at OK, I'm able to digitize my site but I want to digitize my entire construction process just like those guys do over in Boeing or Airbus and make the same processes that they have for how I build a building, a road or a bridge.They're experimenting early with this pushing the building information model further and further down into the process, and what you're going to see is this battle for competitive advantage. It's now becoming who can be more digital-first so that they can increase their fidelity on project bids, cut a few hundred million off their bids for a project because they have much more precise information about what the margin is. So it's going to become a digital arms race and that's exactly what starts to happen in classic technology adoption. There's also just word for it, the tornado and you've heard of many different kinds of words.It's been called different things over the ages, but we're starting to see the early signs of basically, a digitization arms race between various people in the construction space, and it's going to play out now. -- Yeah. That's super helpful. Thank you very much. -- OK. Thanks, RIchard.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thank you. So I just wanted to talk a little bit, you guys are obviously well on your way to $6, which was the first target you guys laid out years ago. But as people start to shift the focus to $11 and I know you've touched on this a little bit here, but can you share with us how you're thinking about the contribution from cloud subs? How important are they to getting to that number and how do we think about broader adoption in the construction market, given they've typically been really slow to embrace technology? So I guess I'm wondering, what do you think the industry needs to see to be more open to leveraging technology? Thank you. -- Let me approach this from a couple of directions. So first off, we're definitely committed to our long-term cash flow targets that we put out there in various forms, especially at Investor Day. I want to remind you of something we said at Investor Day because I think it's very important for how we look at the company moving forward. And we look less at the ratios that we've been classically talking about and much more at the sum of revenue growth and free cash flow margin, and trying to optimize that number to provide the right long-term outcome for the company and the right kind of value creation.So just remember as we look forward out beyond FY '20, we're really looking at the sum of those two numbers. Revenue growth and free cash flow margin growth is kind of the ways to look at where we're going moving forward. So we remain completely committed to the free cash flow targets we put out there. Now when you look at the construction market, so I want to challenge something you said.There already is a large increase in technology spending going on in the construction space, all right? And it's not just because of all the VC money that's been invested in the space -- there's actually hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue being generated right now on the site execution problem. So what's changed fundamentally is it's getting harder and harder for these construction companies, especially on large projects, to win without having some kind of digitization in their process. They're simply not able to get the margins and hit the scheduling requirements they have without having tighter control over the data flow. So they've been historically reluctant because the industry as a whole has been historically sloppy.And because the industry as a whole is sloppy, there was no competitive pressure to actually drive technology adoption. But what you're starting to see is types of excellence inside the construction industry where people are adopting -- some of our best customers are becoming very digital and they're highly visionary in terms of how they see the construction industry evolving. That vision and that move toward being highly digital is changing the way people have to compete in this space. So it's been slow in the past because sloppy has been tolerated and everybody was sloppy and they were all equally sloppy.People are getting a lot tighter and that's what's going to change things, Heather, as they move forward. It's basically back to this fundamental thing about as a segment of the market gets more digital, the rest of the segments, right, track into digital by necessity. -- Thank you very much. -- You're welcome. -- Thanks, Heather.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with J.P.Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Hi, guys. So A lot of discussion around BIM, not only on this call but a lot of investor questions leading up to the call. I just want to ask it simply, has the financial results out of your BIM initiatives lived up to your expectations? -- Well, Sterling, we just had 21% growth in cloud ARR this quarter, which is mostly made up of BIM 360. We added 31,000 subs in the BIM 360 space. So we're absolutely seeing results that we want to see in this space. And you also saw us move to make an acquisition around Assemble to try to double down on frankly, what we believe is a highly differentiated part of the process for us around preconstruction.It's an area where our customers are actually saying: well, we're glad you're doing this site digitization stuff but can you do more on preconstruction for us? So we're actually seeing a lot of the things we expected to see, and we're getting increased demand from some of our best customers around areas they want to see us spend more effort on. So I do feel pretty good about where we're going and I feel very good about our prospects. One of the things I want to iterate here too, is, because I said it many times, is it's our goal to be No. 1 in this construction space.We're not looking for No. 2, we're not -- we would never be satisfied with No. 3. We're going to be looking to be No.1 and we're heavily focused on doing everything it takes to become No. 1 in the space. And I think you just want to make sure that you hear kind of our commitment to that and frankly, our passion for that. -- And one follow-up again on the space. If you look at the big customers like the E&C 300, etc., how are they adopting? Are they going with a single vendor and trying to build? Or are they kind of using a couple of different vendors and a couple of different projects to kind of test the waters and then making their decisions and developing from there? -- Yes. So I mean, not [Inaudible] but what you see is they -- the biggest customers, the biggest in the ENR 100 and the top of the GC chain, what they do is they have a combination of vendors they bring in and also, they bring custom-developed solutions on top of what they're doing to fill the gaps between what they see that no vendor is providing. Now, the great news about the fact that they're engaged in some of these custom solution executions is that they're becoming big adopters of Forge. Because Forge lets them stitch together some of our data into some of their flows in ways that we haven't done the work in some of our off-the-shelf products to do that.So everything you just described is exactly what's happening. I will tell you that there's more and more pressure on us to consolidate more and more of the process around the building information model, and we're trying to respond to all of those requests. But the way you described it is multiple vendors involved and custom software coming together at the page you see, that's exactly what happens. -- Got it. Thank you. -- You're welcome.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Hi, this is Hamza Fodderwala in for Keith Weiss. So it seems like the overall ARR growth was strong but the cloud ARR did come in a bit below that of the core business. Is that largely just a result of the tougher year-on-year compares? And do you see any indication of a reacceleration in the second half from the revamped BIM 360 product? -- Yes. Hamza, the cloud business actually accelerated sequentially, right? So we talked about the ARR being at 21% and the number of subs going from 18,000 net adds, right, so it grew in aggregate. 18,000 net adds in Q1 to 31,000 net adds in Q2, so a lot of this is actually -- it's actually performing quite well. You'll remember, this is the last quarter where our year-on-year comparison cloud compare back to a quarter where we were using a lot of kind of seeding strategy, pushing out a lot of high-volume low price BIM 360 team subs out into the marketplace.So on a year-on-year basis maybe is where you're drawing your conclusion. If you look at sequentially how it's moving, it's actually moving quite nicely, and fueled by [Inaudible] sub. It's fueled mostly by the growth of BIM 360. -- And then on the direct business, so I understood the dynamic between the indirect business growing a bit faster but when could you we see a more material pickup there given the sales restructuring that you talked about? Are there any sort of exclusive discounts that you're offering to the eStore to incentivize customers through that channel? -- No, we're not. Hamzah, I don't think it makes sense to do a lot of that. It's a high-class problem to have when you've got the fastest growth rate in our eStore and in our enterprise sales we've had in the last two years and yet the indirect channel's growing faster. So it's not a case that the direct channel is not growing, it's growing really quickly.The indirect channel is just keeping pace at this point. Longer-term, we still believe it settles in closer to a 50-50 blend but frankly, as long as we continue to grow that direct type space, the indirect business keeps pace, that's a good problem to have. -- Got it. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gal Munda with Berenberg Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- This is actually Alex on for Gal. I just wanted to dig a little deeper in the collection upselling. I was wondering which collections do you see selling the best and I was wondering if could you give a quick breakdown on roughly how they're split. And then secondly, just on the 2 million user base that are not currently subscribers, what is the aging profile of that pool? And are you thinking about any more promos to get them to move over? How are you trying to attract them to become paying subscribers? -- So Alex, on your first question, we don't actually provide that level of granularity. As you'd expect, AEC, which is the biggest piece of our overall business, you would expect the AEC collections to be the bigger piece of our total collection business as well, but we don't provide that level of granularity down to the vintage of the collections. The overall good news is collections [Inaudible] rapidly. Your second question on legacy, the 2 million legacy customers, we're making good strides on that, right? The statistic that we gave earlier, 17,000 took advantage of the legacy promotion that we ran during Q2.Andrew also touched on this, though, in his opening commentary. We will continue to go after that space, continue to migrate the legacy customers. We continue to see the average of this scattergram of the licenses they turn in or the legacy customers turn in to take advantage of the promo. We continue to see the midpoint of that bell curve to be seven years old, seven years behind the current version, which means there continues to be a pretty long tail of legacy customers out there.I think what you'll see us do is -- price is only one reason they move and Andrew, you can jump in on a little bit more on this as well. The longer -- the older their license is, their perpetual license is and remember, we sold the last perpetual licenses for stand-alone products more than two years ago. The older it gets, the more it ages out, the harder it is for them to work effectively within their ecosystem. So price is only one lever to get those guys.Just as the licenses age, they will come back and need to update the licenses. So we'll continue to farm that base probably more so with an inside sales touch through our direct sales hubs as opposed to trying to just get them the price discounts. -- Perfect. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moscowitz with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. -- OK. Thank you very much. The core ARR was strong and it was good to see some improvement in cloud subscriptions as well. But Scott, you did mention that you expect net new subs to come in at the lower end of the range for the year.Is that solely because of the headwind on net adds from the M2S consolidation in the back half of the year? And if so, when do you expect that dynamic will significantly subside? -- Yes, it is roughly related to success with collections is what I'd say. Obviously, when maintenance customers consolidate, that turns into a gain in ARR as we've talked about, but a decline in the total number of active subs. We'll continue to feel that headwind through the second half of the year. The other things that will fuel though, the other part of your question, which is what's going to fuel the subs growth in the second half of the year, there's a couple of things inside there.One is, we continue to -we'll continue to see increased productivity from the midmarket channel that Andrew talked about, so this is the field sales team that we put out there that's driving direct touch with customers and that tier of customers below named accounts and selling side-by-side with a partner. We just started that process the beginning of this fiscal year. So they got their accounts assigned February 1. First-ever fiscal year, they've been meeting those accounts, they've been driving opportunities, they've been filling the pipeline.That business will uptick through the second half of the year. The productivity of that channel, now as they -- the longer they're in position will drive that. And the second is just historically, new product subs are higher in the second half of the year than they are in the first half of the year is what will drive that growth in the second half. -- Gregg, with respect to the consolidation on the M2S side, I said last earnings call that we expect that to work its way out the system through second half of this year. And the reason for that is very simple: the accounts that are most likely to consolidate are our largest accounts. They're the ones that actually make the move from M2S earlier in the cycle. So for instance, in the U.S., the conversion rate for M2S is much higher than the average.I mean, they came out of the gate fast and strong and the largest accounts are already really moved in terms of M2S. You're starting to see that phenomenon work itself its way through Europe, the European market, so you're seeing the large accounts start to take the M2S offering and move. And just like with any pattern of anything we roll out in the company, I don't care what program it is, APAC comes up to speed third in that process. And it will start to see as we move toward the end of the year, its large accounts start to move.So what -- and you'll see as these large accounts that move or most likely consolidate, will start to flush out as they move through the second half of the year. So watch for that to happen. As we move through that, we'll see the headwind start to slow down. -- Very helpful. Thanks, guys. -- Thanks, Gregg.Thank you. And next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with R.W. Baird. Your line is now open. -- Just one for Andrew to start. Andrew, I know you won't be held to a number on piracy in terms of convergence there, but you did float last quarter a little bit about some of the initiatives you guys had. And I know, Scott, you just touched on them as well with the midmarket channel but new sales motions. I mean, product messaging, things like that, I was just wondering if you could talk about the progress of some of those initiatives. -- Yes, and it's good, I'm glad you're allowing me to refresh what I said last quarter that there will never be this announcement of some massive non-paying user event that fundamentally changes our trajectory. But you're right, we did roll out in English-speaking countries, a new program that allows us to get more information and more direct engagement with people basically using invalid licenses and software. That program has been integrated with our license compliance teams and with our inside sales teams, so we're actually getting leads through that program and getting into discussions with customers. It's beginning to have an impact on the run rate and will continue to grow.I mean, like with all these programs, they roll out, we start to get traction with them and we start to understand them more and they start to add more and more contribution. I think the great thing about the whole nonpaying user paradigm here is that it's going to be the gift that keeps giving over multiple years, right? These users aren't going away, they continue to use the software, they continue to procure more invalid licenses as time goes on, and we're going to be continuing to reach out with them more and more as we move forward. So look for it just to continue to support the ramp-ups in volume that we have built into our models over the next few years. -- And Scott, I just wanted to make sure. I think you touched on it pretty clearly but just on that like, the change to kind of the subscription contract. So if you could just repeat that, I think what you said was people get the price freeze for three years and then are subject to a sort of cost-of-living adjustment under that. But I just wanted to make sure I had it right. -- Yes. You got it right, Rob. When we first rolled out maintenance subscriptions, if you remember, we gave three years' worth of visibility to what the prices would be for maintenance and what the increases would look like and then what it would be to convert. And for those that converted, we offered a three year -- they didn't have to pay upfront but they got grandfathered with that conversion price for up to three years.What we've added to that now, one of the feedbacks that we got from the channel is, OK, I want to know what's going to happen after that, right, I get that you're going to grandfather me for three years but I'm giving up a perpetual license that I spent a lot of money on and I did exactly what you asked me to do. I kept it current on maintenance for the entire time that I had it. I'm giving that up so I want to understand some sense of what pricing's going to be longer-term. And you've heard us say several times that there would be kind of cost-of-living price adjustments that go into that.What we've done is just formalize that and put out to the channel that there will be kind of an every-other-year 5% price increase, subject to currency changes obviously, but 5% price increase which averages out to kind of a 2.5% annual about the cost-of-living price increase every year for up to 10 years. So that's what we've done on M2S, just to put in writing what we've been saying verbally and of course, what's been built into our modeling also for the entire time. -- Operator, we have time for one more.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Its Kevin Ma on for Brad. I just wanted to ask on fact, the 10-year pricing plan a little bit more. I mean, has that extra assurance helps incremental and to ask [ if that is all ] and how is that pricing compared to that of non-promo subscriptions beyond 2021? -- Yes. So we didn't provide this clarity because of any issues we're having with M2S and the program. As you can see, we have very, very robust conversion rates that are actually ahead of our original models, so we're feeling good about this. We did this communication more to ensure that our sales resources didn't have to have protracted, long, back-and-forth conversations about the implications of moving to M2S.It's an efficiency move for us and it's a visibility move and trust move with regards to our customer base. So it's truly something that we're trying to do to look ahead to the last year and a half of the M2S program, make sure it's highly efficient and make sure our customers basically have no questions, all right? And remember, as we look at the three-year period, there already was a published price increase true-up at the end of the three-year period. All we did was give them visibility to the how the cost of living will play out in years after that. -- Beyond that external pricing... -- Yes, beyond that. Now, your question about promos, are you referring to the legacy promos or... -- Or was it were you asking what's the relative price of this cohort versus the people that come into a net new sub. Because if you recall, when we laid that out, it starts at about a 50% discount for this converted group versus what the price of a new product sub is. So with these cost-of-living price increases, they probably take place on both lines. They'll continue to have an advantage price for some period of time. -- Yes. And just remember, as time goes on, this cohort, this \"M2S\" cohort that moved from maintenance to subscription, it starts to become a fairly small percentage of our total subscriber base. -- With an extremely high renewal rate. -- With an extremely high renewal rate. -- Got it. That makes sense. Thank you. -- Thanks, Kevin.Thank you. And that does conclude today's Q&A session and I'd like to return the call to Mr. Abhey Lamba for any closing remarks. -- Thanks, everybody for joining us. This concludes our call. Please feel free to call us at (415) 547-3502 if you have any questions. Thank you.[Operator signoff]When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Medtronic posted better-than-expected numbers in its first-quarter fiscal 2019.All major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful achievement of synergy targets. The Zacks analyst likes the company's solid growth trend in the United States after adjusting for the divestitures as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies.Also, gradually stabilizing CRHF market holds promise. The company is also focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. Medtronic is highly positive about its foray into the $1 billion standalone CGM market with its Guardian Connect.Yet escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on Medtronic's bottom line. The company's 2019 guidance remains conservative on apprehension of significant currency headwind.(You can  ).Shares of  have gained around +38.7% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Oil & Gas E&P Industry, which has gained +23% over the same period. The company holds premium acreages in the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford shale plays where it has identified 17,000 premium wells that could lend access to almost 11.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves. In the Eagle Ford alone, EOG identified 7,200 locations that will drive the firm's oil production.During 2016 and 2017, almost 50% and 85% of the wells drilled by EOG Resources met the standard of premium wells. Notably, the firm expects almost 90% of the wells to meet the standard in 2018. EOG Resources recently reported strong second-quarter 2018 results, supported by higher oil price realization.However, the Zacks analyst thinks escalating lease and well operating expenses are hurting the company. Also, limited exposure to international resources is a drag.(You can  ).Strong Buy-ranked  's shares have gained +52.4% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry, which has gained +34.6% over the same period. The Zacks analyst thinks CSX is being aided by lower costs under the Precision Scheduled Railroading system.Notably, this system was implemented by the company's former CEO - E. Hunter Harrison - who expired in December 2017. Designed to improve operational efficiency, the system is being backed by CSX's current CEO Jim Foote. Also, improvement in operating ratio is in tune with the company's cost control efforts.The metric has been steadily declining (lower the value the better) over the past few quarters. Volume growth, efforts to reward shareholders and lower tax rates are added tailwinds. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 9.8% over the last 60 days, reflecting the positivity surrounding the stock.

(Symbol: ADSK) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 2019 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new April 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $13.05. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $121.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $136.39/share today.Because the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.67% return on the cash commitment, or 14.70% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.20. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $136.39/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $140.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.06% if the stock gets called away at the April 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $140.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 46%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

It beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 39.84%.Revenues of $559.4 million matched the consensus mark and increased nearly 15.3% year over year.For second-quarter fiscal 2019, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $595-$605 million. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the range of 13-16 cents per share. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings currently stand at $601.3 million and 17 cents.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Autodesk's results are expected to be negatively impacted by lower net subscription addition due to consolidation of subscriptions owing to upgrade to Collections and new packaging for BIM 360.Moreover, an anticipated increase in Autodesk's expenses due to an increase in hiring is expected to hurt profitability.Nevertheless, strength in its core business, which comprises maintenance, product subscription and Enterprise Business Agreement (EBA) subscriptions, is expected to drive Autodesk's top-line growth.Autodesk is gaining from robust growth in product subscription. The company's broad product portfolio continues to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets.The company's growing maintenance to subscription program coupled with increasing adoption of Collections is a tailwind. Further, increasing spend by customers of Collections is leading to an increase in the company's average recurring revenues (ARR) and average revenue per subscription (ARPS).For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARR is $2.28 billion, up 24.7% year over year.Autodesk is also benefiting from its investment in digital infrastructure. The company's e-store generated nearly 20% of products subscription sales in the last reported quarter.Additionally, growing momentum of BIM 360 and Fusion tools is a positive. The BIM 360 product has gained significant traction in recent times. The solution is rapidly replacing legacy document management tools as well as preconstruction planning software.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

This compares to loss of $0.11 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11.76%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this design software company would post earnings of $0.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.06, delivering a surprise of 100%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Autodesk, which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry, posted revenues of $611.70 million for the quarter ended July 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.77%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $501.80 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the .Autodesk shares have added about 30.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7%.While Autodesk has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Autodesk was unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see  .It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.28 on $635.03 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.91 on $2.49 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

That is because the Aug 24, 2018 $135.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an  strategy.Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Autodesk shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Autodesk is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Computer - Software industry that ranks in the Top 21% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 16 cents per share to 17 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Autodesk right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

But the good times quickly fizzled.However, lately there have been signs of life, as a variety of the operators in the industry have experienced rejuvenated growth rates. And, more importantly, the long-term trends look quite favorable for the 3D-printing space.According to  , the spending in the market - on a global basis - is expected to hit about $12 billion this year. And by 2021, the forecast is for the market to reach $20 billion. Much of the growth will come from physical printers and materials, but there will also be opportunities in software systems and services.So with that prospective growth in mind, what are some of the 3D-printing stocks to buy? Let's take a look at seven: (NYSE:  ) is the pioneer of the industry. Chuck Hull founded the company back in 1983 when he invented Stereolithography.Since then, he has continued to push innovation. As a result, DDD has become a diverse platform, with 3D-printers, materials, software and on-demand manufacturing services. These offerings span industries like aerospace, healthcare, automotive and durable goods.Although, a few years ago, DDD had some major problems. Its product line was lagging and the competitive environment was getting much more intense.But the company took swift action and initiated a restructuring. And this was more than just about cost cutting. DDD was smart to double down on its product line as well as to strike some important partnerships.As a result, the financial situation has improved significantly. For example, during the latest quarter, printer shipment  . Keep in mind that this should amplify future revenue growth because this business leads to annuity streams from material sales. (NYSE:  ) may seem like a dinosaur among other 3D-printing stocks to buy. After all, much of the company's business comes from mature industries like PCs and office/home printers.But somehow HP has been able to gin up growth. In the most recent quarter, revenues  by 13% to $14 billion and operating cash flows came to $1.05 billion.On the PC side, HP has benefited from consolidation in the industry and also a focus on higher-end systems (such as gaming PCs). As for printing, the company is investing aggressively in 3D technologies.Granted, for a company of the scale of HP, it will take time for the business to move the needle. But the company should benefit from its brand and distribution. Besides, HP has been getting traction with snagging large customers and partners, such as Siemens and Forecast 3D (one of the largest 3D manufacturers in the U.S.).According to HP CEO Dion Weisler on the most recent  :\"I am really excited about the leadership position we have taken in 3D printing and the segment where we operate in a very short period of time, we are on the path towards disrupting this $12 trillion global manufacturing industry. But it's a long path, I have always said this is a 5 to 10-year journey and we are making the investments today to really secure shareholder value both today and for the future we are seeing significant sales momentum, including repeat orders from customers as well as service bureaus.\"Clearly, HP is starting to become a standout among other 3D-printing stocks. (NASDAQ:  ) is the leader in design software, which has applications across large industries like architecture, engineering, construction, product design, manufacturing and media/entertainment. For the most part, ADSK software helps with complex visualizations and simulations.So what makes ADSK one of the 3D-printing stocks to buy? 3D-printing is actually an important part of its business.The company has built an extensive line of applications like Netfabb, TinkerCAD, 3ds Max, Within Medical and Fusion 360. These applications are becoming strategic for customers. Just look at  (NYSE:  ). The company recently teamed up with ADSK to use its design systems to 3D-print components for its upcoming electric vehicles. This approach should mean lighter materials that have higher levels of strength.ADSK has also been moving toward subscriptions for selling its software, which should lead to more predictable revenues streams. In the latest quarter, these revenues spiked by  (on an annualized basis) and the subscriber base reached 2.57 million. (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the leaders in the 3D-printing industry. However, the company does not sell any physical printers. Instead, the focus is on building software systems, such as systems for additive manufacturing and healthcare applications.For example, with its medical technologies, there is the ability to create surgical guides and develop customized implants. And as for manufacturing, MTLS has one of the largest single-site additive service centers.A key part of the growth strategy has been partnerships. Some of the latest have included deals with HP and  .However, the relationship with  (OTCMKTS:  ) - a top chemical company - could prove the most beneficial. The company invested  in MTLS. For the most part, this deal is a validation of the company's business model, which is about creating an open system that integrates with many hardware and software vendors.The customers for  (NYSE:  ) conduct much of their activities online, which is a big time saver. Some of these functions include injection molding, computer numerical control machining, 3D-printing and sheet metal fabrication. And PRLB is the world's largest digital manufacturer of custom prototypes and on-demand production parts.Investors have plenty of reason to be excited about this 3D priting stock, as the growth has been strong. For the second quarter, revenues shot up by 34% to $109.7 million and operating cash flows came to $33.2 million. In all, there is $144.9 million in the bank.PRLB is essentially creating a powerful ecosystem, which is a nice barrier to entry. Note that there are over  that use the web-based system. This base up by nearly 19% in the latest quarter. As such, PRLB is one of the most promising 3D-printing stocks to keep an eye on in the months ahead. (NASDAQ:  ) targets a variety of lucrative business segments, such as the Industrial Internet of Things, Augmented Reality, Product Lifecycle Management and Service Lifecycle Management.And to top it all off, PTC also has a significant footprint in the 3D-printing market. The two main products are Creo (for product design) and Mathcad (for in-depth analysis for engineering projects). The bookings for this business segment have been robust, as there have been 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit-growth.The core product for the 3D-printing opportunity is Creo 5, which launched in March. The technology stands out because of its sophisticated integrated topology optimization.But there is more to come with Creo. PTC has entered a  with  (NASDAQ:  ), which is a developer of engineering simulation software. The plan is to integrate real-time simulations into Creo, which would likely be another factor in helping boost demand.If you don't want to invest in individual 3D-printing stocks, there is another option:  (BATS:  ).This exchange-traded fund tracks the Total 3D-Printing Index, which includes U.S. and foreign companies based in hardware, software/CAD, print center operations and materials. Some of the holdings include ADSK, Trimble and  (NASDAQ:  ).The median market cap for this ETF is $8.2 billion. In other words, PRNT provides fairly broad exposure to the market. And as for its expense ratio, it is at 0.66%, or $66 annually per $10,000 invested.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new September 28th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $134.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $134.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $130.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $136.50/share today.Because the $134.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

It doesn't make many products that would ever make their way into consumers' hands, but it does make indispensable tools for dozens of industries, from architecture to injection molding.This is one case of a software company that I think has a built-in competitive advantage that will be  upend  .Image source: Getty Images.When I first started drawing CAD designs two decades ago, AutoCAD was the standard for the industry. Nothing has changed in the years since, and Autodesk has expanded its market very successfully. It's clearly a standard in architecture and related construction businesses, but it's also serving designers building plastic and metal parts.The fact that Autodesk products are standard in industries that use CAD is incredibly powerful. From the time students start engineering or architecture school they're learning on Autodesk products. When they get into the professional world, knowing AutoCAD, or another Autodesk product, is often required.Autodesk's standardization makes the switching costs to competitors very high for companies. Training staff on a new product would incur costs and difficulties, and the result may not communicate well with other vendors.When the most valuable part of the value chain uses a standard product, as is the case with CAD, it becomes standard up and down the value chain. Take construction as a great example. Architects normally use AutoCAD, which means equipment vendors that want their products included in a design will end up using AutoCAD. Partners like mechanical, plumbing, and electrical contractors downstream from the architect will also end up using AutoCAD so they can seamlessly cooperate with the head designer.The mechanical design of goods is moving in the same direction, although consolidation has taken longer because there were dozens of disparate software programs for different functions. That's changing as Autodesk consolidates capabilities like injection molding modeling (Moldflow), machining (Powermill), and stress simulations (Nastran).The result of all this consolidation and standardization is that an entire industry will end up using a single software platform. Now if one company switches to new software it will leave them as an outlier, rather than give them a competitive advantage. Standardization is a good thing for industries that communicate in CAD, and that works to Autodesk's advantage.By most traditional metrics Autodesk is very expensive. Shares trade at a whopping 14 times sales and 149 times fiscal 2019 earnings expectations.But the company's  will ensure continual revenue and cash flow, rather than allowing companies to skip a software update to save money. Management expects to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow in 2020, which puts the company's $29.3 billion market cap at 21 times expected 2020 free cash flow. I don't think that's a bad valuation considering the company's lock-in in key markets and potential upside.Management estimates Autodesk's design and manufacturing addressable market will grow to $27 billion total by 2020, so there's a lot of room for growth. The stock may be up a lot in the last year, but I think Autodesk still has a lot of runway left for investors long-term.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Although the details of the transaction were not disclosed, it's likely to be a mixture of cash and stock. Notably, Autodesk was a leading investor in Assemble's Series A funding in 2017.Assemble's software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform focuses on Building Information Modelling or BIM, in which Autodesk has keen interest. The platform provides 3D models, 2D drawings and other relevant construction related data.Autodesk will integrate Assemble in its BIM project management platform named BIM 360. The deal not only strengthens the company's product portfolio but also its customer base. Assemble boasts a strong clientele (174 unique customers) across 1,000 sites, working on 12,700 projects.Moreover, the deal will help Autodesk become a significant provider of automation software in the preconstruction phase of a project. The rapid adoption of automation is expected to lead to better project management that bodes well for the overall construction industry. Autodesk is well positioned to benefit from this trend. | The BIM 360 product has gained significant traction in recent times. The solution is rapidly replacing legacy document management tools as well as preconstruction planning software.In fact, Autodesk expects BIM 360 to encompass the entire construction process from start to finish over the next five years.The strong adoption is expected to boost top-line growth. In the last reported quarter, revenues increased 15.3% year over year to $559.4 million.For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $595-$605 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $600.7 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 19.7%.However, net subscription addition will continue to get impacted due to consolidation of subscriptions, owing to upgrade to Collections and new packaging for BIM 360.Nevertheless, Autodesk is benefiting from solid growth in product subscriptions and surging maintenance-to-subscription program. In fact, continuing investments in digital infrastructure like e-store and EBA programs are positive.Currently, Autodesk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Adobe  , Verint  and Intuit  are stocks worth considering in the same sector. While Adobe and Verint sport Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Intuit has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Long term earnings growth rate for Adobe, Verint and Intuit is currently pegged at 16.2%, 10% and 16.2%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based engineering simulation software company was upgraded on improving productivity and profits. However, after massive amounts of growth over the last 18 months, this upgrade is too late to benefit new Ansys stock investors.To be sure, the company may finally be coming into its own 48 years after its founding. Ansys specializes in finite element analysis software. This software simulates several engineering-related factors related to product development. This helps to determine how products will function under varied conditions. It also allows firms to test products before incurring higher expenses.Through this technology, it has developed a moat that allows it to compete with the likes of  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) or  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ).Goldman analyst Gabriela Borges cited this fact in defense of her upgrade. She also mentioned improved product positioning, the potential for higher margins, and a positive outlook based on a critical partnership and improving opportunities.One move that has improved this outlook is its partnership with  (NASDAQ:  ). The two firms partnered to develop PTC's Creo 3D CAD software. This utilizes PTC's CAD technology with Ansys Discovery Live real-time simulation. It also allows design engineers to improve the quality of their products while reducing development costs.This partnership should improve the bottom line. Still, the profit picture has already begun to show improvement. After years of stagnant revenue and profit levels, Ansys stock appears poised to grow both revenues and profits. The company saw earnings of $4.01 per share in 2017. Analysts forecast profits of $4.92 per share in 2018 and $5.42 per share the year after.Unfortunately for new investors, the market has likely priced these factors into the stock. Goldman mentioned the high valuation in its report, and they upgraded the stock despite a higher price-to-earnings () ratio.No doubt Ansys enjoys a clear vision and presents a competitive threat to Autodesk and other peers. However, as I mentioned in a  about Autodesk, its quarterly losses did not create a buying opportunity in the stock.Ansys finds itself in a similar situation. Despite low levels of profit growth in recent years, Ansys stock moved steadily higher. It has almost doubled in value since the beginning of 2017.As a result, the current PE for ANSS stock stands above 50, and it trades around 37.5 times earnings on a forward basis. Wall Street expects profit growth of about 22.5% this year and just over 10% next year. At current prices, the price-to-earnings-to-growth () ratio comes in at 1.66 on a forward basis, and over two when measured against current metrics.Judging by both a PE and a PEG basis, Ansys stock appears expensive. Ansys has become a costly stock precisely because of its value proposition and product lines. This will serve both its customers and ultimately their customer's customers well. However, it leaves little room for new investors to profit.Although Ansys appears poised to resume profit growth, valuations have likely moved ahead of its profits. The stock has risen recently on an upgrade from Goldman Sachs.Goldman cited an improving moat as well as increased profits and productivity in its upgrade. While I agree with the factors that led to the upgrade, I find the valuation expensive at these levels. I believe Ansys could profit new investors if it falls to a lower price. Still, at its current PE ratio, investors will likely find higher returns in other equities.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n afternoon trading on Thursday, Technology & Communications stocks are the best performing sector, up 1.6%.

If you look carefully, there are some serious bargains to be made. Don't have a wish list? No worries! Here I dive into five top stocks to buy that are all trading on the cheap right now.As you will see, I use  to ensure that all these stocks boast a \"Strong Buy\" Street consensus rating and big upside potential. So you don't just have to take my word for it. I use the latest reports from top analysts to dive into the outlook on these five top stocks to buy.On Monday, the  closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 2016. The catalyst? A further round of trade war fears - particularly for the tech sector. President Trump has threatened to slap $200 billion of tariffs on Chinese imports arriving in the U.S.\"The market is trading more on sentiment than fundamentals lately, which means moves are likely to be fickle and short lived,\" commented senior BNY Mellon strategist Liz Young. \"We feel that while momentum around trade is escalating, we're still in a place where it's in every nation's best interest to avoid that outcome, and that things could calm down as negotiations progress.\" Plus: \"the economy is still strong, data is moving in the right direction, and we don't see this as the issue that will turn things around.\"So with this bullish analysis in mind, let's take a closer look at these five stocks to buy now:Even internet king  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) has not escaped the current market jitters. GOOGL is currently trading lower (3.9% down in the last week). This is despite numerous bullish analyst calls. For example, five-star Monness analyst  recently reiterated his GOOGL Buy rating. This comes with a $1,306 price target (15% upside potential).White reminds investors that the three \"Big Bet\" areas for Alphabet include YouTube, Google Cloud and hardware. In May, for example, YouTube highlighted that over 1.8 billion logged-in users watched YouTube content each month. And now YouTube has received a powerful upgrade.Google's latest innovation is a new YouTube music streaming service. This should \"further \u2026 [expand] the capabilities and reach of the YouTube franchise,\" cheers White. \"For Alphabet, we believe this new service will improve the company's digital ecosystem and the stock is attractive at just 18x our CY:19 EPS projection (ex-cash).\"The ad-supported version of YouTube Music will be free while YouTube Music Premium (i.e., ad-free, the ability to download, background listening, etc.) will cost $9.99 per month. Moreover, Google Play Music subscribers ($9.99 a month also) will also receive YouTube Music Premium as part of their current package. So far, the initial launch encompasses U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and South Korea.GOOGL scores a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. In the last three months this breaks down into 22 buy ratings vs. just three hold ratings. Meanwhile, the $1,261 average analyst price target works out at 11% upside from current levels.Red-hot chip stock  (NASDAQ:  ) is trading down over 7.9% on a one-week basis. Indeed, the company plunged 7% on June 25. So now is prime time to step in to a long-term success story. Bear in mind that on a one-year basis the stock is up 68%.Five-star Benchmark capital analyst  has just initiated Micron with a Buy rating. He sees the stock spiking 50% to $80.\"We believe MU has progressed from a 'cash burn' to a 'cash return' story in only two years, and we expect the stock to remain a cyclical growth name, generating increasing profits and cash flow on each respective high and low of the memory cycle,\" Burton wrote.He isn't concerned about memory demand peaking. On the contrary: \"We see little evidence of a supply glut in MU's DRAM business heading into 2H18 (or until significant wafers are added due to structural tightness), and we are encouraged that its product roadmap extends another 4 generations to 1\u03b2.\"Most notably, Burton sees Micron as the clear leader when it comes to the 64-layer 3D NAND. This is a shift from Micron's previous 3D NAND position as a cost and market share laggard.Overall, MU - a Strong Buy stock - boasts 17 buy ratings vs. four hold ratings. The average share price of these analysts works out at $82.80 (56% upside potential). (NYSE:  ) has shed 2.5% from its share price over the last week. Agilent Tech develops devices for six key markets, from lab tools for doctors to chemical monitoring solutions for energy stocks. On a three-month basis the stock is down 7.5%. Even pre-correction, Agilent made a compelling investing proposition. But now, the stock has the added attraction of trading on the cheap.Indeed, our data shows that A has 100% Street support right now with four recent buy ratings. Plus the average analyst price target of $83 translates into big upside potential of 35%. These analysts explicitly call out the recent weakness as a buying opportunity.One of these analysts is Baird's  . She has just attended Agilent's analyst day and left the meeting with her bullish take on the stock confirmed. According to Ramsey, strong core growth and margin expansion will ensure long-term, above market performance. She has a $77 price target (26% upside potential) on A.Meanwhile, five-star analyst  notes that shares have been weak since Agilent's earnings reports. However, guidance was maintained and the Jefferies' analyst leaves his positive thesis intact. Like Ramsay, Couillard sees the pullback as a buying opportunity.Plus Couillard adds that the shares don't reflect the upcoming accretion from the pending AATI deal. Agilent snapped up genomics analyzer AATI back in March for a cool $250 million. (NASDAQ:  ) has slipped recently- on a one-week basis the stock is down 3%. So now is the time to jump in! Following on from PYPL's largest-ever deal (for Swedish-based startup iZettle), it seems PayPal has developed a taste for dealmaking. The payments giant has just agreed to acquire Hyperwallet for $400 million as well as fraud prevention platform Simility for $120 million.Top-rated Cantor Fitzgerald analyst  gives the deals his seal of approval. \"The [Hyperwallet] acquisition will increase PYPL's ability to provide payment and e-commerce solutions to marketplaces around the world.\" This is because \"Hyperwallet provides an entrance into more than 200 markets worldwide and a multi-currency payment platform that allows for many disbursement options.\"He has a Buy rating and $93 price target on PayPal. And while this may suggest a higher multiple than PYPL's peers, Foresi is confident that PayPal deserves the extra credit: \"We value PYPL at a premium to the peer group, as it is growing about twice as fast as the industry's average growth rate of high single digits and has expansion opportunities, in our opinion.\"Overall, as a Strong Buy stock, PayPal has received 17 buy ratings vs. only 4 hold ratings in the last three months. These ratings come with a $89 price target (9% upside potential). Plus you should note that top Wedbush analyst  recently added PayPal to the firm's elite \"Best Ideas\" list. His $100 price target indicates 22% upside potential.This isn't the first time I've covered  (NASDAQ:  ), and it's unlikely to be the last. Autodesk is a 3D design company that operates in multiple industries. ADSK tech is used in every industry from construction to architecture to filmmaking. On a one-week basis, the stock is currently tracking down by 7.7%. Nonetheless, ADSK is still up by an impressive 23% year-to-date.Top Oppenheimer analyst  has just reiterated his ADSK Buy rating. He selects Autodesk as a Top Pick for June-July. \"We believe the business is well positioned in a large but lightly penetrated construction industry that is yearning for next-generation technologies, like Autodesk's, to help digitize the industry, which should act as a pillar for Autodesk's next leg of growth beyond FY2020\" writes Ikeda.He notes that Autodesk reported good F1Q results with F1Q total revenue of $560M (+15% y/y, +18% ASC 605) coming in ~$2M above the consensus estimate.In total, ADSK has unanimous Street support right now.

We used  to assess the outlook on these stocks, which are averaging 19% returns year-to-date, from the Street's best analysts. By pinpointing stocks with a bullish outlook from top-performing analysts, we can be confident that these stocks are primed for success.Market value: $98.9 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $147.74 (9% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Salesforce.com (  , $135.55) describes itself as the \"world's No. 1 enterprise cloud platform.\" It's certainly among the top performers in the cloud-stock space.This Goldman Sachs VIP hedge fund stock pick is trading up 28% year-to-date. Big fund managers heavily invested in CRM include Frank Sands, founder of the massive growth investment fund Sands Capital Management.If you are considering following Sands' lead, note that Salesforce currently boasts a \"Strong Buy\" Street consensus. In the past three months, CRM has received 25 buy-equivalent ratings and only two holds. One of the stock's biggest cheerleaders is five-star Monness analyst Brian White (  ). He has just bumped up his price target to $158 (18% potential) from $152 previously. The stock's growth momentum in the cloud means it deserves a premium valuation, White argues.Indeed, Salesforce has just reported strong first-quarter results for its fiscal 2019 and raised its full-year revenue outlook. The company posted revenues of $3 billion (up 25% YoY) and earnings of 74 cents per share. \"The tone of the (earnings) call was positive with Salesforce winning the largest transaction in the company's history\" White says.Most excitingly, on the AI front, CRM's \"smart\" customer success platform Einstein is expanding very quickly. The platform is now providing nearly 2 billion predictions each day - double the previous quarter.\"Given Salesforce's leadership position in the SaaS market with an expanding portfolio in the midst of a strong secular trend around the cloud, combined with a history of strong growth and a predictable subscription-based model, we believe investors will drive Salesforce's valuation higher than historical averages,\" White writes.Market value: $99.2 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $88.47 (4% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Shares in top hedge fund pick PayPal (  , $85.21) have exploded by a whopping 13% year-to-date, and by 55% over the past year. The stock's surge is being fueled by increasing adoption of digital payment systems to conduct transactions, but there are a few more catalysts on the horizon.The online payment giant has announced that it is snapping up iZettle for a cool $2.2 billion - a deal that should close in the third quarter of 2018. IZettle is a Swedish startup that concentrates on providing payment solutions tools and analysis to small businesses, and often is referred to as the \"Square of Europe.\" The deal substantially expands PayPal's reach on a global scale.\"In today's digital world, consumers want to be able to buy when, where and how they want,\" PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said in a release. \"With nearly half a million merchants on their platform, Jacob de Geer and his team add best-in-class capabilities and talent that will expand PayPal's market opportunity to be a global one-stop solution for omnichannel commerce.\"This could have a knock-on effect on U.S. mobile payments rival Square. According to Morgan Stanley's James Faucette (  ) the tie-up is \"likely to be a check\" on Square's international ambitions. He highlights the U.K., Japan, Canada and Australia as countries that will now be particularly \"challenging\" for Square to crack.Meanwhile, top-rated Oppenheimer analyst Glenn Greene (  ) feels more confident in PayPal's long-term outlook post-deal. He writes: \"Encouragingly, some of our concerns about PYPL's long-term competitive positioning within the payment processing ecosystem have been allayed by recent partnerships. We anticipate high-teens revenue growth and >20% EPS growth for the next several years.\" The five-star analyst boosted his price target from $85 to $90.Market value: $29.4 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $157.73 (14% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Autodesk (  , $137.93) is a leader in 3D design, engineering and entertainment software. The company basically develops software for people who make things - this runs the gamut from architecture to manufacturing, construction, media and entertainment. As a result, ADSK is now in prime position to benefit from the digitization of industries such as construction.Hedge funds clearly are impressed by the stock's growth potential. The Goldman Sachs report reveals that this 3D specialist is a top-10 holding for 24 hedge funds. They've benefitted from a 28% pop in shares year-to-date.Autodesk recently reported strong results for fiscal Q1 with key metrics trending positively. Top Oppenheimer analyst Koji Ikeda (  ) sees the results as evidence of the company's successful ongoing transition to a subscription-based model.\"We believe the key to subscription model transitions is entrenchment and the ability to maintain price, which Autodesk is clearly demonstrating\" Ikeda writes. \"We are attracted to Autodesk's dominant market positioning, rapid innovation, and strong execution.\"Ikeda reiterated his \"Buy\" rating on ADSK with a $150 price target on May 25. The Street is even more bullish, with an average analyst price target of roughly $157.Market value: $522.7 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $250.00 (20% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (  , $208.30) is not just a top-10 holding for 45 hedge funds, but also a major holding in numerous international mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The stock has already delivered a 17% gain this year, and Wall Street sees plenty of growth potential left.In fact, BABA shares currently enjoy unanimous support among the TipRanks-polled analysts covering the stock, including 14 buy ratings in the past three months alone.Five-star Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler (  ) recently bumped up his BABA price target from $250 to $300, representing 44% upside potential. Alibaba is working hard to increase monetization from consumers and businesses, and these initiatives encourage Kessler.\"We believe Alibaba has multiple take rate levers including increased personalization and targeting, increasing ad load, increased competition for ad slots, additional inventory expansion, as well as increases in commission rates on Tmall,\" he writes.Alibaba itself certainly seems secure that these new methods will pay off. \"Recent management commentary and robust FY19 guidance suggests confidence in continued monetization levers\" Kessler says.Kessler is a long-time fan of the stock, which he calls the \"biggest winner\" of China's booming e-commerce industry. China boasts more than 730 million internet users right now, and that number still is rising rapidly thanks to an explosion in the country's middle class.Market value: $780.9 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $113.71 (11% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Goldman Sachs also has highlighted software king Microsoft (  , $102.49) as a top hedge fund stock.

Indeed, the latest filings show that hedge funds held a total of 363 million MSFT shares in Q1, up 7.5% from the previous quarter.No doubt these fund managers are cheering Microsoft's latest acquisition of code-hosting and collaboration site GitHub for a mind-blowing $7.5 billion. This is the company's most pricy purchase since buying LinkedIn two years ago for $26.2 billion. GitHub gives Microsoft valuable access to 85 million code repositories, developed by more than 28 million contributors including over 1,000 Microsoft employees.\"We will accelerate enterprise developers' use of GitHub, with our direct sales and partner channels and access to Microsoft's global cloud infrastructure and services,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at the time.The deal has received a collective thumbs-up from the Street. Piper Jaffray's Alex Zukin (  ) has described the move as \"highly positive.\" He sees it is a savvy strategic advance that will give Microsoft an edge when it comes to designing next-generation applications. Plus there are potentially big synergies with Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes (PBP) units, which include Office and LinkedIn.Harriet Lefton is head of content at TipRanks, a comprehensive investing tool that tracks more than 4,700 Wall Street analysts as well as hedge funds and insiders.

So you don't just have to take my word for it. I use the latest reports from top analysts to dive into the outlook on these five top stocks to buy.On Monday, the  closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 2016. The catalyst? A further round of trade war fears - particularly for the tech sector. President Trump has threatened to slap $200 billion of tariffs on Chinese imports arriving in the U.S.\"The market is trading more on sentiment than fundamentals lately, which means moves are likely to be fickle and short lived,\" commented senior BNY Mellon strategist Liz Young. \"We feel that while momentum around trade is escalating, we're still in a place where it's in every nation's best interest to avoid that outcome, and that things could calm down as negotiations progress.\" Plus: \"the economy is still strong, data is moving in the right direction, and we don't see this as the issue that will turn things around.\"So with this bullish analysis in mind, let's take a closer look at these five stocks to buy now:Even internet king  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) has not escaped the current market jitters. GOOGL is currently trading lower (3.9% down in the last week). This is despite numerous bullish analyst calls. For example, five-star Monness analyst  recently reiterated his GOOGL Buy rating. This comes with a $1,306 price target (15% upside potential).White reminds investors that the three \"Big Bet\" areas for Alphabet include YouTube, Google Cloud and hardware. In May, for example, YouTube highlighted that over 1.8 billion logged-in users watched YouTube content each month. And now YouTube has received a powerful upgrade.Google's latest innovation is a new YouTube music streaming service. This should \"further \u2026 [expand] the capabilities and reach of the YouTube franchise,\" cheers White. \"For Alphabet, we believe this new service will improve the company's digital ecosystem and the stock is attractive at just 18x our CY:19 EPS projection (ex-cash).\"The ad-supported version of YouTube Music will be free while YouTube Music Premium (i.e., ad-free, the ability to download, background listening, etc.) will cost $9.99 per month. Moreover, Google Play Music subscribers ($9.99 a month also) will also receive YouTube Music Premium as part of their current package. So far, the initial launch encompasses U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and South Korea.GOOGL scores a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. In the last three months this breaks down into 22 buy ratings vs. just three hold ratings. Meanwhile, the $1,261 average analyst price target works out at 11% upside from current levels.Red-hot chip stock  (NASDAQ:  ) is trading down over 7.9% on a one-week basis. Indeed, the company plunged 7% on June 25. So now is prime time to step in to a long-term success story. Bear in mind that on a one-year basis the stock is up 68%.Five-star Benchmark capital analyst  has just initiated Micron with a Buy rating. He sees the stock spiking 50% to $80.\"We believe MU has progressed from a 'cash burn' to a 'cash return' story in only two years, and we expect the stock to remain a cyclical growth name, generating increasing profits and cash flow on each respective high and low of the memory cycle,\" Burton wrote.He isn't concerned about memory demand peaking. On the contrary: \"We see little evidence of a supply glut in MU's DRAM business heading into 2H18 (or until significant wafers are added due to structural tightness), and we are encouraged that its product roadmap extends another 4 generations to 1\u03b2.\"Most notably, Burton sees Micron as the clear leader when it comes to the 64-layer 3D NAND. This is a shift from Micron's previous 3D NAND position as a cost and market share laggard.Overall, MU - a Strong Buy stock - boasts 17 buy ratings vs. four hold ratings. The average share price of these analysts works out at $82.80 (56% upside potential). (NYSE:  ) has shed 2.5% from its share price over the last week. Agilent Tech develops devices for six key markets, from lab tools for doctors to chemical monitoring solutions for energy stocks. On a three-month basis the stock is down 7.5%. Even pre-correction, Agilent made a compelling investing proposition. But now, the stock has the added attraction of trading on the cheap.Indeed, our data shows that A has 100% Street support right now with four recent buy ratings. Plus the average analyst price target of $83 translates into big upside potential of 35%. These analysts explicitly call out the recent weakness as a buying opportunity.One of these analysts is Baird's  . She has just attended Agilent's analyst day and left the meeting with her bullish take on the stock confirmed. According to Ramsey, strong core growth and margin expansion will ensure long-term, above market performance. She has a $77 price target (26% upside potential) on A.Meanwhile, five-star analyst  notes that shares have been weak since Agilent's earnings reports. However, guidance was maintained and the Jefferies' analyst leaves his positive thesis intact. Like Ramsay, Couillard sees the pullback as a buying opportunity.Plus Couillard adds that the shares don't reflect the upcoming accretion from the pending AATI deal. Agilent snapped up genomics analyzer AATI back in March for a cool $250 million. (NASDAQ:  ) has slipped recently- on a one-week basis the stock is down 3%. So now is the time to jump in! Following on from PYPL's largest-ever deal (for Swedish-based startup iZettle), it seems PayPal has developed a taste for dealmaking. The payments giant has just agreed to acquire Hyperwallet for $400 million as well as fraud prevention platform Simility for $120 million.Top-rated Cantor Fitzgerald analyst  gives the deals his seal of approval. \"The [Hyperwallet] acquisition will increase PYPL's ability to provide payment and e-commerce solutions to marketplaces around the world.\" This is because \"Hyperwallet provides an entrance into more than 200 markets worldwide and a multi-currency payment platform that allows for many disbursement options.\"He has a Buy rating and $93 price target on PayPal. And while this may suggest a higher multiple than PYPL's peers, Foresi is confident that PayPal deserves the extra credit: \"We value PYPL at a premium to the peer group, as it is growing about twice as fast as the industry's average growth rate of high single digits and has expansion opportunities, in our opinion.\"Overall, as a Strong Buy stock, PayPal has received 17 buy ratings vs. only 4 hold ratings in the last three months. These ratings come with a $89 price target (9% upside potential). Plus you should note that top Wedbush analyst  recently added PayPal to the firm's elite \"Best Ideas\" list. His $100 price target indicates 22% upside potential.This isn't the first time I've covered  (NASDAQ:  ), and it's unlikely to be the last. Autodesk is a 3D design company that operates in multiple industries. ADSK tech is used in every industry from construction to architecture to filmmaking. On a one-week basis, the stock is currently tracking down by 7.7%. Nonetheless, ADSK is still up by an impressive 23% year-to-date.Top Oppenheimer analyst  has just reiterated his ADSK Buy rating. He selects Autodesk as a Top Pick for June-July. \"We believe the business is well positioned in a large but lightly penetrated construction industry that is yearning for next-generation technologies, like Autodesk's, to help digitize the industry, which should act as a pillar for Autodesk's next leg of growth beyond FY2020\" writes Ikeda.He notes that Autodesk reported good F1Q results with F1Q total revenue of $560M (+15% y/y, +18% ASC 605) coming in ~$2M above the consensus estimate.In total, ADSK has unanimous Street support right now.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new August 24th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $130.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $130.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $124.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $131.50/share today.Because the $130.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.2%. So, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Marvell is a fabless designer, developer and marketer of analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. We believe strong demand for Marvell's 4G LTE products and acquisition synergies will act as catalysts. The company's current restructuring initiative will help it improve its cloud infrastructure and applications, which is anticipated to drive the top and bottom lines.Notably, Marvell, is also expected to keep on benefiting from the growing demand for SSD products. The storage market is witnessing a steady increase in demand, given fast-growing data volume, especially the exponential growth in unstructured data.The company's storage revenues contributed to over 50% of total revenues in fiscal 2018. Marvell's recent launch of \"NVM Express (NVMe)-based chipset solutions\" is expected to meet new-age data center related SSD needs, which will be a further positive.Additionally, during the soon-to-be reported quarter, the company also announced that it is integrating the first-of-its-kind Secure Automotive Ethernet Switch into NVIDIA  DRIVE Pegasus Platform that will aid in level 5 autonomy of self-driving cars. We believe these initiatives will be beneficial for the company's financials going ahead.Nonetheless, intensifying competition in the High Definition (HD) storage drive market makes us increasingly cautious about the stock's growth prospects. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marvell is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Marvell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP, but an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter is pegged at 31 cents, reflecting a massive year-over-year increase of 29.2%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $601.4 million, up 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these stocks have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Autodesk, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +11.6% and a Zacks Rank #3.

That is, they're trying to determine if the early days of the field are analogous to the early goings of the information technology space in the 1960s. Or maybe it's the 1970s? I don't think it matters one way or the other, but if asked to play the game I would argue it's closer to the 1950s -- and a lack of sustainable technologies and business models tends to back me up.Unfortunately, individual investors that have owned one of the first synthetic biology stocks would reluctantly agree. The field has been high on hype and low on execution, suffers from chronic overpromising, and leans a little too heavily on misleading analogies. But there could be a better way to go about owning a piece of the action: focus on the mature companies partnering with, investing in, and in some cases developing the early-stage technologies in the field.That would lead investors to companies such as  (NASDAQ: ADSK) ,  (NYSE: IFF) , and  (NYSE: DWDP) .Image source: Getty Images.As if the decade debate noted above wasn't bad enough, many venture capitalists also get a little too carried away with the idea that DNA is the software of life, and that we can program it as we wish. It's a little more complex than that, but the gist is right. The point is, in order to engineer better living systems and products, we'll need better design tools -- and no company is better suited to provide that than Autodesk.The effort may not be common knowledge among investors, but the computer-aided design (CAD) pioneer offers one of the most integrated software platforms available for designing and simulating DNA. The cloud-based software allows scientists to piece together genetic sequences on a computer before synthesizing them and putting them into an organism, or to visualize engineered proteins with its molecule viewer. While similar software tools exist, Autodesk Life Sciences is one of the first to put them all together in a single place.Autodesk is wisely sizing up the long-term opportunity in synthetic biology even as it transforms its business model. The software stock is up 140% in the last three years  . Why? Investors think the business's transition to a subscription revenue model could enable long-term sales growth and higher profits, and provide a stickier business in smaller niche markets with better growth prospects -- such as those hacking DNA at a small start-up, university, or even a bootstrapped community lab.Synthetic biology won't get very far without robust digital tools that make it easier to design, test, and simulate new DNA constructs. Autodesk is one company leading the charge for this critical aspect of the fledgling field.Image source: Getty Images.The flavor and fragrance industry is one of the most important industries to modern life that most people have never heard of. Yet you own dozens of products that have been enhanced with the help of natural and synthetic scents and tastes created by the likes of International Flavors & Fragrances, from candles to laundry detergents to ice creams.Problem is, the industry has been bumping up against an innovation ceiling in the last decade or so after pretty much exhausting all of the neat tricks synthetic chemistry has to offer. The good news is natural ingredients (extracted from exotic plants and animals) offer plenty more complex tastes and scents to explore. The bad news is they're prohibitively expensive to obtain. That explains why the flavor and fragrance industry has  : Engineered microbes might be able to mass produce complex natural products at lower costs than plants.International Flavors & Fragrances is among those providing much-needed capital to synthetic biology start-ups. It could prove crucial to enabling the technology. That's because flavors and fragrances are incredibly valuable -- thousands of dollars (or more) per kilogram -- which provides a great financial cushion against the inefficient manufacturing processes of the day. In other words, finding successful business models with the highest-value ingredients will allow synthetic biology start-ups to walk down the value chain toward higher-volume, lower-margin products.Shareholders of International Flavors & Fragrances could certainly use some encouraging developments. The business has struggled to grow in recent years without a heavy dose of cost-cutting and headcount reductions, neither of which is sustainable for the long term. That actually prompted the company to announce its intention to  (which is also investing in synthetic biology), although the cash-and-stock deal left investors with a sour taste in their mouths.I'd tend to agree that there are more questions than answers at the moment, so until management provides more clarity (or the first few synthetic biology ingredients prove their worth), investors may want to approach International Flavors & Fragrances stock with caution. But it has managed to trounce the  over the long haul, so definitely keep it on your watchlist.Image source: Getty Images.DuPont has a long history of innovation in the polymer space that spans household brand names such as nylon, Kevlar, Lycra, and Tyvek. It may only be a matter of time before  is added to the list.The specialty polymer, used in everything from athletic apparel to stain-resistant carpeting, is two parts terephthalic acid (TPA) and one part 1,3 propanediol (PDO). Chemistry aside, the important part is that the PDO is manufactured from living microbes. More important for investors is that the Sorona brand is one of the most valuable -- if not  most valuable -- industrial biotech operations on the planet.That success has given DuPont the confidence to continue investing in industrial biotech and other renewable chemical processes, including a new polymer that could enable  and provide hundreds of millions of dollars in new sales in the next few years. From an investing standpoint, there are some moving parts to consider at the moment since it's part of the behemoth that is DowDuPont. But it's about to get easier to invest in the legacy (and ongoing) industrial biotech efforts.DowDuPont will soon  , each leveraging a unique core focus that resulted from the recent combination of Dow Chemical and DuPont. There will be a materials science company that will retain the name Dow Chemical, in addition to an agriculture company and a specialty products company. The latter will house the industrial biotech efforts in enzymes and polymers while bringing in an estimated $21 billion in annual revenue and a 25% operating margin -- the highest margin of the spinoffs.However, it's going to take some time. DowDuPont doesn't expect to complete the spinoff process until June 1, 2019. If you don't want to wait until then, owning the merged company today will provide a piece of all three companies eventually.Image source: Getty Images.The field of synthetic biology is still very much in its infancy. Therefore, investors shouldn't dismiss its potential just because a few lousy companies in years past have overpromised and severely underdelivered. However, the unfortunate reality is unless you're a venture capitalist, individual investors don't have the opportunity to buy a pure-play synthetic biology stock in 2018 that they won't regret owning later.But perhaps the focus on owning a pure play isn't the point. Successfully commercializing next-gen biotech tools and products will require the blending of many existing disciplines. So why not own the mature companies investing to make that happen in the early goings today? As an added bonus, their diverse businesses will also help to protect against the risk that these early-stage projects fail. That's why investors interested in synthetic biology may want to dig deeper into the efforts being made at Autodesk, International Flavors & Fragrances, and DowDuPont.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That is because the May 25, 2018 $138.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an  strategy.Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Autodesk shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Autodesk is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computer - Software industry that ranks in the Top 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 5 cents per share to 3 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Autodesk right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing.

This year's mid-year malaise has been made even sleepier by the fact that investors aren't entirely sure how the Fed's going to handle persistent inflation. Never even mind the lingering fears of a potential trade war.There are some stocks that might just shrug off the summertime blues though. Granted, they're few and far between, but if a company is able to prove it can grow rapidly even if the economy bumps into a headwind, traders just might gravitate to these names and push them higher.To that end (and in no particular order), here's a run-down of ten companies boasting outsized growth when other outfits can't exactly say the same. Some will ring a bell, and others are rather unfamiliar. In all cases though, clearly the organization is doing something right. (NASDAQ:  ) isn't exactly a household name.

That's because it believes  , and it's rapidly developing technology for both. So far, a large hurdle to overcome is how to profitably make and sell EVs. On Thursday, GM, along with\u00a0software company  (NASDAQ: ADSK) , gave us a glimpse at one small idea that could help do just that.Sure, the idea of taking weight out of vehicles at a time when consumers demand improved mileage on larger vehicles isn't a novel idea.  (NYSE: F) was first to try this, taking a massive chunk of weight out of its bread-and-butter F-Series trucks by using aluminum in some panels instead of steel. In a counterpunch, GM launched 14 new vehicle models with a total mass reduction of over 5,000 pounds. But this is different: GM will be using advanced software design technology from Autodesk to make lighter alternative-propulsion and zero-emission vehicles.GM's next-generation proof-of-concept seat bracket. Image source: General Motors.\"This disruptive technology provides tremendous advancements in how we can design and develop components for our future vehicles to make them lighter and more efficient,\" said GM Vice President Ken Kelzer, Global Vehicle Components and Subsystems, in a press release. \"When we pair the design technology with manufacturing advancements such as 3D printing, our approach to vehicle development is completely transformed and is fundamentally different to co-create with the computer in ways we simply couldn't have imagined before. \"For those of us scratching our head about exactly how this improved development can work, GM was kind enough to give a simple example:Image source: General Motors.There are a handful of reasons why this is important in the grand scheme of things. For consumers, a reduction in part size and mass could increase a vehicle's interior space for more content and it could also increase the range and performance of EVs. For original equipment manufacturers, it could enable new vehicle shapes and designs that could have a wide range of impacts from improved vehicle functionality to more appealing aesthetics.\u00a0For investors, it's a move that makes the long-term vision of fleets of driverless electric vehicles -- the foundation for potential  \u00a0-- one step closer. GM estimates that for U.S. passengers, ridesharing currently costs $3 per mile.\u00a0If that cost per mile drops to $1 (which would be helped by replacing the driver), management suggests, the total addressable market could explode from roughly $20 billion today to a staggering $1.6 trillion.That driverless-EV future, and its lucrative potential market for automakers, suppliers, technology companies, and everything in between, is in the distance, for now. For that future to arrive sooner rather than later, GM needs to produce a solidly profitable EV with better range. If this software and 3D printing can help Detroit's largest automaker reduce the weight of EVs, improve their performance, and open up designs previously unusable for such vehicles, then these small steps will be great news for long-term investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The figure was also better than the company's guided range of a loss of 10-14 cents per share.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise track record. It beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 21.7%.Revenues of $553.8 million beat the consensus mark of $545.3 million and increased nearly 15.7% year over year. The figure surpassed the guided range of $537-$547 million.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Autodesk's results are expected to be driven by its core business, which comprises maintenance, product subscription and Enterprise Business Agreement (EBA) subscriptions.Autodesk is gaining from robust growth in product subscription. Autodesk's broad product portfolio continues to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets. The company's growing maintenance to subscription program coupled with increasing adoption of Collections is a tailwind.Moreover, increasing spend by customers of Collections is leading to an increase in the company's average recurring revenues (ARR) and average revenue per subscriptions (ARPS).For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARR is $2.12 billion, up 21.7% from the reported number in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk is also benefiting from its investment in digital infrastructure. The company's e-store generated nearly 20% of products subscription sales in the last reported quarter. Moreover, half of AutoCAD LT subscriptions in the United States came through the e-store.Although cloud remains a very small contributor to Autodesk's total business, growing momentum of BIM 360 and Fusion tools is a positive.However, churn rate for maintenance subscribers is expected to remain high, given the rise in cost of staying on a maintenance plan.Management expects billings growth in the quarter to be impacted by tough year-over-year comparison as the company recorded strong billings in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Further, cash flow in the quarter will be negatively impacted by the company's restructuring activity and exit tax related to the shift of European operations center to Dublin from Switzerland. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

Since the beginning of 2015, sales and earnings at the the design-software maker have steadily declined, and yet its stock price has surged. Shares have more than doubled, up 121% over that time frame.All the while sales have trended down. From 2015 to 2018, sales declined by 18.4%. And profits have been nonexistent in that time frame, declining from a loss of $282 million to a loss of $567 million. If it  inconsistent with what you might expect, well, it  that way, too: data by  .So what's going on? Why are investors willing to pay up as sales and earnings slip?The answer boils down to Autodesk's business model. Behind the scenes, the company is undergoing a transformation that's only evident when you dig into the 10-K, listen in on conference calls, and sort through its changing revenue mix. All three sources reveal dramatic changes to the way it sells and delivers products to customers. And this transformation is having a profound effect on how the market views the company.Image source: Autodesk.Back in 2014, Autodesk suggested that the following few years would be less fruitful for the company from a financial perspective. It wasn't something that was splashed on the front page of the annual letter to shareholders. Instead, the note appeared on page 40 of the annual report. It read as follows:This all meant big changes for the company.This brief disclosure, as you can see, would have significant implications.In 2014, Autodesk started accelerating the shift. First, it rethought how it delivered licenses to make them more flexible for project-based users and small businesses. This was a stopgap that accommodated the new \"on-demand\" mindset and reduced the sticker price for customers. But it didn't stop there.The company started marketing and persuading large design companies to switch to a new contract and method of product delivery. By 2016, Autodesk was disclosing sales of subscriptions versus license and maintenance revenue. Subscriptions stood at $228 million in 2016, and they more than quadrupled to $989 million over the next two years. Meanwhile, maintenance and licensing revenues have decreased by 16% and 551%, respectively, during the same time period.On the investor relations front, management increased transparency around the changes. In its annual reports, for instance, Autodesk went from mentioning the word \"subscription\" three times in 2013 to 41 times in 2015 to a staggering 99 times by 2016. The revenue shift was evident, and the company was going all in on messaging to the market.Meanwhile, outside the company, investors were starting to grasp the effects of this transition, which was also happening at other software companies, like design competitor  and accounting software maker  . The slowdown in sales, though disappointing, could actually indicate rosier prospects for the long run. After Autodesk's stock stumbled in 2015 (as shown above), it started to reverse course in a big way in 2016.Ultimately, the market has embraced the business model. As befuddling as it may sound, sales were sliding, but each dollar of sales is demanding a greater premium with each passing year.The  is the best indicator of the premium that Autodesk stock fetches. In 2013, every dollar of Autodesk's sales was valued at $3.60 by the market. That figure increased by 53% through 2016 and by 283% through the most recent 12 months:Data source: Morningstar. Chart by author.Growth of that magnitude cannot be attributed solely to an overall pricey market. This feat is unique to Autodesk, and it's propelled by the market's embrace of this new business model.Recurring revenue, as you may guess, means Autodesk has greater visibility into its sales cycle than if it started from scratch each quarter selling new licenses. The market appreciates this predictability. It also appreciates that customers tend to be more \"sticky\" in this model because their switching costs increase. Once customers have adopted Autodesk to suit their needs, they're less inclined to go through the headaches of moving to another provider.And, finally, Autodesk's product -- software -- has the potential to become easier to deliver and to create a shorter feedback loop via the cloud between the end user and the company. This means the company can save on costs and get better at satisfying the desires of its customers.These are the reasons the market's bidding up shares: more predictability, \"stickier\" customer relationships, and a more direct model of distribution.Sales didn't slide due to declining demand or an inferior product. Autodesk has a unique product in industries that are embracing technology more and more, like construction, manufacturing, and engineering. Sales slid because Autodesk overhauled its approach to selling its software, and therefore recognized less of the revenue at the outset of the sale. In the long run, this change in business model will be better for investors.Meanwhile, Autodesk showed signs the sales  just last month. Sales were up from $1.98 billion to $2.06 billion year over year.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of SPHB, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SPHB's low point in its 52 week range is $35.94 per share, with $46.04 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $43.36. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NASDAQ:  ) data fiasco has shaken the market as a whole - and tech stocks in particular. Prices have pulled back on a wave of negative media attention and potentially tighter regulation. Suddenly the unstoppable rise of the tech giants looks a little bit more fragile. But many tech stocks still show very sustainable and robust long-term fundamentals. That's why I am confident that now is the time to buy cheap tech stocks on the dip.Indeed, top Monness analyst  has just told  that tech might be the biggest buying opportunity right now. Now is the time for investors to boost their tech holdings, says White, adding: \"There are some great secular trends in this group.\"With this in mind, I used  to pinpoint the most compelling tech stocks right now. These are stocks with support from top analysts - i.e. analysts with the strongest track record of rating success, as well as big upside potential.I include in all the stocks covered below the average analyst price target so you can see how far these stocks can potentially spike from current levels.Let's take a closer look now:Perhaps surprisingly, the first stock on this list is none other than Facebook. Yes, that's right FB. But when you think about it, it's not surprising at all. Following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, we now have a \"truly attractive entry point\" into one of tech's best growth stories.For RBC Capital's  , FB is still his No. 1 Long in large-cap internet stocks. This five-star analyst has just reiterated his bullish take on FB with a $250 price target. With shares down 7% year-to-date, this translates into massive upside potential of over 50%.According to Mahaney, FB has a key advantage because of its current low market shares - less than 20% of Global Online Advertising and a mid-single-digit percent of Global Total Advertising. This will help it to maintain premium growth for a long time. On top of this, FB still has several new large revenue growth drivers up its sleeve. We are looking at Instagram monetization, Messaging Platform monetization, camera/AR, AI, and video to name but a few.He adds, \"Yes, Regulatory Risk is real \u2026 But we believe this is now more than fairly reflected in FB shares and reiterate our Outperform rating.\" And the Street as a whole clearly feels the same. Overall, FB has received 31 recent buy ratings vs just two hold ratings and one sell rating. Meanwhile their $219 average price target translates into 33% upside potential from current levels.This groundbreaking 3D design company makes software for people who make things. This includes software for architects, animators, constructors and engineers. In the last month prices have pulled back by 3.4%. But its growth trajectory is nonetheless very impressive, with prices up 25% year-to-date.And this is just the beginning according to the Street. In the last three months,  (NASDAQ:  ) has received an impressive 13 buy ratings with a $154 average price target (16% upside). Two of these ratings stand out. Top Oppenheimer analyst  calls ADSK his Top Stock Pick in Saas/ Applications Software. He explains: \"Autodesk is a well-established franchise and industry leader and operates as an industry-standard, must-have technology in nearly every industry it operates in.\"Looking forward, Ikeda sees big growth potential as \"the business is well positioned in a large but lightly penetrated construction industry that is yearning for next-generation technologies, like Autodesk's, to help digitize the industry.\"Similarly, five-star Robert W Baird analyst  calls ADSK a \"Fresh Pick.\" He ramped up his price target from $145 to $155 (20% upside) while praising the company's strong execution. I highly recommend tracking  (NYSE:  ) very carefully right now. First Data holds a relatively rare position as merchant acquirer, network, and issuer processor. Crucially, the company is also benefiting from the rise in electronic payments. People are turning away from cash and checks, and towards electronic transactions.According to the wisdom of top Oppenheimer analyst  this stock can soar 51%. He picks First Data as his No. 1 fintech right now. Why does this matter? Well, our data places Greene as a Top 10 analyst for his stock picking ability. He currently boasts an 82% success rate and 20.9% average return on his stock recommendations.According to Greene: \"The company has an attractive business model, characterized by transaction-related fees, multi-year contracts, a diverse client base, and high incremental margins.\" Plus he expected strong earnings growth as FDC \"applies its sizable annual FCF [free cash flow] to debt paydown, and a narrowing of the valuation discount to peers.\"In the last three months, eight top analysts have published buy ratings on FDC with only one analyst staying sidelined. With shares down 9% YTD, the $21.61 average price target indicates big upside potential of 41%.Like FB, online travel emporium  (NASDAQ:  ) is down 9% year-to-date. But this neglects the fact that Expedia represents an excellent play on the secular growth in Online Travel. \"Buying the EXPE Dips\" over the last five years has been a very good strategy for making $\" argues RBC Capital's  . I'm sold!New management is now investing more aggressively in tech and marketing- and this should help EXPE catch up with industry leader  (NASDAQ:  ). Meanwhile HomeAway, EXPE's answer to Airbnb, is still in its early days and boasts 'a tremendous growth runway' domestically and internationally.Mahaney explains: \"We view EXPE's Bookings and Room Night Growth rates to be largely intact, current investments as the right move, and with Street estimates recently reset twice, we see potential for both multiple re-rating and positive estimates revisions.\"Over the last three months, 14 top analysts have published buy ratings on EXPE with six analysts staying on the sidelines. On average these analysts see 23% upside potential from the current share price.As a stock that costs well over $1,000,  (NASDAQ:  ) is never going to be a bargain buy. But still, shares are looking undeniably \"cheap\" right now. Prices are down by 5% over the last month, and 7.5% over the last three months.This pullback comes even though GOOGL remains one of the strongest and most consistent stories out there. Just look at its 32 consecutive quarters of 20% revenue growth and 25%-plus operating margins. These are the kind of figures other companies can only dream about.Indeed, five-star Monness analyst  has just reiterated his \"buy\" rating and $1,280 price target. Alphabet is already the No. 1 search engine and mobile operating system in the world, says White, but it is still furiously innovating with a never-ending list of new products (see  ).With an eye on the attractive growth opportunities ahead, White says: \"With the company's dominant position in search, the company has garnered the top position in the global online advertising market and we believe the stock is an attractive value at current levels.\"We can see from TipRanks that GOOGL - a \"strong buy\" stock - has received 23 buy ratings vs three hold ratings in the last three months. This is with a $1,302 average analyst price target (25% upside potential).You may not have heard of chip maker  (NASDAQ:  ) - but in the last six months this \"strong buy\" stock has jumped by 77%. What's more, there is still plenty of upside potential left! Mellanox is a leading supplier of computer networking products using InfiniBand and Ethernet technology. The stock is buzzing after the company positively pre-announced first quarter earning results. Most notably, midpoint of revenue guidance increasing by $18 million, or 8%, to $245 million.On the news, top Loop Capital analyst  boosted his MLNX price target from $80 to $90. The new price target suggests 28% upside potential from current levels. For Kisner, MLNX stands to benefit from 1) the adoption of high-speed Ethernet network interface cards and 2) switches by hyperscale internet/Web 2.0 companies.Most interestingly, Kisner isn't concerned about the company's activist spat. On the contrary, he sees the involvement of Starboard Value LP as a positive catalyst that could lead to a company sale or operating improvements. Starboard owns 10.6% of Mellanox shares and is currently pushing to take over the board of directors.Shares in  (NASDAQ:  ) are down 7% over the last month. Amazon has had to deal with FB's data woes as well as a barrage of tweet attacks from President donald Trump. \"I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,\" Trump tweeted on April 3.But while Amazon may not be the president's favorite stock, it certainly has top marks from the Street. RBC Capital's  writes \"Presidential Obsession\" is now an investment risk, but we continue to view the long-term growth outlook for AMZN to be the most robust in 'Net land given the very large TAMs [total addressable markets] AMZN is facing.\"He continues: \"For '18, we believe AMZN starts gaining traction in Marketing services (AMS), while Cloud appears to have hit a positive industry inflection point.\" Indeed, AWS revenue contribution is still growing and should act as a meaningful, sustainable source of leverage for Amazon.Right now 34 out of 35 top analysts are bullish on the stock.

For the Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (Symbol: VO), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $173.00 per unit.With VO trading at a recent price near $155.16 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.49% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ollowing a rocky Q1, now the million-dollar question is: How will tech stocks perform in Q218? Wall Street is unclear. Although tech still boasts the highest expected sales growth and profit margins, the sector also has high risks from tax reform, valuation, and government regulation.The upshot of this risk/reward is that investors need to be more savvy about how to pick winning tech stocks going forward. Here we used TipRanks'  tool and  to find top tech stocks with 1) a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating from top analysts and 2) big upside potential for the coming year. The data is all based on Street ratings from the last three months.Within the tech sector, these three stocks still stand out as particularly compelling investing opportunities. Let\u2019s take a closer look now:Google-parent Alphabet has an earnings track record that other companies can only dream about. Ahead of its Q1 earnings report, GOOGL boasts 32 consecutive quarters of 20% revenue growth and 25%+ operating margins. So what can we expect this earnings season?Five-star RBC Capital analyst  is modelling for Core Google gross revenue of $30.13B (up 23% Y/Y), driven by strength in Mobile Search, Programmatic, and YouTube.He wrote: \u201cWe do worry about Government Risk, especially for GOOGL. And competitive risk from the likes of Amazon. But we continue to believe GOOGL is one of the strongest, most consistent fundamental stories out there. And the valuation pitch remains constructive.\u201dSpecifically, Mahaney\u2019s ad survey revealed that that the majority of marketers plan to increase their spending on Google (52%), while the next-largest group intent to maintain current spending levels (40%). Conversely, only 7% of marketers believe that they will decrease their spending on the platform. \u201cWe continue to view Google as an almost essential marketing channel for most businesses \u2013 something of a utility,\u201d Mahaney said.He has a $1,285 price target on the stock- indicating 24% upside potential from current levels. This falls just below the average top analyst price target of $1,301. Overall, we can see from TipRanks that GOOGL, a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d stock, has received 23 buy ratings vs 3 hold ratings in the last three months.This groundbreaking 3D design company makes software for people who make things. In the last three months, Autodesk has received an impressive 12 back-to-back buy ratings. One of these bulls is five-star Robert. W Baird analyst . Not only has he just ramped up his price target by $10 to $155, he also calls the stock a Fresh Pick. Oliver believes Autodesk can spike 20% from current share price.Most interestingly, Oliver isn\u2019t alone. Top Oppenheimer analyst  has also selected ADSK as his Top Stock Pick in Saas/ Applications Software. Ikeda gives three reasons why he is such a fan of Autodesk, namely: 1) its dominant market positioning; 2) rapid innovation and 3) strong execution. Right now the company is undergoing a transition to subscriptions, which is anchored by bullish FY2020 financial targets.Looking further afield Ikeda sees a long growth trajectory: \u201cWe believe the business is well positioned in a large but lightly penetrated construction industry that is yearning for next-generation technologies, like Autodesk's, to help digitize the industry, which should act as a pillar for Autodesk's next leg of growth beyond FY2020.\u201dOverall, analysts predict that this \u201cStrong Buy\u201d stock has almost 18% upside from the current share price. And notably even the lowest price target of $135 still means upside for this steadily rising stock.First Data scoops first prize as the top fintech stock. This is according to the wisdom of Oppenheimer analyst . He has just selected the stock as a Top Pick based on First Data holding a relatively rare position as merchant acquirer, network, and issuer processor. More broadly, Greene believes FDC benefits from the ongoing secular transition toward electronic payments. As we all know from our own lives, people are increasingly turning away from cash and checks, and towards simple electronic transactions.According to Greene: \u201cThe company has an attractive business model, characterized by transaction-related fees, multi-year contracts, a diverse client base, and high incremental margins.\u201d Plus we should see strong earnings growth as FDC \u201capplies its sizable annual FCF [free cash flow] to debt paydown, and a narrowing of the valuation discount to peers WorldPay and Global Payments as it gradually de-leverages.\u201dIn terms of upside potential, Greene\u2019s $23 price target suggests impressive growth potential of 50%. Note that this is an analyst worth following: our data shows Greene as a Top 10 analyst for his stock picking ability. He currently boasts an 82% success rate and 20.7% average return on his recommendations.Like the two stocks discussed above, First Data has a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 rating from the Street. In the last three months, 8 top analysts have published buy ratings with only 1 analyst staying sidelined. These analysts have an encouraging average price target of $21.61 (41% upside).Our database covers over 5,000 stocks.

Over the last five years you've hit what folks like me call a \"10-bagger.\" Your investment in Netflix stock is up over 1,000% in value. Just since Jan. 1 you're up 65%.Rather than argue about whether you might get another percentage or two out of the shares, however, it might be more valuable to consider the lesson of the success of Netflix stock for your other investments.Here it is. Riding the clouds is profitable. The Cloud Czars continue to build-out enormous storage and (now) transmission capacity in their data centers. The more of that capacity a company can buy, the more it can use, the more profitable it can be.It's not just that clouds are profitable, but that using them is, too.Consider the success of  (NASDAQ:  ), s  (NYSE:  ) and, now,  (NASDAQ:  ) in recent years.What they have in common has been a willingness to go \"all-in\" on cloud, to put all their capital into building true cloud-based applications.Companies that have fought the cloud, like  (NASDAQ:  ), are now hustling to catch up, building out their own cloud platforms. But it's the cloud providers themselves, the companies that first got this message, that now dominate the global economy.I call these companies the \"Cloud Czars.\" (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ), and  (NASDAQ:  ) committed the $1 billion/quarter in capital needed to play the new great game.Sometimes (as in the case of Facebook) before they were financially ready.They took the risk and reaped the rewards. So, too, have their largest customers.Netflix stock benefited by when the company became an early customer.  , but not blindly. It has its own content delivery network, OpenConnect, which allows it to arbitrage capacity and keep delivery costs down. This is great for Netflix stock.Thanks in part to OpenConect, Netflix is not afraid of competing directly with Amazon Prime Video. Thanks to Amazon, it is miles ahead of broadcast-based competitors from a technical standpoint.This includes  (NYSE:  ), which put what could have been its cloud investment into dividends and stock buybacks and whose DirecTv Now has to play catch-up.Netflix has been pitched as a rival to the  (NYSE:  ) HBO service, and thus AT&T's pending purchase of Time Warner is, along with DirecTv, supposed to provide real competition.It won't, because of cloud technology investments Netflix made years ago. This goes for all the other streaming content plays out there, from Hulu to  (NYSE:  ). First mover advantage can work if the first mover is willing to keep moving.Thus, all these content deals. They're not being done blindly. Netflix has long used its data on what subscribers watch to drive what it buys. And it gives producers a \"deal they can't refuse,\" the kind of autonomy and control even a President can love.Using the cloud means more than saving files to it. Netflix uses cloud to arbitrage its delivery costs, and to determine what content to buy based on user preferences. This is its real secret sauce.This doesn't mean Netflix isn't fully priced, maybe even overpriced as Serge Berger  The stock could fall in the near term, as James Brumley But the business is more than sound, because Netflix went all-in on all a cloud can do. Look for that in your other investments.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n this segment from the  podcast, host Chris Hill is joined by Jason Moser of  , David Kretzmann of  , and Aaron Bush of  to discuss the stocks on their radar.

Our man behind the glass, Steve Broido, will hit you with a question. Also behind the glass with Steve and our producer, Mac Greer, this week, James Chen, longtime listener visiting. [claps] [claps] Whoo-hoo! [claps] Thanks for coming, James! Shout-out to James. Alright, David Kretzmann, what are you looking at? I'm looking at National Beverage, ticker FIZZ. This is the beverage company behind soft drink brands like Shasta and Faygo, but most recently their growth is coming from sparkling water brand LaCroix. Even now, any grocery store I go into, LaCroix has prominent displays everywhere. LaCroix is everywhere. Revenue is still growing 17%. Strong balance sheet, strong free cash flow production, and the quirkiest CEO I think you'll ever find. Worth a closer look. Steve, question about National Beverage? Do they still sell Shasta? [laughs] I've not heard of Shasta since I don't know, 1985. Shasta is still going strong, although sales are dropping a little bit. Jason Moser, what are you looking at? I know my guy Cakes with the sports junk, he's going to love this one, calling out JPMorgan, ticker JPM. CEO Jamie Dimon's letter to the shareholders just came out over this week. I recommend everybody reading it. I do believe this is a company worth owning for the long haul. I put Dimon in a class with Buffett and even maybe a little bit of Bezos there. But, I think he's probably the best reason to own this company. Very smart. His experience navigating through the Great Recession, I think, has really put this company in a great position. Listen, they measure themselves by tangible book value, and they're targeting 17% annual returns on tangible equity for the foreseeable future. Stock is selling about 2X tangible book value today. I still think it's worth a look. Steve, question about JPMorgan? How many Chase credit cards do you currently have in your wallet? I think I have just the one, right? That's the Amazon Prime  , right? That's a Chase card, isn't it? It is. It's your card, man. Don't ask me. Just as long as the creditors aren't chasing me. Alright. Aaron Bush, what are you looking at? I'm taking a look at Autodesk, which makes computer-aided design software. I think it's really interesting, because  has actually been a huge outperformer, and I think they're following in their footsteps in terms of changing their business model from licensing to subscriptions. So, right now, the financials look pretty bad, but I think things are about to look pretty good. And the ticker? ADSK. Steve? I'm an Autodesk shareholder. What do you think the biggest opportunity for Autodesk is, in terms of what design thing for them in the future is? Oh, man! [laughs] Aaron will get back to you on that one. In the meantime, do you have one you want to add to your watchlist? I'm going to stick with Autodesk, they've been just a rocket ship.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he Nasdaq Composite Index staged a stunning comeback, recouping all losses incurred early last month when the index had slipped into a correction territory. In fact, it hit a record high for the second consecutive session and has been outperforming major indices, which are yet to fully recover from February's selloff, by a wide margin from a year-to-date look.The strength in the technology sector, which accounts for nearly half of the index, helped Nasdaq surge on a gain of 8.3% this year compared with gains of 1.4% for the Dow Jones and 3.2% for the S&P 500 (read:  ).The sharp gains came from the astounding surge in FAANG stocks and other high-performance technology names. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as big data, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as key catalysts.The twin tailwinds of Trump's tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are also pushing stocks higher. This is because tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates. Additionally, most of the tech companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies do not face any financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment.Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are boosting economically-sensitive growth sectors like technology, which perform typically well in a maturing economic cycle. With the global economy gathering momentum, technology companies are likely to outperform and are less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation.If these weren't enough, waves of consolidation among semiconductor manufacturers are driving tech stocks to new highs (read:  ).As a result,  , which serves as a proxy for the index, has climbed nearly 12% so far this year.

(Symbol: ADSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $135.61, changing hands for $137.72/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 18 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Autodesk Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $122.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $150.00. The standard deviation is $8.225.But the whole reason to look at the  ADSK price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ADSK crossing above that average target price of $135.61/share, investors in ADSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $135.61 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

In fact, it hit a record high for the second consecutive session and has been outperforming major indices, which are yet to fully recover from February's selloff, by a wide margin from a year-to-date look. Source: ShutterstockThe strength in the technology sector, which accounts for nearly half of the index, helped Nasdaq surge on a gain of 8.3% this year compared with gains of 1.4% for the Dow Jones and 3.2% for the S&P 500.The sharp gains came from the astounding surge in FAANG stocks and other high-performance technology names. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as big data, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as key catalysts.The twin tailwinds of Trump's tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are also pushing stocks higher. This is because tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates. Additionally, most of the tech companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies do not face any financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment.Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are boosting economically-sensitive growth sectors like technology, which perform typically well in a maturing economic cycle. With the global economy gathering momentum, technology companies are likely to outperform and are less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation.If these weren't enough, waves of consolidation among semiconductor manufacturers are driving tech stocks to new highs.As a result,  (NASDAQ:  ), which serves as a proxy for the index, has climbed nearly 12% so far this year. Let's take a closer look at the fundamentals of QQQ.The  (NASDAQ:  ) provides exposure to 104 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq by tracking the Nasdaq-100 Index.

Shares have lost about 7.4% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ADSK due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Autodesk incurred fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP loss of 9 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents. The figure was also better than the company's guided range of a loss of 10-14 cents per share.Revenues of $553.8 million beat the consensus mark of $545.3 million and increased nearly 15.7% year over year. The figure surpassed the guided range of $537-$547 million.Moreover, deferred revenues increased 9% to $1.96 billion in the quarter, which reflects growing strength of the business model. Total recurring revenues were 93%, a significant increase from 86% reported in the year-ago quarter.Revenues were impacted by a 40.2% year-over-year decline in License revenues (7.3% of total revenues), which totaled $40.3 million in the quarter.Maintenance revenues (39.7% of total revenue) also declined 18% from the year-ago quarter to $219.8 million, primarily due to lower subscriptions.However, the company's business model transition continues to be on track. Subscription revenues soared 104.8% year over year to $293.7 million, driven by strong product subscriptions and other subscription plan types. Total subscriptions increased approximately 127K from the prior quarter to 3.72 million.Subscription plan (product, end-of-life and cloud subscriptions) increased approximately 371K from the last quarter to 2.27 million backed by new product subscriptions as well as maintenance to subscription or M2S program which recorded 168K subscriptions.Total annualized recurring revenues (ARR) were $2.05 billion, up 25% from the year-ago quarter, driven by product subscription and Enterprise Business Agreement (EBA) subscriptions.Subscription plan ARR of $1.18 billion surged 106% year over year and 105% on a constant currency (cc) basis. However, maintenance plan ARR of $879 million declined 18% from the year-ago quarter and 17% at cc.Autodesk is also benefiting from its investment in digital infrastructure. The company's e-store generated nearly 20% of products subscription sales in the quarter. Moreover, half of AutoCAD LT subscriptions in the United States came through the e-store.Autodesk is gaining from the EBA program. In the quarter, the company witnessed more than 70 deals valued at more than $1 million with significant contribution from EBAs. Furthermore, 14 of them were valued at $5 million or more.New customers represented about 30% of the mix in the quarter and contributed a significant portion of subscription additions.Cloud subscription additions of 45K represented a decline of 50% year over year. However, increasing adoption of BIM 360 Docs and Field tools and other high value products is a positive. The company won several large contracts from top-ranked construction companies. Management expects cloud to be a key growth driver beyond fiscal 2020.Autodesk's broad product portfolio continues to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets. Geographically, revenues in the Americas increased 10% year over year to $232 million. EMEA revenues increased 19% to $221 million while the same from APAC increased 23% from the year-ago quarter to $100 million.Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 310 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 88.2%.Research & development, sales & marketing and general & administrative expenses as percentage of revenues declined 550 bps, 450 bps and 80 bps, respectively. This was partially offset by higher restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, which expanded 1510 bps from the year-ago quarter to 17%.Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined 1080 bps to 91.4%.The company reported non-GAAP operating loss of $17.5 million in the quarter compared with the year-ago quarter's operating loss of $81.5 million.Autodesk exited the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $1.32 billion compared with $1.45 billion as of Oct 31, 2017.As of Jan 31, 2018, cash from operating activities was $0.9 million compared with $169.7 million in the year-ago period.The company repurchased 2.4 million shares in the quarter.Per the company's new revenue recognition standard, Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, for first-quarter fiscal 2019, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $550-$560 million. Under the earlier ASC 605, revenues are expected to be $565-$575 million.Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated in the range of 1-4 cents for the quarter (under ASC 606) and 11-14 cents (under ASC 605).Cash flow in the quarter will be negatively impacted by the company's restructuring activity and exit tax related to the shift of European operations center to Dublin from Switzerland.For fiscal 2019, the company expects revenues in the range of $2.455-$2.505 billion (under ASC 606) and $2.495-$2.545 billion (under ASC 605). Billings are projected to be in the range of $2.720-$2.820 billion, under both the measures.Non-GAAP earnings are now expected in the range of 77 cents to 95 cents (under ASC 606) and 92 cents to $1.10 (under ASC 605).Autodesk now projects subscription additions to be between 500K and 550K. Management expects M2S migrations to be the highest in fiscal 2019 as cost to switch will be lesser than the cost of staying on maintenance plan.Total ARR is still expected to be in the range of 28% to 30% (under ASC 606) and 29-31% under ASC 605. Non-GAAP spending is expected to be increase marginally by 1-2%, under both the standards.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

(Symbol: ADSK) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $136.35/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the April put at the $136 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $6.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.6% return against the $136 commitment, or a 33.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADSK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $136 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Autodesk Inc. sees its shares decline 0.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $129.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $6.30 from $136), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 33.8% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., and highlighting in green where the $136 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the April put at the $136 strike for the 33.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Autodesk Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $136.35) to be 34%.

Recently, the company sustained several quarters of losses as it deferred revenue to move from a permanent license to a subscription revenue model.Now, with most of the pain past the company, investors will have to decide if the short-term losses created a buying opportunity on ADSK stock.The company reported a loss for fourth-quarter 2017 of  . This number came in 2 cents per share ahead of consensus estimates. Revenue came in at $553.8 million, increase revenue bye 15.7% year-over-year. They also beat estimates by $9.06 million.Like peers such as  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and many other software companies, ADSK is transitioning to a subscription revenue model on its software. The new model has hurt the bottom line in the short term, and at times, ADSK stock.Subscriptions cost less than the licenses, at first.When the  , a license for AutoCAD Design Suite Ultimate sold for $6,295. That same software under the new model fell to an annual cost of $2,520. Earning that $6,295 had previously been instant. Under the new model, it took almost 2.5 years.While ADSK will come out ahead in the end, waiting for subscription revenue to catch up has meant losses to the company.Critics often accuse companies of not looking past the next quarterly report.In this case, Autodesk's management did the opposite and inflicted years of losses on the company to derive more revenue later. Fortunately, Autodesk stock investors have been patient with the company -mostly.After its November earnings report, ADSK fell by nearly 13% on news that the company was reorganizing to prioritize subscription plans.Still, for most of the last two years, the stock price went up. Despite sustaining heavy losses in both 2016 and 2017, the stock nearly tripled in value between early 2016 and late 2017. Its previous record high of about $131 came just before the company's last earnings report.Following this report, investors bid up the price of ADSK stock the day after the company revised its guidance downward.The company believes it will bring in $550-$560 million in the next quarter. Consensus revenue had stood at $585.06 million. The company also expects to return to profitability with earnings of between 1 cents and 4 cents per share. Analysts had expected 16 cents per share.Having understanding investors helps current stockholders.Unfortunately for investors who want in, this transition did not create a buying opportunity. Forward estimates place the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio for the upcoming fiscal year at 166. For fiscal 2021, analyst forecast a profit of $3.96 per share. With that figure, the stock trades at over 30 times 2021 earnings.Although management succeeded in increasing long-term revenue by switching to a subscription revenue model, the multiple quarters of losses did not create a buying opportunity.Investors understood the method to management's madness. They tripled the price of Autodesk stock over the last two years as the company reported losses quarter after quarter. Now, with the company able to enjoy the increased revenue, profit growth is on track for two years of annual profit growth over 100%.Unfortunately, ADSK stock now supports a valuation at least two years ahead of the price. With the popularity of its software remaining strong the company's future is likely secure.

Q4 was another milestone quarter for our subscription transition. Key to the quarter was the strong growth in both ARR and ARPS. Even as subscription additions fell below expectations, we finished the year with better than expected performance on many of the traditional financial metrics such as revenue, deferred revenue, EPS, and cash flow, all of which are becoming more relevant again as we pass the inflection point on our business model transition. Overall, these results bolster our belief in our ability to achieve our Fiscal 2019 goals around ARR and free cash flow.There are several key outcomes of Q4 that I want to highlight. Total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR grew 25% and subscription plan ARR more than doubled again. Both ARR and subscriptions or subscription plan are now greater than the ARR and subscription base for maintenance, which is a significant milestone and in line with our projections when we began the transition. Annualized revenue per subscription, or ARPS, inflected up in Q4, also in-line with our projections. Recurring revenue has increased to 93% of total revenue and we continue to see faster than expected migration of maintenance customers to subscription, with the maintenance to subscription program or M2S. Beyond that, we remain enthusiastic about our long-term market expansion initiatives in both manufacturing and construction as we continue to introduce new technology that brings Design and Make closer together and drives the convergence of manufacturing and construction.Now, I know you want to hear what's going on with sub adds and I will get to that, but let's first start by talking about ARR. The continued positive trends we're seeing in ARR are clear signals that the transition is working. I'll stress once again that ARR is the most important metric when evaluating the health of the business at this stage of the transition. The strength in total ARR was broad-based with all three major geographies growing ARR at 20% or more. Subscription plan ARR more than doubled, driven by growth in all subscription plan types, but led by product subscription. We continue to drive tremendous growth in product subscription ARR on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.Now let's talk about subscription additions. To provide you more insight into the subscription dynamics, we need to break out core and cloud subscriptions. To be more explicit, the core business represents a combination of maintenance, product subscription and EBA subscriptions, while the cloud business represents all the results generated by stand-alone cloud offerings. When you break these two views out, our core business, which drives the overwhelming majority of our revenue ARR and billings growth, is performing quite well. Our cloud business performed up to our reset expectations for the quarter. We added 45,000 cloud subscriptions in Q4, which represented a nearly 50% decrease against a tough compare to Q4 of last year when we ran a seating program for a component of BIM 360.However, from a billings perspective cloud had its biggest quarter ever, fueled by several large wins, including six with top-ranked construction companies. We see continued momentum in terms of customers moving to higher value products like BIM 360 Docs and Field. We remain very enthusiastic about the opportunity with our cloud products, but keep in mind that cloud is still a small contributor to our overall business. ARR for stand-alone cloud grew 23% in Q4 but contributed less than $100 million of our total $2.05 billion in ARR so, while cloud will not be a major driver of our FY '20 performance, we remain confident it will be a major component of our business in the years beyond FY '20.This brings us to the question why did the net sub additions fall short for the quarter? The answer is that we experienced greater than expected subscription consolidation as customers are reducing their total subscriptions in favor of Collections. We're seeing this reflected in the general adoption of Collections where the mix of Collections within the product subscription base more than doubled year-over-year and now represents over 20% of the product subscription base. The good news is that most of these customers are increasing their total spend with Autodesk, contributing to solid increases in ARPS and ARR so our core strategy of driving upsell to industry Collections is working better than we anticipated.We're also seeing the impact of Collections upselling with both regular renewals and with customers participating in the M2S program and the upsell effect related to M2S is happening across all geographies. To give you an idea of how this works, I'll give you a real example of a Canadian engineering firm and their M2S transaction from Q4. They had 42 maintenance subscriptions up for renewals -- 20 AutoCADs, 21 Navisworks, and 1 Premium Suite. They migrated to 19 subscriptions of the AEC collection and one AutoCAD subscription, a net reduction of over half their seats. However, the account value for this customer increased by over 10%. This happens enough times and you get a depressive impact on our net sub adds as a result of Collections upsell but a pronounced increase in overall ARR. So, that should help you understand what's happening.This is a positive outcome for ARR and ARPs, but it negatively impacts our net sub adds. Beyond that, we believe this issue will work itself out over the course of the year as most of our largest customers complete their maintenance to subscription migration.Despite the impact from Collections upsell, sub adds in our core business increased 14% year-over-year and accelerated from the prior three quarters, led by a record number of product subscription additions. Even when normalizing for M2S, the base of product subscriptions nearly doubled the year-over-year and EBA sub additions increased over 30%, fueled by the strong Q3 EBA deal activity. The core business drove more than $1.9 billion of our total ARR in Q4 and grew more than 25%.Another consistent attribute of the transition is that new customers continue to make up a meaningful portion of product subscription additions and represented close to 30% of the mix for the quarter. These new customers come from a mix of market expansion, growth in emerging markets, converting unlicensed users, and people have been using an alternative design tool. We'll go into much greater sub results and modeling details at our Investor Day in a few weeks, but there wasn't anything in these numbers that alters our conviction in our ability to drive ARR and cash flow.Now I'll turn it over to Scott for a few more details on the M2S program, ARPS, and other financials. Scott? -- Thanks, Andrew. Subscription plan subs grew by a record 371,000 during Q4, with growth in net subscriptions coming in all three categories: cloud, enterprise, and product subscriptions. Partially offsetting the growth in subscription plan subs was the expected decline in maintenance plan subs, primarily related to the M2S program. The M2S program continues to progress faster than expected, especially in the Americas.In Q4, customers migrated 168,000 maintenance subs to product subs. Similar to last quarter, approximately one-third of all maintenance renewal opportunities during Q4 migrated to product subscription. Those that migrated, over one-third of eligible subscriptions upgraded from an individual product to an industry collection, which is the highest upgrade rate we've seen yet and relates to the Collections upsell effect that Andrew just spoke about. The renewal rate for customers held steady in Q4. However, remember that Q4 has the biggest pool of maintenance plan renewal opportunities. Consequently, the decline in maintenance subs is always greatest in Q4.We're very pleased with the M2S program to-date and we'll continue to encourage maintenance customers to move sooner rather than later. We expect Fiscal '19 to be the biggest year for M2S migrations. It makes more economic sense for our customers as the cost of staying on maintenance will be higher than the cost to migrate and products subscription provides them the greatest value with increased flexibility, support, and access to our cloud products.Now let's talk a little bit more about annualized revenue per subscription, or ARPS. This is the anticipated quarter where we saw ARPS inflect up for all the reasons we've been calling out, including improvements to the product mix and the geo mix and the base of our products subs, the price increase for the M2S program, less discounting and promotional activity, and selling more direct to our customers through our e-store. Collections upsell is also having a positive impact on ARPS. Our total ARPS grew 5% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Breaking it down, maintenance plan ARPS continues to grow as expected, driven by mix and the annual price increases we rolled out as part of the M2S program. Product subscription plan ARPS showed a 6% sequential growth. If we exclude the effect of M2S, product subscription ARPS grew 8% sequentially, had its fifth consecutive quarter of growth, and grew 20% year-on-year.That's meaningful growth in ARPS for the largest component of our core business. Further, if we isolate on our core business -- which, again, is maintenance plus product subs plus EBA subs -- core ARPS grew 10% year-on-year and 5% sequentially. These are the ARPS trends we've been predicting since the start of the transition and I know have been a source of question for many of you.Looking at our business mix, once again, total direct was 30% of the Q4 mix. One of the key investment areas for Autodesk has been our digital infrastructure, with the goal of making it easier for our customers who choose to do business directly with Autodesk. Our e-store is a big part of that and we're very pleased that we've already grown that channel to nearly $100 million in Fiscal 2018 revenue. In addition, our e-store generated approximately 20% of the product sub sales in Q4 and close to 50% of LT subs in the Americas came through the e-store in Q4. That's tremendous progress in a short amount of time and we expect to see this continue to grow.The biggest component of our direct mix is still the business we do with large enterprise customers. Q4 is always our biggest quarter for large-deal activity and we signed a record number of million-dollar plus deals in Q4 -- over 70 of them, including 14 contracts valued at $5 million or more. Most of these large deals were EBAs and, on average, the contract value for EBA renewals increased over 40% compared to the original EBA contract value.For those of you who might not be as familiar with the history of Autodesk, these large deal stats are quite remarkable, even compared to just five or ten years ago. Through our product innovation and forward thinking, Autodesk has evolved to become a trusted partner and thought leader with our customers. Many are now coming to us seeking our guidance on how to prepare for the confluence of Design and Make, which is already happening in certain industries.Moving to spend management, we continue to be able to execute well while keeping spend flat on a constant currency basis for both Q4 and Fiscal 2018. The restructuring action we initiated last quarter is allowing us to reallocate our spend to increase investment in areas that drive long-term value or reducing spend and making targeted divestments in other areas. We also remain committed to keeping Fiscal 2019 non-GAAP spend flat at a constant currency relative to our Fiscal 2018 budget at about $2.2 billion. Looking at the balance sheet, reported deferred revenue grew 9%. At the same time, unbilled deferred revenue increased by $178 million sequentially, bringing total unbilled deferred revenue to $326 million. As a reminder, this completes the first full year of moving our enterprise customers to annual billing terms.If we consider total deferred revenue as reported deferred plus unbilled deferred -- which is a fair comparison to last year -- deferred revenue grew more than 25%. Since most of our enterprise customers are on three-year contracts, an entirely new group of enterprise customers will come up for renewal this year and next year so the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will continue to grow meaningfully.Q4 cash flow was stronger than expected, driven by good billings linearity in the quarter. The strength of the Q4 cash flow allowed us to finish the year just in the black, which was also better than expected. When it comes to capital allocation, our stock repurchase program continues to be primary use of cash and we opportunistically accelerated that program in Q4, buying back roughly $2.4 million shares. At our last Investor Day, I indicated that we would use the majority of the $1.7 billion cash balance we had available at that time for stock repurchases. Since then, we've spent over $9 million on share buybacks. In fact, over the past two years, we've reduced our absolute share count by close to 3% and we remain committed to managing dilution and reducing shares outstanding over time.Before getting into our outlook, I want to touch on two high-profile items that are impacting every company: tax reform and ASC 606. With the start of the new fiscal year, we have adopted the new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606, and will be applying the modified retrospective transition method. The new standard will not result in a change in timing and amount of the recognition of revenue for the majority of our product subscription offerings and enterprise agreements. In Fiscal '19, the estimated impact will be a net reduction to revenue and EPS of approximately $40 million and $0.15, respectively, compared to what would have been recognized under ASC 605 and a reduction of approximately $20 million in ARR.We will be required to capitalize and amortize sales commissions under the new standard. While we do not expect a significant impact on reported expenses for the full-year, the timing of when we recognize the deferred commissions by quarter will vary compared to historic seasonality. 606 impacts are greatest in Q1 and then dampen as we move through the year and become nominal by Fiscal '20. And, of course, none of the 606 impacts affect cash flow.Regarding the impact from tax reform, saying it's complex may be an understatement and clarifications from the IRS seem to come out daily, although we have enough information to provide the following. All in all, U.S. tax reform is good for Autodesk, whereby the lower U.S. tax rate and the ability to access foreign cash in the future will increase our profitability and help us manage capital more efficiently. We will utilize our deferred tax assets to offset the cash cost of the one-time transition tax. We're still analyzing the full impact of tax reform, but we currently estimate our Fiscal '19 non-GAAP effective tax rate at 19%. For Fiscal '20 and beyond, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 17% and 18%.Now I'll turn the discussion to our outlook and I'll start by saying that our view of the global economic conditions remains unchanged from the last few quarters, with most of the mature markets performing relatively well and little change in the emergent markets. We're providing guidance this quarter under both ASC 605 for comparison to our historic financials and ASC 606 and would expect The Street to model us using the 606 numbers.We recognize, as we introduce guidance for Fiscal 2019, you'll be able to fill in the blanks for several Fiscal '20 metrics based on our stated Fiscal '20 goals. As Andrew said at the top of the call, we are confident in our ability to achieve our important goals around ARR and free cash flow. As we head into the growth phase of the model transition, we're bringing back annual guidance on billings, defined as reported revenues plus the change in deferred revenues, which should be helpful in modeling our cash flow. I'll note that while we expect billings to increase by approximately 26% at the mid-point for the full year, billings growth in Q1 will be much more modest due to a tough compare against strong billings in Q1 last year.Another thing to keep in mind as you model out free cash flow is that there are a couple of one-time impacts to Fiscal '19 cash flow that total about $130 million. These pertain to charges for the restructuring and the exit tax from moving our European operations center from Switzerland to Dublin, Ireland. These one-time items, together with the strength of our Q4 cash flows, will have an impact on the strength of cash flow for Q1, which is likely to be negative. As we emerge from the inflection in our business model transition, cash flow ramps up quickly through Fiscal '20. A significant part of the ramp is driven by the increase in billings, primarily from what will be a much larger renewal base of product subs and multi-year subscriptions returning to the levels we used to see with maintenance.In addition, in Fiscal '20, we'll then have two years' worth of unbilled deferred revenue flowing into billings, following our transition to annual billing for enterprise customers. The underlying positive trends in our business give us confidence in accelerating ARR growth to approximately 30% for Fiscal '19. This growth will be driven by fewer subscriptions at higher ARPS, which reflects the trends we're seeing with both our cloud products and Collections upsell. As such, we've revised our outlook for subscription additions for the year.As Andrew mentioned, our next investor day event is just about three weeks from today. We'll use that opportunity to do another deep dive on the model and provide more details on the recent numbers and the path ahead. We'll also go into greater detail on subs and ARPS model to get us to the Fiscal '20 goals and we'll revisit our five-year model.Now I'll turn the call back over to Andrew. -- Thanks, Scott. I'll reiterate what Scott just said and assure you that we are confident in our ability to accelerate ARR growth to achieve our Fiscal '20 ARR and free cash flow goals and we have a realistic plan in place to achieve those goals.Given the changes we've seen at the end of this year, it shouldn't come as a surprise that we'll be reducing the subs CAGR and increasing the ARPS CAGR, consistent with the move to fewer higher value subs in both the core business and in our cloud business. The transition is on-track and these model adjustments are happening for the right reasons. We'll go into all the details at our Investor Day on March 28th.Now, if we look back at the year, we've taken significant action to realign our investments and position Autodesk to meet our long-term goals. We are investing in building and expanding the digital infrastructure of the company, increasing go-to-market and development spend for the construction opportunity, and maintaining development of our core products. I'll finish by repeating the three strategic priorities that will drive long-term success at Autodesk: completing the subscription transition, digitizing the company, and reimagining manufacturing, construction, and production.We have already made significant progress in addressing the tremendous new market opportunity in the construction market and we will continue to pursue that market aggressively. In addition, some of you may have noticed that we are increasing our efforts in the manufacturing space as we just opened the new advanced manufacturing facility in Birmingham to highlight the work we're doing to move product design and manufacturing companies to a new hybrid additive and subtractive future. You'll see more of that over the next couple of years and you'll also begin to see the first results of our efforts to reimagine production.To wrap things up, I want to thank our customers, but especially recognize our employees and partners who have worked so hard to make last year a success. We're excited to be now in the growth stage of the transition, to see accelerated growth in ARR, and to be another step further along the journey of our transition. We're confident in our long-term plans and ability to execute while providing our customers with greater flexibility, more compelling products, and a better user experience.Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you would like to ask a question over the phone lines, please press * and then 1 on your telephone keypad. To everyone participating in today's question-and-answer session, we please ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If your questions have been answered and you wish to remove yourself from the queue, simply press the # key.And our first question will come from the line of Phillip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks, guys, for taking my question. Obviously, we've been focused on ARPS since mid-2015 so it's really exciting to see the inflection here in that number in Q4 so congratulations on that. And my question is, on ARPS -- and, obviously, you said you're going to give us more details in terms of just the framework for the long-term guidance at Analyst Day -- but wondering if you'd talk about '19 and '20, the puts and takes that you see? Because there's a lot of things going on -- obviously, the price increases on maintenance, the less discounting on the M2S, as well as discounting on the overall -- help us frame out the puts and takes of ARPS as you think about it in 2020? -- Yeah, so let me give you a little perspective on what's driving us. First, let me frame the problem a little bit. One of the things I want to make sure you're seeing here is the same thing that we saw. So, the core is doing incredibly well -- sub space grew 14% year-over-year last year -- we're going to see that number continue moving forward at least at that level, which is in-line with historical level so the core's doing really good. And, when you look forward, you guys have probably noticed where we're at with our guide.Most of that guide is due to our reset expectations in cloud so you're zeroing in on exactly the right thing right now on ARPS. So, what's driving the ARPS, specifically? So, what we're seeing is an acceleration of some of the strategies that we've already put in place and we've talked about in the past. The first one's being the upsell in the Collections. Like I said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing an acceleration. More people, as they move from M2S, are taking us up on the move to Collections. More people in the run rate of our core business are moving to Collections. You're going to see those phenomena play out into next year and into beyond.The other thing that's getting accelerated right now is our price realization efforts and this comes from, basically, three components. One, better execution in the e-store -- which, by the way, is very high price realization channel. Our renewal-based changes in terms of the channel costs to renew product subscriptions -- we're making some changes there. We've made some changes in the low-end margins of our business as particularly around LTs. That is accelerating our price realization. And we're doing much better in terms of managing the promo discounts across the products. All of those things, in the fact that they're accelerating, are going to drive up ARPS as we move into next year and beyond. -- Got it. Thanks, guys. And I'll just get back in the queue. Thanks.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is now open.Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. First, maybe, for you, Andrew, thanks a bunch for the example on the Canadian engineering firm to show that net add and ARR dynamic. But, just to make sure that we understand, the question is are customers buying for fewer engineers? I guess, why is it that a collection is able to handle fewer seats if, presumably, seats are a good proxy for employees. And, I guess, I think we all appreciate the ARR lift that you're getting, but talk us through how you think about this dynamic when you think about seat share within your customers, if that makes sense? -- Yeah, Saket, I'm really glad you asked this question, alright? So, this is the dynamic of subscriptions versus users, alright, and this is an anomaly of how we're counting our business. So, what you saw in this example is each user actually had two subscriptions -- so the number of users in this company did not change at all. It just so happened that each user had a seat at AutoCAD and a seat of Navisworks Manage sitting on their desktop. So, what happened is that the customer said, \"Well, I can now take this M2S offer, move all of those seats to Collections. Not only do they get AutoCAD, Navisworks Management, they get Revit as well,\" and that's what the customer did. So, the number of engineers sitting there -- exactly the same. The number of subscriptions sitting on each engineer's desktop -- one from two. Make sense?That does. That makes a lot of sense. -- We're seeing that broadly.Got it. Maybe for my follow-up, just a little bit of extension of Phil's question: could either you or Scott just maybe talk about the shape of M2S in Fiscal '19? Because it feels like we saw a nice reaction to some of the pricing strategies here in Fiscal '18 -- I believe the next action will build on that. Can you just maybe walk us through how you're thinking about the maintenance space by the end of Fiscal '19? And, back to ARPS, how should we think about the impact that that could have on ARPS? -- Yeah, Saket, it's a great question. We are expecting to see an acceleration of people -- maintenance subscribers -- that, as they come up to the point of renewal, seeing them move to product subscription. It's already moved faster than we expected, as you know, in Fiscal '18 -- 110,000 migrations in Q3, 168,000 in Q4. Both of those numbers were higher than expected. As we look at next year, the economics change again and the price to renew goes up 10%, the price to convert only goes up 5%, so the economics actually swing in favor of conversion even more strongly. And, of course, the product sub has higher value to our customers in terms of higher access and ease of management so I think we'll see it accelerate. What we haven't done is gone into trying to forecast each of the sub components to give you a sense of that, but I think our expectation all along was that Fiscal '19 was the biggest year for M2S conversions and I think, seeing how quickly it's already moved in Fiscal '18, I think we will see that acceleration happen again in Fiscal '19.In terms of the effect on ARPS, I don't think it has a massive effect either way. The price to convert or the price to renew is still relatively close -- a little bit more expensive to renew maintenance, but I don't think that, by itself, will have a big effect. What's likely to have a bigger effect is people who, at the point of migration from maintenance to subscription who do, like the example we used in the opening commentary, and actually move up from individual licenses up to the Collection.Very helpful. Thanks, guys.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan Your line is now open. -- Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. Based on the positive comments that you made around the number of users eligible to move to subscription that did and some of the other elements, is there a redrew on churn? So, other words, has churn actually improved over the last couple of quarters? -- So, in fact, Sterling, what we've seen is that there's absolutely no change in the churn rate of the maintenance mix. So, the maintenance mix quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, is holding solidly at the same kind of renewal rates we've seen historically. What you just see is more people are deciding to take the maintenance to subscription offer and, of those people, even more -- in acceleration over the previous quarter -- are choosing to go to Collections. But the actual renewal rate of that base has remained solidly intact on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis and even trend wise. -- And, to your point, Sterling, that's an aggregated renewal rate -- you know we do it on seat count today -- so what it implies is that, because you've got consolidation going on, the remainder is actually seeing a bit of an uptick in renewal rate, right, because some of them are moving off maintenance -- like the example we pointed to -- are dropping off, certain subscribers, as they consolidate up to Collections. So, we're really pleased with the renewal rates we're seeing in aggregate. -- Alright. Great. And then one follow-up, on the EBAs, I think you mentioned the subscriptions in arrears and that's an element that can cause some noise within the net subscriber count, if you will. Wonder if you can give us some insight into maybe some previous cohorts? So, an EBA from three, four quarters ago, how does that number of subscriptions' contribution into the total count fluctuate? -- Yeah, the biggest impact we see is on the first measurement of MAUs. So, a customer that buys an EBA, in every case, has had a larger state of perpetual licenses that are on maintenance and then convert those perpetual over to an EBA. So, the first effect you see is maintenance subs go down, enterprise subs go up. And because anyone in the company now has access to the license, we can't count MAUs instead of people who have access to it when they move to an MBA. After 90 days of measuring the MAU, that's what gets added to the subscriber count and what we typically see is a pretty significant uptick at that first read. Beyond that we continue to see growth and it's that volume growth in usage that drives one of the stats that we talked about in the opening commentary, which is we've had several renewals of EBAs in Q4 and, on average, the renewal is 40% higher than the original EBA. That's driven by usage -- it's not as much price-driven as it is by usage -- so big uptick on the first measurement and then slight upticks out through the remainder of the three years. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Zane Chrane with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering how should we think about the timing and magnitude of the EBA billing cycle change to deferred revenue for Fiscal '19 and '20. And then, my second question, what's been the feedback from customers on the new features and functionality with the new model subscription versus legacy licenses? Is it the features and new functions that's driving the migration of license-only users or is it more of a financial decision given the upfront cost? Thanks. -- Okay, Zane, I'll take the front end of that and let Andrew talk about the value prop of moving to subs. This is the first year where we've migrated the overwhelming majority of our EBAs over to annual billings, so it's still a three-year commitment but billed annually. So, if you notice, one of the stats that we're providing now is unbilled deferred. What that represents -- almost entirely represents -- is Year 2 and Year 3 of EBAs that we signed this year. A few other small cats and dogs in there, but almost all of that $326 million is the second and third year of the EBAs we signed this year. So, you can tell half of that $326 million will come out in Fiscal '19, the other half will come out in Fiscal '20. In Fiscal '19, we'll sign another cohort of EBAs, alright, and in each case, those will also be on annual billing so I expect to see that $326 million balance grow this year as we add two more years of unbilled deferred to the balance but only bill one year out of that $326 million. Right? So, the $326 million will be something higher at the end of Fiscal '19. I think it's pretty straightforward and we'll provide you those stats each quarter. It's pretty straightforward for you to just set up a quick waterfall model, then understand how that's going to creep into future billings. -- Yeah, Zane, this is Andrew. With regards to the other question about what's driving their motion right now, if you're looking at a stand-alone product, right now, the financial incentive is probably the core thing that's driving the momentum in terms of maintenance subscription moves because they're essentially seeing the same product with a cloud wrapper around it. We are getting a lot of feedback that the inclusion of some of the new cloud wrappers we've put in with the products around collaboration and sharing, in conjunction with the support offering we've entangled with subscription is adding a lot of value.When you look at Collections and the increase in people choosing Collections, that's more than just the financials incentive -- the Collections has actually been beefed up progressively. So, for instance, in the product Design and Manufacturing Collection, we've added machining capabilities into the Collection and people are noticing that and choosing the options. Same with the AEC Collection -- we've added some core capabilities that are making it more attractive for people to decide to take the Collections option as they move. So, it's kind of bifurcated in terms of stand-alone products and what we're seeing with Collections. Everybody likes the support. -- Sorry, what was that last part? -- I said everybody likes the support -- the added support. -- Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, guys. Congratulations.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. We've been talking with a lot of your channel partners throughout the quarter and there's obviously a shift occurring in the channels involvement in your new product sales. Andrew, how do you view the channels role in new product sales over the next couple of years and what are you expecting from them? -- Yeah, so I think I've stated pretty emphatically over time that the channel, one, is still an important part of our business. As we move out to a steady state, we expect our business to be 50/50 split between direct and indirect. With everybody seeing a larger business, we'll have a larger direct business -- they'll have a larger indirect business. So, the channel's a strategic component of our execution moving forward. In the new businesses, when it comes to booting up new businesses, a lot of the hard work has to be done by Autodesk first.Channel partners really, really want to get engaged in new businesses early on and we do engage them at various points in new businesses, but it's better if we do some of the early market seating and market development efforts and then start to migrate the business more over into the channel. We've been doing that with BIMS 360 in some of the new applications, but try to make a measured approach. One area where we've really engaged partners in the future is the Forge platform and building out customizations on top of our cloud platform -- that's an area we're encouraging partners to step up and get engaged in really early because that allows them to stitch together solutions for their customers and really drive their services business, which we think is not only important for us long-term, with the fact that we're going to be seeing new types of custom solutions built on Forge, it's important for them. -- That's helpful. Thanks very much, guys.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thank you. I was just wondering, Andrew, how do you feel about cloud? As you look further out as being a TAM expander, there's been a lot of question. Talking me through how you get to $6.00 in free cash flow? And, by the way, assuming -- you guys didn't explicitly state that, but I guess people are asking if that's still your target? And then, when you look out to your further target, the Fiscal '23 target, how important is cloud as a TAM expander to get to that level and what do you see as being a driver for that to drive adoption? Thank you. -- Alright, thanks, Heather. First off, let's be very clear: we are affirming the $6.00 and we're committed to that, so let's be super clear on that one. So, now, when we look at the cloud, so let's be super clear about a few facts. So, first off, in Q4, we added 45,000 cloud subscriptions in the quarter. Okay? A lot of people would love to have that number, so that's the net adds -- yes, that's the net adds -- so there's a robust add. We have record billings, robust billings growth. The cloud is right where we expect it to be at this point. What we've decided to do strategically -- and I think it was appropriate -- is we've deemphasized and moved away from the super low-end cloud subscriptions we had. They came under the guide of BIMS 360 team, Infusion 360 team, and moved much more toward portfolio strategy around things like Docs, and Field, and the higher value Fusion offerings.That was a very deliberate choice and that's why you see some of these subscription guidances that are being heavily impacted by the change in the way we're executing on cloud. But now, as you look out forward in terms of our business development efforts in the cloud, we're exactly where we should be in the cycle as we move to FY '23. So, one more fact -- just to comment on FY '23 before I talk about the cloud -- the business model transformation, the move to subscription of the core business, doesn't just suddenly run out of steam as we move to FY '23. It provides a solid growing foundation that we build upon but, to get to those FY '23 targets, you're definitely going to see us add a lot more cloud business as we get to FY '23. It's not necessary for FY '20 -- it's absolutely part of the FY '23 plan and you're going to see us grow that both organically and inorganically like we've done with any new business in the past. -- That's really helpful. Thank you so much.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, thanks. Good evening. First question, Andrew, you touched on this, is the role of the e-store. I think you said $300 million for Fiscal '18 and, at some point, you expected it to be at least half of the direct business, which would mean quarter-to-quarter business. So, if, by, say, Fiscal '22, '23, you are a $4 billion plus company, you're looking at potentially roughly a $1 billion e-store business. So, if the map is wrong, tell me, but could you talk about the infrastructure scaling requirements or expectations that you have to get to that kind of multiplier of your e-store business from Fiscal '18? And then, last question, it has to do with your product roadmap or your product development execution. You did that very well starting 15 years ago with the namesake program, moving to an annual release and that sustained your flywheel for recurring revenue. Given all the changes in the company -- you talk about a move in terms of core products and changes in R&D, R&D management and all that -- could you talk about your execution plans for development, not just in cloud, for the next year or two to make sure that you keep that flywheel going for recurring revenue? -- Yeah, OK. So, let me start with the infrastructure question. So, you're right -- we've been moving up close to $1 billion e-store business as we move to those outlying years. And an infrastructure investment is required to make sure that we manage that base in the appropriate way. So, I've talked about this whole effort around digitizing the company and investing in digitizing the company -- we already have the transactional infrastructure to get to that number, so we can take the orders, we can manage the entitlements, but there's that whole wrapper of infrastructure around $1 billion base. Just think how many subscribers that's going to be -- it's in the millions, right, and you want to take care of that base, you want to engage with that base, you want to have intelligence on that base so that you can easily see what's going on with those customers.That's the infrastructure we're building out: the inward-facing infrastructure that allows us to understand the customer that came to us electronically, but also the infrastructure that faces the customer that allows them to, on their own without any intervention from an Autodesk person, -manage their relationship with Autodesk. So, you'll see us building out both of those pieces of infrastructure over time. Right now, obviously, we've already got the core transactional infrastructure to drive the results here.Now, when we talk about the R&D cadence, so one of the things I did -- and I think you astutely noticed this -- is that we've split the development efforts up into essentially what is the core business -- design and creation products, inventor, AutoCAD, Revit, Max, Maya -- and the new business products, essentially around the cloud construction-based products, the new kind of advanced manufacturing products. One of the key things that's going on inside the design and creation organization is spinning that flywheel on development where there's a rapid cadence of small, incremental additions and upgrades to the product that keep the customer seeing progress. Now, they're going to see progress not only in the product, but for those people who manage large installations over the next 18 months or so, they're going to see progress on how easy it is to manage their installations with Autodesk.So, over a 12 to 18-month period, people are going to see a lot of functionality show up. The experience we aspire to, Jay, is like what you're seeing with Office 365 right now, where these little updates come in and they give you a quick little dialogue that says, \"Here's the things that we just updated for your Office experience.\" That's where we're heading -- we're actually making very good progress in that direction -- and that's how customers are going to be able to digest a continuous stream of upgrades without this kind of big thud that we used to do. -- Thanks, Andrew.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what kind of uptake you've seen from unsubscribers during the year and then any plans to address that base going into Fiscal '19? -- Yeah, so, historically, the non-subscribers are absorbed into our run rate. We run promos -- we've been running promos on a cadence of about twice a year -- so you saw that we did fairly successfully in the promos this year. I can't remember exactly the number of non-subscribers we brought in through promos last year -- we did two promos, one in Q1 and one in Q3. What we're doing this year, as we move forward, one, on the non-paying non-subscribers side, this is the year we're instrumenting our license compliance efforts so we're actually putting out more intelligence and capability that actually tells the customer in the product that they're working with a non-compliant copy and maybe they might want to investigate how they got there and also allowing them to contact us quickly and buy.If you look at what what we're doing the legacy base -- the non-subscribers that have fallen off maintenance and they're sitting on old perpetual licenses -- we're actually rolling out a new set of promos, lower discounts but actually have some insurance policies built into it where, if the customer moves and falls off two years from now, they can default back to the old perpetual release they had at the time they moved. They don't get the latest -- they just get their old one -- so it's like an insurance policy to provide even more attraction to that base to come and move forward. We're going to see how that works as we move into this year.This past year -- I got the number in front of me -- we moved 50,000 users into our paying base from promotions like this. We actually expect this new promotion to do as well, if not better, than some of those past promotions. -- Yeah. And, Ken, promotions are one way that we go after the legacy bases. In many cases, they end up coming back to us as the product that they're using, if they're not on maintenance, ages out. And, as it gets older and older, their ability to communicate with other partners around them -- whether they're in manufacturing and part of a supply chain or they're a contractor on AEC -- as their version becomes more and more down-level, their ability to exchange files becomes harder and harder. File types change through time. So, promos is one way, a financial lever to pull. Another is, since all of these are network-type used products -- in other words, they're used in conjunction with other companies -- they end up needing to get the latest release just to stay compliant. -- Great. And, I guess, just a bigger picture question: could you rank order what factors might cause you to exceed your current ARR growth targets for Fiscal '19? -- Yeah, that's a little bit of a loaded question. What I'd say is what we've seen so far is faster progression in ARPS growth than we had previously anticipated -- a lot of it based on the factors that, again, Andrew talked about earlier. Some of it's coming from consolidation of subscriptions where people are moving up to the Collections at a faster pace than we had saw. The uptick of maintenance to subscription has been a bit of a catalyst for that. E-store has been bigger than we expected and we'll continue to drive that faster. Our renewal base, remember, when we sell a new product through the channel, there's a higher margin for the channel partner than when we sell a renewal through a partner.And as that renewal base grows out through time, the lower channel cost-end effect accretes to us as well. That's also driving ARPS. So, there's a whole set of things that are driving ARPS growth even faster than we expected -- I would say that's probably been the bigger upside. And you've seen subs, in particular around cloud, subs are coming in at a slightly lower level but at a higher price point. -- Great. Thank you very much.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.Thank you, guys, for taking the question. So, not to be too bear-ish, but we've seen two quarters in a row where the net subscriber adds have come in below people's expectations and you guys have taken your targets down and, if I'm not mistaken, it's two different explanations for why it happened. Last quarter, it was more about heavily promoted cloud subscriptions not being in the number going forward basis and, this quarter, it was more about the difference between what a subscriber is and what a subscription is and more subscriptions getting collected into one Collection. How do we garner confidence that this is the last take down in terms of our net subscription add estimates on a going forward basis? Is there any visibility you can give us into any excess that might be in that base on a going forward basis that you feel comfortable that this number's not coming down again? -- Yeah. First, let me acknowledge your frustration that you might be having with the way this has played out over the last two quarters -- I just have to acknowledge that. It doesn't help you with your modeling, it doesn't help you with some of your core efforts, so I absolutely want to acknowledge that. I want to just go back to some fundamentals here so we get level-let and then I'll answer your question as specifically as I can. So, first off, remember that we broke out the core and the cloud deliberately now so you can start seeing those dynamics. The core grew 14% for the year -- so the subs space in the core grew 14% for the year. That's in-line with historical behavior. We're going to see that same number or greater moving forward, so the core shows some nice strength and stability. Alright? What we did see this quarter that was not anticipated at the rates was this acceleration in the Collections activity associated not only with the run rate of M2S and it was an acceleration that was off the trend of the previous two quarters in terms of how fast people we removing. And, yes, that did result in this consolidation resulting from upsell, but for the right reasons. We saw the appreciation of ARR associated with that.So, when you look forward to what we've done with the guide, like I said earlier, the vast majority or the most of that guide is due to our cloud reset expectations and the majority of that cloud reset is due to simply not driving these super low value cloud subscriptions. When you look at the core, our CAGR for FY '20 is essentially unchanged for the core business. So, what can garner you confidence here is we understand a lot more what's going on with the cloud, we're now prepared for more acceleration around consolidation as we've seen it move forward, we know it will play out through FY '19, and we're holding to the CAGR for the core business that we expect to have in FY '20. And that's where we're at. You want to add anything else, Scott? -- Yeah, the only thing I'd say is, even in those two quarters, as you point out, with subs coming in, certainly lighter than everyone externally expected in Q3 and lighter than our own expectations in Q4. In each quarter, ARR performed nicely and that really has been -- we've said all along -- that's our top goal is to drive ARR and to drive cash flow out of that ARR. If you remember, Q3, ARR grew 24% so faster than Q2 before that -- actually, it was the seventh consecutive quarter of increasing growth rate in ARR -- and it grew again 25% in the quarter we just closed. So, ARR continues to perform nicely, even as subs have been a little bit lower than our expectations in the last quarter.Excellent. Definitely understand that ARR is the key number that you're looking at but also want to have confidence in the components building onto that ARR -- the trend line there going in line with my model. -- Oh, I get that. I totally get that. -- And I want you to go back to that core strength that we're talking about here because that's the important driver. You layer on top of that the factors we're talking about -- ARPS appreciation associated with upsell of Collections, better price realization, and the reduced promo activity. And, by the way, don't underestimate how the acceleration of price realization is going to affect the year moving forward. Those are the things you're going to want to pay attention to -- the core. That's why we're trying to help by breaking out the two.Got it. And, longer-term, do you think there's any chance that you have a view on subscribers versus subscriptions? -- It's a conversation we have a lot. Part of the investment -- Andrew's talked about three big priorities we've invested in -- one of them is digitizing the company. Part of the effort there in digitizing the company is to be able to count users as opposed to subscriptions. Historically, we sold shrink-wrapped product that had a license number with it so you can track licenses but you can't always track on a one-to-one basis who's the actual user of that license. Part of the investment that we're making in digitizing the company will give us much better insight into account-level metrics and then, within that, user metrics. And so, yes, we may get to that point -- we're not there today.Got it. Thanks, guys.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Monika Garg with Keybanc. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry to go back to the ARPS point, to you look at your Fiscal '19 guidance, you're guiding ARR to 30%, but your net sub add group is about 14% -- that mean you're guiding ARPS growth of somewhere 10%ish. Could you walk through the math and we achieved this kind of guidance? -- Sure, Monika, and it sounds like you're looking at the 605 guidance. The mid-point of the guide to ARR under 606, which is really what I'd like everyone to adjust their models to, is 29% but your math is still directionally right. And I think the ARPS growth drivers will be the components that we've talked about. It's continuing upsell to Industry Collections. And, particularly, as maintenance to subscription accelerates, what we're seeing is that, as people make that choice, is those who are eligible to upgrade, more than one-third are taking that, so that's going to push more people to Industry Collections that obviously drives ARPS up. E-store will continue to grow. The renewal bases is a big part of the ARPS growth -- it's a significantly higher yield to Autodesk, when a channel partner sells a renew, versus selling a new product. And so, as renewal becomes a bigger part of our overall revenue, obviously, the cost of selling to the channel comes down. That drives up our price realization.And we've made some very specific changes on partner margins around the low end, specifically, AutoCAD LT, and what those margins look like. So, you add those factors together, along with reduced promotional activity and discounting -- that's what's going to drive that ARPS growth rate. And, if anything, what we've seen is it move up faster than we expected. -- Got it. Thanks, Scott. And then, just the follow-up, your 1Q revenue growth guidance is somewhere 14%, 14.5%, but your yearly guidance is somewhere 21%, 22%, which would mean deep ramp acceleration and revenue growth toward second half. Maybe walk us through the factors that could lead to that acceleration? Is it like ARPS growth is more second-half accelerated or any other factors? Thank you. -- Yeah, that's exactly what it is. And, if you recall, so, it's ARPS growth mostly. We do see some growth in subs throughout the year, but it's mostly ARPS growth. But, remember, too, the maintenance to subscription program, the annual change in price points on that come into effect in Q2 and so that also... that not only affects Q2 but, of course, direct-end, when we sell that, it drops into deferred revenue, it comes back out of deferred revenue as the year goes on, so it has a lesser effect earlier in the year and a bigger effect later in the year. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. Hi, guys. Thanks for your explanations on the mechanics of how this is going. I wanted to ask one question on maintenance subs and then just a follow-up question on ARR and then converting to billings growth. So, on the maintenance subs, Scott, I think you said the expected decline in maintenance subs was primarily related to the M2S program so that leads me to the question, if that was the primary factor, what are the secondary factors in the decline in maintenance subs? -- Yup, there's always a certain number of non-renew. Right? We don't have 100% renewal rates, Steve, so as the maintenance base is bigger in Q4, that drives the other piece of why you saw the decline in maintenance subs. So, 168,000 of the 244,000 that maintenance came down, 168,000 migrated -- the remainder are some form of non-renew. Remember the example we gave, though. That customer, those were 42 licenses on maintenance that converted over to 20 subs, so some of that non-renew is actually good news -- it's individual licenses that are converting up to Collections. -- Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then, on the follow-up, is there anything that could surprise you guys when it comes to eventually converting that ARR to billings growth? And then I want to sneak in, maybe, a related question if I could define it that way: thinking about post-Fiscal '20, how should we think about how ARPS and free cash flow, how that trajectory flows after Fiscal '20? Should the ARPS growth peak in Fiscal '20 and then decelerate fairly gradually because you're still layering on subscriptions faster than you're converting the base? So, how should we think about longer-term trajectory as well? -- Okay. That's quite a suite of questions, there, Steve. Let me take the billings one first. I think the other thing to think about as we talk about ARPS and how that's going to grow and how that's going to drive billings out through Fiscal '20, billings, so the two big drivers are cash flow -- which I think is the source of your question -- our net income -- you have a good sense of that from the targets we've given -- and billings, which drives deferred revenue growth. The only other effect besides the ARPS growth that'll drive the billings side of that that you need to bear in mind is we've always had a steady proportion of customers that buy multi-year. So, if you go back to when, before we started the transition, we were selling maintenance agreements, somewhere between 20% and 25% of our customers who bought a maintenance agreement bought a multi-year. That's been pretty steady.Of course, when we launched maintenance to subscription, we cut that off -- we cut off multi-year maintenance subs. What we see, interestingly, in product subs -- off a much smaller base, of course -- is many of them are also buying. In fact, it's almost the exact same proportion of product subs customers are buying multi-year as well. So, as you're thinking about your billings model out through Fiscal '20, remember that we've had a decline in Fiscal '18 in billings driven by no multi-year maintenance. The same proportion of customers are also buying multi-year product subs and, as product subs become a bigger part of the base, that's going to drive billings as well.The other factor to layer in -- two other factors to layer in on that -- the bleed back of unbilled deferred which we talked about earlier with Zane's question, make sure you're modeling that in. We have a year of unbilled deferred that's built up to $326 million. That'll build again in Fiscal '19 and then, by Fiscal '20, we'll actually have two years of unbilled deferred bleeding back into the billing stream so add that in. And then, finally, just from a cash flow -- not from a billings standpoint -- bear in mind that Fiscal '19 has these two one-time events that total about $130 million of cash outflows, partly driven by the cash payments for the restructuring, partly the exit tax from moving our operational center in Europe from Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland to Dublin, Ireland. -- And the only point I'll add, Steve, just to reinforce what he said about multi-year, the multi-year is not going to happen for no reason at all. As we enter into Fiscal '20, we're actually entering the first group of M2S customers that are seeing their M2S period end so they're going to want to lock in their price. That's been a historic behavior. What happens is customers say, \"Okay, I want some price stability out there,\" so they'll buy multi-year. And the fact that we had such a large tranche of initial M2S customers, you'll see that just naturally migrate into the business in FY '20. -- And then, guys, if you could answer the question I snuck in there, that would be great, which is how should we think about the trajectory after Fiscal '20 in terms of growth rates as we layer on the subscription revenue and more of that until you get to more of a steady state? How should that progress? -- Steve, I think there's no big change to the path that we had laid out on that at our last Investor Day. Probably the better thing to do, rather than try to tackle the moving parts here, is to say we have our Investor Day three weeks from tomorrow here and, at that point, we'll not only give you a little more granularity on the path to Fiscal '20, but we'll also give you a little more granularity on the five-year plan. So, that might be the best thing to do is to hold off on that until March 28th. -- Terrific. Thank you very much, guys.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is all the time we have for questions today. So, now I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Dave Gennarelli, Investor Relations, for closing comments and remarks. -- Great. Well, thanks, everybody. As Scott just mentioned, we have our Investor Day coming up on March 28th here in our office in San Francisco. We'll also be at the Bernstein conference on April 10th in Boston. We're going to follow that up with an NDR in Boston on April 11th and in New York on April 12th. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can reach me at (415)507-6033.

The question lingering in investors' minds is whether this semiconductor company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise or not in the quarter.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, its results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate each time, with an average positive surprise of 10.1%. So, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at 31 cents, reflecting a massive year-over-year increase of 40.9%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $611.7 million, up roughly 7% from the year-ago quarter.We believe strong demand for Marvell's 4G LTE products and acquisition synergies will act as catalysts. The company's current restructuring initiative will help it improve its cloud infrastructure and applications, which is anticipated to drive the top and bottom lines.Marvell is a promising player in the solid state drive (SSD) controllers market. Over the coming years, the company expects an increasing number of PCs/servers to use the flash-based solid state technology for storage. The storage market is witnessing a steady increase in demand, given fast-growing data volume, especially the exponential growth in unstructured data. NAND (non-volatile storage technology) demand is expected to remain very strong in 2018 as well. SSD demand will also rise and might even surpass the manufacturing capacity, leading to periodic shortage and higher pricing in the near term.Marvell has been benefiting from this growing demand for SSD products. Notably, the company's storage revenues is increasing sequentially in the last two quarters, mainly driven by higher-than-anticipated demand at the SSD segments, along with elevated demand from enterprise.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 8.

These acquisitions expands the company's offerings related to machine learning.Further, partnerships with Booz Allen Hamilton and Accenture are helping the company to launch products and improvise its existing product line.

In the trailing four quarters, the company topped earnings estimates, delivering an average beat of approximately 117%.Before we discuss the factors likely to influence the forthcoming results, let's take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.The company reported mixed results for third-quarter 2017, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. Although revenues declined marginally, earnings improved significantly on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year improvement in the bottom line was mainly driven by the company's consistent focus on reducing operating expenses, partially offset by lower revenues.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Stratasys, a manufacturer of 3D printers and in-office rapid prototyping (RP) and manufacturing systems, looks well poised on the back of product launches and strategic partnerships. These initiatives are paving the way for the company to excel in the 3D printing industry, which is anticipated to witness CAGR of 25.76% from 2017 to 2023 and reach $32.78 billion.Notably, during the quarter, the company announced that Skorpion Engineering has accelerated the development of prototypes of luxury cars by around 50% with the help of Stratasys' additive technology solutions. The company also announced the launch of BioMimics for 3D printing of medical models. This will address the needs of hospitals, manufacturers of medical devices as well as researchers.The company also entered into a collaboration with e-Xstream Engineering, per which the latter will be delivering \"process modeling and structural analysis numerical tools\" to Stratasys, which will in turn be beneficial for the betterment of the company's solutions and hence the top line.The company's strategic partnerships with Schneider Electric, The Boeing Co., Ford Motor Co., Siemens, Boom Supersonic and United Launch Alliance have expanded its geographic reach and market penetration. Its clientele, which includes the likes of Airbus and Koninklijke Philips N.V, is an additional positive. We believe an increase in its client base to aid fourth-quarter 2017 revenue growth.Furthermore, Stratasys has also taken measures to improve margins. It recorded operating margin of 5.2% in the third quarter compared with 2.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.We believe that the company's consistent focus on reducing operating expenses will also drive results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

(Symbol: ADSK) saw new options become available this week, for the October 19th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new October 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $110.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $99.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $112.97/share today.Because the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.36% return on the cash commitment, or 14.36% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., and highlighting in green where the $110.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $12.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $112.97/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $115.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.82% if the stock gets called away at the October 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $115.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 45%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

The strong start to the year can be attributed to a surge in subscription revenue, which grew by 84% y-o-y. The growth in subscription revenue allowed PTC to beat estimates by nearly $6 million. However, the earnings beat was partially offset by a mixed performance in terms of support, perpetual, and professional services revenue.Apart from the strong Q1'18 performance, the company  to a subscription-only licensing model in the Americas and Western Europe. Under this transition, the company will switch its focus from perpetual licenses - which entail upfront payment - to subscription-based licenses that would realize periodic fees to license the software on an ongoing basis. Although this shift might hurt the company's revenue in the short term, it should also boost recurring revenues and drive long-term value for the company.Below, we have summarized the major takeaways from PTC's Q1 earnings using Recurring software revenue accounts for nearly 75% of PTC's revenue. This segment has been growing consistently and has reported double-digit growth for four consecutive quarters, indicative of the momentum PTC continues to gain from the business model transition. The division's revenue grew 12% y-o-y to $231 million in Q1'18, fueled by the growth in subscription revenue.Subscription revenue grew to $100 million in Q1'18, 84% higher than the prior year quarter. As a result of the transition, the contribution of subscription revenue to the company's total revenue rose from 19% in Q1'17 to nearly 33% in Q1'18. Further, the company witnessed strong demand across its product portfolio.Additionally, the company also reported a strategic alliance with BMW, which could hold significant potential. Under this alliance, BMW has selected PTC's PLM solution to support its digitalization efforts. PTC's PLM solutions provide data management solutions across a product's lifecycle - from inception to post-production. With the PLM market expected to grow further, this partnership could be a steppingstone for PTC to boost its recurring revenue.Professional services revenue declined by 10% y-o-y to $41 million in Q1'18, due to the company's strategy to shift services engagements to partners and deliver products that require less in terms of professional services.Furthermore, PTC's support revenue declined by 13% in Q1'18, as customers continued to convert their perpetual licenses to subscription licenses. Consequently, its contribution to the overall revenue fell to around 43% in Q1'18 compared to 53% in Q1'17.See More at Trefis The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoIn trading on Wednesday, shares of Autodesk Inc.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Autodesk reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP loss of 12 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 13 cents. The figure was within the guided range of a loss of 12-16 cents per share.Revenues of $515.3 million beat the consensus mark of $514.1 million and increased nearly 5.3% year over year. The figure was within the guided range of $505-$515 million.Moreover, deferred revenues increased 15% to $1.76 billion in the quarter, which reflects growing strength of the business model. Total recurring revenue was 92% in the reported quarter, a significant increase from 78% reported in the year-ago quarter.Per Autodesk, restructuring will drive long-term growth by realigning investments in strategic areas like digital infrastructure, facilitating development of core products and increasing spend on construction opportunities.Revenues were impacted by a 61.7% year-over-year decline in License revenues (7.7% of total revenue), which were $39.8 million in the quarter.Maintenance revenues (47.4% of total revenue) also declined 10.5% from the year-ago quarter to $244.4 million, primarily due to lower subscriptions.However, the company's business model transition continues to be on track. Subscription revenues soared 105.6% year over year to $231.1 million, driven by strong product subscriptions.Total subscriptions increased approximately 146K from the prior quarter to 3.6 million in the quarter. Subscription plan (product, end-of-life and cloud subscriptions) increased approximately 307K from the last quarter to 1.90 million.The company's maintenance to subscription or M2S program recorded 110K subscriptions. New customers represented about 30% of the mix in the quarter and contributed a significant portion of subscription additions.Autodesk is also gaining from the Enterprise Business Agreement (EBA) program. In the quarter, the company witnessed a substantial increase in deals valued at over $1 million with significant contribution from EBAs. Notably, Autodesk won large EBA renewals this quarter from two engineering companies, each of which increased their annual contract value by more than 50%.Cloud subscription additions were impressive driven by robust performance of BIM 360 and Fusion tools. The company's focus to fast integrate new technology into Fusion 360, advancement of BIM 360 platform and the growth of its Forge platform are positives.Total annualized recurring revenues (ARR) were $1.90 billion, up 24% from the year-ago quarter and 25% on a constant currency (cc) basis. Subscription plan ARR surged 108% at cc.Autodesk's broad product portfolio continues to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets. Geographically, revenues in the Americas increased 1% year over year to $215 million. EMEA revenues increased 8% to $205 million, while the same from APAC increased 12% from the year-ago quarter to $95 million.Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 86.5%.The company reported non-GAAP operating loss of $26.2 million in the quarter compared with the year-ago quarter's operating loss of $42.9 million.Autodesk exited the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $1.45 billion compared with $1.90 billion as of Jan 31, 2017.However, the company lost $78.4 million of cash from operating activities as of Oct 31, 2017.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $537-$547 million. Non-GAAP loss per share is anticipated in the range of 10 cents to 14 cents for the quarter.Buoyed by the encouraging third-quarter results, Autodesk revised its full-year revenue and EPS expectations. The company now expects revenues in the range of $2.040-$2.050 billion (mid-point $2.045 billion) compared with the prior guidance of $2.030-$2.040 billion (mid-point $2.040). Non-GAAP loss is now expected in the range of 54 cents to 61 cents compared with the previous guidance of 49 cents to 53 cents.Autodesk now projects subscription additions to be between 625K and 650K compared with the prior guidance of 625K and 675K. Total ARR is still expected to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Non GAAP spending is expected to remain unchanged on a year-over-year basis.The company also anticipates pretax charges of $135-$149 million owing to the restructuring plan undertaken by it.

In terms of the top and bottom lines, Autodesk grew revenue and narrowed its adjusted loss. Revenue increased 5% to $515 million, compared to the prior year's third quarter, and was up 6% on a constant-currency basis. The company's adjusted net loss per share checked in at $0.12, compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.18 per share during the corresponding period last year.

A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Andrew.Thanks, Dave. I just got back two weeks ago from the largest Autodesk University in our history. There were over 10,000 design, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and film production professionals in attendance. And as usual, their enthusiasm for and dedication to our product is absolutely inspiring.Now I know several of you are able to attend the event, and I'm sure you felt some of the same level of excitement I did. Now before we get started with the details, I want to point out that after we review our Q3 results, I'll discuss the restructuring that we announced with today's earnings release, which now brings me to our Q3 results. I'm pleased to announce that Q3 marks our return to revenue growth, and we continue to make excellent progress on our two major initiatives: completing the subscription transition and expanding beyond design with cloud-based solutions for construction and manufacturing. The consistence in performance we've delivered over the last several quarters increases our confidence and our ability to achieve the goals of the subscription transition.Now here are some key outcomes of Q3 that I want to highlight: Total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 25% at constant currency. Recurring revenue had increased to 92% of total revenue. Approximately 1/3 of the eligible customers are choosing to migrate to subscription with the maintenance-to-subscription program or M2S. We added 146,000 total subscriptions, driven by 307,000 subscription plan sub additions, making the base of subscription plan subs bigger than the base of maintenance plan subs.That is a great milestone. Now let's take a closer look at our Q3 performance. I think it's important to first note that Q3 represents our return to revenue growth. It's the first quarter where the year-over-year revenue is comparing back to our first subscription-only quarter.The growth was even better than it looked if you remember that our Q3 results last year also included $38 million of license backlog that rolled over from the end-of-sale of Suites perpetual licenses in Q2 of fiscal year '17. Normalizing for that, Q3 revenue would have grown 14% year-over-year. The trends we're seeing in ARR are clear signals that the transition is working. Total ARR continues to accelerate, powered by double-digit growth in all the three major geographies.Subscription plan ARR more than doubled, driven by growth in all subscription plan types, led by product subscription. We continue to experience tremendous growth in product subscription ARR on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Subscription plan ARR was just shy of becoming the major component of total ARR, and there is no doubt it will become the major component in Q4, as we anticipated. We achieved the growth in subscription plan ARR by adding a record number of subscription plan subs in Q3, led by continued strong adoption of product subscription.Even when we normalize for M2S, total product subscriptions more than doubled year-over-year. Another consistent attribute of the transition is that new customers continue to make up a meaningful portion of product subscription additions and represented 30% of the mix for the quarter. These new customers come from a mix of market expansion, growth in emerging markets, converting unlicensed users and people who have been using an alternate design tool. We continue to make meaningful progress in converting legacy nonsubscribers into subscribers.In Q3, we added another 26,000 product subscription through another successful promo targeted at legacy users, which is on par with the promo-related subs we added in Q1 despite an even lower discount structure. Interestingly, we're still finding that more than half of those participating in the promo are turning in licenses seven years back or older. This reinforces our view that there are a meaningful number of active users who are interested in moving to the latest software and have licenses that are more than five years old. There are over 2 million of these legacy users that are actively using an old perpetual license.Over time, we will convert a large portion of these users either through a promotion or compelling new product releases as their product becomes increasingly outdated over time. One more positive development with the Q3 promo is that we experienced a meaningful uptick in the percentage that purchased an industry collection. Now Q3 is not typically a big quarter for EBA subscription additions, and we experienced normal seasonal trends this quarter. However, we did experience a sizable increase in large deals valued at over $1 million in Q3, and most of them are EBAs.We'll see the benefits of the new EBAs in both subscription additions and ARR in future quarters. We also signed the two largest contracts in Autodesk history in Q3. Both were EBA renewals with large engineering companies, and both increased their annual contract value by more than 50%. These cases illustrate how Autodesk is moving beyond being a software vendor to becoming a strategic partner with our customers.Now that doesn't happen by wishful thinking. It's been very intentional on Autodesk's part to become a thought and technology leader in the industry and work with our customers to solve the biggest design challenges they are facing today. Now total cloud subscriptions continue to be a fast-growing subscription component. There are three areas of our cloud-based products that I want to highlight briefly: the acceleration of new technology integration into Fusion 360; the growth of the Forge partner ecosystem; and the evolution of the BIM 360 product and business.Let's start with Fusion 360. We recently announced the integration of two key capabilities into Fusion 360: Inventor and SolidWorks interoperability in the basic version; and general design workflows in the $1,500 per year Ultimate version. This will allow users to associatively move data back and forth between Fusion, Inventor, and SolidWorks so they can access advanced manufacturing capabilities, like 5-axis CAM and the automated creation of manufacturing-ready geometry delivered by Generative. This will bring these users one step closer to true push-button manufacturing.Next, I want to talk about our Forge platform. We are working with dozens of partners integrating with Forge and BIM 360. These third-party developers share the same vision as we do on supporting the needs of construction workflows today as well as anticipating their future needs in preconstruction and site execution. There are nearly 54 applications for BIM 360 available today.We also have customers successfully integrating BIM 360 with their existing systems using Forge. One example is a company that is designing and constructing large infrastructure projects, including hydropower stations, tunnels and more. Another large U.S.-based construction company is using BIM 360 and Forge to extend their workflows and services to facilities management. Forge is well on its way to becoming the extensibility platform for the world of design and making.And you can expect us to talk a lot more about it in the future. In addition, we just announced the next-generation BIM 360 platform is now available as a public technology preview. This new platform is built on Forge and integrates the capabilities of the BIM 360 family in a single environment that easily allows customers to pilot test and implement their next project. We've also had several key BIM 360 wins with construction companies.And in Japan, we signed a $5 million BIM 360 deal with one of the country's largest general contractors. In EMEA, we had a 7-figure deal with another contractor. These are just a few examples of the BIM 360 deal activity. Now we'll turn it over to Scott for a few more details on the M2S program, ARPS and other financials.Scott? -- Thanks, Andrew. I'll start with subscriptions and our maintenance-to-subscription, or M2S, program. Partially offsetting the strong growth in subscription plan subs was the expected decline in maintenance plan subs. It's worth repeating that we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance plan subscriptions, and the rate of decline will vary based on the number of maintenance plan subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate and the pace of the M2S program.110,000 of the decline in maintenance subs was the result of the fast start to the M2S program. It was the first full quarter of availability for the program, and we again experienced better-than-expected results. Approximately 1/3 of all maintenance renewal opportunities during Q3 migrated to product subscription, which is even better than the early data we got from Q2 results. And of those that migrated, over 25% of eligible subscriptions upgraded from an individual product to an industry collection.Once again, some customers were doing a partial conversion of their maintenance seats, but we're especially pleased that overall, participating accounts are growing their total subscriptions and growing their spend with Autodesk. In other words, accounts that participate in M2S are purchasing net new product and cloud subs, and we're seeing this behavior across all geographies. It's still early days for the M2S program, but as we've said, we'd like these maintenance customers to move sooner rather than later as product subscription provides them the greatest value with increased flexibility, support, and access to our cloud products. Moving to a single model makes the most sense and will immensely simplify our business and how our customers interact with Autodesk.Now let's talk a little about annualized revenue per subscription, or ARPS. We spend a lot of time on ARPS on last quarter's call and reiterated the influence on the short-term performance of ARPS, including product mix, geo mix, timing and the M2S program, which is having an impact on ARPS. That's a positive impact on maintenance ARPS and a negative impact on subscription plan ARPS due to the discount offered for conversion. I know it's easy to get distracted by the near-term noise in ARPS, but here's a metric to focus on: Product subscription ARPS grew nearly 20% year-over-year.And if we exclude the effects of M2S, it would have grown nearly 25% and had its fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. That's meaningful growth in ARPS for our core business. We remain confident that overall ARPS will increase in Q4, driven by less discounting and promotions, the price increase for maintenance and M2S customers, and the migration to higher-value products. Moving to spend management.We continue to be able to execute and drive results while keeping spend growth nearly flat. Non-GAAP spend increased by 1% at constant currency in Q3 and is flat year-to-date. We're achieving this through targeted divestments and reallocation of those dollars to initiatives that drive our transition. Andrew will talk more about how we're accelerating this with the restructuring and that we remain committed to keeping spend approximately flat this year and next year.Looking at the balance sheet. Reported deferred revenue grew 15%. At the same time, unbilled deferred revenue increased by $85 million sequentially. So total unbilled deferred revenue now stands at $148 million, which would have added another 10 percentage points of growth to deferred revenue, and we expect it to continue to grow meaningfully in Q4 and going forward as we move more of our enterprise customers to annual billing terms.Our view of the global economic conditions remains consistent with our view over the past several quarters, with most of the mature markets performing relatively well and little change in emerging markets. Turning to our outlook. We continue to see strength in our core business around product subscriptions, EBAs, and our ongoing maintenance and are seeing the trends we expected for total ARR, which is the key driver for our long-term model. We're holding steady or slightly increasing most of our guidance metrics.However, we slightly reduced our Q4 subs outlook related to our cloud assumptions. With cloud subs, we continue to see good traction with our core products, namely BIM 360 and Fusion. As the capability of these products has matured, more and more customers are purchasing the higher-value offerings that include the features of the lower-value products they were purchased last year. As such, we expect to see continued increases in cloud subs with higher ARPS and lower volume.Now we'll turn the call back over to Andrew. -- Thanks, Scott. I'll reiterate what Scott just said and assure you that we remain fully committed to the FY '20 goals around ARR, subs and cash flow, which brings me to the restructuring. Some of you may recall that last quarter, I outlined the three strategic priorities that I believe will drive long-term success at Autodesk: completing the subscription transition; digitizing the company; and reimagining manufacturing, construction, and production. The next era of the Autodesk will not be defined by simply a product or business innovation but in their combination.We must excel at both, and we must do that all in the service of our customers. Restructuring actions, like we're announcing today, are usually taken when the company is under an external pressure, such as a prolonged economic downturn or when there is a need to significantly cut expenses. In contrast, this action is being taken to support our evolving company strategy by rebalancing our investments, divesting in some areas and investing in others. By realigning our investments, we are positioning the company to meet our long-term goals.We will be investing in building and expanding the digital infrastructure of the company, increasing go-to-market and development spend for the construction opportunity and maintaining development on our core products. To fund these growth areas, we must rebalance resources and divest where it makes sense. We will, therefore, divest in some research and development activities that are not well aligned with reimagining construction, manufacturing, and production. We will also close some Autodesk sites that are no longer aligned with our global location and talent acquisition strategy.I want to reaffirm what Scott said earlier: Our flat spend goals for this year and next are not changing. To wrap things up, we're excited to be another step further along in our transition. We've been able to consistently execute on our long-term plan and while providing our customers with greater flexibility, more compelling products, and a better user experience. Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press * followed by the no.1 key on your telephone keypad. If your question has been answered, or if you would like to remove your line from the queue, you may press the # key. To allow as many questions as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question.And our first question for today comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Sir. -- Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Let's hit the 625,000 to 650,000 net adds for the year down from the 625,000 to 675,000. Scott, you gave us some color but some of the discussions having with investors looks like the maintenance-to-conversion program is working really well.Getting more subs from that component would seem to indicate that you're getting lower organic net adds into that subscription program. Is it just cloud? Or is there anything else that you're not getting quite the traction that you thought at the beginning of the year? -- Yes. Thanks, Sterling. It really is cloud, our cloud assumptions and what we see in cloud in Q3. So the core business is still strong.In fact, our core business subs are up sequentially Q2 to Q3, and they'll grow again from Q3 to Q4. That's what delivered the strong quarter that we just announced, with ARR up 25%. That's what underpins the guidance that we gave, the slight uptick in our guidance on the financial metrics at least for Q4. So the core business is strong.But as we look at cloud, the slight dive down that we've got there at the midpoint is really a function of continuing to see good traction. We're pleased with the growth. We're seeing our overall cloud subscription base, just to give you a sense of it, is up 150% year-on-year. So the cloud base continues to be strong, but it is still a relatively new business and it's still fairly choppy.We also have a really big renewal opportunity on cloud in Q4. Remember, cloud, Q4 a year ago, we talked about how big a quarter we had on cloud sub adds. Many of those come up for renewal this quarter. So we're trying to be conservative on our expectations in that cloud business.But it's, in effect, moving from a little bit what I talked about during the script, a seeding strategy with promotional activity that drove a lot -- high volume at a low price to more mature market that we see now that is likely to have slightly lower volume in cloud but at a higher price. -- Yes. Sterling, this is Andrew. I want to jump in, too, just before you do your follow-up question. So first, one of the things that I want reiterate that Scott said is the core business is doing awesome.I mean, the net adds for product subscription are up quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. They're robustly heading in the right direction. And let's remember, that's the key driver to the financial metrics. That's why you see us with a slight uptick in the guide around some of the core financial metrics.When you look at cloud, the construction business is doing awesome right now. And one of the reasons why I highlighted those large deals we were talking about in both EMEA and APAC is I'm trying to give you a sense for where that business is trending right now. Last year, we were doing a lot of work seeding the business, injecting things like BIM 360 team into various accounts through promos and other types of activities to try to get people exposed to the offering. Now what we're seeing is people stepping up and making large investments in the BIM 360 offering.So I think what you're going to see and we kind of started to feel in Q3 is you're going to see lower volume in things like BIM 360 but at higher prices because we're actually making bigger deals and going deeper into accounts. So the cloud is on fire. Construction is on fire. It's just in a different mix than we were expecting earlier in the year.We expected a mix like this further down in the maturation cycle. -- Got you, got you. And then glad to hear the reiteration of the fiscal long-term goals, especially on cash flow, which brings up the point -- cash flow, I think, was negative again in the quarter, getting questions from investors. When do we start to see that inflection in cash flow to get positive and start to trend toward those long-term goals? -- Yes, I mean, it's consistent with what the cash flow slide that I laid out back in December a year ago at our -- almost a year ago at our Investor Day. This showed fiscal '18 is the trough. Certainly, when we get to fiscal '19, we expect for the full year of fiscal '19 to see positive cash flows. Frankly, we'll continue to see in fiscal '19 revenue growth that you've now seen for the first time in Q3 as we've compared back to a quarter that was a full subscription quarter.We'll see that revenue growth continue, and we'll see earnings per share turn positive next year. But I think it's -- while we don't guide cash flow as a metric, it's not surprising at all that cash flows are negative this quarter, and it wouldn't surprise me to see them negative again next quarter. -- Right. Thank you. -- Thanks, Sterling. -- Thank you.And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. -- Hey, guys. It's Mark Grant on for Heather. Just wanted to dig in some of those large deals a little bit. You mentioned most of those are EBAs, cited the two largest contracts in history.But in the prepared remarks, I look and I see that you called out a decline in EBA ARPS. Can you give us a sense of kind of what that sales cycle is looking like in those EBAs? Is there any kind of incremental promotion that you might be doing that's having a negative near-term impact on the ARPS there? -- Sure, Mark. That decline in the EBA ARPS is what we typically see actually every Q2 and every Q3. So if you think about the way our enterprise business agreements work, they're 3-year commitments with an annual payment. That's what we see in the cash flows now.But that revenue is fully ratable over the 3- year time frame. So we've laid it out. And the revenue, that is unchanged. But the denominator in ARPS is subs.And for EBAs, it's a token-based, right -- it's a consumption-based offering. So what we use for subscriptions is monthly active users. And what we see in all of our EBAs is from the time they signed, the monthly active usage continues to increase, right. They access more and more of our products.So the numerator of the EBA equation stays flat on an account-by-account basis, but the denominator grows. And so we'd -- typically, we'll see that aggregated result in enterprise ARPS for both Q2 and Q3 every year, and then that begins to tick up a little bit in Q4. And then, of course, it gets much bigger in Q1 when we get the full quarter, the full benefit of all the revenue from the Q4 EBAs that we'll sign. So that's just a normal seasonality trend.It's not about any additional promos or discounting into those accounts. -- All right, makes sense. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking our question. This is actually Michael Barrett sitting on for Phil. I wanted to touch on the 2/3 of maintenance customers who were up for renewal, who decided not to migrate.Do you have a sense of their thinking about the timing of migration? Are they just waiting until next year? Are they going to write out the price increase as long as they can? Any sense of that, that you could give would be great. -- Yes. Look, I think what's really kind of straightforward here is it's a small price increase this year. So when you're looking at a 5% price increase, you say, \"Okay, look, I'm going to ride this out probably to the 10% price increase and reevaluate my options at my next renewal cycle.\" And if you're really concerned about holding on to your perpetual rights as long as possible and locking in a release at some point, you're going to do that. That's really what's happening.What's interesting is we actually didn't expect to see as much front-loading as we're seeing right now. So we're way ahead of our expectations. We expected the surge to start next year as we got close to the 10%. So this gives us a lot more confidence in terms of how this program is going to play out over the next two years.But really, there -- a 5% price increase, if you wanted to hedge your bets, you just wait until the next renewal cycle. -- Michael, the other interesting point there that -- and we've talked about this in the past, is we also look at the migration rate by customer size. And what you see is the smallest customers are the most reluctant to give up their perpetual license, and the biggest customers, they're ready for subscriptions. In many cases, they are already buying a lot of products on subscription. So they're moving the most quickly. -- They're also moving to EBAs. -- Got it. That's very helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. What impact on subs did the migration to industry collection among those M2S customers have on subs adds, if any? I mentioned there were some consolidation of numbers. -- Yes, you always -- look, whenever you have the customers moving to an aggregate offering, there's always some consolidation associated with that. But remember, the price of the industry collection is significantly higher. But what we did see in these M2S accounts is all of these accounts, when the renewal cycle is over, they were actually higher-value accounts than when they started. So in some cases, they may have consolidated some of their offerings around industry collections, but at the same time, they actually bought additional cloud subs and additional other types of subs that actually made them -- the value of the account to actually increase over time, which is what we were expecting.So it's no surprise if you see some -- so we saw the exact, same thing when we rolled out Suites. -- Got it. Thanks, guys.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gal Munda with Berenberg. Please go ahead. -- Hey, I just have a question about the impact of the EBAs into Q4 and new subs. You said that you're expecting some tailwind. Can you quantify how much compared to last year you're expecting if you have any visibility on that? -- Yes, Gal. The -- what we typically see in EBAs is a 1 quarter lag from when we see a big amount of sales. So we did have a good quarter for EBA, a surprisingly good quarter -- or I guess it wasn't surprising, a good quarter for EBA sales in Q3, bigger than what we normally would see in Q3. We expect another big quarter of sales for EBAs in Q4.Most of those Q4 EBA sales will accrete to subscribers, the monthly active users beginning in Q1 of next year. So the impact we'll see in the coming quarter will be the impact from the sales we had in Q3, and that is already baked to the guidance that we gave. It's not something that I want to break out, but it's baked into the guidance that we gave you. -- Then just a follow-up. You said that the guidance implies lower renewals in the cloud than the other side. Does that imply -- considering cloud comps at lower ARPS, does that imply a significant improvement in ARPS you're expecting in Q4? -- I'm sorry, Gal. Can you restate the question? -- Sure. So in terms of your guidance, you said that your guidance implies, in terms of net new subs, lower renewal -- sorry, lower additions in the cloud -- coming from lower renewals in the cloud. Does that mean because cloud is lower ARPS that there should be a positive impact on overall ARPS in Q4? -- We do expect that. We said all along -- I mean, that's only one effect that I think will cause ARPS to tick up in Q4, but we do expect to see ARPS pick up in aggregate and -- between maintenance and subscription plan. -- Yes. The obvious behavior we're seeing right now is exactly the kind of behavior we expected, where we fully expect to see the ARPS tick up in Q4 just as we said it was going to tick up in the second half. We're well on our way to getting there. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Thanks, Gal.Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalla with Barclays. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Scott, maybe for you, just kind of thinking about subs a little bit higher level. Can you just talk about any commonalities that you're seeing from the first couple of slugs of M2S conversions? And I guess what I mean by that, are the first leg of M2S conversions maybe coming in -- focused in any particular product family or any particular vertical, any commonalities that you're seeing in the first couple of quarters of M2S? -- So it's going to be Andrew, and then we'll probably bounce back and forth to Scott. Look, one thing you're seeing is a large -- it's dominated by the Suites customers. The Suites customers are moving the fastest because they have this one path to collection, and they see themselves, I think, as basically locking in the lowest possible price per collection. So you definitely do see a slight Suites bias in some of the migrations, and that's evident.One of the stuff that I think is important for us to reiterate is that when you look at the percentage of -- when you look at the people who are eligible to move to something else, 25% of them are opting to move to a collection. So you might be seeing a bunch of Suites people moving to collection. You're seeing a very large percentage of people who are non-Suites that move to the collection, which is great and above our original expectation. -- Sure, that is great. Actually, Andrew, maybe just to stay with you. Again, kind of even going higher level than kind of the M2S, which, of course, is the focus here. But even more strategically, as it kind of get into your first couple of quarters as CEO, just maybe longer term around the business, how do you think about M&A strategically? -- Well -- so I'm going to pass that one to Scott. No, I'm just kidding. Look, I think when you look at yourself entering new markets, like when we talked about reimagining construction, manufacturing, production, you're going to be looking at M&A as a major part of that reimagination. We are going to be bringing in not only technology but, whole businesses that increase our effectiveness not only from a technology and product side but also from a go-to-market side and market knowledge side.So I think M&A is an important part of the strategy moving forward, especially in these reimagining exercises we have in the new markets in construction and manufacturing. So I see this as supercritical element. -- Very helpful, guys. Thanks very much. -- Thanks, Saket.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. -- Got it. Thanks. Good evening. Andrew, let me start with you with a longer-term question stemming from a couple of things you said at AU.You made the -- a pretty interesting comment or observation that you think that eventually if I'm quoting you correctly, that all subscription companies will eventually be consumption model companies. In perspective, you -- specifically, how do you see effectuating that? What do you see as the intersection of your business model with your technology platform enabling a broad consumption model not just for the EBAs as today but more broadly? Secondly, the near-term question for Scott vis-\ufffd-vis the restructuring. So you mentioned some product or R&D rationalization there. I assume it has to do largely with what you call your Horizon three designations, but anything on the sales and distribution cost side? Anything baked into the restructuring from channel management or every cost of that kind not specifically related to products? -- Sure, if you want to... -- Yes, so I'll go first. So Jay, thank you for asking that question. First, let me frame it -- so for the other people who weren't there for my comments. What I said exclusively, I said, \"Look, the cloud is turning every software company into a subscription company,\" and I said, \"Machine learning and artificial intelligence is going to turn every subscription company into a consumption company.\" And what I mean there is the value of the automations that are being created on top of cloud platforms is so large that people are going to pay for an outcome.Now we're talking out in the future, and I'll give you some examples of some of the outcomes that we might deliver in the future. So one of the things we've been talking a lot about is push-button manufacturing and this idea that, I come up with an idea, I come up with the design, and my design is instantaneously informed by the type of manufacturing methods I'm going to be using. And when I'm done with my design, I push a button, not today but in the future, and that design is immediately turned into a stream of bits that go to a configurable micro-factory that makes it. Pushing that button, Jay is incredibly valuable.When you go from having a design to instantaneously turning it into a stream of bits that you can then manufacture without any intervention by a human being, that's worth a lot. People are going to push that button. Now we've already been experimenting with consumption in numerous ways, the EBAs -- or consumption model. So that allows people to consume all of our portfolios.And by the way, it's how a lot of our largest customers are getting active to BIM 360, but we've also experimented with pure consumption models in the push-button sense. One of the most successful offerings we have right now is a rendering service for consumption. That's one of our most successful consumption offerings. People push a button and they get an outcome.They either get an incredibly large pixel at high resolution or they get a lower number of pixels at low resolution, and they pay for that outcome. You're going to see us deliver numerous types of outcomes in the future. Some of the outcomes may be, \"I want to know what the energy consumption of this building design is.\" Push a button. You know what the energy consumption of the business.I want to know what is going to cost me to manufacture this particular -- you push a button. You get the answer. That's where we're going to be going over the future. And as we mature and develop these machine learning-based algorithms and these artificial intelligence-based algorithms, you're going to see more and more of these things show up as consumption offerings.And that's where the future is going. Now it's not tomorrow. It's the 5- to 10-year horizon, but that's where we're heading. -- And Jay, to your second question on restructuring. It will have an impact on our sales organization as we continue to evolve that sales model. It's consistent with what we've talked about. Moving to subscription, almost by definition, will put us in a position of having more direct touch with our customers, right.The subscription model lends itself to that kind of direct touch, whether it's through an e-commerce channel, whether it's through customer success, whether it's through kind of an inside sales, direct touch. We'll continue to invest in direct touch. And so I don't want this to sound like it's the death of the channel. It's not.We've been very upfront with the channel that we'll continue to move this needle. But we also, based on our modeling, believe the channel business in absolute dollar terms grows. So it's a smaller piece of the pie, but it's more dollars. So I think the restructuring clearly will have an impact on sales.There will be some disinvest and some reinvest in that space, consistent with the plans we've talked about. I just don't want you to misinterpret that as this is somehow the death of the channel. We're not -- I don't think that makes sense. -- No. And as I've said previously when I talked about investing and digitizing the company and -- a large chunk of the investment is going to go into that. That is all about providing self-service to the set of customers that work with us directly, either EBAs or digitally direct through eStores or hub sales. That's absolutely going to be valuable to the customer.But at the same time, we're going to be able to provide more account insight to our internal sales force and our partners as well so that they can better serve those customers, do better cross-sell, upsell and engagement with those customers. So it's going to work both ways. We're going to have a healthy 50-50 mix of channel and direct, as I've said before. And yes, a big part of this investment is going into that digital infrastructure to enable that. -- Okay. Thank you very much. -- Thanks, Jay. -- Thank you, Jay.Our next question comes from the line of Zane Chrane with Bernstein Research. -- Hi, Thanks for filling me in. I just want to dig into the 30% metrics of the subscribers being added, 30% being net new customers, pretty impressive. Comparing Adobe at this point of their transition, I think it was only adding 20% net new customers. Can you just talk a little bit about the composition of that 30% net new customers, how much is coming from the new emerging products, such as cloud and BIM 360, et cetera, versus how much is coming from customers buying the product offerings? -- Yes. So the vast majority of that is coming from the existing offerings, all right. And it's a mix of several things. In some ways, it's customers who were -- remember, for a lot of customers, they've never seen a price like this before for the kind of sophisticated software that we deliver.They've never imagined themselves buying Revit, for instance, because it always looked outside of their initial cash flow capabilities. So now they can and they may have been using some kind of alternative method, either a free piece of software or something that's maybe not necessarily the professional-grade stuff we deliver, and they've decided now is the time to invest in Autodesk. We're seeing a lot of those customers. The one thing that is hard to know is how many of those customers that are coming in for the first time were users but were never payers, the people we like to euphemistically call pirates.We can't tell -- they don't declare themselves at the door. We do know that some of those people are actually pirates. And they've come in and they bought the software for the first time, which is great, but we're happy to see them come in. I think Adobe was seeing some of the same phenomenon when they rolled out their initiatives as well.The other piece of customers that we see are just people that are starting their businesses up for the first time. They're basically net new, but it goes in those three kind of categories. They're moving from something else, either nothing to us. They're moving from user to actual customer, and they were a customer before.Or they're starting up a business from scratch. And yes, we have been delighted with the fact that, that number has stayed as constant as it stayed throughout this experience. And when you look at our cloud business, especially on the Fusion side, the percentages are even larger. -- Got it. That's really helpful. Just a quick follow-up, how do you think about when you could, if or when revise upward your cost guidance? It seems like the opportunity in construction and some of the collaboration tools in the cloud, the massive potential TAM, which is pretty underpenetrated. How do you think about when you might want to actually revise upward your cost guidance to just capture that land grabber or drive greater growth in some of these emerging products? -- Yes, Zane. We've talked about that. We've committed to flat spend this year, which is overall most at the end of and flat spend again next year. But after that, we do see total spend.And when I say total spend, by the way, it's not just OpEx. It's COGS plus OpEx. But we expect to see it begin to trend up in fiscal '20 in a single-digit kind of way, but I think you can expect to see spend trend up in fiscal '20 and then beyond. -- Got it. Thanks very much. Nice quarter, congrats. -- Thanks, ZaneThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. -- Excellent. Thank, guys, for taking the question. Starting out on the restructuring side of the equation, how should we think about the timing? There's actually a lot of heads coming out of the organization. How should we think about the timing in terms of when those guys are coming out of the equation, sort of coming out of our models? And then vice versa, what's the expense ramp on the other side? Then maybe if you could give us a little bit of color in terms of what types of stuff that investment will come into? So where and when does the expense ramp on the other side of that restructuring? -- Yes. So Keith, I'll -- this is Andrew. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Scott for any additional color. So most of that is very front-end-loaded.We're going to see a lot of that -- those -- that expense [inaudible] it's come out of the system fairly quickly, right. The ramp-up to higher -- look, if I could do it all in two months, I would, perfectly honestly, because I'm in a big hurry to ramp up that investment in construction, in particular, because we're seeing so much success there. I want to keep turning that wheel. I'm very interested in the digitalization.The truth of the matter is when you try to hire back that many people, it takes time. So there'll probably be a lag as we head into Q1 and Q2 of next year in terms of the ramp-up, but our overall goal is to get that money invested back in the business as quickly as we possibly can. Scott, do you want to add any color? -- No. You said it exactly right. The only other comment I would add, Keith, is if you do the math on our EPS guide, you can see there's a couple of pennies of benefit that we're expecting to accrue to Q4. That's built into our guide. -- Got it. And then one follow-up on going back to the subscriptions number. Can you remind us -- is there any sort of impact that we should be aware of in terms of like a year-over-year compare, in terms of promotions you're doing where you attached cloud subscriptions to collections? -- Yes. That's part of, as we talked about the subs guide, change that we made in Q4. That was part of the cloud impact that we saw. We had two things that drove a really big quarter for cloud sub adds in Q4 a year ago.One was we launched user packs for the first time, and there was some pent-up demand for that. But the second one was we did have some promotional activity around -- specifically around a really low-end member of the BIM 360 family called Team. A lot of those Team subs come up for renewal in Q4. And so that's part of what's factored into our -- the way we're thinking about the cloud. -- Yes. You're pointing to -- you're pointing exactly to what we were talking about earlier. -- Got it. And so we shouldn't expect a similar type of promotion this year to attach Team subs to collections? -- No, we don't -- one, we don't need it, all right. Those promotions, we're seeding upwards. They were brand-building efforts. They were trying to get the message out there.Here's BIM 360. Welcome to me. We don't need those right now. The brand is carrying itself. You're not going to see that kind of promotional activity. -- Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. -- Thanks, Keith.Our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. -- Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Scott, you mentioned that a lot of the timing on the conversions are going to depend upon just when maintenance subs are up for renewals. Is there anything -- just to keep our eyes open for there in terms of seasonality, just wondering on seasonal trends there and when we might -- how we might think about that. And I had one quick follow-up.You did talk about some customers doing partial conversions, and I was wondering if you could just add a little more color on that. Thanks, guys. -- Sure, yes. Rob, the seasonal -- so the customers are eligible to take part in the maintenance-to-subscription program only when their maintenance sub expires. And we have the heaviest quarter for maintenance subs renewals in Q4, which makes sense because historically, that was our heaviest quarter for perpetual license sales. So it makes sense that would be the heaviest quarter for subs renewal.I think beyond that, there's not a lot of other seasonality. Q1, surprisingly, also has a fair amount of maintenance subs that come up for renewal, but I'd say the bigger effect is in Q4. And I'm sorry, Rob, remind me of your second question. -- It was just on the -- and then the other was just on the -- you mentioned -- I think it was in reference to larger or EBA customers doing some partial conversions and I guess -- I apologize. I just wanted to understand that a little bit better. -- Sure. We do have -- I think it's one of the questions that's come up as -- and it comes through channel checks that some customers are doing partial renews or partial conversions as they move from maintenance over to subscription. Partial renews a nothing new. It's something that we've had for quite a while ever since we've had -- even before we announced product subscription, we would have customers do partial renews, for example, when they were moving from stand-alone products into Suites, right.So it's not a new phenomenon. We are seeing it now. I think we've kept a sharp eye on that though. And some of the interesting stats that we see on the customers that are moving from maintenance to subscription and doing just a partial move is that also, we see them adding more new subs, either cloud subs or other product subs so that the net total subscriptions are increasing in those accounts and the net total revenue is increasing in those accounts.So it's -- even though there's only a partial renew, I think that the immediate thing that people run to is, \"Well, that must mean subs are coming down and revenues coming down.\" We're actually seeing the exact opposite behaviorally. -- Great. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, guys. -- Thanks, Rob. -- Welcome.And the next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. -- Hi, it's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. So you mentioned piracy in an answer to a question -- a couple of questions ago. That was something you talked about at last year's Analyst Day and since then, and the strategy is to communicate more with the customers pirating the software next year. As we approach that point, could you talk a little bit more about that strategy and then maybe how we should think about that unfolding through next year? -- Yes. Dan, let me kind of reiterate what we've said in the past. So this year, what we're doing is we're providing higher quality leads and insights to the existing capacity we have, targeting piracy. We're doing that through analytics and through dashboards and help people understand where, in particular, areas piracy is happening.As we move into next year, there will be much more in-product communication that we'll be rolling out and piloting in various places so that we cannot only provide better lead quality to existing capacity, but we can also provide more capacity through automated fulfillment to some of these piracy activities through direct digital engagement with some of these customers. So that's rolling out. We expect that to increase some of our volume of piracy conversion, and we expect that to be a continuing, ongoing thing for years to come. Given the number of pirated usage -- or number of users who aren't paying out there, it's going to be years and years of bringing those users into the paying community.But next year, yes, we're moving to more automation and more direct communication with those customers. I expect that to be more fully operational as we head into second half of next year and have an ongoing impact beyond then.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Koenig with Wedbush Securities. -- Hi, gentlemen, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you, Scott, a little bit more on cash flow here. So the -- it looks like the cash flow result was pressured by two main components: one is the -- it looks like maybe the move to annual billings is what's hurting your billings; and then collections, meaning DSO, not the product suite, were also pretty weak. So can you give us more color on those factors? And were there other things that were responsible for the weak cash flow result this quarter? And how -- I know you're not guiding for cash flow, but how should we think about how to model that going forward? Is there any way to think about it? -- Yes. The -- so Steve, first of all, thanks for the questions, and it's great that you're digging into the numbers. I would say that if you look at our DSOs, you can see they were up slightly during the quarter, up to the mid-50s, which means we had a little bit more back-end loading of the -- it just means that the linearity moves more toward the end. The quality of the receivables is unchanged.We have a very high percentage of on-time receivables. So there's no change in the quality, but when those come in later in the quarter, of course, they sit in receivables and not in cash as the quarter closes. So a little bit of a shift in linearity is part of what drove that. The other is the shift to annual billings for EBAs, but remember also, as part of the maintenance-to-subscription program, we shut off multiyear sales for maintenance as well, right, so the people couldn't front-run the series of price increases that we had laid out there.And so there's actually two effects that you're seeing in the -- on the -- in the long-term deferred: one is the reduction of multiyear maintenance, and the second is moving to annual billings from EBAs. -- Got it. So Scott, how do we think about -- well, how long does the pressure on the -- to the -- shift to annual? Does that anniversary, say, in Q1 and that subsides? Or how should -- and more generally then, how should we think about the cash flow rack?Yes. The unbilled deferred is strictly driven -- the number that I give you. So we had $148 million of unbilled deferred during the quarter. So add that to the deferred revenue.If you're trying to do an apples-to-apples, kind of how much the deferred revenue grow year-on-year, that number will grow again in Q4 and that's strictly driven by EBAs that are 3-year commitments with annual billings. That phenomenon will continue. We'll continue to build unbilled deferred throughout fiscal '19 and that -- but of course, at the same time, we'll start to see some of the unbilled deferred from prior years bleed back out, right, as the -- because we'll continue to have annual billings on that. I think the whole system gets to a more steady state by the time we get to late fiscal '20.Okay, all right, great. I'll stop there. -- You can -- if you want, then you can waterfall that out just by looking at the growth in unbilled deferred, which is the number we'll give you each quarter. You can start to waterfall out when that's going to come back. -- Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. -- Yup, thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. -- Okay. Thank you and good afternoon, guys. Just getting back to the restructuring. You're planning to reduce staffing level by 13%, obviously a material number.Given what will be some degree of transition in go-to-market, can you just expand on why you have confidence this will not impair your ability to execute your fiscal 2020 plan? -- Yes. First off, we were very selective in where we divest. We actually looked at project areas and functional areas that were not contributing to either our long-term strategic goals around reimagining construction, manufacturing and production. So that's where we're actually seeing permanent removals in cost.So those areas are not aligned with any of the goals or with the subscription transition, and they're not going to affect any of our ability to achieve those goals. In fact, the money we've taken out of those areas, we're reinvesting in areas that are absolutely going to allow us to achieve our goals. Now on the sales side, what we're doing is we're moving away from some of the things that we were using to focus on the territories and other parts of the organization to move more into the inside sales structure. We've already been doing this for a while.So we have nice machinery in place to actually manage these moves. So this is actually in line with actions we've already been taken. So it has absolutely no material impact on our ability to hit our goals. In fact, what it's doing is it's reinforcing our ability to hit these goals, especially when you look at the digital infrastructure side. -- Okay. Andrew, that's helpful. And then Scott -- so the unbilled deferred obviously grew very nicely this quarter. I assume you're still on track to the over $300 million by year-end? -- So it continues to grow rather than make that a metric that I try to forecast each quarter and update guidance because there's a lot of variables in that number. It's driven by EBAs, and both the size and the timing of the EBAs have an impact on that number. But we continue to expect that to grow strongly not just in Q4, but throughout fiscal '19 as well. -- All right. Thanks, guys. -- Thanks, Gregg.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. -- I wanted to pop back and talk about these net subscription adds. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for which elements within that mix you have the least amount of visibility. And if you could give us a sense for -- if there's a baseline of net subscription adds that we can think about as sort of being your floor on a quarterly basis or even on an annual basis if that's easier to predict. -- Yes. Ken, there's not a -- unfortunately, there's not an easy rule of thumb on this even within -- so if I just look at a category like maintenance. Even within maintenance, there are different rates of renew and migration to subscription by major product family, in other words, AutoCAD versus LT versus Suites versus other stand-alone. So, unfortunately, I can't give you an easy kind of a rule of thumb on that.I think the thing I would tie back to though is the strength of the core business. So -- and when I say the core business, it's the sum of maintenance plus product subscription plus enterprise business agreements, right. If you add those three together, that's the core business. We continue to see nice growth in the core business in subscriptions, and that's what's driving the results.That's what's driving the ARR that we just posted in Q3 at constant currency, 24% as reported, 25% at constant currency. It's that -- it's the sum of those 3. And that -- if you want to focus your model, focus in on those three. -- Okay. And just as a point of clarification on an earlier comment, I think you said that linearity was a bit different this quarter. I wanted to confirm, one, is it different from what you've seen in the past? And was there a substantial impact on ARR in the quarter because of that? -- No. There -- I mean, obviously, a later linearity in the subscription model does have an impact on ARR. I don't think it was significant. I think the change in DSOs was from the mid-40s to the low to mid-50s.So I'm trying to find it on my cheat sheet here. Yes, it went from 48 days to 54 days. So it wasn't a big swing, but it's a little bit later. It doesn't make a big difference in ARR, but the question that, that was asked in relation to was what's happening to cash flow.It does make a difference on cash flows, right. Those six additional days sitting, not collected and sitting in cash but sitting in receivables, makes a difference when you're talking about a cash flow number that's as small as our cash flow number right now. -- Great. Thank you very much. -- Thanks, KenThank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Hey, guys, congratulations on wrapping up a great AU, really enjoyed it. My question has to do with the restructuring. Andrew, you said that typically, these things are done when there is an adverse business. Clearly, businesses are going really well for you guys.I'm thinking through -- your goals to keep the spend flat next year and the year after, if you're cutting 13% of your headcount, it's going to take some time to rehire back. So how realistic is your plan going to be to reabsorb that 13% back in the workforce? And also, to an earlier question, these kinds of moves can be somewhat deceptive. How much of a buffer have you provided to Wall Street with respect to your financial plans as you go through this restructuring? -- So first off, let me make sure we're all clear on what our stated goals are. So we're flat next year. We are not flat the year after that, and we do not intend to be, all right. We intend, in fiscal '20, to ramp up our investment, especially in some of the areas that we think are important in expanding our business.So this is -- that goal is all about flat on OpEx next year. So with regards to your other question, yes. There's always a ramp in terms of rehiring some of these people. So you're not going to immediately rehire them.But remember, we've divested from areas that are not right now aligned to some of our critical key goals, like, for instance, completing the subscription transition, digitizing the company, and reimagining construction in particular right now. So we've been very deliberate in how we've actually executed this restructure to create the pool of money that we're going to be able to execute on, but we're reaffirming the goals for next year in terms of the total spend for the year. Scott, do you want to add anything? -- Yes, Kash, just to address your last statement about the offer. What I'd say is these things are never easy, and there's no question that it will be a rocky couple of days. But what I'd say is we didn't -- this wasn't a -- some kind of an across-the-board, peanut butter method type restructuring. It was a very targeted set of divestments that were focused in a few areas.So I don't think it's going to have the same disruptive effect overall, certainly to the overall core business, that it might have been if we had done something that's a little bit more, \"Hey, everybody take out x percent,\" which I think is a far more disruptive path. So I'm not -- I don't want to minimize it. This is a tough day and it's going to be a tough couple of days, but I don't think it's going to have the same kind of disruptive impact to our execution. -- Yes. And frankly, peanut butter cuts are actually, as Scott said, more disruptive execution, actually more demoralizing to the teams because everybody feels like, \"We're all getting squeezed but we're asked -- being asked to do the same thing.\" When you actually stop doing something for -- although it's hard for the team that was on the projects or initiatives that are being shut down, it's more motivating for the other people because they say, \"Wow, OK. We're getting investment over here, and we're not being asked to do two things with less money again.\" And I think that's something you have to pay attention to. -- Wonderful. And is it fair to say that you're reiterating your long-term fiscal '20, what had we out at the Analyst Day, the ARR, the revenue, the earnings and free cash flow? Is it fair to say that you still are reiterating that? That's it from me. -- Absolutely, Kash. We are reiterating our FY '20 goals, the 24% CAGR and ARR, the free cash flow targets. All of that is completely reiterated. Matter of fact, the restructuring is aligned to increase our confidence and our ability to execute on those goals and actually deliver results beyond FY '20, especially when we look at what's going to happen with construction as we move forward. -- Thank you so much, gentlemen. -- Thanks, Kash. -- Thank you, Kash.Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the floor back over to David Gennarelli for any closing comments. -- Thanks, operator. That concludes our call today.

(Symbol: ADSK) saw new options become available today, for the March 2018 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 102 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new March 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.20. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $98.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $106.17/share today.Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.90% return on the cash commitment, or 21.14% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., and highlighting in green where the $105.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.70. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $106.17/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.98% if the stock gets called away at the March 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

The design software specialist posted healthy revenue growth and continued net losses as the management team announced a major new restructuring plan.More on those cost cuts in a moment. First, here's how Autodesk's headline numbers stacked up against the prior-year period:\n  \nData source: Autodesk financial filings.Sales rose for the first time in over a year thanks to strong customer growth trends. Autodesk's gross and net profitability improved slightly, but the company still generated significant losses due to elevated operating expenses.Image source: Getty Images.Highlights of the quarter include:Executives highlighted success around Autodesk's move from a product-purchase business model to cloud-based, subscription sales that produce lower initial revenue in exchange for  . \"We're experiencing healthy trends in several key transition metrics,\" CEO Andrew Anagnost said in a press release, \"including [annual recurring revenue] and deferred revenue growth, as customers continue to embrace our new subscription offerings.\"\"We are excited to have reached a significant milestone where the base of subscription plan subscriptions has surpassed the base of maintenance plan subscriptions for the first time,\" Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren added. \"Our third quarter results mark our return to revenue growth as we reached the one year mark of subscription only sales,\" he explained.Executives said the latest operating trends gave them confidence in both their short-term and long-term business goals. As a result, they left the bulk of their full-year sales and profit forecasts unchanged. Management did lower its subscriber target slightly, though, as executives now see the base rising by between 625,000 and 650,000 (compared to the prior target of 625,000 to 675,000).However, Anagnost and his team aren't satisfied with the company's spending structure, and so they announced an aggressive plan to cut staffing by 1,150, or 13%, while closing several of Autodesk's operating facilities. The restructuring isn't aimed at reducing overall costs, they said, but instead is focused on shifting spending toward the company's growth priorities.Management sought to cast the reorganization as an offensive move rather simply a reaction to weak demand. The company is taking the action \"from a position of strength,\" Anagnost said. Investors were concerned that the restructuring move implied weaker sales and profit trends ahead, though, and they sent Autodesk's shares down by more than 10% immediately following the earnings announcement. That dip erased just a small portion of the stock's  over the past year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's what investors will be looking for in these announcements. Computer-aided design software specialist Autodesk will post its results  on Tuesday. Shares are  this year as the company shows off how a transition to cloud-based delivery can improve its business. Last quarter, for example, Autodesk gained 270,000 new customers in its subscription services, and the boost helped recurring revenue jump 94% to $784 million.Recurring revenue is up to 91% of the sales base today, compared to 69% a year ago. That success has given management plenty of confidence in their 2017 sales forecast. CEO Andrew Anagnost and his team predicted in late August that third-quarter revenue would be between $505 million and $515 million as the company progresses toward its goal of boosting subscription numbers by as much as 675,000 users in fiscal 2018. Investors would be happy to see that subscriber growth since it points to faster and more stable sales gains in the future.Investors haven't been impressed with Ambarella's latest operating trends.

In any case, shareholders are likely in for a bumpy ride with this stock since it has a huge range of growth possibilities. Ambarella's sales could take off if its engineers succeed in pushing the camera tech industry further with innovations around image capturing and processing.

The figure was also much narrower than the guided range of a loss of 14-18 cents per share.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise track record. It has beaten estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 23.52%.Revenues of $501.8 million beat the consensus mark of $494.8 million but fell nearly 8.9% year over year. The figure was better than the guided range of $488-$500 million.Management continues to emphasize on the fact that revenues will be negatively impacted by the business model transition from \"upfront\" to \"ratably\" as well as lower initial purchase price of new offerings.Notably, Autodesk's shares have gained 72.6%, substantially outperforming the 35.8% rally of the  it belongs to. We believe the company's broad product portfolio and accelerating subscription base to sustain the share price momentum going ahead.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Autodesk's business transition from licenses to cloud-based services is expected to boost subscriptions and deferred revenues. The marketing and promotional activities undertaken by the company are anticipated to sustain its growing subscription base.We note that Autodesk's broad product portfolio generates new customers in both domestic and overseas markets as evident from the year-over-year triple digit growth in product subscriptions in major geographies including emerging countries.Strong adoption of products is driving subscription revenues for the company. In the last reported quarter, the company's maintenance to subscription or M2S program recorded 63K subscriptions. New customers represented about 30% of the mix in the quarter and continue to contribute a significant portion of product subscription additions.Moreover, robust performance of BIM 360 and Fusion tools is the reason behind the continuous addition to cloud subscription.However, although the company plans to keep spending unchanged over the next one year, it remains concerned about increasing foreign exchange headwinds, which might weigh heavily on its expenses.Stiff competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon  , Microsoft  and Adobe Systems  also remain headwinds. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

The company can now address the needs of diverse industries like IoT, next-gen 5G product designs, autonomous vehicle, mobile products as well as high-performance chips for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Moreover, growing demand for energy efficient products is also a key catalyst.Additionally, collaborations with leading vendors like Autodesk  , Synopsys  and NVIDIA are expected to drive demand for the company's products.However, declining perpetual license revenues will hurt top-line growth at least in the near term.

The tech sector has had a very strong year even when you factor in the recent pullback. For example even with Facebook\u2019s 4.5% decline on September 25, overall the stock is still up 42% on a year-to-date basis versus the S&P 500\u2019s 12% return. The story is the same for Amazon (up 25%), Netflix (up 44%) and Alphabet (up 18%).Here we look at three large-cap tech stocks outside of the usual mega-cap names like Apple and Facebook. These three stocks all have very strong Street support. We used the  to specifically pinpoint stocks with a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 consensus rating from best-performing analysts.

Even though its latest earnings report on September 20 did not meet the most bullish expectations, it still prompted 9 buy ratings vs just 2 hold ratings. Analysts believe that a shortfall in Adobe\u2019s digital marketing unit is just a \u2018small speed bump\u2019 and that any rare pullback in prices should be seen as a buying opportunity.In particular, top Piper Jaffray analyst  reiterated his buy rating with a $180 price target (22% upside from the current share price).

He called the results solid and said that the company has some of the best intermediate and long-term fundamentals in the space. As to the the Experience Cloud bookings miss, he is confident that this comes down to longer sales cycles rather than a more negative change in demand or competitive dynamics.Indeed as CFO Mark Garrett explained on the analyst conference call: \u201cThe scale of our engagements is growing with customers increasingly adopting multiple Adobe solutions, which is leading to larger deal sizes but longer sales cycles. As a result, we did not achieve our Q3 bookings goal\u2026 However, we do expect greater than 20% organic annual growth in FY '17 on the subscription book of business.\u201dThis innovative software design company has 100% Street support. In the last three months, the stock has received 9 back-to-back buy ratings and no hold or sell ratings. Meanwhile, with an average analyst price target of just over $127, analysts are predicting that ADSK can climb by nearly 14% in the next 12 months.Over the last year, ADSK has already soared from $70 to $110 due to strong subscription growth. Meanwhile the company is also seeing the gains from a drastic change in its business model. Users are being transferred from a maintenance system to a new subscription-based model which will help revenue flow and prevent product piracy- and so far the change seems to be going smoothly.Encouragingly, Evercore ISI analyst  reiterated his buy rating on the stock on September 20 with a bullish $180 price target (20% upside potential). He says that a recent report from the AIA (the American Institute of Architects) is \u201cpositive\u201d for Autodesk as it \u201cpoints to strong future growth in design and construction activity in the coming months and years.\u201dThis matters because ADSK generates a big part of its revenue from architecture firms with about \u201c43% of revenue coming from its Architecture, Engineering, and Construction segment in FY17.\u201d And Talanian seems to know what he is talking about -- on his ADSK recommendations he has a 75% success rate and 16.8% average return.San Francisco-based Salesforce is one of the most highly valued US cloud computing companies. And the company also has the Street\u2019s seal of approval. In the last three months, CRM has received 21 buy ratings and just 3 hold ratings. We can also see that, on average, analysts are projecting over 14% upside for the stock over the next 12 months.The stock\u2019s most enthusiastic supporter is Raymond James analyst  who says he is \u201chard pressed to find much of a bear case at this point.\u201d His $125 price target translates into big upside potential of 34%. Peterson calls CRM a \u201cmulti-year success story\u201d adding that investors should be encouraged by the acceleration in sales cloud growth and consistent upside in billings.\u201cCRM shares have tended to outperform during the fall, with a potential catalyst from the company\u2019s Dreamforce user conference in early November\u201d says Peterson, who has an impressive 80% success rate and 18.4% average return on his CRM recommendations.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Tuesday's bounce is favoring technology, retail and homebuilders, which are getting the brunt of buying interest.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 858 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $20.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $115.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $95.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $116.05/share today.Because the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Here's what to look for in the reports.Home-improvement specialist Lowe's will announce its results before the market opens on Wednesday. The retailer has been trailing rival  lately in key metrics including sales growth, profitability, and market share. Its comps in the fiscal first quarter, for example, ticked up by just 2%, while Home Depot's jumped 6%.Image source: Getty Images.Lowe's recently took a page out of Home Depot's playbook with a $500 million acquisition aimed at expanding its influence in the maintenance, repair, and operations business. This niche helps serve the professional customer, which has been key to Home Depot's market-beating growth lately, and Lowe's is hoping it will do the same for its business.Investors will find out whether Lowe's can close the gap with the market leader, which last week announced blazing second-quarter comps of 6%.

That apparent contradiction stems from the fact that the computer-aided design-software specialist is shifting its business model toward subscription services and away from one-time purchases. The change depresses short-term sales results but implies steady, profitable, revenue growth that should power significant earnings ahead.Back in May, the company revealed solid gains on its shift. It added 233,000 subscribers to help push recurring revenue to 90% of the business. \"We're executing well and making significant progress on our business model transition,\" CEO Andrew Anagnost said in a press release at the time.Wall Street is expecting a further drop in top-line results this week as Autodesk's sales fall 10%, to $495 million. Subscriber numbers will be the key figures to watch, though. The company's most recent outlook called for paying subscribers to rise by between 600,000 and 650,000 in fiscal 2018. If that aggressive forecast holds, then investors appear ready to accept Autodesk's third straight fiscal year of net losses in exchange for progress toward a more predictable and profitable revenue base.Investors aren't expecting much good news from video game specialist GameStop when it posts earnings results on Friday. After all, mall-based retailers are struggling with weakening customer traffic, in general, and GameStop is especially exposed to that trend as its core product moves to digital delivery.

It remains solidly profitable, having generated $353 million of net income last year to easily cover its hefty dividend payout.GameStop's  reflects deep pessimism on the part of investors that this business will return to solid growth any time soon.

It has beaten estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 51.47%.Revenues of $485.7 million fell nearly 5.1% year over year but came ahead of the consensus mark of $473 million and the guided range of $460-$480 million. Management continues to emphasize that revenues will be impacted by the company's business model transition from \"upfront\" to \"ratably\".Notably, Autodesk's shares have gained 46.7%, substantially outperforming the 20.7% rally of the  it belongs to. We believe the company's broad product portfolio and accelerating subscription base to sustain the share price momentum going ahead.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Autodesk is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. : Autodesk currently has an  of +17.39%. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : Autodesk currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Autodesk's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +17.39% makes us confident in looking for an earnings beat. | Autodesk's business transition from licenses to cloud-based services is expected to benefit it by boosting subscriptions and deferred revenues. Additionally, marketing and promotional initiatives taken up by the company have accelerated its subscription base.In the last reported quarter, total subscriptions increased approximately 186,000 from the prior quarter to 3.29 million while subscription plan (product, end-of-life and cloud subscriptions) increased by 233,000 to 1.32 million.In fact, cloud subscriptions in the last reported quarter continued to show strong growth, improving more than four times from the year-ago quarter driven by robust performance from BIM 360 and Fusion tools.Moreover, Autodesk is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing through its comprehensive product portfolio. We expect its broad product portfolio to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets. Further, the company stated that demand for the core engineering product was strong as evident from 170% year-over-year growth in product subscriptions in the last reported quarter.Notably, the company's aggressive acquisition strategy has played a pivotal part in developing its business. Cost cutting initiatives are also a big positive.Here are a few companies that you may also want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release:The Toronto-Dominion Bank  with an Earnings ESP of +1.18% and Zacks Rank #1. You can see Big Lots  with an Earnings ESP of +0.72% and a Zacks Rank #2.Malibu Boats  with an Earnings ESP of +3.66% and a Zacks Rank #2.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" few years ago, Harvard professor and bio-engineering rockstar George Church was a guest on  . As many of the talk show's guests did, he presented host Stephen Colbert with a copy of his book, which he'd co-authored with Ed Regis. Well, sort of. He actually handed Colbert  copies of his book -- and they all fit in his front pocket.How was that possible? Church had programmed 20 million copies of his book into DNA, which is known, rightly so, as the \"information molecule\" in biology. The incredible density of information that can be stored in DNA, and the potential to use it much like a traditional hard drive, has not been lost on technology companies scrambling to keep up with society's exponentially growing need for data storage.Perhaps due to its having let the future pass it by on one too many occasions,  (NASDAQ: MSFT) is going all-in on the idea. It plans to deploy a proto-commercial, DNA-powered storage device about the size of a commercial Xerox copier by the end of the decade in one of its data centers. Even though it would cost billions using today's DNA synthesis technologies and only serve a niche application, the technology developed in the next three years will go a long way to ushering in digital-bio hybrid computing machines. It could be big for investors, too -- if it works.Image source: Getty Images.Microsoft and the rest of the information technology industry has spent billions of dollars on data centers to date in an endless battle to scale with the needs of consumers and growing demand for cloud computing. The most expensive part of a data center is power consumption, since it takes a lot of power to keep arrays of servers cool. That has become especially painful as traditional storage media have begun hitting their limits, which means tech companies won't be able to wring any further cost reductions out of scaling storage capacity with today's technology.That's what makes DNA so intriguing, on paper at least. Volume for volume, it can store 10 million times more information than the magnetic tape drives commonly used today, which would drastically reduce power consumption per TB or square foot of space in a data center. One copy of your genome, held in just one of your body's cells, holds approximately 1.5 GB of information. And since your body contains trillions of cells, all of the DNA in all of your body's cells stores trillions of GB of information -- more than all of the digital data storage capacity in the entire world (although it's getting close).There is one massive obstacle to commercializing this technology, however: cost. Consider that state-of-the-art technology today can produce synthetic DNA for  at costs of about $0.05 per base pair, and experts I've spoken to attest it could be two orders of magnitude lower for DNA data storage applications. (The end use affects the cost of DNA because each application has different requirements for accuracy, length, and yield.)Image source: Getty Images.Either way, even with the best technology today, it would take several months and hundreds of thousands of dollars to synthesize an equivalent amount of DNA held in a single cell of  -- something the bacterium does for free in about 20 minutes.The good news is the cost has fallen quickly -- it was $1 per base pair not long ago. The not-so-good news is Microsoft estimates costs would need to fall by a factor of 10,000 before DNA data storage could really take off.The company will likely be powerless to drive down the cost of DNA synthesis without outside help from biotech companies (supply) and fellow tech peers (demand). That's why Microsoft has partnered with the University of Washington and DNA synthesis leader Twist Bioscience, which has received investments from  and  , among others.Earlier this year the trio made  developing the basic technology required for DNA data storage, such as error-free read and write capabilities. The early-stage work also shows which areas need drastic improvement:The biggest cost reductions will come from synthesizing DNA as close to free as possible (nature does this pretty efficiently), although improvements in technologies allowing us to more fully tap into the awesome storage density of DNA will greatly improve the cost-benefit ratio as well.Put it all together and today's DNA synthesis and DNA data storage technologies would enable digital data storage devices at a cost of between $2 billion and $4 billion per TB. That's awfully expensive, but tremendous cost reductions -- more than 99.9% -- are possible with the proper effort and investments.It may seem ridiculous, but investors should know there is precedent for dropping costs of biotechnologies over 99.9%. The amazing success of the Human Genome Project, which was initiated to spur innovation in DNA sequencing (\"reading genes\"), serves as a great example of what's possible. The cost of sequencing a human genome fell from $3 billion at the start of the project to just $1,000 today. Illumina thinks it can reduce that to $100 in the near future.The recently announced Genome Write Project, which aims to spur innovation in DNA synthesis and construction (\"writing genes\"), is the logical follow-up to the Human Genome Project. Catalyzing a similar cost reduction to its scientific predecessor would drop DNA data storage costs from $2 billion to $4 billion per TB today to market-ready prices in the next 15 to 20 years, perhaps much sooner for data-center applications when power consumption and footprint costs are factored in.However, the Genome Write Project's main problem is a lack of funding: Other than a $250,000 grant from  , there isn't much funding to speak of, despite interest in DNA data storage for data centers from across the industry. If Microsoft is serious about delivering DNA data storage technology to the market, it may want to consider funding the public research project in addition to its in-house R&D. Otherwise, it may be difficult to drum up support from tech peers -- who represent future synthetic DNA demand.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Instead, Adobe opted to offer its solutions solely on a subscription basis for $20 to $50 a month, depending on the package. Customers were not amused, to put it mildly, with Narayen's initiative.Within days of announcing the transition to a subscription sales model literally thousands of creative types had signed an online petition \"demanding\" Adobe continue to sell its design software the traditional way. Narayen stuck to his guns however, and the result is the long-term trend that makes Adobe an awesome buy, even at its current elevated levels.Image source: Adobe.Adobe stock was already flying high when it announced record-breaking second quarter results June 20. Up 43% this year, Adobe shares tagged on about 5% of that stellar growth since its last quarterly release. That kind of performance may set off alarms for some investors, particularly value-oriented folks, but it shouldn't because of why Adobe stock has climbed to near record highs in 2017.The $1.77 billion in revenue Adobe reported in June was the best second quarter in its history, and nearly all the credit for its jaw-dropping performance harkens back to Narayen's unpopular decision -- at the time -- of shifting to a subscription sales, annualized recurring revenue (ARR) emphasis.The 27% year-over-year jump in revenue was impressive in and of itself, yet pales in comparison to Adobe's subscription growth. Subscription revenue soared 37% last quarter to $1.48 billion, and when service and support sales of $117 million are added to the mix, an impressive 90% of total revenue -- a figure that continues to climb with each successive quarter -- was derived from ARR-related products and services.In fact, Adobe's shift to an ARR model has been such a success its engineering software design brethren  (NASDAQ: ADSK) followed suit. One of the reasons Autodesk shareholders are enjoying a 49% jump in share value in 2017 is because it's delivering on its  . References to Autodesk's ARR results, including adding 233,000 new subscribers bringing its total to 1.32 million, are sprinkled throughout its earnings release, and for good reason.\"What's the big deal with ARR growth?\", some investors may ask. A primary reason Adobe was able to deliver such impressive revenue and subscription-related gains, while increasing operating expenses just 20% to $1 billion last quarter, is because it simply costs less to make a one-time sale that drives revenue for years rather than rely on software package sales.One of the largest increases in expenses in Adobe's most recent quarter was in research and development (R&D) which climbed 29%, and its development efforts and spending are beginning to bear fruit.Adobe has been working on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) solutions across its multiple cloud platforms for a while and recently took a significant  with the release of a personalization algorithm for its marketing cloud customers. The upgraded feature allows customers to input their own data and utilize Adobe's AI capabilities to \"predict what customers want and deliver it before they ask,\" which is quickly becoming a consumer expectation rather than a nicety.Another high-growth initiative is Adobe's early stage voice recognition solutions, the most recent upgrade is specific to its analytics cloud and combined with AI provides detailed analytics based on consumers voice-related data.The recent acquisition of privately held SkyBox and its 360 degree view and virtual reality (VR) technologies is yet another Adobe initiative to drive future growth.Adobe's ARR initiative may not have been a pleasant transition for users, but it's exactly the long-term trend that makes its stock such an awesome buy.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Autodesk reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted loss (including stock-based compensation expense) of $0.43 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.36.Excluding stock-based compensation, the company reported loss of $0.16 wider than the year-ago quarter loss of $0.10. However, the figure was much narrower than management's guided range of a loss of $0.27-$0.21 per share.Revenues of $485.7 million beat the consensus mark of $473 million but fell nearly 5.1% year over year. The figure was within management's guided range of $460-$480 million.Moreover, deferred revenue increased 18% to $1.80 billion in the quarter, which reflects growing strength of the business model.Management continues to emphasize that revenues, in the near term, will be impacted by the business model transition as revenues are now recognized \"ratably\" as against realized \"upfront\" earlier on.Total recurring revenue was 90% in the reported quarter a significant increase from 72% reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, Autodesk continues to make meaningful progress in converting non-paying users into subscribers. The company's 30% discount promotional offer added 26K product subscriptions during the quarter.We believe that the development is positive as it improves revenue visibility and growth trajectory in the long haul. Further, improving average revenue per subscriptions (ARPS) owing to price increases as well as lesser discounts related to shift from legacy maintenance plans to product subscriptions will drive growth in second-half fiscal 2018.Revenues were impacted by a 65.7% year-over-year decline in License revenues (10% of total revenue), which were $48.7 million in the quarter.Maintenance revenues (54.3% of total revenue) also declined 7.3% from the year-ago quarter to $263.6 million, primarily due to lower subscriptions. However, the decline was better than management's anticipation. At the end of the first quarter, the company had nearly 2 million maintenance planned customers.However, subscription revenues soared 102.8% year over year to $173.4 million. The company stated that demand for the core engineering product was strong as evident from 170% year-over-year growth in product subscriptions.Total subscriptions increased approximately 186K from the prior quarter to 3.29 million in the quarter. Subscription plan (product, end-of-life and cloud subscriptions) increased approximately 233K from the last quarter to 1.32 million.New customers represented about a third of the company's new product subscriptions in the quarter. New enterprise customers' growth was also strong as evident from the 44K subscription additions in the quarter, 10% more from the prior-year quarter.Cloud subscription additions continue to show strong growth, improving more than four times from the year-ago quarter driven by robust performance from BIM 360 and Fusion tools.Total annualized recurring revenue (ARR) was $1.74 billion, up 18% from the year-ago quarter and 20% on a constant currency (cc) basis. Subscription plan ARR surged 105% at cc.Geographically, revenues in the Americas decreased 3% year over year to $210 million. EMEA revenues declined 6% to $190 million, while the same in APAC decreased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $86 million.Gross margin contracted 40 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 85.8%, primarily due to massive contraction in license gross margins.Operating expenses as percentage of revenues increased 570 bps to 105.1%, primarily due to higher marketing & sales (up 560 bps) and research & development (up 80 bps) expenses, partially offset by lower general & administrative expense (down 70 bps).Operating loss widened to $98.5 million as compared with $78.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk exited the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $1.81 billion compared with $1.90 billion as on Jan 31, 2017.Cash flow from operating activities was $45.2 million in the reported quarter.

It's not necessary to delve into  or other such risky endeavors -- just choose companies that possess the right qualities.We asked three top Motley Fool contributors to identify a stock that an ambitious investor might appreciate, and they came up with  (NASDAQ: DXCM) ,  (NASDAQ: ADSK) , and  (NYSE: VSTO) . Read on to find out why they hold such promise.Image source: Getty Images. The American Diabetes Association estimates that more than 29 million Americans have diabetes and another 86 million are at risk of developing the disease. Given the prevalence, perhaps it isn't a big surprise to learn that dozens of companies have  aimed at treating this condition. One of my favorites is Dexcom, a leading provider of continuous glucose monitors. Dexcom's stock has been a Wall Street favorite for years as demand for the company's product continuous to soar.So what is a continuous glucose monitor? Traditionally, if a person with diabetes wanted to know what their blood sugar level was, they would have to prick their finger and apply a drop of blood to a meter. While this data was useful, it was also burdensome to gather. In addition, the number didn't tell the user anything about which direction their blood sugar was heading.Dexcom's solution to this problem was to insert a small sensor under the skin that continuously measured glucose levels. Those readings would then be constantly uploaded to a monitor, which provided people with diabetes with a real-time view of their glucose levels. What's more, Dexcom's sensors need to be changed out every few days, which provides the company with a recurring revenue stream.Since the product's launch, the diabetes community has welcomed Dexcom's device with open arms. Better yet, Dexcom's razor-and-blade business model has allowed its top line to soar, taking long-term shareholders on a very profitable ride. data by  .While Dexcom's growth is impressive, the company's system is currently being used by about 200,000 patients. That number is still quite small when compared to the 29 million Americans with the disease.The only knock against Dexcom is that Wall Street values its stock at nearly 10 times sales. While that's expensive, if you count yourself as an ambitious investor, I certainly wouldn't fault you for taking a small position in Dexcom today.Image source: Autodesk. Autodesk might not look like a growth stock given that both its top and bottom lines are heading in the wrong direction right now. The design software specialist's sales fell slightly in 2015 before diving 19% last year. Its annual losses ballooned to $582 million from $330 million over the same time.Both of those figures were heavily impacted by Autodesk's choice to abandon its one-time purchase model and replace it with subscription offerings. Yet while these new cloud-based purchases carry much smaller initial contract prices, they make up for that weakness by delivering higher-margin recurring revenue.The business model shift has made subscriber figures the key number to watch lately. And by that metric, Autodesk is doing a great job. The company grew its customer base by 21% last year and the solid momentum  on the strength of new cloud-based offerings that helped subscription plan recurring revenue double to $692 million.Ambitious investors should consider investing in this business ahead of what could be a significant operating rebound. Management is targeting a 20% subscription gain this year as recurring revenue expands by as much as 26% to account for a growing proportion of the total sales base. Yes, sales and profits are both likely to show just minor improvements over last year, but surging subscription sales are laying the groundwork for much better growth down the road.Image source: Vista Outdoor.

In part driven by the fear of greater gun control legislation getting introduced, gun sales had soared in recent years, but the election of a purported gun-friendly president and Congress helped deflate such worries. Vista called it an \"unprecedented\" drop in demand.At the same time, the bankruptcy of sporting goods retailers like Sports Authority and Gander Mountain hurt sales of recreational outdoors gear, as the stores were big sellers of its products. In Vista's most recent earnings report, it said a write-off of $17 million worth of receivables from a bankrupt retail customer lopped off $0.18 from Vista's per-share earnings. That was likely Gander Mountain, as its March bankruptcy filing listed it as owing Vista nearly $15.2 million.But the gun market is booming and the FBI just reported the month of May was its busiest May ever for background checks of potential gun buyers, with some 1.9 million investigations conducted. All year long it has shown the big drop off in demand following the election was more of a one-off event than a trend. Vista still expects it to take time for demand to recover to where it was, but everything points to greater growth again.While the retail landscape remains dicey,  (NYSE: DKS) scooped up a bunch of Gander Mountain stores and the retailer's new owner  has said it is rebranding the chain as Gander Outdoor. Guns won't be  as they were previously, but it's a hopeful sign Vista will have a new outlet once more.Trading at just 13 times next year's estimated earnings and a fraction of its sales, Vista Outdoor's depressed stock appears ripe to grow. An investor willing to bide his time during some likely short-term turbulence could enjoy some ambitious returns in the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The design-software specialist announced that it has picked Andrew Anagnost as its new permanent CEO and president. Anagnost had been serving as the company's interim co-CEO -- along with Amar Hanspal, who is leaving the company -- and chief marketing officer. He's also been granted a seat on the board of directors. All moves are effective immediately.Anagnost is a longtime Autodesk veteran, having joined the company in 1997. Among other positions, he has been senior vice president of business strategy and marketing.In the press release heralding the appointment, the company's chairman, Crawford Beveridge, said Anagnost \"has been instrumental in the development and execution of Autodesk's successful business model transition, and with his leadership, we are confident that our move to the cloud and subscription will continue to be successful.\"Image source: Autodesk.Naming Anagnost the permanent CEO is an encouraging development, indicating that Autodesk's leadership situation has settled down. That wasn't quite the case earlier this year, when previous CEO Carl Bass resigned in the wake of a tussle with activist investors Sachem Head Capital Management and Eminence Capital. Bass' resignation was matched by the departure of two Sachem affiliates from Autodesk's board of directors. Anagnost has filled one of those seats.Before that, Autodesk reached a settlement with Sachem and Eminence, which resulted in Sachem's gaining a total of three board seats. These days, one Sachem affiliate, Richard Hill, remains.Anagnost will certainly have his work cut out for him going forward. Although Autodesk's stock was a  earlier this year, largely because of its success in selling software subscriptions, it will have to ensure it can provide enough value to keep those subscriptions alive. In addition, the company has posted three consecutive quarters of bottom-line losses and is forecasting only modest revenue growth for this fiscal year.

Or triple? And if you're lucky enough, notching your own  ? Of course, buying into stocks with potential returns like that doesn't come without risk, but here are three that are hitting their stride heading into June and could be huge winners for investors.You may or may not have noticed, but gaming has continued to evolve over the past decade and has become so popular that tournaments and eSports events have nearly gone mainstream. One stock that has undoubtedly benefited from the overall trend of gaming is  (NASDAQ: EA) . And while investors might be scared off because of the stock rising 661% over the past five years, there could be plenty of room for it to run.Image source: Getty Images.If you aren't familiar with the stock, EA produces sports games such as  ,  , and  , as well as action games such as  ,  , and  , and it even produces mobile games for gamers on the go. EA was the No. 1 publisher on PS4 and Xbox One consoles in the western world for fiscal 2017, according to the company's estimates. Here's the thing: It makes these games very well, and it shows in its financials. Fiscal 2017 was a ridiculous year for the company; it set records for net sales and operating cash flow.What's nice about EA for long-term investors is that it dominates sports games, accounting for almost 50% of sports games sales -- and that means reoccurring revenue as those are guaranteed to come out each year. It's also been successful expanding into mobile games, and as a player of Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, I can attest that the \"  \" gaming model can generate some serious revenue. And in terms of juicing its bottom line, management believes its new development engines will drive down the costs of producing high-quality games.Gaming has been here for decades, and it only appears to be gaining momentum. You'll have to pay a premium to own shares -- it's trading at roughly 34 times its trailing-12-month earnings -- but EA is well positioned to benefit from the gaming and eSports megatrend for the foreseeable future.It would have been extremely easy for investors to give up on  (NASDAQ: TRUE) in 2015, when its business came crashing down like a house of cards. Adjusted EBITDA plunged, it was involved in a ugly spat with its largest auto dealership group, and executives left for greener pastures. To get the business back on track, TrueCar had to fix its tense relationship with dealerships; it did just that with its \"  ,\" and look at how its adjusted EBITDA has soared over the past three quarters.Data source: TrueCar's SEC filings. Chart: author.TrueCar's repaired relationship with dealers set the stage for the company to also improve the way it marketed vehicles and dealerships, which helped improve the efficiency of sales leads and returned growth to its units sold. In fact, TrueCar's year-over-year units sold growth has increased each quarter starting with Q2 2016, and it recently hit 24% growth to  . But the first quarter brought other interesting news for investors.While the automotive industry's new-car sales are likely to plateau at near record levels over the next few years, which is good for business, TrueCar has previously missed out on an entirely different market: trade-in vehicles. That's going to change with TrueCar Trade; the company announced it would be creating a six-month pilot program to offer consumers and dealerships a cost-effective and best-in-class tool with instant and transparent valuations. Since the used-car market is roughly three times the size of the new-car market, this could be a phenomenal business for TrueCar if it can find a way to generate meaningful revenue from the service.TrueCar's unique visits to its website continues to climb, its EBITDA results have spiked in recent quarters, its dealership relationships are healthy, and it's finally prepared to start launching new products and services to fuel growth -- TrueCar is finally hitting its stride this summer.Last but not least on this list is  (NASDAQ: ADSK) , which is actually trading 14% higher at the time of this writing thanks to releasing its strong first-quarter results. Autodesk is a leader in computer-aided design software, and it has a portfolio of products for industries such as architecture, construction, engineering, manufacturing and even media.Image source: Getty Images.But Autodesk is just hitting its stride after switching to a subscription model, just listen to what Scott Herren, Autodesk CFO, had to say about that: \"Recurring revenue jumped to 90 percent of total revenue, which is a significant milestone considering it was less than half that before we started the move to subscription.\" Herren continued:One competitive advantage that Autodesk offers investors is that the industries using its products are weary of switching because to high costs and familiarity with the programs -- engineers, developers, and designers are trained on these products. This is a massive advantage for Autodesk. Another reason Autodesk could have a bright future is a potential decline in piracy. These expensive programs are similar to movies or other computer programs that are often bootlegged or shared. However, moving forward, Autodesk has the chance to take advantage of using cloud software, which would make pirating its products far more difficult.All three of these stocks recently posted strong to blockbuster quarters recently and are clearly hitting their strides come June. You might have to pay a premium to own shares, and their potential high reward comes with high risk, but these stocks could end up being huge winners for investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: ADSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $113.00, changing hands for $113.03/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Autodesk Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $80.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $137.00. The standard deviation is $15.528.But the whole reason to look at the  ADSK price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ADSK crossing above that average target price of $113.00/share, investors in ADSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $113.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

However, the figure was much narrower than management's guided range of a loss of 27-21 cents per share.Revenues of $485.7 million beat the consensus mark of $473 million but fell nearly 5.1% year over year. The figure was within management's guided range of $460-$480 million.Moreover, deferred revenue increased 18% to $1.80 billion in the quarter, which reflects growing strength of the business model. | Management continues to emphasize that revenues, in the near term, will be impacted by the business model transition as revenues are now recognized \"ratably\" as against realized \"upfront\" earlier on.Total recurring revenue was 90% in the reported quarter a significant increase from 72% reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, Autodesk continues to make meaningful progress in converting non-paying users into subscribers. The company's 30% discount promotional offer added 26K product subscriptions during the quarter.We believe that the development is positive as it improves revenue visibility and growth trajectory in the long haul. Further, improving average revenue per subscriptions (ARPS) owing to price increases as well as lesser discounts related to shift from legacy maintenance plans to product subscriptions will drive growth in second-half fiscal 2018.Shares were up almost 10% in after-hour trading. We note that shares of Autodesk have outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the stock gained 37.8%, the index returned 5.5%.Revenues were impacted by a 65.7% year-over-year decline in License revenues (10% of total revenue), which were $48.7 million in the quarter.Maintenance revenues (54.3% of total revenue) also declined 7.3% from the year-ago quarter to $263.6 million, primarily due to lower subscriptions. However, the decline was better than management's anticipation. At the end of the first quarter, the company had nearly 2 million maintenance planned customers.However, subscription revenues soared 102.8% year over year to $173.4 million. The company stated that demand for the core engineering product was strong as evident from 170% year-over-year growth in product subscriptions.Total subscriptions increased approximately 186K from the prior quarter to 3.29 million in the quarter. Subscription plan (product, end-of-life and cloud subscriptions) increased approximately 233K from the last quarter to 1.32 million.New customers represented about a third of the company's new product subscriptions in the quarter. New enterprise customers' growth was also strong as evident from the 44K subscription additions in the quarter, 10% more from the prior-year quarter.Cloud subscription additions continue to show strong growth, improving more than four times from the year-ago quarter driven by robust performance from BIM 360 and Fusion tools.Total annualized recurring revenue (ARR) was $1.74 billion, up 18% from the year-ago quarter and 20% on a constant currency (cc) basis. Subscription plan ARR surged 105% at cc.Geographically, revenues in the Americas decreased 3% year over year to $210 million. EMEA revenues declined 6% to $190 million, while the same in APAC decreased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $86 million.Gross margin contracted 40 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 85.8%, primarily due to massive contraction in license gross margins.Operating expenses as percentage of revenues increased 570 bps to 105.1%, primarily due to higher marketing & sales (up 560 bps) and research & development (up 80 bps) expenses, partially offset by lower general & administrative expense (down 70 bps).Operating loss widened to $98.5 million as compared with $78.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk exited the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $1.81 billion compared with $1.90 billion as on Jan 31, 2017.Cash flow from operating activities was $45.2 million in the reported quarter. The company repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total of $192 million.For second-quarter fiscal 2018, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $488-$500 million. Non-GAAP loss per share is anticipated in the range of 18-14 cents for the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss of 28 cents on revenues of $491.4 million.For fiscal 2018, Autodesk continues to expect revenues in the range of $2.000-$2.050 billion. Non-GAAP loss is expected in the range of 73-56 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss of $1.38 on revenues of $2.03 billion.Autodesk projects subscription additions to be between 600K and 650K. Total ARR is still expected to be 24% to 26%. The company expects to keep non GAAP spend unchanged on a year-over-year basis.Management expects maintenance plan subscriptions to continue to decline going forward. The rate of decline will vary and will depend on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate at the time and the company's ability to shift maintenance planned customers to product subscriptions.Autodesk's business transition from licenses to cloud-based services is expected to benefit it in the long run by boosting subscriptions and deferred revenues. We expect its broad product portfolio to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets.However, in the near term, the company's financials may also be affected by increasing investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives.Currently, Autodesk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

That's why it isn't uncommon for companies -- even large ones -- to rise or fall dramatically during the course of a single month.May was no exception. Dozens of stocks from the  jumped or fell by double-digits during the month. Here's a closer look at three companies from the famous index --  (NASDAQ: ADSK) ,  (NASDAQ: FSLR) , and  (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- that put up the biggest gains.Image source: Getty Images.Shares of Autodesk rose more than 24% in May in response to producing an upbeat earnings report. The maker of architecture, engineering, and media software posted total quarterly revenue of $485.7 million. While this figure was down 5% when compared to the year-ago period, it was  of what Wall Street had predicted. The quarterly non-GAAP net loss of $0.16 per share was also better than expected.Autodesk's top line has been under pressure as it transitions its business model away from one-time license sales and toward a software-as-a-service model. While this change provides the company with a recurring stream of revenue, it also delays recognition while having a negative affect the top line. Traders looked right past the revenue dip and instead chose to focus on the 233,000 subscription customers that were adding during the quarter.Turning to the full year, management predicted that its recurring revenue base would increase by 24% to 26% as it plans on growing its subscriber base by at least 600,000 users. That news pleased Wall Street and triggered two analysts upgrades. Given all of the positivity, it is easy to understand why shares took off.2017 was predicted to be a  for solar companies, but First Solar's first-quarter results painted a different picture. Sales rose by 2% to $891 million, and the company produced a small profit of $0.09 per share. These figures were far ahead of the $668 million in revenue and the net  of $0.13 analysts had predicted.First Solar's management team also said that its first quarter was so strong it was raising its full-year guidance. The new range calls for $2.9 billion in sales at the midpoint, which is up $50 million from its prior outlook. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS is expected to land between $0.25 to $0.75, which also bested expectations. Taken together, the company's upbeat first-quarter results and raised guidance caused shares to rally more than 25% in May.There's little doubt that this good news took the markets by surprise. First Solar's stock has been  , which is a big reason shares have been under pressure. However, it now appears that 2017 is going to be a much better year for solar manufacturers than many had expected. If the negative sentiment continues to abate, then First Solar's stock might be in a great position to post a strong recovery.Standing in direct contrast to First Solar, optimism abounds for the graphics card maker NVIDIA. The company's stock has been red-hot over the past year as demand for its chips continues to be strong in all of the market segments in which it competes. That optimism has stretched NVIDIA's valuation, which amps up the pressure on the company to continue to deliver blow-out results.In spite of the tension, NVIDIA came through for investors when it reported on May 9: Total revenue jumped 48% to $1.94 billion, while EPS jumped 126% to $0.79. These numbers easily surpassed the $1.91 billion in revenue and $0.66 in EPS that Wall Street had expected. The beat caused a  rally on the day of the release, and traders have since bid up the company's stock more than 34% since May 1.NVIDIA credited the big gains to surging demand from gamers and data center operators. Meanwhile, revenue from its auto business also continues to hum along. In total, the company remains well positioned for even more fast growth as interest in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and self-driving cars continue to build. While that optimism is certainly priced into the stock's valuation, I for one think there are  for investors to continue to hang on.

To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $90.52/share today.Because the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.94% return on the cash commitment, or 28.79% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., and highlighting in green where the $90.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $92.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.05. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $90.52/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $92.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.56% if the stock gets called away at the June 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $92.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $92.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.37% boost of extra return to the investor, or 24.60% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 29%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 30%.

In the last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 14.29%. Notably, the company had a mixed earnings history in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 12.50%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Autodesk's business transition from licenses to cloud-based services is expected to benefit it in the long run by boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues. In the last reported quarter, total subscriptions increased approximately 154,000 from the prior quarter, while new model subscriptions (product, enterprise flexible license, and cloud subscription) increased by 227,000 to $1.09 million.In fact, cloud subscriptions in the last-reported quarter continued to see solid growth driven by BIM 360.Autodesk is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing through its comprehensive product portfolio. We expect its broad product portfolio to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets. | Notably, the company's aggressive acquisition strategy has played a pivotal part in developing its business. Cost cutting initiatives are also a big positive.We note that Autodesk has outperformed the Zacks  industry on a year-to-date basis. The company's shares rallied 28.8% compared with the industry's gain of 15.3% during the period.However, the company's financials may also be affected by increasing investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. Foreign exchange fluctuations and competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  , Microsoft Corp.  and Adobe Systems also remain headwinds.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Autodesk expects revenues in a range of $460 million - $480 million. Non-GAAP loss per share is projected in the range of 21 cents to 27 cents for the same period.Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Autodesk this quarter.

Despite such positives, the company is likely to struggle in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 due to higher costs of package deliveries in the recent holiday season and the shift in the product mix.

The big question we have to ask ourselves as investors from time to time is when is the market  forward-looking. In other words, when do the valuations of stocks far exceed their hype?With this in mind, we asked three of our Foolish contributors to weigh in on three highly hyped stocks to decipher whether they have what it takes to meet that hype. Find out what they had to say about  (NASDAQ: TSLA) ,  (NASDAQ: ADSK) , and  (NYSEMKT: NAK) . (  ): Has there ever been a more hyped stock than Tesla?Elon Musk's electric car start-up (hey, did you hear they make solar roofs, too?) makes battery buggies that can zoom from 0 to 60 in two seconds. More relevant to investors, Tesla  has zoomed from$15 million in revenues in 2008, when it first introduced the Roadster, to $7  last year. That's more than 47,000% growth in just eight years.Tesla Model 3 unveil. Image source: Tesla.And yet, during all this time, Tesla has failed to earn a full-year profit even once. To the contrary, annual losses have ballooned from $83 million lost in 2008 to $675 million in 2016 -- an eight-fold increase.That's one reason that  to build and sell 500,000 Tesla electric cars annually by 2018 doesn't excite me as much as it may excite other investors. Historically, you see, the more cars Tesla sells, the more money it loses ...Sure,  , Tesla might soon turn profitable -- perhaps not in 2018, but by 2019 for sure, says Piper Jaffray. But even then, and even if Piper is right, I have to wonder: Maybe Tesla  earn a profit in 2019. But what kind of profit will it earn? Will it earn the 3% operating profit margin that  pulls down, for example? Or perhaps even the 6% margin that's more common at  ? Because based on those kinds of profit margins, investors value Ford stock at only 10 times earnings, and GM at a lowly 6 times earnings.Right now, with no profits to value Tesla on, investors happily pay several times annual sales for shares of  . Once the company has profits to hang a valuation on, though, might they not decide to value Tesla stock on those profits? Because if that happens, then the $0.20 per share Tesla might earn in 2019 would only be worth about $2 a share at Ford's valuation, or a buck-twenty at GM's.Those are two far cries from the $308 a share Tesla stock currently fetches -- and one very big reason why I don't buy the hype surrounding Tesla stock. (  )  Surging optimism around Autodesk's business has pushed the stock up nearly 50% in the past year. What's most surprising about that rally is that it happened while the computer-aided drawing specialist endured a sharp  in earnings.Net loss ballooned to $582 million in fiscal 2017 compared to a loss of $330 million the year before. In contrast, the company had been generating consistent annual profits of over $200 million as recently as 2014. data by Yet investors are salivating at the financial prospects that Autodesk's shift to a subscription-based selling model might soon deliver. After selling perpetual licenses for years, the company has transitioned to term based memberships through the cloud.The shift is making Autodesk appear less profitable, since it now books revenue and earnings over time rather than in a lump sum. That makes subscription figures the key metric for investors to watch right now -- and the good news is that they have shown robust growth. Subscriptions jumped 21% last year to over 3 million, which represents a strong base of recurring revenue.Management believes it can boost subscriptions at a 20% pace in fiscal 2018, Autodesk's first full year under the new business model. If it can keep that momentum going, while also upgrading many of the company's maintenance customers into bigger, product-based subscriptions, Autodesk should make solid progress toward returning to profitability this year and earning its premium valuation. (  ): Northern Dynasty Minerals has, for lack of a better pun, been a hot commodity among short-term traders in recent months.The company, which is an exploratory-stage precious-metals miner, has the rights to the Pebble Project in Alaska. This project could, in theory, be mined out for well over 100 years. The election of Donald Trump, who is expected to relax a number of environmental protections (and thus ease the permitting of Pebble in Alaska), as well as rising physical  on a per-ounce basis, have investors excited about the company's prospects.As for me, I'm not buying into this hype.Image source: Getty Images.The biggest issue I have with a company claiming to be sitting on a literal gold mine is that its own management team isn't certain if the assets can be recovered profitably. The following excerpt is taken directly from Northern Dynasty Minerals' fourth-quarter report:In other words, there are no guarantees that, even if the minerals that are in the ground are proved resources, the company has a way to recover those minerals for a profit.Even if the company did, it's going to need a heck of a lot more capital than it has now. It ended the fourth quarter with $7.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, but burned through $24 million in 2016. It did complete a secondary share offering in January for $32 million, but with the way it burns through its cash on hand, this only buys it about a year.Plus, developing the Pebble Project would cost billions upon billions of dollars, and we'd likely be two years, if not more, out from commercial production commencing. What bank in its right mind is going to lend that much to Northern Dynasty without any assurances that recovery can be done profitably for an extended period of time?Pebble has changed hands a few times prior to Northern Dynasty scooping it up, and there may be a good reason its prior owners ditched the asset. Put plainly, investors putting their hopes into Northern Dynasty could be sorely disappointed.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

All sectors are beginning to see dealers take profits or worse, knock stocks out of their intermediate-term bullish trends.Today's three big stock charts looks at examples of the latter with a quick analysis of the shifting trends in  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Autodesk shares have fallen by about 8% after the company announced earnings and guidance that disappointed Wall Street analysts. ADSK stock's drop may be exactly what short-term traders should be looking for from this market leader though.Over the last year, Autodesk shares have appreciated by more than 40%, after the 8% decline, putting it among the top third of performers within the  . ADSK stock's technicals have been strong in giving support to the shares on pullbacks.This brings us to the current technical test. Autodesk's decline has the stock tagging-up with its ascending 50-day moving average. This trendline has been extremely supportive of ADSK shares since turning bullish in July 2016.The last test of the 50-day resulted in a rally from $75 to $90 since the beginning of the year.Alexion dropped 1.4% on Wednesday on an increase in volume as the shares tumbled through two key technical trendlines and found support at a third.First, let's discuss the broken technicals. ALXN shares slid below their 50- and 200-day trendlines. The former has been in a short-term ascending pattern that signaled a potential transition into bull rally mode for Alexion stock. This transition actually formed what is referred to as a Golden Cross when the 50-day moved above the 200-day last week.The celebration for traders has been short lived though as Wednesday's trading saw heavy volume break lower.Ultimately, ALXN shares were able to muster up some support from the 100-day trendline that currently resides at $126.41.Herein lies the test for Alexion stock. A break below the 100-day over the next few trading sessions will increase selling pressure and target a technical move to $120 over the short-term. Unfortunately, the upside for ALXN is limited, as a pattern of lower highs and lower lows indicates $135 as the likely top for the shares over the short-term.Through the first half of 2016, shares of CA had been relative strength leaders as they shot almost 25% higher during that period. Unfortunately, the trade became crowded with bulls and it has lagged the market since.Year-to-date, CA shares are only up 0.8% against the  returns of about 8%. It appears from the charts though that the stock is likely to remain a laggard.Since its top in August 2016, CA shares have put in a consistent pattern of lower highs and lows. The bearish trading pattern has CA shares teetering towards slipping into a technical bear market.Support in January came from the stock's long-term, 20-month moving average, the line of demarcation between bull and bear markets.Wednesday's decline broke CA shares back below their 50-day moving average and immediately tested the 100-day, which held for the day.With an RSI reading that indicates that CA shares are far from being oversold, the sellers are likely to increase pressure on the stock as it is squeezed between a worsening technical rock and hard place.Expect a break below the 100-day ($31.98) to accelerate the stock's bearish move to its long-term support at $30.71. From there, a break lower takes CA into a bear market.The post ) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Let's take a look at what lies in store for the HoloLens this year, and when a cheaper consumer-facing model might finally arrive.Image source: Microsoft.Under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has gradually built a \"One Windows\" ecosystem in which various devices are connected by a single operating system, app store, and cloud platform. HoloLens will play a crucial role in tethering \"mixed reality\" users to that ecosystem via Windows 10.The first major step toward that integration will be the Windows 10 Creators Update this spring. That update will add 3D image capture and editing tools, which will enable artists and developers to create 3D objects which can be viewed in HoloLens. That learning curve sounds steep, but Microsoft claims that the tools will be so simple that they can be used by 12-year-olds. Doing so could help Microsoft attract more developers to make Windows 10 and HoloLens a truly \"holographic\" combination.Last October, Microsoft announced that it would launch  that could track a user's head rotation and position without using external sensors like  's(NASDAQ: FB) Oculus Rift and  's Vive. Like the Rift and Vive, Microsoft's VR headsets will be tethered to PCs.But Microsoft's headsets will start at just $300 -- significantly undercutting the Rift and Vive's respective price tags of $600 and $800. Microsoft also claims that the headsets will work on mid-range PCs, which could pull PC gamers away from the Rift and Vive. Microsoft won't manufacture these headsets on its own. Instead, it will rely on hardware partners like  ,  ,  ,  , and  to launch the devices.These headsets will notably use similar voice and gesture commands as the HoloLens. This means that they could serve as cheaper \"training wheels\" for the HoloLens -- so the controls feel more familiar when the commercial version finally arrives.Microsoft has been boosting the HoloLens' public exposure with several retail partnerships.  uses the HoloLens to let consumers \"virtually\" customize their dream cars in augmented reality -- regardless of a dealer's in-store inventory. That virtual customization helps dealers minimize inventory space to reduce real estate expenses.The HoloLens being used at a Volvo dealership. Image source: Microsoft.Home improvement retailer  lets customers use the HoloLens to view changes to their homes in virtual reality. Microsoft will likely sign similar retail partnerships this year, since they help both retailers and customers understand the practical uses of HoloLens' mixed reality features.Microsoft has also signed enterprise deals with several companies to test the HoloLens' effectiveness in the workplace. Its integration with  360 helps designers create hologram versions of their designs, and its partnership with  streamlines communications for construction workers and provides them with 3D visualizations of their projects.  also used the headset to train mechanics and flight crew members last year. That list will likely grow this year if the Creators Update whets companies' appetite for holographic applications.Microsoft is laying down the foundations for the HoloLens, but consumers shouldn't expect a cheaper version of the device to arrive this year. Alex Kipman, who oversees the development of the HoloLens, recently told  that he doesn't expect hardware prices to significantly decline anytime soon. Kipman admitted that \"roadmaps\" for getting the price under $1,000 exist, but he declined to share any additional details.It's very common for a device to have a long waiting time between developer kit releases and the commercial launch. Oculus, for example, released the first dev kit of the Rift in March 2013. The commercial version didn't arrive until three years later. Therefore, we could still need to wait a  long time before a cheaper HoloLens arrives.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

So far, two separate analysts have upgraded Autodesk stock over the past two days, with Rosenblatt raising Autodesk from sell to neutral on Thursday, and today, Canaccord Genuity chiming in with an upgrade from hold to buy.What's behind all this excitement over Autodesk? Funny that you ask!Here are three things you need to know.Computer assisted software, such as Autodesk makes, is the brains behind the 3D printing revolution. Image source: Getty Images.Autodesk's surge appears to be tied to the company's holding of an investor day on Dec. 6. While we don't know  what Autodesk said at this event, it's clear that analysts in attendance were impressed.As reported on  , coming out of the conference, analysts at Cowen & Co. immediately raised their target price on the stock from $79 to $87. This was quickly followed by Rosenblatt's upgrade and $81 price target on Thursday -- a target that has already been hit. Then, Canaccord upgraded this morning.According to the latter, Autodesk stock that costs just $81 and change today should rise as high as $95 within a year -- and that's just to start with. In fact, Canaccord is predicting that Autodesk will  in value over the next three to four years, and average 15% to 20% gains over the next five years.At the top end of that estimate, we could be looking at a potential run from $81 a share today, to as much as $194 per share by 2021. Granted, this is a bit of an outlying estimate. Granted too, our data here at Motley Fool CAPS show that Canaccord is  . But even so, if the analyst is anywhere close to right on this one, investors could be looking at some pretty impressive gains from this stock going forward.Canaccord bases its optimistic forecast for Autodesk stock on a belief -- apparently laid out at the investor day mentioned above -- that Autodesk will grow its rate of per-share free cash flow production to \"$6 in FCF by 2020 and $11 per share in 2022.\" But is that realistic?According to data from  , Autodesk stock generated $228 million in positive free cash flow over the past 12 months. Divided among 222.6 million shares outstanding, that's a bit more than $1 a share. So what Canaccord is really saying is that over the next four years, it expects Autodesk to  its cash profitability, and then nearly double it again two years later.Suffice it to say this is a  aggressive target. It's so aggressive that, if Canaccord turns out to be anywhere near right about its estimates of free cash flow growth, then Autodesk stock probably deserves to do a whole lot better than merely double in price, as the analyst predicts, over the next four years. An 11-fold improvement in free cash flow production should actually be worth a whole lot more to investors.In fact, though, I suspect that Canaccord is probably being a bit overoptimistic about the stock. So let's dial back the enthusiasm a bit, and see how Autodesk looks today.GAAP-unprofitable last year, and likely to be unprofitable again this year, the best number we have available for hanging a valuation on Autodesk stock is its free cash flow -- so let's go ahead and use that one.With $228 million in trailing free cash flow, and a market capitalization of $18.2 billion, Autodesk stock currently sells for a valuation of 80 times earnings. Canaccord's enthusiasm notwithstanding meanwhile, most analysts who follow the stock see profitability at Autodesk growing at just 15% annually over the next five years. What that means is that as currently valued, Autodesk stock sells for a price-to-FCF-to-growth ratio of about 5.3 -- which is every bit as expensive as it sounds. Let's also not forget that the last time Autodesk reported earnings (just two weeks ago), it guided investors to expect slower growth, not faster, than what Wall Street was looking for.When you take all of the above and put it into context: Canaccord Genuity's poor record of picking winners, its free cash flow projections for Autodesk that verge on the absurd, and Autodesk management's own conservative stance on its growth prospects, I'm left with just one conclusion:Canaccord Genuity is wrong to upgrade this stock. Autodesk is overpriced, and doomed to fall.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As the dust and initial panic after the election settle, more people are expressing positive economic attitudes. That was evidenced by The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment gauge, which surged 4.5% to 98. That level was the second strongest reported since 2004, and investors are hoping that optimism carries the consumer to a strong holiday season.With that said, here's a look at a handful of stocks making big headlines or big moves in the markets this week.Shares of  (NASDAQ: ADSK) , a software company that develops products for people and companies that make things in many markets and industries, touched record highs this week after Canaccord Genuity upgraded the stock Tuesday.Analyst Richard Davis moved Autodesk stock from \"hold\" to \"buy\" and raised his price target from $70 per share to $95. \"While other sectors are a decade into this (cloud) transition, design engineers have finally discovered the advantages of back-end (cloud) computing, multiplatform file access and collaboration, and modern user interfaces,\" Davis noted in a report to clients.It was a welcomed reversal for investors after Autodesk posted steep declines after its third-quarter earnings beat Wall Street estimates, but investors were underwhelmed with guidance. Autodesk seems well positioned to continue providing value to consumers and attract subscribers to its platform, and it benefits from its customers' high switching costs. That said, if consumers are buying in now near all-time highs, understand that it's a richly valued company that remains thus far unprofitable. (NYSE: BWA) was one of the top performers in the S&P 500 this week, rising 15%. One positive development for BorgWarner investors, albeit not its former employees, was that the company won a long-running lawsuit by retirees who accused the company of altering their health benefits, which allegedly was in violation of collective bargaining agreements. On Dec. 5, a federal judge in Michigan ruled that the retirees' health benefits weren't vested for life, and for that reason, BorgWarner could modify them. It put an end to a lawsuit that began in 2009 and lifted some uncertainty around the company.Image source: Getty Images.Beyond that, there's been some concern about automotive suppliers, as the automotive industry increasingly appears to be heading to an electric-vehicle future. The reason for concern becomes clear when you read about BorgWarner's business: It's a supplier of automotive systems and components for powertrain applications that help improve vehicle performance and fuel efficiency, among others. Obviously, a future with electric vehicles that don't need gasoline engine-powered powertrains or better fuel efficiency would cripple BorgWarner -- unless it adapts.With the lawsuit aside, investors can go back to watching how BorgWarner adapts to the evolving auto industry; at least one example shows progress, as BorgWarner provides BYD Auto -- a fast-growing automaker in China that deals in hybrids and electric vehicles -- with multiple turbochargers for its hybrid electric vehicles.Another stock that did extremely well this week was  .(NASDAQ: PLAY) , which jumped 20% this week after the restaurant company reported strong third-quarter earnings.Starting with the top line, revenue jumped 19% to $228.7 million, compared with the prior quarter, driven by a healthy 5.9% increase in same-store sales, as the company's marketing has done well, attracting more consumers to its restaurants. On the bottom line, its net income moved from $4.6 million, or $0.11 per share, to $10.8 million, or $0.25 per share, during the third quarter, ahead of Wall Street's $0.13 forecast.As icing on the cake, management even upped guidance slightly for the full year, from previous guidance of between $983 million and $995 million up to between $998 million and $1.003 billion. Dave & Buster's also plans to open 11 new stores this year, which is an extra store than originally expected.This was a strong third quarter for a company with momentum. If it can sustain its comparable-store sales increases, expect more quarters like this.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It lets the general contractor know when and how much material to buy and when to be ready for each subsequent step in the construction process.RIB's customers are a who's who of the world's architecture, engineering, and construction ((AEC)) firms, including some of the biggest international contractors, developers, architecture, and engineering firms. The company also sells to the public sector, as well as infrastructure and transportation providers. Across the installed base, customers using iTWO have been able to optimize materials and time planning, resulting in up to 30% time and cost savings on construction projects ranging from luxury residential and commercial properties to billion dollar state of the art hospitals.When we first looked at RIB in 2013, the company had two main challenges. The first was that the company's software represented a sea change from how construction projects had been managed previously, and the industry has historically been very conservative in its adoption of new technology. To address this challenge, the company began opening high tech laboratories in locations around the world where potential customers can stage a three day simulation of the virtual construction site produced by RIB's software. One of the first lab visits for a customer in the company's Hong Kong lab led to an immediate sale versus the 6 to 9 month sales cycle that RIB had seen previously. As sales began to accelerate, the company quickly built a roster of top-tier reference customers whose adoption of iTWO strongly validated the software in the construction industry. Large customers have also in some instances forcibly driven adoption of iTWO - RIB signed the largest deal in its history in 2014 with Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway, which now requires all architects and contractors that it does business with to use iTWO as well. Finally, RIB has validated iTWO's strength in academic settings, developing partnerships with leading engineering programs at universities like Stanford, Georgia Tech, National University of Singapore, and the University of Hong Kong.The second hurdle RIB had to overcome was expanding its geographic reach, as the vast majority of its historical sales had been in Germany and the rest of Western Europe, and its distribution capabilities were very limited outside these markets. Since then the company has expanded its sales reach into North and South America, the Middle East, and Asia, especially in China. Even so, RIB's growth has still been constrained by the size of its sales force. The distribution challenges historically faced by RIB have all been addressed by three transformative partnerships all announced over the last few months, each of which we feel could massively expand the company's reach and bolster its financial performance.The most recent of the three new partnerships is with Autodesk (  ), the leading provider of computer aided design ((CAD)) software. RIB will closely integrate Autodesk's Revit architecture software into RIB's iTWO product, and Autodesk will recommend iTWO to its vast account base, which essentially includes every major player in the construction industry. We believe that Autodesk is a very likely acquiror of RIB at some point, but RIB's CEO owns a very large stake in the company and will not sell at these levels.Prior to signing the deal with Autodesk, RIB inked a joint venture arrangement with Flex Limited (  ), a large supply chain management player. The JV will supply construction projects worldwide with required materials and RIB will record a transaction fee equal to a small percentage of the total volume. If this platform works as envisioned, it will become a very large and completely incremental revenue stream for RIB down the road, in addition to providing an expanded sales pipeline for iTWO.The third new partnership was signed with Wipro Limited (WPRO.IN), a large Indian outsourcer who will distribute RIB's software worldwide. Wipro will be the consultant for these deals while RIB will receive the software license revenue. This partnership should significantly boost RIB's worldwide distribution capabilities and make its software finally available to a broad worldwide customer base.Shares of RIB are currently trading near \u20ac12.50, down from a recent high around \u20ac14.50. At current levels the company has a market cap of \u20ac570 million and an enterprise value of \u20ac405 million after accounting for over \u20ac165 million of net cash on the balance sheet.In 2016, we forecast sales of \u20ac95 million, up 16% and at the midpoint of management guidance. RIB is highly profitable, and we expect the company's EBITDA margin to be just over 33% for the year, also within management's stated guidance range.We forecast 18% and 16% sales growth in 2017 and 2018, with EBITDA margins expanding slightly to 35%. On these estimates, RIB will generate \u20ac46 million in 2018 EBITDA, valuing the company at less than 9x.Given the company's growth and profitability profile we believe that shares would be fully valued at 15x 2018 EBITDA, yielding a target price of \u20ac18.60 and representing approximately 50% upside from current levels.As previously mentioned, RIB is ultimately a very likely candidate for consolidation by a strategic player. Autodesk would be an obvious fit as iTWO and Revit are so closely integrated and should have a growing attach rate going forward. SAP (SAP.GY) would be another logical acquiror as iTWO represents a natural extension of SAP's ERP dominance in the construction sector. SAP has actually been a long-term investor in RIB, currently holding 4% of the company's shares. Dassault Systemes (DSY.FP), a provider of 3D design software, could also be interested in RIB. Any potential acquisition would likely have to be supported by RIB's CEO Thomas Wolf who currently owns just under 20% of shares, and who we believe aims to significantly grow the share price organically before exploring a sale of the company.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n recent trading, shares of Autodesk Inc. (Symbol: ADSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $82.58, changing hands for $82.65/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Autodesk Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $53.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $101.00. The standard deviation is $15.011.But the whole reason to look at the  ADSK price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ADSK crossing above that average target price of $82.58/share, investors in ADSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $82.58 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Plus, Autodesk also expanded its share repurchase program in its efforts to maximize shareholder value.However, in the near term, the company's financials may also be affected by increasing investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives.

At the top of the list would have to be  to  (NASDAQ:  ) in 1996, more than a decade after the co-founder was shown the door. AAPL stock gained more than 9,000% over the next 14 years. Source: Next, would have to be Lee Iacocca's rescue of  (NYSE:  ) back in 1979 before it was owned by Fiat. Fresh off the  firing from the  (NYSE:  ), Iacocca did whatever it took, including creating the now ubiquitous minivan, to revive the fortunes of the Motor City's No. 3 carmaker.This is the stuff that legends are made of.On the brink, down and out, struggling to survive, Jobs and Iacocca will always be viewed as great leaders despite their human failings. At a time when we give thanks, it's important that we remember their great work. Who are the turnaround messiahs of today? Those CEOs whose companies are losing money, but are one big break away from salvation.During Thanksgiving week, it's appropriate that we consider seven feast or famine stocks to buy.It's been a little more than a year since the data storage company went public, and even though  (NYSE:  ) proclaimed at the time to have the fastest growth in  PSTG stock has floundered, down  since its Oct. 5, 2015, IPO.Big Data is a huge deal, so it's certainly playing in a potentially explosive segment of the technology sector. Unfortunately, when you have enterprises continuing to debate how to store all their information, you never know if you're one hit product away from success or failure.Since launching its FlashArray product in 2012, Pure Storage has racked up more than $600 million in operating losses over 42 months. Yet, you can't help but be impressed by its revenues, which have grown tenfold in the past two years alone. In the second quarter of 2016, PSTG increased revenues  year-over-year to $163.2 million, growing its customers by 107% year-over-year to more than 2,300.The big news: It began shipping FlashBlade, its follow-up product to FlashArray. Despite the significant operating losses it's racked up, PSTG could finally deliver the promise so many believed it had coming to market last October.With the stock down 13 months after going public, now is the time for it to really break out. FlashBlade could be just the ticket to make that move happen.The serial acquirer of transportation and logistics businesses - more than a dozen acquisitions since 2011 - including Con-way Inc., which it acquired last year for  - recently sold Con-way's truckload business to Canadian trucking firm  (OTCMKTS:  ) for $558 million in a move to reduce the $5 billion in debt taken on to make all of these acquisitions.Not a pivotal piece of Con-way's business, TransForce's offer was simply too good to pass up.If you thought Pure Storage was a big revenue grower,  (NYSE:  ) is out of this world, having growing its revenues from  in 2011 to a top ten global transportation and logistics company with  in revenue through the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 and estimated full-year revenues of more than $15 billion.Most importantly, XPO generated free cash flow in Q3 2016 of  and expects to be free cash flow positive for the entire year. Amazingly, it's got a good chance to reach its adjusted Ebitda goal of $1.6 billion by fiscal 2018. And only seven years after CEO Bradley Jacobs and investors put  into XPO, then called Express-1 Expedited Solutions, to gain majority control. Today, Jacobs Private Equity owns approximately 15% of XPO's shares and 23% of the votes.On the precipice of making money, XPO Logistics shareholders can expect more good things to happen with Jacobs at the helm.How you view  's (NASDAQ:  ) latest quarter depends on whether you're a glass half-full or glass half empty type of person. The maker of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems announced its  earnings Nov. 1; it lost 22 cents per share on $148.6 million in revenue.If you're a half full kind of person, you'll view its 41% year-over-year increase in revenue and 55% reduction in its quarterly loss to $18.6 million, as real progress towards sustainable profitability. If you're a half empty person, in the red is in the red, no matter the number. Working on bringing its CGM systems to the diabetes world since 1999, DexCom has yet to make a profit, but whose revenues will likely hit $1 billion within the next five years. If hope were all you needed to make money on a stock, DexCom would be at the top of anyone's list.DexCom's argument when it comes to managing diabetes is that intermittent, finger-stick glucose monitoring isn't enough. Patients tend to spend a great deal of their day outside a healthy glycemic range between  for every deciliter of blood. So, constant monitoring is the better alternative.There are three million insulin intensive patients in the U.S. - 30 million patients if you include T2 non-insulin and non-intensive patients - and only a small percentage of those patients are using CGM. Despite intense competition from  (NYSE:  ), DexCom continues to improve its gross margins and generate free cash flow, a key ingredient to most successful and profitable businesses.Good things are just around the corner.Earlier this year,  (NASDAQ:  ) stock traded in the low $30s, a level not seen since early 2013. If you were lucky enough to have bought SPLK stock at those prices you've done well, because it's doubled in value since then.What happened to reignite the analyzer of big data?Like many software companies, it's in the middle of transitioning from software licenses to the cloud. That transition's been anything but smooth in terms of both top- and bottom-line growth. In early February, as some other cloud companies delivered disappointing  , Splunk stock went splat in sympathy with those stocks.However, the downward trend was short-lived.Splunk  Q1 2016 earnings in late February that were much better than analyst expectations. And SPLK stock was off to the races, gaining 12% in March alone. But now analysts fear the move to the cloud has become a big headwind to Splunk's historical growth - revenues have grown  in past five years - and expect its Q3 2016 results to be a big disappointment leaving SPLK stock to flounder once more.Splunk Cloud uptake will limit upside and expect  MKM Partners' analyst Kevin Buttigieg recently said about Splunk's upcoming Q3 earnings. \"While investors had understood that the transition to the cloud could have a negative effect on margins, they are now grappling with its negative effect on top-line growth as well.\"Still not making money on an annual basis, but generating positive free cash flow, SPLK stock might be expensive at 10 times sales, eventually, the opportunities in Big Data analytics will pay handsomely. Splunk included.The maker of 3D modeling software made the decision to transition to a subscription-based business model from a licensed-based one back in  . As part of that transition, it's accepted operating losses, as the price it has to pay to remain competitive.Since 2013,  (NASDAQ:  ) operating profit has disappeared going from $305 million, or $1.32 per share, in fiscal 2013 to a company projected loss of at least $608 million, or $2.74 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, it's less painful, with an estimated loss of between 55 cents and 70 cents per share. But it's a loss nonetheless.The subscription model, when done well, can lead to higher revenue and profits.  (NASDAQ:  )  to a subscription-based model starting in 2013, operating profits went from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2012 to $413 billion in fiscal 2014 - then the turnaround took hold. Adobe will likely generate operating profits of  or more in fiscal 2017, with operating margins returning to historical norms.The big problem for Autodesk: It needs to speed up the transition. Adobe's subscription revenues really took off over the past two fiscal years -  in 2013 to $3.2 billion in 2015 - while maintaining operating expenses at the same level. Over the past two years, Autodesk's subscription revenues have increased by  or about 20%. It has got to do better.Keep the faith, ADSK shareholders. A couple of figures in its Q2 2016 report provide hope.First, new model annualized recurring revenue increased  in the second quarter to $371 million. That's a sign customers are slowly getting on board. The second sign things will get better is deferred revenue - up 23% to $1.5 billion in Q2 - the subscription fees to be paid in future months in order for customers to continue to use the software.If these two keep going up on a quarterly basis and at a decent clip there's no reason why it too can't generate record profits just like Adobe.Are you starting to sense a pattern here? It seems all of these cloud companies are growing revenues at a significant pace without much hope for immediate profits or even those on the horizon.  (NYSE:  ) definitely fits into that category.The cloud-based enterprise software company was founded in 2005 and went public in October 2012 at  per share. Trading above $80, IPO investors still holding have done well although WDAY stock has traded in a fairly tight range since April 2014. What's going to get it unstuck?Continue to grow subscriptions while slowing the amounts spent on marketing and product development which accounted for about  of its Q2 2016 operating expenses. Cut both of those by 25% while increasing subscription revenues by 30-40% per quarter and presto, you've got significant operating profits, not losses.Financially, Workday's business is getting stronger. Its trailing 12-month free cash flow is $178.1 million or about  of its revenue over those same 12 months. Adobe's current trailing 12-month free cash flow is  of revenue. Clearly, WDAY has work to do (no pun intended) but it's getting there.As it continues to win  customers in both the human capital management and financial segments, many of whom are global powerhouses, WDAY should gain pricing power as its customers become attached at the hip to its cloud-based products.When that happens, and it will, and Workday continues to maintain control over its expenses, the margins will go through the roof. And so will WDAY stock.It's hard to believe but  (NASDAQ:  ) actually made a profit in the third quarter, its first in more than three years. More importantly, it generated  in free cash flow from the production of 25,185 vehicles. Its business is getting profitable just in time to begin producing the Model 3, Tesla's version of the commuter car.Orders for new Model S and Model X vehicles were up 68% in Q3 while actual production jumped 92% year-over-year. Tesla expects to deliver 50,000 new vehicles from June 2016 through the end of the year with slightly more than half that number in Q4.So, although Tesla generated its first profit in a long time and business is looking up, it's still going to lose in the order of $800 million in 2016, a substantial amount. Not to mention its profit only came after a $139 million in California zero emission credits which are almost  pure profit.CEO Elon Musk has rolled the dice merging  for  figuring the two businesses go together like peanut butter and jelly. It remains to be seen whether his vision will be correct. What we do know is they'll both require a lot of cash until the potential synergies can be effectively - and profitably - exploited.Of all the seven feast or famine stocks, Tesla is easily my favorite. Not because I think you'll make the most amount of money but because Elon Musk is an  like no other - except maybe Jeff Bezos.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund (Symbol: QTEC) where we have detected an approximate $61.0 million dollar inflow -- that's a 22.0% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 6,600,002 to 8,050,000).

However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $533 million.The upside in the top line was driven by solid performance in the bio/pharmaceutical end-markets, up 13% on a year-over-year basis. Also, the industrial market achieved 2% growth in sales. However, a 15% decline in sales within the government and academic markets partially offset the otherwise strong performance.Also, impressive contribution from the sales of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth. In addition, Water Corp.'s recurring revenues and instrument system sales increased 8% and 3%, respectively, boosting top-line growth.On a geographic basis, Asia emerged as the winner, with 13% rise in sales, in terms of constant currency, largely attributable to the robust demand from China.

But thankfully for  (NASDAQ: ADSK) shareholders, it's been the exception to the rule. Up nearly 12% year-to-date and 7% since announcing better-than-expected fiscal 2017 Q2 earnings last month, Autodesk CEO Carl Bass is beginning to hit on all cylinders as he transforms its business.Autodesk handily beat analyst's earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations and revenue in Q2. Estimates were for negative $0.13 a share on a non-GAAP basis (excluding one-time items) and sales of $512.07 million, which Autodesk obliterated, announcing a positive $0.05 per share on revenue of $559.7 million. Bass went on to share guidance for Q3 and fiscal 2017 that also pleasantly surprised.Autodesk is an intriguing investment alternative based on how well it's delivering on several new initiatives.Whether it's included in its quarterly earnings release or an integral component of Bass' conference call, there's one thing Autodesk management wants to make abundantly clear: total sales have \"been and will be negatively impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front.\"As part of Autodesk's \"business model transition,\" it discontinued new licensing sales for most products several quarters ago and instead is focused on its new model subscriptions. The new subscriptions in turn generate what Autodesk refers to as \"annual recurring revenue (ARR).\" Measuring the success of Autodesk's new-ish ARR model is based on its quarterly billings and deferred revenue: and it's absolutely killing both key metrics.Total ARR climbed 10% last quarter to an impressive $1.47 billion, and that's not even the best part. Autodesk's new model ARR -- which includes product, enterprise, and cloud subscriptions -- soared to $371 million in fiscal Q2, good for a whopping 82% improvement year-over-year. Autodesk shared a couple more indicators its ARR strategy is spot on: recurring revenue now makes up 67% of total sales, compared to \"just\" 55% a year-ago, and deferred revenue climbed 23% to $1.52 billion.Autodesk isn't alone in its efforts to drive long-term, sustainable recurring revenue. Its design software brethren  (NASDAQ: ADBE) is also coming off a strong quarter in which strength in its creative and document clouds drove a 9% improvement in recurring revenue to $3.41 billion. Why are the likes of Autodesk and Adobe so focused on their respective versions of ARR?Put simply, building ARR over the long haul is a less costly proposition than relying solely -- or even primarily -- on generating new sales. Last quarter was an ideal example: Autodesk's non-GAAP spending dropped 4% in Q2, and Bass expects it will decline 2% for the 2017 fiscal year.Recurring sales can also lower the chances of a stock price rollercoaster ride because it is both more sustainable and predictable than relying solely on new revenue. Which in turn sets the table for fewer negative surprises: something most investors would like to avoid whenever possible.Image source: .Image source:  .Not only does Autodesk benefit from its new subscription model and the associated upsides it represents, its customers seem to love it as well. New model subscriptions skyrocketed 22% last quarter and now sit at 692,000. More impressively, the additional 125,000 new ARR customers in Q2 were compared to the first quarter of this year, not 2016.That kind of sequential subscriber growth certainly bodes well for Autodesk's transformation, and also helps explain why it's pleasantly surprising investors and analysts alike with each subsequent earnings report.Continuing to make strides in its subscription efforts and the ARR it generates, combined with its stellar customer acquisition results, are the gauges the \"new\" Autodesk should be measured by. And in virtually every one Autodesk is delivering. And to think: it's just getting started.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

After the company reported another blowout quarter, by the close of Oct. 3 trading, Adobe shareholders were enjoying a gain of nearly 9%, with the stock closing Oct. 3 at $108.45.But Adobe's stellar run may be concerning to investors wondering if they've missed the boat. Not to mention the blase analysts who've actually lowered Adobe's price target to just $118.46 since last quarter's results were announced. But brush those concerns aside. For a number of reasons, Adobe remains a great long-term \"buy.\"Image source: Adobe.Adobe's $1.46 billion in sales last quarter was its 10th record result in a row, and good for a 20% improvement compared to the year-ago period. Just as impressively, Adobe was able to report sky-high gains in earnings per share thanks to CEO Shantanu Narayen's expense-management efforts.Adobe reported a whopping 59% jump in GAAP (including one-time items) per-share earnings of $0.54, well above last year's \"paltry\" $0.34 EPS and higher than analyst estimates. Despite Adobe's 20% revenue increase and strong EPS results, it didn't require emptying the expense coffers to make it happen.Operating expenses increased by 14% year over year, and Adobe's cost of revenue inched up 6%. Considering its top-line growth, Adobe's spending last quarter was more than reasonable. Keeping a grip on expenses also drove a 50% increase in operating income, yet another Adobe quarterly record, and helped push its cash and equivalents on hand to $4.45 billion, up from last year's $3.99 billion.Revenue growth, EPS gains, and maintaining its ongoing string of record quarters -- all without the need to spend through the roof -- form a good recipe for long-term growth and provide a sound explanation as to why Adobe stock is still a bargain. And it gets better.When investors look back years from now, Adobe's decision to strictly adhere to its subscription-based business model could stand out as its defining moment. Design software peer  (NASDAQ: ADSK) serves as a good example of how critical it will become to build a base of recurring revenue, rather than rely solely on product sales, with each successive quarter.Though Autodesk's $551 million in revenue last quarter was a 10% year-over-year decline, its stock has climbed nearly 13% since the company shared its fiscal 2017 second-quarter results on Aug. 25. Why? Because Autodesk is making significant progress on its \"business model transition,\" which is CEO-speak for shifting to a subscription-based, annual recurring revenue (ARR) focus. And as Adobe knows firsthand, ARR is an ideal methodology for sustainable long-term growth, and investors are beginning to recognize it.Adobe's shift to its document, creative, and marketing clouds has helped facilitate its recurring revenue transformation because the more services and data it stores and helps its customers utilize, the less likely they'll forgo their ongoing subscriptions. Last quarter speaks to the success of Adobe's ARR model -- an objective Autodesk is working to emulate going forward.Narayen cited total digital media ARR of $3.7 billion last quarter, up 8%  . That kind of growth would be significant even on a year-over-year basis, but as it is occurring from one quarter to the next, it's no wonder Adobe's guidance is for yet another revenue record as it winds up its fiscal year.As with Autodesk, Adobe's design software and services are ideal for the up-and-coming virtual reality (VR) and 3D markets, and the company has the new opportunities covered. Adobe isn't new to either medium, but its VR and 3D content design upgrade released last month take its cutting-edge design solutions to a whole new level.Not only is Adobe hitting on all cylinders today, but there's no end in sight for its soaring recurring revenue, its customers love its cloud features, spending remains under wraps, and its offerings are perfect for the burgeoning VR and 3D industries.

The technology giant is reportedly looking to buy Samsung Electronics' printer business.Last Friday, Seoul Economic Daily reported that Samsung will potentially sell its printer business to HP for approximately $1.8 billion, citing an unnamed senior executive of the Seoul, South Korea-based electronic giant.The spin-off is considered to be part of a broader restructuring process at Samsung, under which the company is trimming its business through the divestitures of non-core assets. Note that Samsung is a global leader in manufacturing smartphones, televisions and memory chips.Despite its market position, Samsung failed to make a mark in the printer space, lagging a long way behind HP, Canon Inc.  and Espon. In fact, according to International Data Corporation (IDC), Samsung holds the fifth position in the global hardcopy peripheral industry, with a mere 4% share in the second quarter of 2016.Hence, we believe that the divestment of its printer business will unlock investments for the company and help it to focus better on its core segments.HP is one of the two publicly traded entities that were formed after the Nov 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard Company. The split also led to the formation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company  . HP focuses on PC and printing products and services. | Over the past few quarters, HP has been losing market share to its Japanese rivals - Canon and Espon - due to intense price competition. These Japanese manufacturers have been able to slash prices due to a weak Yen compared to the U.S. dollar.Although HP is still the biggest printer manufacturer in the world as per IDC, the company's market shrunk 420 basis points (bps) year-over-year to 36.6% in second-quarter 2016. In the same quarter, however, Canon and Espon's market share expanded by 100 bps and 220 bps, respectively.Furthermore, HP's recently released third-quarter fiscal 2016 results showed a 14% year-over-year decline in printing revenues to $4.432 billion, primarily due to an 18% plunge in supplies revenues and weak performance at the hardware segment. HP's total hardware unit sales were down 10% primarily due to declines of 2% and 14% in Commercial hardware units and Consumer hardware units, respectively.Thus, we believe that the acquisition of Samsung's printing operations could help HP turn around the printer business. The transaction will not only eliminate a major competitor, but also help to control prices. Apart from this, the acquisition will also give HP access to Samsung's partners and strengthen the former's position across various geographies.Demand for printers has witnessed a secular decline over the past several years as consumers are increasingly favoring digital alternatives over printed materials due to their cost effectiveness.Post the split from its parent company, HP has been focused on product innovation and differentiation to maintain its leading position in the space. This May, the company hinted at the possibility of enhancing its 3D printing business capabilities in an effort to revive tumbling sales.Note that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, the company lags behind 3D Systems Corporation  and Stratasys Ltd.  .Thus, in order to establish its presence in this space, HP recently unveiled its Jet Fusion 3D Printing Solution, with two models to choose from - 4200 and 3200. Unlike 3D Systems and Stratasys, which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets because of their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions.To satisfy customers in this space, HP has collaborated with various companies like BMW, Nike Inc.  and Autodesk Inc.  with an aim to develop more advanced 3D printing technologies for a wide array of industrial use.Additionally, the 3D printing market presents significant long-term investment opportunities as a large number of engineers, designers, architects and entrepreneurs are now turning to 3D solutions for primary designing and product modeling.According to market research firm, CONTEXT, over half a million 3D printers have already been shipped across the globe between the 1980s and mid-2015, and the industry is currently on track to ship its millionth unit by 2017. Data from the Wohlers Report 2014 revealed that the worldwide 3D printing industry is expected to grow from $3.07 billion in 2013 to $12.8 billion by 2018, and will exceed $21 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 34%.HP's efforts to turn around the printing business have been commendable. Its strategy of focusing on product innovations and enhancing 3D printing capabilities will help to stabilize falling revenues at its printer division.If HP succeeds in acquiring Samsung's printer business, it would prove to be a prudent move for geographic expansion and market share capture.Currently, HP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Autodesk reported earnings per share of 5 cents for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This is down from the 19 cents per share that the company reported during the same time last year. However, it came in above Wall Street's estimate, which had ADSK reporting losses per share of 13 cents for the quarter.Revenue reported by Autodesk in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $550.7 million. The company's revenue for the quarter was down 10% from the $609.5 million it reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Despite this, ADSK's revenue was still above the $512.07 million that analysts were looking for.Autodesk also noted that its total subscriptions for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were up by 109,000 when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This brought its total subscriptions to 2.82 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\"Continued adoption of product subscription drove strong growth in new model subscriptions, new model ARR, and deferred revenue,\"Scott Herren, the Chief Financial Officer at Autodesk,  . \"We saw record volume of product subscription for suites while also experiencing greater than expected volume of perpetual licenses for suites, stemming from the final availability of that offering.\"ADSK also updated its guidance in its recent earnings report. The company is expecting losses per share between 27 cents and 22 cents for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Wall Street is expecting the company to report losses per share of 29 cents for that quarter.Autodesk also noted that it expects revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $470 million to $485 million.

At the same time, a weaker launch calendar depressed new video game sales down by 18%.was a big hit in last year's Q2, but the lack of a comparable blockbuster pushed game sales down. Image source: Time Warner. Overall, GameStop's comparable-store sales fell 11%, against management's forecast of a 6% drop. CEO Paul Raines said in a press release that fiscal Q2 was \"a tough quarter for video gaming\" as the retailer lowered its full-year comps outlook to a 5% drop from the 2% decline it projected in late May.New business lines, including mobile and consumer technology, are still growing at a healthy pace and producing much higher margins than GameStop's legacy video game business. As a result, profitability and net income both logged strong gains this quarter despite the revenue drop. That success has set up an interesting dynamic whereby the retailer's earnings set record highs even as the stock price sinks on bearish bets from investors.

Subscriptions rose to 2.8 million, up 109,000 from the prior quarter. Gross margin held steady at 85% of sales.Image source: Getty Images.Overall revenue fell by 10%, but that's mostly by consequence of Autodesk's switch away from one-time purchases and toward a cloud-based subscription model. \"We posted terrific second quarter results driven by growth in new model subscriptions, the end of perpetual license sales, and diligent cost control,\" CEO Carl Bass said in a press release.Investors can expect revenue to continue to decline as Autodesk books all future business on a subscription basis, which produces lower initial sales prices. In that context, a key metric to follow as a reflection of the health of the business is subscriber growth. Autodesk said that it expects to add about 500,000 new subscriptions during the year. Management also believes the current momentum supports their target of 20% compound annual subscriber growth through fiscal 2020.

Moreover, growth of software licenses revenue in Brazil and Mexico proved conducive to the sales growth of the Latin American region. This supplemented top-line growth in the Americas. For the APJ region, double digit software license growth in Japan, Malaysia and Singapore, along with robust performance in China, acted as catalysts.SAP reported IFRS operating margin of 20.5%, down 380 basis points from the figure recorded in third-quarter 2015. Also, the company recorded an 8.4% increase in its operating profit, which came in at \u20ac1,103 million ($1,230.5 million).SAP's human capital management (''HCM'') applications continue to act as the key growth driver, with SuccessFactors Employee Central surpassing the 1,350-customer at the end of the third quarter. Also, SAP's Customer Engagement and Commerce solutions grew in double digits during the quarter.Moreover, consistent strong market traction of the SAP S/4HANA platform is proving to be the strongest profit churner. During third-quarter 2016, the company gained 400 customers, of which 40% are entirely new. This hugely fuelled the company's revenues. The SAP HANA Cloud Platform (HCP) has been aiding clients in extending functionalities, build new applications and integrate across cloud and on-premise platforms, which in turn is bosltering its growth.This apart, SAP's business, which it manages through three main players - namely Ariba, Fieldglass and Concur - experienced 17% growth in cloud subscriptions and support revenue during the quarter under review. In the past 12 months, Ariba network handled the trading of 2.4 million connected companies worth over $840 billion, Concur managed travel and expenses of more than 44 million end users and Fieldglass helped in managing 2.8 million flexible workers.For the nine-month period ended on Sep 30, 2016, the company's operating cash flow came in at \u20ac3.6 billion ($4.0 billion), up 12.5% on a year-over-year basis; while free cash flow was \u20ac3.0 billion ($3.4 billion), up 5% compared to the year-ago tally.As on Sep 30, 2016, SAP had cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac4,112 ($4,609.8 million) compared with \u20ac3,411 million recorded at the end of Dec 31, 2015.Supported by lucrative opportunities in the market, the company has raised its full-year 2016 outlook. The company now expects full-year 2016 non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenues in the range of \u20ac3.00-\u20ac3.05 billion from the previous guided range of \u20ac2.95-\u20ac3.05 billion, at constant currency (cc).Also, non-IFRS cloud and software revenue guidance has been revised upward. It is expected to grow in the range of 6.5%-8.5% instead of the previous guided range of 6-8%, at cc. Also, 2016 non-IFRS operating profit forecast has been tweaked at the lower end of the previously guided range. It is now estimated to be in the range of \u20ac6.5 billion- \u20ac6.7 billion, from the earlier range of \u20ac6.4 billion and \u20ac6.7 billion, at cc. | SAP has managed to deliver a robust top-line performance despite what Gartner and other research firms had to say about IT spending woes. The company has established dominance over three of the most critical client demand areas, namely efficient customer engagement, human capital management and interconnected commerce network. Stiff industry rivalry and cutthroat competition in contemporary business enterprises are causing firms to scour for technological platforms that can help them outshine peers.We believe that robust demand momentum for efficient software tools by leading business enterprises offers SAP excellent opportunities for future growth.

The company projects subscription additions for fiscal 2017 to be between 475,000 - 525,000.In the near term, Autodesk's financials will likely be affected by increasing investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives.

The Dow fell more than 100 points before recovering to cut those losses roughly in half. The primary culprit was the Federal Reserve and central bank chair Janet Yellen, who made comments suggesting the Fed might be more aggressive in raising interest rates in the future than many had expected. Given Yellen's traditional tone of being careful about prematurely tightening monetary policy, the turnaround led to greater nervousness, and that likely justified the sell-off in the overall market.Some stocks managed to gain ground regardless, and among the best performers were  (NASDAQ: ADSK) ,  (NASDAQ: FRGI) , and  (NASDAQ: EPAY) .Autodesk gained 8% after the computer-aided design company announced its fiscal second-quarter results Thursday afternoon. At first glance, Autodesk's financials might not seem to justify much excitement, given that revenue fell 10% compared to the year-ago quarter and the company only managed to post adjusted net earnings of $0.05 per share, off nearly three-quarters from fiscal 2016's second quarter. Yet like many of its peers in the software industry, Autodesk has worked hard to try to create sources of sales that repeat each year rather than representing one-time income, and the company said it grew recurring revenue at a 10% rate during the quarter. More importantly, Autodesk gave positive guidance for the fiscal third quarter and the full year, with narrower losses and higher sales than it previously anticipated. As long as demand for CAD software remains strong, Autodesk remains a good long-term pick as it makes a key transition toward a better business model.Fiesta Restaurant Group climbed 9% in the wake of Thursday afternoon's announcement that CEO Tim Taft would retire at the end of the year. The parent company of the Taco Cabana and Pollo Tropical restaurant chains said it would create a search committee to find a successor and work with Taft to create a transition plan to prevent any disruptions in the company's operations. In addition, Fiesta said it would reconsider its previous strategy of separating out Taco Cabana from the rest of the business, in part because of difficult conditions in the restaurant industry right now. Given the difficult time Fiesta stock has had lately, the potential for a change in direction is clearly appealing to shareholders.Finally, Bottomline Technologies gained 12%. The provider of electronic payment solutions and digital banking services released its fourth-quarter financial report, featuring substantial gains in subscription-based revenue that helped push overall sales upward by more than most had expected. The company also managed to grow adjusted earnings from year-ago levels, defying calls for a pullback in profitability. In particular, investors seemed to applaud the fact that more of Bottomline's business is coming from cloud-computing based applications. Bottomline also announced a stock repurchase program amounting to $60 million, which could also help the share price.

The 52-week high is at $65.78, and the 50- and 100-day major moving averages are in solid uptrends. The 200-day moving average has leveled out after a steady rise that started in May, but it looks stable.Wall Street is forecasting a loss of 13 cents a share on revenue of $512 million.The company was profitable in three of the past four quarters and has topped estimates during this time period despite reporting a loss of 10 cents last quarter. The low estimate for the recently ended quarter is for a loss of 16 cents, while the high estimate is for a loss of 12 cents.Despite what could be back-to-back quarterly losses for Autodesk stock, shares have powered higher since bottoming just below $50 in June. The fundamental story makes going long ahead of the news a risky proposition, however, despite the strong technical setup.To offset some of the risk, a \"straddle\" option trade could be used to play the event, but shares will need to make a major move for the trade to make money. The ADSK Sept $67.50 calls (ADSK160916C00067500, $0.82) and the Sept $60 puts (ADSK160916P00060000, $1.11) are pricing in a move of up to 5% in the stock.Here is how the trade would make money.

A 100% return would be achieved if shares clear $71 or fall below $56 by mid-September.The options have over three weeks before they expire, which is why this trade is a tempting one to take.

While the VR device itself offers considerable opportunity, it's also important to investors and the Street that Intel got onboard in the early stages of a market with almost limitless upside.As big as the VR market is forecast to become, most pundits agree that augmented reality (AR), or a \"virtual\" world in which users are still aware of their physical surroundings, is -- due to its commercial applications -- where the real opportunity lies. The good news for Intel fans and investors in search of a long-term growth and income alternative is that it has that base covered as well.Image source:  .CEO Brian Krzanich kicked off Intel's annual developer conference in San Francisco, CA last week with a bang. Krazanich introduced Project Alloy and its \"merged reality,\" all-in-one headset. Though Intel describes project alloy as an \"all-in-one virtual reality solution made from the ground up,\" it has applications for both VR and AR.The headset stands apart from other VR and AR solutions in several ways. First, there are no VR-like \"pesky cords\" to deal with as the device is entirely self-contained. Similar to  's(NASDAQ: MSFT) HoloLens, alloy gives users the ability to safely roam an area with its built-in collision detection and avoidance sensors while retaining the merged reality experience.Intel plans to open the ecosystem doors to developers and hopes to have its partners ready to deliver units next year. Intel added that it has come to a collaboration agreement with Microsoft in collision detection and avoidance sensors, to \"optimize Windows-based content and experiences on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy.\" And the arrangement between the two tech juggernauts doesn't stop there.Krzanich was joined by a Microsoft Windows exec onstage at the developer conference and announced that in addition to the opportunities that merged reality offers users of Microsoft's suite of business software, combined they were able to develop a PC gaming, merged reality experience that requires less powerful computers than VR headsets from the likes of Oculus Rift and Vive.Both Rift and Vive require PC computing power that few consumers have, and costs for a unit with the power needed start around $1,000 and go up from there. Computing cost is a concern voiced by several pundits as a roadblock to overcome before VR reaches its full potential. With Microsoft's assistance, Intel's alloy could very well prove to be the solution VR gamers have been looking for.While VR garners much of the press, the AR market is expected to dwarf virtual reality in the coming years. According to one forecast, of the $150 billion in combined revenue the two alternate realities are expected to generate by 2020, AR will garner a whopping $120 billion of that thanks to its multiple commercial uses.Microsoft HoloLens already has commercial arrangements with leading auto manufacturers, software design developers including  , construction, and education providers, among a host of others. So what does that mean for Intel? Unlimited potential because alloy's merged reality experience essentially combines the two technologies so both VR gamers and construction engineers, as an example, can each use a variation of the same, alloy-developed device.The result is Intel-powered alloy headsets will garner a piece of both the VR and AR $150 billion pie in the coming years. That said, in the near-term Intel will continue to rely on its cloud-based data center sales, security, and Internet of Things (IoT) to drive topline growth, and make up for its waning Client Computing Group, which declined again last quarter to $7.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year.With its stock price bumping up against 52-week highs, investors are finally recognizing that Intel's future lies in the cloud, IoT, and related markets. But as the new alloy headset and agreement with Microsoft attest, it's not going to miss out on another up-and-coming opportunity, which should be music to the ears of Intel shareholders.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

In the last quarter, the company delivered in-line earnings. The company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 23.22% in the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Autodesk's business transition is adding to its subscriptions and deferred revenues. The company has already started seeing decent growth in new subscriptions. In the first quarter, though the transition was underway, new subscriptions represented more than half of the total subscription additions. Also, the company remains focused on undertaking more cost-cutting initiatives as a part of its business transition.In Jun 2016  the company unveiled a number of updates to its Forge platform while increasing its investment in the same. This apart, Autodesk collaborated with Trimble in the quarter in order to accelerate interoperability to help clients save time and money.However, in the near term, the company's financials may also be affected by increasing investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. This is a concern as the company is yet to report profits. The other headwinds are foreign exchange fluctuations and competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  , Microsoft Corp.  and Adobe Systems.For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $500 million - $520 million. Non-GAAP loss per share (excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles) is expected in the range of 11 cents - 18 cents for the quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Autodesk is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Autodesk's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 30 cents.

The distinction between the two is that VR fully immerses a user into an alternate reality, while AR essentially puts virtual \"stuff\" into a user's real world, enhancing it.Many pundits believe that AR will dominate the two alternate reality options because of the multiple commercial applications. And that's where  (NASDAQ: ADSK) enters the picture: Autodesk's engineering-related design modeling software is ideally suited to AR, and it's wasting no time in pursuing the cutting-edge new technology.Image source: Autodesk.Autodesk recently inked a two-phase deal with  (NASDAQ: MSFT) that includes embedding its Spark 3D printing software into the world's most popular operating system, Windows 10. As an Autodesk exec put it, \"We're approaching a tipping point with 3D printing, which means there is a huge market opportunity waiting for companies developing applications for Windows 10.\" And Autodesk intends to get its fair share of that \"huge market.\"Last year, the manufacturing industry alone -- the primary market for 3D printing, and right in Autodesk's wheelhouse -- generated over $5 billion in revenue, a more than 26% increase from the prior year; that rapid growth rate isn't expected to slow anytime soon. But it's the second initiative of Autodesk's alignment with Microsoft that warrants long-term investors' attention.The plan, according to Autodesk, is to incorporate \"3D models from Autodesk software into the virtual reality environment of Microsoft HoloLens\"; this will allow designers to surround themselves in their virtual designs, inspect various aspects, and then make changes as needed. It's this type of application that separates AR and VR in terms of growth expectations.Combined, AR and VR are expected to generate a whopping $150 billion in sales in 2020 -- good news for providers of both technologies. Here's the best part for Autodesk: of that massive opportunity, AR is forecast to garner as much as $120 billion, easily outdistancing the gamer-focused world of VR. That disparity in market potential is exactly why Autodesk has partnered with Microsoft and its HoloLens: the unlimited applications in the engineering, construction, automotive, and related industries.Despite the nearly unlimited upside that AR, 3D printing, and similar technologies offer Autodesk, investors might be a bit dismayed given its financial results last quarter, not to mention guidance for fiscal 2017 that suggests a 20% year-over-year decline in revenue. It's no wonder shareholders are sitting on an 8% drop in stock price, year to date. But there's a bit more to the story.Autodesk CEO Carl Bass and team are in the midst of a significant transition focused on driving annual recurring revenue (ARR) via cloud-based subscription sales. The result of the shift to a more stable ongoing revenue model is that its top line will be \"negatively impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front.\" In other words, Autodesk is focused on the same thing as growth investors: generating sustainable, long-term growth. And it's working.Last quarter, Autodesk grew subscription sales 132,000 sequentially, and now boasts 2.71 million recurring revenue customers and another 567,000 new model subscribers: up 140,000 compared to the prior quarter. On the ARR front, Autodesk is also moving in the right direction, climbing 9% to $1.44 billion on an annualized basis. New-model ARR, which is where Autodesk's alignment with Microsoft's HoloLens will likely be housed, jumped an impressive 71% year over year to $308 million.Patience is necessary, to be sure, but Autodesk's transition is in full swing and the results are beginning to show. Now toss in the upside offered by a HoloLens-enhanced design software suite, and Autodesk promises to be one of the best, under-the-radar AR investment opportunities around.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

Clearly, Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen and team dropped the proverbial ball in fiscal 2016's second quarter, right?Turns out, not only did Adobe meet or exceed vaunted analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) in Q2, it reported its best quarter ever. After sharing such a strong quarter, Adobe's guidance was alluded to by some pundits as the reason for its stock price easing, but that makes little to no sense, either. And therein lies the opportunity for long-term growth investors in search of value.Image source: Adobe.It was about four years ago that Adobe began to materially change its business model with the introduction of its Creative Cloud. It may seem old hat today, but at the time the shift to a subscription-based service delivered via the cloud was fairly cutting-edge, and the move has paid off handsomely. As impressive as Adobe's record quarterly revenue of $1.4 billion was, it took a back seat to its Creative Cloud sales and the recurring revenue they bring.The digital media segment jumped 26% last quarter to a record $943 million, driven by a whopping $755 million in Creative Cloud revenue, good for a 37% year-over-year improvement. A primary reason for Narayen's efforts to deliver subscription cloud services is the recurring revenue they generate. Ongoing, relatively stable sales are a fantastic means of building a business foundation, and Adobe has this nailed.Narayen also pointed to Adobe's Creative Cloud, along with its Document Cloud, as a key to boosting Adobe's digital media unit's annual recurring revenue (ARR) to an impressive $3.41 billion in Q2. To put that into perspective, Adobe issued guidance of $5.8 billion in total sales for 2016, which means that as of today, nearly 60% of its expected revenue this year will come from ongoing subscription customers.Adobe's move to an ARR model is hardly exclusive, as others in the sector including  (NASDAQ: ADSK) are quick to point to their own success in building an ongoing source of sales. Autodesk CFO Scott Herren attributed its solid, if not spectacular, fiscal 2017 Q1 results, announced on May 19, to \"success we are having with our business model transition\" -- namely, driving subscription sales to boost recurring revenue.It's worth noting another benefit of recurring revenue: It simply doesn't cost as much to generate those sales as relying on new customers to bolster the top line. Despite growing revenue by 20% last quarter, Adobe's cost of revenue increased just 9% year-over-year, as did operating expenses. That's a formula not only for future growth on Adobe's top and bottom lines, it's also a testament to Narayen and team's sound leadership.Though hardly the sole reason to invest in any stock, Adobe analysts' consensus target of $111.73 per share is 20% above June 28's closing price of $92.46, and based on expectations for both the current quarter and fiscal year, pundits' expectations could prove overly conservative.Adobe naysayers may point to its current lofty valuation given that it's trading at over 52 times trailing earnings, and at first glance they'd be right. However, with expected revenue growth of 20% both this quarter and this year, along with a more than 60% jump in non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) EPS forecast for fiscal 2016, Adobe's forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 24 makes it an absolute steal.Down the road Adobe could see competition from the likes of virtual reality and augmented reality providers, but as it stands it's dug a fairly effective moat to defend its market of creative professionals. Autodesk has its place among structural designers, and virtual reality is still focused on gamers, so Adobe's competitive edge should remain intact for years to come.Adobe's competitive advantage, combined with its impressive cloud-based ARR, total sales growth, and diligent management team, is why it warrants a prominent spot on most any value investor's buy list.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

At the same time Alphabet  and Oracle  found themselves heading to court again.Here are the top stories-Back-to-back negative reports from the Nikkei impacted Apple shares last week. The first of these mentioned falling iPhone shipments based on estimates from IHS, smartphone part makers and manufacturing equipment makers, all of which see increasing demand for cheaper Chinese smartphones from Huawei, Xiaomi, Lenovo, ZTE, Vivo, etc. While Huawei is currently expected to be the biggest gainer (to grow 20-30% this year), the top 10 Chinese smartphone makers are together expected to grow 15% to 550 million.The other reports focused on weak sales of Apple component suppliers and measures taken by Japanese and Taiwanese part makers to target Chinese phone makers. Since Apple is already dealing with its first quarter of shipment decline, the Nikkei reports had more of a negative impact.Oracle lawyer Peter Bicks says that Alphabet's Google made $42 billion in revenue and $21 billion in profits from Android-based smartphones and is therefore seeking $8.8 billion in damages, or around 11.7% of its balance sheet cash. It's a huge amount even for Google, but it's as yet unclear if Google will have to pay for it. Google used 37 application programming interfaces (APIs, or software code that enables interoperability between programs) that belonged to Sun, which was subsequently taken over by Oracle.The last time the case was tried, the court held that the technology wasn't copyrightable. Moreover, Google argued that the inability to use APIs and making them negotiable and licensable, especially in the given circumstances (such as Sun encouraging Java use to ensure its proliferation) would limit innovation. App and hardware makers building on Android would also be affected and there would be cost escalation for all.HP, Red Hat and Yahoo submitted papers supporting Google while Microsoft, EMC and NetApp sided with Oracle at the time. Both sides argued for innovation. Microsoft said that failure to protect APIs would lead software makers to reveal less about them, which would in turn affect innovation.But that was a long time ago. Oracle now says it has numbers to support its claims. Google of course doesn't make anything from Android but from software it has developed on it that people use to search, download apps, etc. It doesn't even sell those, earning only from the ads and commissions they generate.So after Google was granted victory in 2012, the decision was overturned on appeal, when Google asked the Supreme Court to hear the case. When they refused, the case went for retrial. Now there's a jury of 8 women and 2 men to decide Google's fate.\n  \nOther stories you might have missed- : Confirming earlier reports about possible iPhone manufacturing in India, last week saw a fresh report from ET saying that Apple supplier Foxconn was ready to sign a contract for a $10 billion facility covering 1200 acres in India's Maharashtra state. Apple's plans of selling refurbished phones in the country were hit by regulatory authorities on account of competitive concerns.A manufacturing facility in the country aligns with the government's plans of creating 6 million manufacturing jobs through the \"Make in India\" initiative. If Apple resorts to India-only prices as this facility might enable and as manufacturers in other industries already do, it has a much better chance of tapping the Indian market where the average smartphone costs around $150. : Apple's supplier of choice is Taiwan Semiconductor, which has reportedly started taping out the design for its 10nm A11 chip. It's currently expected that the chips will be qualified by the end of the year with samples shipping in the first quarter of 2017. It was earlier thought that Taiwan Semiconductor would secure an exclusive contract, which made sense since it is more focused on developing leading edge technology that Apple can make use of in the future. But it now appears that Samsung is likely to get a quarter share of orders. : 27 Swedish broadcasters, publishers and media associations have objected to Facebook's deal with partly state-owned telecom Telia. The deal offers Facebook to customers without charging them for the data used. The concept hasn't been popular in a number of places, most notably India where it was objected to on the grounds of net neutrality. Swedish companies are objecting on the same grounds. : Intel refinanced some debt that matures this year and in 2017. It sold $2.75 billion in bonds with five, ten and thirty-year maturities and carrying an S&P rating of A+. The 30-year part is the biggest one through which it raised $1.25 billion at 1.55%. The company will also repay $1.5 billion of its 1.95% percent notes due in October and a portion of the 1.35% notes due next year. : News reports last week said that the Yahoo Mail and Google appspot.com had been banned in the lower house of Congress on security concerns. In Yahoo's case, it was because the mail was allowing ransomware attacks, in which hackers attach malicious software to emails. In Google's case, it was because appspot continues to host remote access tools that were capable of stealing personally identifiable information and a trojan named BLT. The FBI issued warnings on these in June 2015. : Microsoft has announced that its Canadian cloud is now open for operation. This is a big deal because it allows businesses and governments to store their data within the country while using Microsoft solutions such as its IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and hybrid platforms. Microsoft has said that Office 365 is already available for data residency and Dynamics CRM is coming in September. : Alibaba's entry into the Washington DC-based International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC) last month has ruffled many. Gucci and Michael Kors already quit the lobby group in protest and last week saw an anonymous letter to the board that there would be mass exits unless Alibaba was ousted. The relationship between IACC President Robert Barchiesi (who has held Alibaba shares since its IPO) and Matthew Bassiur (who took over as Alibaba's head of intellectual property enforcement this January) has also been called into question.China's leading ecommerce company has battled with counterfeits on its Taobao platform for long and many brands are unhappy with its limited success. Taobao has announced fresh rules to crack down on counterfeit items including new requirements for luxury goods sellers that require them to upload proof of authentic goods by May 20, failing which they can have their fund balances frozen. : Following the approval of the Ministry of Commerce of China (MOFCOM), the deal, which was already approved by other regulatory bodies and company shareholders, came to a close. Western Digital, which specializes in HDDs and San Disk, which specializes in the new age NVM are perfectly complementary to each other with broad product and industry experience. So the acquisition is a boon for shareholders. SanDisk co-founder, President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra joins the Western Digital board of directors. Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan continues as CEO of the combined company. : Facebook has been anonymously accused of suppressing news stories that offer a conservative view point. Zuckerberg said an investigation was in progress although there was no evidence of this happening and that he would meet conservative leaders through the week. Facebook also confirmed that it will remain a sponsor of the GOP's July convention in Cleveland despite pressure from liberal activists. Separately, U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul S. Grewal has left the bench to become global litigation head at Facebook. : A new report from Politico indicates that Alphabet's Google is in for some fresh investigation into its search practices. The report says that the investigation is in its early stages, so details are limited. But the idea is to see if Google has misused its dominant position in search to favor its own products. A previous investigation found it not guilty back in 2013.Both search and Android OS are being scrutinized by European authorities. The British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph reported yesterday that Google was looking at a fine of up to $3.4 billion (or up to 10% of its annual sales) plus a ban on favoring itself over rivals in search but that the bill had not been finalized. : Groupon has sued IBM in Chicago district court for infringing on its software patent. Specifically, Groupon alleges that IBM's WebSphere Commerce platform infringes on a patent that Groupon holds. This follows IBM's suing the company for infringement of four of its patents, which said that Groupon's lawsuit is without merit. : Possibly in order to better target business users, WhatsApp has now spread to Macs and PCs. The app is now available on the broadest range of operating systems including iOS, Android, Blackberry and Windows and has the reach of other leading messaging services, such as iMessage and Skype. Facebook Messenger is close on its heels with apps for mobile, web and as a Windows 8 or 10 app. : Business Insider reports that India comes first as far as Facebook At Work adoption is concerned and says that it's because of its high mobile dependence. Users can typically toggle between their personal and official accounts, with Facebook serving ads on the first one and giving companies total control over the other one which is ad-free. First users are happy with the product calling out its intuitive feature. : Microsoft is courting corporate technology buyers by allowing them to make bulk purchases of third party apps from its Windows Store for Business launched last November. While there's no incentive yet, volume discounts are reportedly on the way.That's not all -- it is removing the option to block the purchase of apps using Windows 10 Pro devices. This is a cheaper version of its OS, usually used by SMBs. If the IT departments want greater control over company devices, they have to upgrade to its pricier product. All this is expected to interest developers to make more apps for Windows, which is absolutely necessary if it is to succeed against Android and iOS. : Google has a developers' conference this week where we might learn more about a new device along the lines of Amazon's popular Echo. Re/code's Mark Bergen says the device will be called Chirp and is in all probability being developed by its Nest group. Nest has some earlier success with smart thermostats and security cameras and has something of a cool design team. So we should get ready for a smart device answering questions, fetching mail, turning on music, etc but hopefully Google will think of a sexier name than OK Google. : Amazon has launched a YouTube killer/competitor called Amazon Video Direct that will live on user-generated content the way YouTube does. But Amazon may get it to profit sooner since it can advertize the millions of items it sells on the platform. It also has a fairly large and loyal user base that it feeds through Prime, so uptake could be quick. Just how Amazon hopes to tie this in with the rest of what it does isnt something it's talking about yet, but the possibilities are exciting.Also, note that Amazon has some fairly successful original content that sets it apart from other video providers except Netflix. Still, YouTube has many more years of experience in video distribution and also has brand value, so it should be a good fight. : Salesforce will build its IoT cloud on AWS according to the WSJ. This is a big win for Amazon, which also recently helped Netflix move to its cloud. While Amazon remains the largest online retailer with significant growth prospects, all the excitement in recent times has been about AWS.Its cloud infrastructure business, while making a single-digit contribution to revenue, generates nearly half its profit. Note that Salesforce's flagship CRM offering competes with Microsoft's Dynamics CRM. Microsoft is second in the IaaS segment, so Amazon (the market leader) is the best company it could have gone to. : Apple has invested a billion dollars in Chinese ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing Technology. Company president Jean Liu has said that the two companies would \"benefit each other on product, on technology, on many other levels,\" but no other details are available.Apple's only known interest in cars is with respect to its autonomous/electric car technology, which is another secret project with few details available. It's extremely hard to understand Apple's move here. If it had been a manufacturing alliance, Apple would have tied with car makers, instead its tied with technology companies. SO Didi could be interested in using these cars when they become available. This could be a goal of the Chinese government as well as it moves to reduce China's carbon footprint. : Alibaba and Softbank have formed a joint venture (called SB Cloud) to offer cloud services in Japan. Softbank's goal is to develop the perfect cloud for Japanese companies and multinationals with data residency in Japan. Alibaba brings its secure, scalable cloud computing technology to the JV so the companies can deliver data storage and processing services, enterprise-level middleware and cloud security services. : Micron said it was expecting a third quarter loss of 5-12 cents per share on revenue of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. Analysts expect Micron to report a loss of 4 cents per share on revenue of $3.2 billion. The softness at Micron is because it is focused on memory chips for the PC market where prices continue to slide. The company does have new products in the pipeline, but they aren't expected to make a contribution yet. :  ,  ,  ,  ,  :  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , CRM, SNPSWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Revenues were impacted by a 43% year-over-year decline in License revenues to $185.9 million. The results in the quarter were impacted to some extent by the exit from perpetual license offerings. Subscription revenues however increased about 2% from the year-ago quarter to $326.7 million.Total subscriptions increased approximately 132,000 from the prior quarter to 2.71 million in the quarter. New model subscriptions (desktop, enterprise flexible license, and cloud subscription) increased approximately 140,000 from the last quarter to 567,000.Segment wise, revenues from the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segment decreased 8% from the year-ago quarter to $219 million.Manufacturing revenues decreased 14% on a year-over-year basis to $158 million.Revenues from Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) plummeted about 46% from the year-ago quarter to $100 million.Sales from Autodesk's Media and Entertainment (M&E) segment decreased 12% on a year-over-year basis to $35 million in the reported quarter.Geographically, revenues in the Americas decreased 11% year over year to $218 million. EMEA revenues declined 17% to $203 million, while the same in APAC decreased 42% from the year-ago quarter to $92 million.Adjusted gross margin contracted 380 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 84.1% in the reported quarter.Adjusted operating expenses were $514.2 million during the quarter. Autodesk also recorded a restructuring related charge of $52.3 million in the quarter. As a result, the company's profitability was impacted. Autodesk's adjusted loss from operations was $83.9 million.Autodesk exited the fiscal with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $2.27 billion compared with $2.25 billion as on Jan 31, 2016.Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $164.4 million compared with $86.5 million in the prior-year quarter.For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $500 million - $520 million. Non-GAAP loss per share (excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles) is expected in the range of 11 cents - 18 cents for the quarter.In fiscal 2017, Autodesk continues to expect revenues in the range of $1,950 million - $2,050 million. Non-GAAP loss (excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles) is expected in the range of 70 cents - 95 cents per share. The company projects subscription additions for fiscal 2017 to be between 475,000 - 525,000.We believe Autodesk's business transition (from licenses to cloud-based services) though affecting its business in the near term will benefit it in the long run.

Forge provides a means for developers to extend Autodesk's suite of cloud-based solutions, which in turn is expected to fuel CEO Carl Bass' efforts to boost recurring revenue via subscription sales and fend off fast-growing competitors, including France-based  (NASDAQOTH: DASTY) .Based on Autodesk's fiscal first-quarter 2017 results, announced May 19, subscription sales, recurring revenue, and deferred sales all performed admirably. However, while peers like Dassault were reporting top- and bottom-line growth, Autodesk's transformation initiatives have taken a near-term toll on sales: dropping 21% to $511 million last quarter.The answer, as per Bass, is Autodesk's Forge platform, along with investments in new, fast-growing markets via its $100 million investment fund. And it's wasting no time in getting its transition and investments in tech upstarts into full swing.Image source: .Image source:  .If the recently completed Forge developers conference is any indication, Autodesk's emphasis on cloud-based product offerings is off to a strong start. The company said it hosted more than 1,000 cloud developers during the conference, held June 15 and 16 in San Francisco. That's not a bad showing just six months after it introduced Forge to the dev world.There was no shortage of new product and development announcements, including expanding the Forge platform to assist developers in building new 3D-printing features, improving data management capabilities, and transforming 3D images into usable information, all delivered via the cloud. That's great stuff and should give developers everything they need to expand Autodesk's suite of services.But the Forge platform developments took a backseat to news of Autodesk's investments in a few upstarts that are on the leading edge of the drone and Internet of Things markets.In the next five years, sales of drones are expected to grow by 50% to $12 billion, largely due to commercial and government enterprises, including military applications, and the construction, telecom, and energy industries. That's a lot of upside, and explains why Autodesk announced at its Forge gathering that it had invested an undisclosed sum in leading drone maker 3D Robotics.3D Robotics is already using the Forge system to capture data and images from its drones and transform that information into engineering data. Autodesk and its 3D design software is ideal for data-collecting drones, and its recent commitment to 3D Robotics, though likely small-ish -- remember, Autodesk committed \"just\" $100 million for its entire investment fund -- opens the doors to a world of revenue-generating opportunities.Another of Autodesk's intriguing investments is in Seebo, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform designed to transform \"simple,\" everyday objects into IoT \"smart\" technologies. Everything from toys to fashion are made \"smart\" by simply dragging and dropping connected components including sensors, bluetooth, and GPS, into a product design framework.As is the case with 3D Robotics, Seebo is already an avid Forge system developer. The combination of Seebo's SaaS solutions with Autodesk is designed for \"manufacturers to tap into the world of IoT simply, securely and cost effectively.\"This year is expected to see some 6.4 billion IoT connected \"things\" in use, a 30% jump from 2015. And depending on which market estimate you choose to believe, the revenue possibilities are seemingly endless, with some suggesting IoT will grow into a trillion-dollar -plus opportunity. Autodesk's IoT forays are in their early stages to be sure, but with so much upside, even a slice of such a huge revenue pie will move the needle.Despite Autodesk's drop in revenue, which was particularly painful given one of its primary competitors, Dassault, reported a 6% jump in sales, its 132,000 sequential jump in subscriptions is nothing short of spectacular. As was Autodesk's 9% increase in annualized recurring revenue to $1.44 billion and 32% jump in deferred sales to $1.52 billion.The transformation is picking up steam, and as Autodesk's recent investments indicate, its future is no longer tied to desktop software, and that bodes well for growth investors with some patience.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 42.86%. The company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 23.22% in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Autodesk's business transition (from licenses to cloud-based services) is boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues. Also, the company remains focused on undertaking more cost-cutting initiatives as a part of its business transition. It's noteworthy that though the transition is still underway, the company has started seeing strong growth in new subscription additions.In Apr 2016  Autodesk acquired Solid Angle, an Arnold developing company. Arnold is an advanced, ray-tracing image provider for creating superior 3D animation and visual effects. While this acquisition is expected to be a long-term growth driver, it would likely have a negative financial impact in the to-be-reported quarter.In addition, the company's profitability may also be affected by increasing investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. The other concerns are foreign exchange fluctuations and competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  , Microsoft Corp.  and Google.For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Autodesk expects revenues in a range of $500 million - $520 million.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Autodesk is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Autodesk's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 26 cents. Autodesk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is a company, which you may consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Best Buy Co., Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.94% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Made In Space, founded in 2010 and based at NASA's Ames Research Center, launched its first 3D printer to the ISS in September 2014, as part of its \"3D Printing in Microgravity Experiment\" demonstration. It used findings from that mission to develop the AMF.The AMF is also the first \"hardware store in space,\" with Lowe's the first retailer operating off-Earth. While Made In Space owns the 3D printer, Lowe's will use it to produce branded tools that will be commercially available.  also clinched a first: Its software was used to design the printer. (Made In Space also used Autodesk's software to design its first 3D printer.) The AMF is an extrusion-based 3D printer that has a build envelope of 14 cm (w) x 10 cm (d) x 10 cm (h) -- equivalent to about 5.5 x 3.9 x 3.9 inches. In addition to having a larger print volume than its predecessor, it also has expanded materials capabilities. Initially, it will print in more than 30 polymers, including ABS (which is the plastic from which Legos are made), HDPE, and PEI/PC, but it's designed to print with other materials as they become approved for ISS operations. The printer's resolution capabilities are in the 0.1-to-0.44-millimeter range, depending upon material.The 3D printer can be operated locally and remotely, including from Earth. This remote operability feature opens up the AMF for commercial use, as it allows Made In Space personnel and customers on Earth to upload designs to be 3D-printed. It also provides backup support to those operating the AMF locally.The AMF is available to research and commercial entities, as well as to NASA and the U.S. National Laboratory on board the ISS. It can be used to produce hardware for experimentation, tools, parts, education purposes, and microgravity research. Built to be modular and upgradable, the AMF will also be used as a research platform to advance other in-space manufacturing techniques.NASA and other customers will pay Made In Space to use the AMF. The cost will generally range from $6,000 to $30,000 for one print job, Made In Space's head of product strategy, Spencer Pitman, told  though there are discounts for education initiatives. Pitman said that the company already has orders from more than 20 customers, including for medical research components, parts for satellites and other spacecraft, and parts for school projects, according to  The benefits of in-space 3D printing include faster delivery time; the ability to design lighter, more optimized parts; and increased safety. Some benefits also result in cost savings.Being able to produce spare parts and tools in space will be tremendously valuable to NASA and astronauts. Currently, NASA has to launch considerably more parts than any mission will need, which is extremely costly. After all, it's not like astronauts can make quick jaunts to the nearest hardware store or call a contractor like we earthlings can if we're in need of a quick fix.Another advantage relates to the design of the parts themselves. Objects made on Earth often need to be structurally reinforced to withstand the stresses of the launch, which subjects them to gravitational forces three to nine times those on Earth. This additional weight isn't needed once the object is in orbit, so in-space printing will allow for the creation of ultra-light objects. Less material use means less cost.These facts illustrate the potential for in-space 3D printing to make life in space easier and considerably less costly:Ultimately, NASA's goal is to include 3D printers on all space missions. Beyond the moneysaving and convenience factors, there's the safety aspect. There's no way even a group of rocket scientists can foresee every conceivable emergency scenario. So, having a 3D printer on board to crank out jerry-rigged fixes on space missions could be lifesaving. The AMF's availability for commercial business should help kick-start the burgeoning space economy, which some predict could ultimately be a trillion-dollar market. Self-sufficiency, or at least near-self-sufficiency, is a must if humans are to eventually colonize other planets, such as Mars, which SpaceX founder and Chairman Elon Musk believes will occur within 20 years.The first object -- a prototype of a spacecraft -- ever 3D-printed from asteroid material. Image source: Planetary Resources.A few companies, such as Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, have formed with the goal of mining asteroids to use as feedstock for off-Earth manufacturing. Planetary Resources, in fact, together with its partner 3D Systems, revealed the first object ever 3D-printed using asteroid material at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2016. Off-Earth 3D printing will certainly eventually present investment opportunities for individual investors. While Made In Space is currently a private company, there's the possibility that it could go public to raise capital to help fund expansion.Companies entering the asteroid mining business also bear watching. Planetary Resources, which is building spacecraft for harvesting asteroids, counts billionaires Larry Page, CEO and co-founder of  (parent company of Google), and Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, among its founding investors.3D Systems and Stratasys? Personally, I don't think they'll enter the off-Earth 3D printing \"space,\" as it has extremely high barriers to entry, and they have enough potential business on Earth.One thing's for sure: The sky is no longer the limit for 3D printing -- or its profits.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Autodesk signed an interoperability agreement with  , which will make it easier for customers to transfer files between different CAD platforms. Difficulties with that can be a major pain point as designers work with manufacturers to produce parts, so being able to use software that is compatible with Siemens' products will be a nice feature for customers.The company also reached a truce with activist hedge funds Sachem Head Capital Management and Eminence Capital. They'll vote for the company's board of director nominees through the end of September, including three members recently named to the board. Activist investors tend to be more a thorn in the side of a company's management than a great value to its stock, so the agreement Autodesk made with those hedge funds is an incremental positive for the company. And it may help that shares have had a strong run in 2016, which should ease some of their fears about the lack of value creation.But long-term, the interoperability agreement between Autodesk and Siemens will probably be a bigger deal. As a former designer, I know firsthand that lack of compatibility between CAD programs can be a huge inconvenience; partnering with one of the largest CAD companies for manufacturing should have a material impact on customers' desire to choose Autodesk as their software vendor.

The king of activist investors,  ' namesake Carl Icahn, lifted his stake in the company to 8% last December.The following month, Xerox agreed to not only split into two companies in order to \"drive shareholder value,\" but to award the Icahn Partners leading light three of the nine board seats in one of those entities.The voices of activist investors are getting louder, with numerous other recent examples of successful agitating. These include the latest win for Icahn Partners and its cohorts, who managed to score (along with fellow high-profile activist John Paulson) a pair of board seats at insurance giant  .In this atmosphere, and facing an activist bloc that holds an 11%-plus stake, Autodesk is probably making the right move by inking its peace deal.This buys it some time to show that its shift to the cloud is working. If its current Q1 and upcoming Q2 come in above expectations, and/or that subscriber growth is impressive, it might be able to fend off those gadflies a little longer.

Rick Hill, chairman of Tessera Technologies Inc and Jeff Clarke, CEO of Kodak, will serve as members of the Board's Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee and Audit Committee, respectively.The board will currently have 13 members. However, this will come down to 11 members after the 2016 annual meeting as twomembers will not opt for re-election. Autodesk said that following the agreement, Sachem Head and Eminence Capital have agreed to \"certain standstill and voting provisions\"Last November, Sachem and Eminence Capital disclosed 5.7% and 5.8% stake in Autodesk, respectively and have been pushing the management to maximize shareholders' returns. The development comes close on the heels of CEO Carl Bass criticizing activist investors at the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 conference call while heaping praises on the company's long term investors calling them as constructive investors \"who have raised the same issues in a much better way\".San Rafael, CA-based Autodesk reported fourth-quarter adjusted loss (including stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation but excluding all other non-recurring items and related tax impact) of 4 cents a share, which compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 7 cents.Revenues in the quarter decreased 2.5% year over year to $648.3 million but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $636 million. Revenues were impacted by a 7.2% year-over-year decline in License revenues to $328.8 million. The results in the quarter were impacted to some extent by the exit from perpetual license offerings. Subscription revenues however increased 3% from the year-ago quarter to about $319.5 million.Autodesk is in the middle of business transition from licenses to cloud-based services, which has been boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues. In 2016, maintenance subscription attachments and renewal rates are expected to gain from the discontinuation of perpetual licenses. This would also allow the company to have more flexible pricing terms with its clients, thereby boosting its subscription rates, going ahead. Though the transition is still underway, the company has started seeing strong growth in new subscription.In the fourth quarter of 2015, total subscriptions increased approximately 109,000 from the prior quarter to 2.58 million. New model subscriptions (desktop, enterprise flexible license, and cloud subscription) increased approximately 62,000 from the last quarter to 427,000. Also, the company remains focused on undertaking more cost-cutting initiatives as a part of its business transition. Moreover, in Feb 2016, the company declared that it will reduce its workforce by about 10% and streamline its operations to drive long-term growth. The company expects the transition to be completed by the second half of 2016.Currently, Autodesk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The shoe was available for $300 in a very limited edition of 96 pairs on March 18 via the company's website and at its flagship Brand House store in its hometown of Baltimore. It sold out online before 7 a.m. that day, according to my check.Under Armour was founded in 1996, so the limited edition number \"ties\" into the company's 20th anniversary celebration. More significantly, however, this launch vaulted the relative newcomer to the athletic shoe category ahead of industry goliaths  and  and well-established New Balance in the race to offer a 3D-printed athletic shoe to the general consumer market.Here's what you should know.Image source: Under Armour. Under Armour decided to release a 3D-printed all-purpose training shoe in part because its competitors are working on 3D-printed running shoes and in part because the company's roots are in training, Under Armour vice president of outdoor and training footwear Chris Lindgren told SI.com.The Architech is a multipurpose trainer, which means an athlete can go from an exercise such as weight training to sprinting without changing shoes. In order to accomplish this \"feat,\" Under Armour had to design the shoes to be stable yet lightweight, and provide significant flexibility and cushioning. The secret sauce is the 3D-printed lattice-structure heel, which is produced from a combination of polymers and elastomers that \"makes it soft enough and strong enough to protect and provide structure, but with cushioning underfoot,\" SI.com quoted Lindgren as saying.Under Armour has reportedly been working on the Architech for two years. The process involved studying various different geometric shapes and structures in nature and architecture -- hence, the shoes' name -- to develop a midsole design best suited for a quality multipurpose trainer. Notably,  's Within software was used to generatively design the lattice midsole, which required 3D printing to produce, as it couldn't be made using traditional manufacturing techniques. Generative design is an emerging technology where a computer algorithm creates structures based on criteria like durability, flexibility, and weight. Autodesk Fusion 360 software was also used in the shoe's development.Under Armour reportedly worked with more than 80 athletes who tested and provided feedback on the countless iterations of the trainer, which were tested for more than 120 hours both by athletes and in the company's lab. The rapid prototyping involved was enabled by 3D printing.Under Armour reportedly plans to release several other 3D-printed shoe models this year.New Balance's 3D-printed running shoe will launch in April in Boston. Image source: New Balance.The Architech's release means that Under Armour sprinted ahead of New Balance to become the first company to offer a 3D-printed athletic shoe to the general consumer market. Privately held, Boston-based New Balance announced in November that it plans to launch a limited edition 3D-printed running shoe in Boston this April -- no doubt to coincide with the Boston Marathon on April 18 -- and then in select New Balance retail locations around the world.The two titans in the athletic shoe business, Oregon-based Nike and Germany's Adidas, are currently no-shows in this competition. However, both announced last October plans to step-up their use of 3D printing to include producing customized athletic shoes for the general consumer market. Adidas unveiled Futurecraft 3D, its concept for a running shoe with a 3D-printed midsole customized to provide the right fit and cushioning for a specific consumer's foot. Nike's announcement at its investor day event didn't provide any details. Both companies have used the innovative technology to make extremely limited edition, customized spikes for athletic shoes for elite athletes.The future of the UA Architech and other 3D-printed athletic shoes? Customization. Image source: Under Armour.Under Armour's win in the race to become the first company to sell 3D-printed athletic shoes to the general public is impressive; one would have thought that the industry biggies would have moved a little faster to secure this victory. It's great PR, and first-mover advantages can be lasting. (New Balance, however, will become in April the first company to sell a 3D-printed  to the general consumer market, unless one of its competitors makes a last-minute plunge for the finish line.)The much bigger prize in terms of revenue and profit, however, lies ahead with customized 3D-printed athletic shoes. This product category should explode in size as 3D-printing technology further advances. It seems probable that within just a couple of years, consumers will be able to go into select athletic shoe companies' retail stores to have their feet digitally (excuse the pun) scanned or will do the scanning in the comfort of their homes. In the latter scenario, they'll upload the scan and other relevant information with their order. The shoes will then be 3D-printed, perhaps by a partner company, and shipped to the customer.Such customized shoes will surely be priced at a premium, allowing for a greater profit margin (at least eventually) for athletic shoe companies. Investors looking to profit from this trend could consider investing in Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour. Share of the former two have raced to total returns of nearly 30% and 53%, respectively, for the one-year period ending March 18, leaving the S&P 500's flat performance in the dust. Under Armour has returned 4% over the same period, though it's the longer-term winner, with a five-year return of 433% that considerably outpaced Nike's 264% and Adidas's 101% returns.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Shares of  jumped 10.5% in February as better-than-expected earnings helped drive the stock higher. Revenue fell slightly in the fourth quarter, but the company's subscription model is gaining traction. 109,000 subscribers were added during the quarter to bring the total to 2.58 billion, and deferred revenue jumped 31% to $1.52 billion. The downside is that net loss was $32.7 million, or $0.15 per share. That beat expectations, but with GAAP net loss expected to be $2.91 to $3.32 per share in fiscal 2017, the business is yet to reach a sustainable profitable level. Autodesk has gone through a major business model revamp, pushing subscriptions more heavily. That has led to the decline in revenue short-term, but will lead to more consistent results in the long run. What's concerning now is that the company still isn't expecting to post a profit for the next fiscal year. Results and expectations may have been better than analysts expected in the most recent quarter, but until Autodesk proves the ability to make money, I'll sit on the sidelines of this stock.

This marks Triple D's second such victory in the burgeoning 3D-printed athletic-shoe space. In November, New Balance announced an exclusive partnership with 3D Systems to make the world's first running shoe with a 3D-printed midsole that will be commercially available.First, a look at these two shoes, and then I'll discuss why 3D Systems' SLS tech is emerging as a winner in this space.Image source: Under Armour. Earlier this month, Under Armour introduced the UA Architech, which sports a 3D-printed lattice-structure midsole, and announced the shoe would be available in a limited edition of 96 pairs on March 18. Folks grabbed up the $300 shoes, which were sold out online before 7 a.m. EST that day, according to my check. The Baltimore-based company plans to release several other 3D-printed shoe models this year, and to launch customized 3D-printed shoes in the future.Because the Architech is a multipurpose trainer, an athlete can use it to go from an exercise where stability is critical, such as weightlifting, to one where flexibility and a relatively light weight are key, such as running sprints. Under Armour's development process involved studying various geometric shapes and structures in nature and architecture -- hence the shoe's name -- to develop a midsole heel design that would be best suited for such a shoe. 's  Within software was used to generatively design the lattice midsole, which is impossible to make using conventional manufacturing techniques. Generative design involves a computer algorithm generating structures based on criteria like durability, flexibility, and weight.Under Armour apparently used 3D Systems' SLS technology for this initiative. I figured this was the case, because New Balance is using it to produce 3D-printed running shoes. There's no mention anywhere of the technology used to produce the trainers, but I spotted 3D Systems' printer in a  about this story.Under Armour is likely using the printer on its own, because New Balance's press release in November indicated that it was  collaborating with 3D Systems in its 3D-printed running-shoe efforts. \"Exclusive,\" however, could just apply to 3D printing  shoes, rather than athletic shoes in general.Image source: New Balance. New Balance announced last November that it was working in an exclusive collaboration with 3D Systems to 3D-print an elastomeric material into a honeycomb-like structure to form midsoles for running shoes. The team used 3D Systems' newly developed elastomeric powder, DuraForm Flex TPU, which was 3D-printed using SLS technology. Elastomers are polymers that are light and flexible, yet strong.The midsole was designed based on underfoot pressure data from where the runner's foot strikes the surface, with more cushioning in areas of higher-than-average pressure. This project involved collaboration among experts in running and biomechanics, plastics engineering, material development, and generative design.New Balance's limited-edition -- no word on the exact number -- 3D-printed running shoe will launch first in Boston in April to coincide with the Boston Marathon, and then in select New Balance retail locations around the world. The company reportedly plans to roll out customized versions in 2017, though it hasn't provided details.3D Systems' S Pro SLS Center. Image source: 3D Systems. Selective laser sintering allows for the production of some geometries that are impossible to produce by other 3D-printing technologies, such as stereolithography (SLA) and fused deposition modeling (FDM), let alone by conventional manufacturing methods. This is because the part being made is surrounded by unsintered powder at all times, so it doesn't need special support structures to fabricate overhanging designs. Additionally, because the SLS machine's chamber is always filled with powder material, multiple parts can be positioned to fit within it, making the process more cost-effective.3D Systems had the patent lock on SLS technology until several key patents expired in 2014. So it's almost a sure thing that any company that's been using SLS technology in its 3D-printing efforts for a while is using a 3D Systems' model.Image source: Carbon3D.It's looking like 3D-printed athletic shoes will be a big business in the relatively near future. 3D Systems needs to speed up its SLS technology if it wants to be a major player in  customized midsoles.Investors should keep their eyes on start-up Carbon3D, which plans to launch a super-speedy 3D printer in 2016 that reportedly excels at producing elastomers. Carbon3D announced last spring that an unnamed \"major athletic apparel\" company was testing a 3D printer based on its Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP) technology. I believe it's likely that  (my second guess is Under Armour) is the athletic-apparel company that's testing this printer for the production of midsoles for athletic shoes.Autodesk's generative design technology is also worth a watch. If 3D printing for production purposes beyond small runs takes off -- and there's every reason to believe it will -- Autodesk Within software could be a considerable winner.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

(Symbol: ADSK) saw new options become available this week, for the October 21st expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADSK options chain for the new October 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $47.50 strike price has a current bid of $5.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $47.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $41.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $48.41/share today.Because the $47.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 11.68% return on the cash commitment, or 17.77% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., and highlighting in green where the $47.50 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.75. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $48.41/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 15.16% if the stock gets called away at the October 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 11.88% boost of extra return to the investor, or 18.07% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 40%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 43%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $48.41) to be 34%.

Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 85.6% from 83% in the year-ago quarter.As a result, the company's profitability was impacted. Autodesk's adjusted loss from operations was $Array0.2 million in the quarter, in contrast to prior-year quarter's income of $35.9 million.

The company projects subscription additions for fiscal 20Array7 to be between 475,000 - 525,000.We believe Autodesk's business transition (from licenses to cloud-based services) is boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues, which are expected to benefit it in the long run. Also, the company remains focused on undertaking more cost-cutting initiatives as a part of its business transition.It's noteworthy that though the transition is still underway, the company has started seeing strong growth in new subscription additions, which represented more than half of the total new subscription additions in the quarter.However, in the near term, the company's profitability will likely be affected by investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives.In addition, foreign exchange fluctuations and competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  , Microsoft Corp.  and Adobe Systems Incorporated  pose concerns.Presently, Autodesk carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of Array00.00%. The company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of Array0.58% in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Autodesk's business transition (from licenses to cloud-based services) is boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues, which are expected to benefit it in the long run. Also, the company remains focused on undertaking more cost-cutting initiatives as a part of its business transition. In line with this, the company has now started to eliminate third-parties from its eStore chain, which is likely to add to the company's savings going ahead while also improving customer experience.It's noteworthy that though the transition is still underway, the company has started seeing strong growth in new subscription additions. Earlier this month, the company also declared that it will reduce its workforce by about Array0% and streamline its operations to drive long-term growth. Autodesk also declared that it expects revenues, earnings and subscriber growth to be toward the higher end of its projected outlook.However, in the near term, the company's profitability can be affected by investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. Further, the discontinuation of perpetual license offerings in 20Array6 may have some impact on the company's financials in the short run.In addition, foreign exchange fluctuations and competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  , Microsoft Corp.  and Google pose concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Autodesk is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #Array, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Autodesk's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 7 cents. Autodesk has a Zacks Rank #Array (Strong Buy), which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is a company, which you may consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Apache Corp.  with an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In this regard, SAP SuccessFactors Performance & Goals stand in good stead, as its continuous performance management capability is especially engineered keeping in mind the current gap in market. This new breed of tools from SAP family is expected to gain momentous traction by catering to majority of the needs of contemporary digital workforce.The company believes that addition of continuous performance management will significantly aid employees and managers by facilitating \"one-on-one check-ins\" among them, which in turn, will help better realization of organizational goals. By deploying SuccessFactors Performance & Goals, a company's human resource pool will be able to align their work structure more effectively as well as take advantage of feedback and coaching sessions, leading to overall improvement in productivity.The most striking features of SAP SuccessFactors Performance & Goals include empowerment of employees by providing them with more ownership; comprehensive reporting to managers, allowing them to guide subordinates transparently; and enabling HRs to provide guidance on coaching techniques. In a nutshell, this will accelerate organizational productivity by targeting critical areas like employee motivation, employee engagement and job satisfaction.

Recently, an Oracle Corporation  lawyer told the court in a federal hearing (Jan 14) that Alphabet's  Google has reportedly garnered $31 billion in revenues from its Android platform since its release.Oracle had filed a lawsuit against Google seeking royalties for the use of its Java programming language for developing Android.Apart from the revenues, Oracle also disclosed that Google has raked in profits of $22 billion from Android. However, Oracle did not state the methodology by which it came up with the figures.While the accuracy of these numbers is not yet confirmed, it has drawn attention to the much debated comparison between the two operating systems. It is widely speculated that iOS makes much more  than Android, despite smaller market share. However, as the two companies operate on a different business model, it would not be wise to compare the profits. While Apple sells both hardware and software for iOS, Google's Android is used by other device makers (free of cost) who retain their profit. Google just benefits from being the default search engine and also a provider of a number of important apps on Android.As regards to the disclosure by Oracle, Google it seems has urged the federal court to keep certain parts of the transcript away from the public domain saying \"Google does not publicly allocate revenues or profits to Android separate and apart from Google's general business.

It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet, ADSK's low RSI value isn't the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Autodesk's earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 2 earnings estimate revisions move higher, compared with just none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame.

The striking similarity of the fitness band with its more feature-packed smartwatch competitors, disappointed investors resulting in more than 18% plunge in share price.This PurePulse technology has been used in Fitbit's fitness wearables like Surge, Charge HR and Blaze. Last November, the company upgraded Surge and Charge HR, thereby making exercise tracking smarter and easier.

The court documents describe a case where the user's personal trainer recorded the heart rate at 160 BPM, while the device read only 82 BPM.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $47.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 9.3% return against the $47.50 commitment, or a 4.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADSK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $47.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Autodesk Inc. sees its shares fall 22.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $43.10 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.40 from $47.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., and highlighting in green where the $47.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $47.50 strike for the 4.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Autodesk Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $61.30) to be 28%.

For this specialized back-end service, CACI provides technical support to a wide range of geospatial intelligence products that are used in the Army.CACI has a large pipeline of new projects and continues to win more deals at regular intervals. These back-to-back contract wins are key catalysts driving success perennially for the company. Moving forward, CACI intends to drive operational excellence by intensively focusing on its organic and inorganic growth strategy and strengthening its existing customer relationships while building newer ones.A leader in IT outsourcing for the U.S. federal government, CACI earns its revenues through four customer groups: Department of Defense (DoD), Federal Civilian Agencies, Commercial and Other, and State and Local Governments. DoD customers include the U.S. Army (CACI's largest customer) and the U.S. Navy. Federal civilian agencies furnish litigation support services to the Department of Justice (DoJ).Having the government as one of the biggest clients lends stability to the business and moderates fluctuations in revenue. Although the government generally has a lengthy approval process, the project earns money for a number of years after it is approved. Moreover, government contracts improve the visibility of future revenue streams.In addition, CACI has ample exposure to the rapidly growing DoD and Department of Homeland Security budgets. CACI's system integration skills and intelligence expertise consume a significant portion of the funds earmarked for the Department of Homeland Security, while creating systems that foster the sharing of critical information among all intelligence agencies.

During the third quarter of 2015, SAP's next-generation suite was also chosen by Bosch Group in Germany for simplifying the latter's business model as well as enhancing customer satisfaction.Market research company Gartner forecasted that global spending on enterprise application software will likely grow 7.5% to $149.9 billion in 2015, as increasing number of companies continue to upgrade core functionality. Moreover, as per the report, marketing, e-commerce and advanced analytics software recorded highest growth during 2015, with total spending on enterprise application software expected to reach $201 billion by 2019. Also, according to the latest reports of Research and Markets, the global ECM (?) software market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.66% during 2014-2019.Going forward, we believe SAP S/4HANA's popularity will surge as SAP Cloud, powered by HANA, offers 'real-time digital data' devised for modernizing client operations. This, coupled with positive industry trends like higher spending on advanced statistical software, is expected to bolster the company's growth.SAP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The campus in phase one will cover an area of about 560K square feet and will consist of state-of-the-art amenities.This initiative is expected to lead to employee expansion of over 50% in Austin by the company. Oracle in its bid to promote improved work-life balance for its employees has also unveiled its plans to provide housing facilities. For this, it will be buying out a 295-unit apartment close to the campus. As management stated, \"We already have a high-performing employee base in the region, and the surrounding technology community is teeming with creative and innovative thinkers. Our state-of-the-art campus will be designed to inspire, support and attract top talent -- with a special focus on the needs of millennials.\"Additionally, as per media reports, the company has also acquired an Austin-based startup called StackEngine Inc. for developing its Oracle Public Cloud domain.Oracle is gaining ground in its cloud business as is evident from its second quarter performance, wherein total cloud revenues grew 26%. In fact, the company's cloud revenues surpassed that of market leader salesforce.com  .To benefit from the booming cloud industry, Oracle has introduced a number of Cloud Platform services in the last few quarters that will not only help personalize SaaS applications, which are currently in demand but also support easy migration of on-premise applications to Oracle Cloud.The Austin based cloud campus will further boost the company's position in the market.

The new company was expected to be owned jointly by EMC and VMWare with each having a 50% stake.However, this news added to investors' concerns as Virtustream was still not profitable. A 50% stake would have required VMware to invest a huge amount for the development of hybrid-cloud solutions of Virtustream, which would weigh on VMware's financials.All these concerns had together resulted in dwindling investor confidence in VMware, as can be seen from the fall in share prices. In the last three-month period, the company lost nearly 30% of its market cap in contrast to the S&P 500 index's gain of over 2%.This loss led management to take some measures to regain investors' confidence as declining valuation of VMware would mean lower per share sale price for EMC investors at the time of the deal.In fact, the speculations (of VMware retreating from forming a new Virtustream) started earlier this month when a Reuters report had stated that the company is re-evaluating the proposed ownership structure of Virtustream.Virtustream was an important factor in VMware's valuation as the company had expected an operating loss of $200 million to $300 million in 2016 if it had formed Virtustream. However, Virtustream was expected to contribute significantly to VMware's revenues in 2016 with projected growth in the double-digits.According to the deal, EMC's stake in VMware (about 81% of the company) will be owned by Dell post the closure of the acquisition. VMware however, per the release, will continue to remain a publicly-traded company even after the acquisition.An important thing to note here is that Dell will not be offering regular trading stocks for VMware. Instead, the company will be issuing a tracking stock that would reflect the performance of the trading stock. This will entitle EMC shareholders to have only economic interest in the trading stock but not own them (that is no voting rights or dividends). Most importantly, according to the deal, Dell will create tracking stock from 53% of the value of total VMware shares. Dell of course retains 80% of VMware shares and other shareholders the remaining 20%, which will be trading as usual. Dell will be paying EMC shareholders $24.05 per share in cash and approximately 0.111 shares of VMware tracking stock.Through the EMC acquisition, Dell would be able to get a significant control of VMware at a much discounted price. As a result, investors have become jittery regarding the valuation of the company.However, as per a Dec 11 update, Dell is considering buying back about $3 billion worth of VMware tracking stock.Despite backing out from the joint venture, the company's shares fell over 3% in Friday's trading session. Though VMware margins will now be less affected, revenues will likely come down for the company in 2016.We note that VMware had already given a soft outlook for revenue growth in 2016 owing to the weakness in bookings.It seems that such initiatives are not enough to regain investors' confidence amid the acquisition related uncertainty. We believe that management needs to explicitly lay out a growth strategy for VMware's core business, especially as headwinds from sluggish IT spending and stiff competition remain.Currently, VMware has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The new collaboration would also aid SAP in expanding its footprint in the Latin American market, with Buenos Aires taking the lead.The strategic tie-up involves seamless integration of the real-time situational awareness capabilities of SAP HANA, SAP's proprietary cloud platform, with Philips' CityTouch street lighting management system to create a comprehensive information network.The collaboration entails real-time integration of information from Philips' connected streetlights with data from other sensors. This data, related to street lighting, parking and traffic controls, will be broadly assimilated on a singular dashboard and critically examined by town planners for improved operational results.Philips is currently working on a project in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to power 91,000 streetlights with its CityTouch-managed LEDs for helping the city realize greater energy savings and better safety measures. The SAP HANA platform has been deployed in this project to help Buenos Aires better manage about 700,000 assets like streetlights, parks, bus stops, buildings and bridges. This will help city planners minimize damage by monitoring storm & heavy rainfall as well as reduce energy consumption by adjusting lighting intensity.SAP believes that as more & more cities increasingly embrace digital transformation, there is tremendous potential for real-time and predictive analytics applications, as they serve to improve services related to lighting, sustainability and efficiency. According to Philips, less that 1% of streetlights in only about 30 countries are connected with CityTouch, which represents lucrative opportunities for SAP, going forward.Meanwhile, the SAP's analytics platform enjoy huge popularity with about 4,000 regional, local and city organizations benefiting from it. According to reports from Gartner, 1.6 billion 'things' (including electric devices, buildings & establishments, smart homes and others) will be connected to create smart city infrastructure by the end of 2016, representing a 39% year-over-year rise. With increasing number of companies from a gamut of industries coming together to create an interconnected urban environment, we believe SAP's business prospects shine bright for the long term.SAP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, the company stated that it will likely lead to growth of 24% in annualized recurring revenues during the period.The company is primarily banking on cloud transition to fuel this growth, which is further supplemented by increasing demand for licenses, a large active customer base of 2.8 million (including non-subscribers as well) and scope for conversion of non-subscribers to subscribers. For this, the company will also be offering its subscription services packages for a smaller timeframe (at present it only offers perpetual licenses, which are expensive for short-term users).Moreover, in the last reported quarter, Autodesk finally achieved breakeven earnings and also raised its earnings guidance for fourth quarter 2015, despite an expected softness in billings.

The company returned 14.9% in the past one year and roughly 18.9% year-to-date. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months was approximately 34,641K.Microsoft is one of the largest software companies in the world. Its operating systems are installed on a majority of computers across the world. It is also a leader in the emerging cloud computing market. Microsoft's cloud offerings include Windows Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM.The bullish stance of equity research analysts at Raymond James and FBR on the stock is driving Microsoft.Raymond James' analyst Michael Turits upgraded the rating on Microsoft from \"Market Perform\" to \"Strong Buy\", and gave a price target of $62.00. He is optimistic about the company's successful transition from PC software to cloud computing. Turits sees the company as \"the only 'hyperscale' hybrid cloud vendors able to integrate Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with a vast installed base of on-premise server and client software\".FBR analyst Daniel Ives also rated Microsoft as \"Outperform\" on strong cloud prospects. He believes that though Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leader in the cloud space, Microsoft's Windows Azure has the potential to capitalize on the increasing demand for cloud-computing services in the enterprise sector.The price appreciation may be attributed to Microsoft's strong fundamentals, solid growth of its cloud service, strong Windows adoption and better-than-expected first-quarter 2016 results reported on Oct 22. Since then, the stock has gained 15.7%.In the quarter, Microsoft reported a profit of 67 cents, breezing past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. In response, shares jumped almost 8% in extended trading. However, revenues were down 8.1% sequentially and 12.2% year over year.Also, Microsoft's Surface is doing very well despite the temporary softness that is typical before a product release and difficult comps from the previous-generation product released last year.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2016 earnings moved up 2.83%. Additionally, the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 14.45% over the trailing four quarters backed by the robust business portfolio.Microsoft currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some stocks in the technology space worth considering are Aspen Technology, Inc.  , Autodesk, Inc.  and Cadence Design Systems Inc.  .

According to a Bloomberg report, VMware is planning to buy back a huge number of shares (possibly in multimillion dollars).VMware has been going downhill since the news of the EMC-Dell merger came out. In the last three-month period, the company lost over 25% of its market cap in contrast to the S&P 500 index's gain of over 6%.Investors have become jittery regarding the valuation of the company. Following the spin-off of EMC's stake in VMware (about 81% of the company), it will be owned by Dell. Additionally, according to the deal, Dell will create a tracking stock from 53% of the value of total VMware shares. Dell will retain 80% of VMware shares and other shareholders the remaining 20%, which will be trading as usual. Through the EMC acquisition, Dell would be able to get significant control over VMware at a much discounted price.The decline in share prices is a significant concern for management as this is lowering per share sale price for EMC investors from the earlier expected $33.15 to $30.61 (considering closing price of Dec 4).Therefore, the aforementioned buyback plan is likely an attempt to regain investor confidence. In addition, the company is also reconsidering the ownership structure for Virtustream, a leading hybrid-cloud product company that was acquired by EMC earlier this year for $1.2 billion.Earlier, EMC had announced its plans to spin out Virtustream following the acquisition. The new company was expected to be owned jointly by EMC and VMWare with each having a 50% stake. However, a Reuters report last week stated that the company is now re-evaluating this ownership structure and might even consider consolidating Virtustream's results within EMC, thereby foregoing the 50-50 partnership plan.We believe that VMware shares would likely benefit from the buyback and its dissociation from the loss-making Virtustream business.The EMC-Dell deal is deemed to be the largest technology acquisition ever with a value of nearly $67 billion.Currently, VMware has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same space are Autodesk, Inc.  and Cadence Design Systems Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In the last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 50.00%. The company has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 12.15% in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Autodesk's business transition (from licenses to cloud-based services) is boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues, which are expected to benefit it in the long run. Moreover, increasing demand for the company's cloud-based products like Fusion 360 and PLM 360 are likely to drive the company's business.Autodesk's aggressive acquisition strategy has played a pivotal part in developing its business over the last couple of years. In the past quarter, the company had announced its plans to acquire San Francisco-based company-SeeControl and Germany-based company netfabb. These two acquisitions are likely to be accretive to the bottom-line going ahead. However, financials can be affected in the near-term owing to the costs of acquisition.Also, the company's profitability will likely be hampered by investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. Further, the discontinuation of perpetual license offerings this year may have some impact on the company's financials. In addition, foreign exchange fluctuations and competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  , Microsoft Corp.  and Google pose concerns.The company expects revenues in the range of $580 million - $600 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of 5 cents-10 cents for the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Autodesk is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Autodesk's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 13 cents. Autodesk has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is a company, which you may consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Casey's General Stores, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +23.78% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

However, it compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter earnings of 12 cents.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of 14 cents in the quarter, down from 25 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Following the earnings release, the company's shares gained nearly 1.9% in yesterday's trading session to close at $62.39.Revenues in the quarter decreased 2.9% year over year to $600 million but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $592 million. Revenues were impacted by a 12.4% year-over-year decline in License revenues to $280.9 million. Subscription revenues however increased 7.2% from the year-ago quarter to about $319 million.Total billings decreased 9% on a year-over-year basis, impacted by the ongoing business transition. Total subscriptions increased approximately 80,000 from the prior quarter to 2.47 million in the quarterSegment wise, revenues from the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segment jumped 4% from the year-ago quarter to $225 million.Manufacturing revenues increased 3% on a year-over-year basis to $175 million.Revenues from Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) declined about 15% from the year-ago quarter to $161 million.Sales in Autodesk's Media and Entertainment (M&E) segment decreased 9% on a year-over-year basis to $39 million in the reported quarter.Revenues from Flagship products were $267 million, a decline of 7% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues from Suites decreased 3% on a year-over-year basis to $218 million. Revenues from New and Adjacent products rose 9% from the year earlier quarter to $114 million.Geographically, revenues in the Americas rose 2% year over year to $236 million. EMEA revenues declined 5% to $225 million, while the same in APAC decreased 7% from the year-ago quarter to $139 million. Revenues from emerging economies decreased 8% from the year-ago quarter to $88 million, representing about 15% of total revenue.Gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 84.8% in the reported quarter. Operating expenses were up 1.2% on a year-over-year basis to $524 million during the quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 87.3% from 83.7% in the year-ago quarter.As a result, the company's profitability was impacted. Autodesk's loss from operations was $14.8 million in the quarter, in contrast to the prior-year quarter's income of $14.6 million. Autodesk has been negatively impacted by the ongoing business model transition and investment in cloud infrastructure.Autodesk exited the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $2.3 billion compared with $2 billion as on Jan 31, 2015. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $80 million compared with $136 million in the prior-year quarter.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $620 million - $640 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 8-12 cents for the quarter. The figure does not include stock-based compensation expense of 25 cents per share, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of 10 cents per share and tax-related charges of 4 cents.For fiscal 2016, management expects net billings to grow in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%, down from earlier guidance of 2%-4%. However, on a constant currency basis, billings growth is expected to be 7% - 8%. The company expects a $10 million impact on billings in relation to the exit from the Creative Finishing hardware business.Revenues in fiscal 2016 are expected to increase 3% to 4% (earlier projection was 3%-5%) on a constant currency basis. Operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is expected to be about 10%.Non-GAAP EPS (excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles) is expected in the range of 72 cents - 76 cents, up from the earlier guidance of 60 cents - 72 cents. The company projects subscription additions for fiscal 2016 to be between 310,000 - 330,000.We believe Autodesk's business transition (from licenses to cloud-based services) is boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues, which are expected to benefit it in the long run. Also, the company remains focused on undertaking more cost-cutting initiatives as a part of its business transition. In line with this, the company has now started to eliminate third-parties from its eStore chain, which is likely to add to the company's savings going ahead while also improving customer experience.It's noteworthy that though the transition is still underway, the company has started seeing strong growth in new subscription additions.However, in the near term, the company's profitability will tend to be affected by investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. Further, the discontinuation of perpetual license offerings in 2016 may have some impact on the company's financials in the short run.In addition, foreign exchange fluctuations and competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  , Microsoft Corp.  and Adobe Systems Incorporated  pose concerns.Presently, Autodesk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The below-par performance for the companies that have reported so far was primarily attributable to the excess capacity due to rapid expansion of the industry on one hand and weaker macroeconomic conditions on the other, resulting in an overall slowdown in capital equipment spending. This created a huge imbalance in the demand and supply chain, and adversely affected both the top- and bottom-line of almost all the industry participants.A major chunk of the companies in the 3D Printing industry have already reported their third-quarter results, including some of the bigwigs. Let us have a brief recap of their earnings. : This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock reported an adjusted loss of 4 cents per share for third-quarter 2015 that miserably missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 1 cent. A continued challenging operating environment as well as lower revenue from 3D printing products and services added to the woes. Revenues declined 9% year over year to $151.6 million and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $179 million.In order to tide over the situation, 3D Systems has decided to reduce its cost structure through stringent cost-cutting initiatives, refocus its resources around near-term opportunities and improve quality across the organization. : This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock reported a net loss of 23 cents for the quarter, which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 18 cents. The disappointing year-over-year performance despite higher revenues was primarily driven by significantly higher operating expenses. Although revenues increased 34.3% year over year to $15.1 million, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16 million. Moving forward, the company aims to capitalize on the launch of several new 3D metrology products for a healthy earnings growth. : Camtek reported adjusted earnings of 3 cents per share that was flat year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Although this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock faltered in earnings, revenues of $26.3 million were up 17% year over year and were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The healthy top-line performance was largely due to solid sales in the semiconductor market. The company expects a steady revenue stream with higher penetration levels in new markets. : Stratasys appears to be the lone bright spot in the earnings chart with net loss of 5 cents for the quarter, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents. However, this Zacks Rank #3 stock slipped on top-line performance with revenues of $167.6 million, down from $203.6 million in the year-ago quarter and missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $176 million as orders did not materialize as expected. The company expects the near-term visibility to continue to remain low, adversely affecting its revenue growth in the future quarters as well.Stratasys intends to make adjustments to its costs and operating structure, while remaining committed to working on significant advancements for existing platforms, as well as the development of new capabilities and business models to beat the odds in the long term.A handful of companies in the sector are yet to report their quarterly results and the beleaguered industry expect to get some reprieve from the battered earnings chart. Below we provide you with a brief synopsis of the upcoming earnings releases. : This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock is scheduled to report its third quarter results after the closing bell on Nov 5. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 7 cents, which represents a year-over-year improvement of 77.0%, on revenues of $18 million. However, ExOne has a dreaded history of drastically missing both the estimates over the past several quarters. Whether an increased credit facility for providing lease financing to customers will increase its global installed base and lend stability to earnings remains to be seen. : With third-quarter 2015 results due on Nov 12, this Zacks #3 stock expects Services revenue growth to outpace Systems revenue growth in the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues and earnings are currently pegged at $6 million and a loss of 14 cents, respectively. Historically, Voxeljet had a mixed bag of earnings and revenue surprises over the past few quarters. The company expects higher global Systems sales and continued Services revenue growth at its facility in Friedberg, Germany. Let's see if the company can surpass the corresponding estimates when it reports a few days later. : This Zacks Rank #4 stock is scheduled to report its third quarter results after the closing bell on Nov 19. The company is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing through its comprehensive product portfolio. For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $580 million - $600 million, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $592 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the impending earnings remains at a loss of 13 cents.Although the year-to-date performance of almost all 3D Printing stocks vis-\u00e0-vis average price return is relatively abysmal in comparison to the benchmark S&P 500 index, there appears to be a glimmer of hope as several experts believe that these stocks have found a bottom.According to Wohlers Report 2014, the worldwide 3D printing industry is expected to grow from $3.07 billion in revenue in 2013 to $12.8 billion by 2018, and exceed $21 billion in worldwide revenue by 2020 with a CAGR of 34%. Chat Reynders, chairman & CEO of Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, observed: \"While we may or may not be on the absolute bottom for the stock, there is promise ahead for long-term investors that can weather through the current volatility.\"Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

No matter how much theory you soak up, it's worthless if you can't apply it in the murky waters of the markets.Investing is already such a complex subject. The successful investors focus only on the essentials and simplify.In sports, you hear a common phrase.\"Slow the game down.\"It means to control the game instead of letting it control you.It's too easy to get swept up with the tempo of the market. Before you realize it, you're sitting on losses exceeding thousands of dollars.All successful investors have systems in place. All of them also have investing principles to make things easier.Guy Spier is an investor I follow. He is the fund manager for Aquamarine Fund and author of The Education of a Value Investor which I highly recommend (here's my book review).But I'll let the numbers talk.Aquamarine Fund Performance. 1997 to 2014 and 2000 to 2014.The above chart is from Guy Spier's 2014 letter I received in the mail.But what I particularly liked about the letter is that, instead of simply discussing stocks and performance, he lays out his investing principles which everyone should read.So here are Guy Spier's 10 investing principles.The topic of compound interest is ignored or forgotten in the world of investing.What I like about Spier's approach is that he places great emphasis on simplifying and filtering out noise.I highlighted previously the problems with professional money management and five reasons why you have an advantage.While the investment industry works off daily, quarterly and yearly returns, Spier focuses on increasing net worth by getting the miracle of compounding interest to work in your favor.Gains Required to Offset LossesMy expensive mistakes all came from trying to make as much money as possible with every investment.I was the home run hero.Except I wasn't hitting any home runs.If I hadn't sold  (  ) for a 30% loss, I'd be sitting on a -80% disaster at the moment.But swallowing my pride, admitting my mistakes and utilizing the remaining cash into better investments has more than made up for the mistake.Not losing money helps you invest for another day.This principle refers to personal finance leverage and not companies. Avoiding leveraged stocks is also a good idea, but that's another story.Taking risks with money you don't own is the most effective way of violating Buffett's rules 1 and 2.Again, Spier uses a Buffett quote about the implosion of Long-Term Capital Management:Spier believes that his incentives should be properly aligned with that of his shareholders. That's the reason why the majority of his own money is invested in the same fund as shareholders.It's true for companies too.If the CEO isn't eating his own cooking, the worst that will happen is that he loses his job and then finds another one with an even fatter paycheck.Their objective is to maximize short term performance and then letting the next CEO handle the problems it will cause.Playing as close to the foul line as possible can bring great results and make you look like a genius.But what happens if things change or things don't go your way?John Paulson (Trades, Portfolio) made billions by betting correctly on subprime. He couldn't simply go back to \"normal\" or \"simple\" investments after that.Here's what happened in the following years.As cliche as it may sound, the fundamental of making money in the stock market is to buy a mispriced company.Spier uses the example of the pari-mutuel horse betting system that Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio) often talks about.Everybody knows which horse is the fastest and most likely to win. But to make money with horses or in the stock market, it's important to go beyond just knowing what is the best company. You need to find the mispriced company.Howard Marks (Trades, Portfolio) has always written about the same thing when he explains how risk comes from the price you pay.The quality of a stock doesn't reduce risk. Buying a stock when it's mispriced reduces risk.Jack and Jill could both own  (  ).Jack bought it at $130.But Jill bought it at $80.Guess who will come out better?When I simplify it like this, it's easy. But in reality, how many people have the guts to buy at $80 when a stock drops from $130?Spier refers to the money management side with principle #7, but it's easily adaptable to investing.As shareholders and tiny owners of a business, it's important to know what type of manager is running your company.One of the big wins for me this year wasn't from a company I invested in but one I made a quick decision to ignore. The CEO is simply a person I did not want to be partners with.This is what a bad partner in a company can do.Check out these two books.Before picking a stock, you should have a checklist to run it through.It could be as simple asThese three points already speak volumes about a stock, and this is what Spier realized as an investor.He has a much more extensive checklist, of course, and it's prevented him from making a number of bad investments.The purpose of a checklist is to prevent blowups first and then profit second.Download a set of value investing checklists and make it easier on yourself. Click the image below to get it via email.The mythical hydra generates two heads if its head is cut off.So what is the investment equivalent?In Spier's words, it's to profit from all scenarios the world throws at you.Recessions, bubbles, booms, busts, oil crashes, new presidents and the works.Don't limit yourself to just one industry, country or strategy. Understand and have the flexibility to implement it all at the appropriate times.This one is better left in Spier's own words.LinksAbout GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $41.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $46.66/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.56% return on the cash commitment, or 13.70% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $47.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADSK stock at the current price level of $46.66/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $47.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.34% if the stock gets called away at the April 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Autodesk Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $47.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $47.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.54% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.27% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 33%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $46.66) to be 26%.

At this stage, imagining everyone owning a 3D printer sounds a lot like imagining riding around on segways.Here\u2019s the thing, though: Even a technology like segways ended up finding its market \u2014 even if it fell dramatically short of the original hype. And while the two innovations may seem miles apart, segways and 3D printing have that in common.3D printing stocks like Autodesk (), 3D Systems () and Stratasys () have been downright slaughtered so far this year \u2026 in part because there was so much hype around their market debuts. The idea of the next big consumer technology gets investors giddy and when it doesn\u2019t pan out, there\u2019s panic.But 3D printing is simply in the middle of a transition to an enterprise focus. Which is why recent declines are growing pains \u2014 not death knells.Because ADSK, DDD and SSYS have already suffered such dramatic damage and are also heavily shorted, there\u2019s plenty of chatter about a continued demise. Just about any 3D printing headline can be construed as a nail in the coffin, including the recent announcement that smaller rival Carbon3D \u2014 which focuses heavily on the manufacturing sector \u2014 secured $100 million from Google (, ).But increased competition in this case is promising, as it\u2019s further evidence of the shifting application and real market for 3D printing products that have a manufacturing focus.This was evident when I recently spoke with Dylan Reid, the CEO of 3D printing startup Matter \u2014 a company that\u2019s based in Brookyln and focuses on small-scale manufacturing specifically. Reid noted the gap between innovation and application that has hounded big names in the 3D printing space. The founding team of Matter was working in the 3D printing space at MIT just a few years ago and Reid recalled that people would talk about all the innovation happening in 3D printing and then pull a 3D-printed Yoda head out of their pocket as proof.\u201cThat technology is useless without an application,\u201d he added.The large gap between innovation and application helped Matter hone in on its focus. Like the 3D printing giants, it began by focusing on consumers via custom jewelry but eventually transitioned to small-scale, web-based manufacturing.Matter\u2019s story is a microcosm for the broader market, including the companies that you and I can actually invest in. While there will likely be more bumps to come as the technology expands, matures and finds its market \u2014 especially considering there\u2019s both an application and business model transition taking place, as the CEO of Autodesk noted in its most recent  \u2014 the long-term prospects are solid, despite the bloodbath.If you\u2019re willing to wait out the rockiness, 3D printing stocks could be a great bet when it comes to cashing in on a truly transformative technology.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["op Tech StocksMSFT -0.41%AAPL -0.18%IBM -0.75%CSCO -0.94%GOOG -1.68%Technology stocks were trying to resist late afternoon profit-taking, with shares of technology companies in the S&P 500 dropping about 0.3% in recent trade.In company news, Autodesk (  ) shares fell to their lowest price since November 2013 after the design software company late Thursday reported Q2 revenue trailing analyst opinion and offering a below-consensus outlook for the current quarter.Revenue of $609 million during the three months ended July 31 trailed Capital IQ consensus expecting $612.6 million.

Adjusted earnings of 1 cent a share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 19 cents in the quarter, down from 35 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Following the earnings release, the company shares declined nearly 5% in Friday's trading session to close at $47.52.Revenues for the quarter decreased 4% year over year to $610 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $612 million. Revenues were impacted by a 17.1% year-over-year decline in License revenues to $290.5 million. Subscription revenues, however, surged 11.3% from the year-ago quarter to $319 million.Total billings grew 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher subscription billings. Total subscriptions increased approximately 61,000 from the prior quarter.Segment wise, revenues from Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) declined about 21% from the year-ago quarter to $164 million.Revenues from the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segment jumped 7% from the year-ago quarter to $233 million.Manufacturing revenues increased 2% on a year-over-year basis to $171 million. Sales in Autodesk's Media and Entertainment (M&E) segment decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis to $41 million in the reported quarter.Revenues from Flagship products were $272 million, a decline of 11% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues from Suites decreased 3% on a year-over-year basis to $226 million. Revenues from New and Adjacent products rose 13% from the year earlier quarter to $112 million.Geographically, revenues in the Americas rose 6% year over year to $236 million. EMEA revenues declined 7% to $226 million, while the same in APAC decreased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $148 million. Revenues in emerging economies decreased 7% from the year-ago quarter to $92 million, representing about 15% of total revenue.Gross margin contracted 150 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 84.7% in the reported quarter. Operating expenses were up 2.6% on a year-over-year basis to $512.2 million during the quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 84% from 78.4% in the year-ago quarter.As a result, income from operations plunged over 91% year over year to $4.3 million in the quarter. Autodesk's profitability was negatively impacted by the ongoing business model transition and investment in cloud infrastructure.Autodesk exited the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $2.39 billion compared with $2.02 billion as on Jan 31, 2015. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $77 million compared with $96 million in the prior-year quarter.Along with the earnings release, Autodesk announced its plans to acquire San Francisco-based company-SeeControl. SeeControl specializes in developing enterprise Internet of Things (IoT) cloud service platform. This acquisition that is scheduled to be closed in the third-quarter is expected to enhance Autodesk's cloud offerings in the booming IoT domain.For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $580 million - $600 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 5-10 cents for the third quarter. The figure does not include stock-based compensation expense of 21 cents per share and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of 7cents per share.For fiscal 2016, management expects net billings to grow in the range of 2%-4%. Revenues are expected to increase 3% to 5% (earlier projection was 2%-4%). While operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is expected to be in the range of 9% to 10% versus 12% to 14% projected earlier.Non-GAAP EPS (excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles) is expected in the range of 60 cents - 72 cents, down from the earlier guidance of 95 cents- $1.10. The company projects subscription additions for fiscal 2016 to be between 375,000 - 425,000.We believe Autodesk's business transition (from licenses to cloud-based services) is boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues, which are expected to benefit it in the long run. Moreover, increasing demand for the company's cloud  based products like Fusion 360 and PLM 360 are likely to drive the company's business, going forward.Recently, the company announced that its open 3D printing platform, Spark has been embedded into Windows 10 allowing users to get access to 3D printing.However, in the near term, the company's profitability will tend to be affected because of investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. Further, the discontinuation of perpetual license offerings this year may have some impact on the company's financials. In addition, foreign exchange fluctuations and competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  , Microsoft Corp.  and Google Inc.  pose concerns.Presently, Autodesk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In the last quarter, the company delivered in line earnings. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 10.65%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Autodesk reported decent first-quarter fiscal 2016 results. While revenues improved significantly, earnings were in line with expectations. The company is likely to benefit from the increasing adaptability of cloud-based services.Also, the company's business transition (from licenses to cloud-based services) is boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues, which are expected to benefit it in the long run.Moreover, increasing demand for the company's cloud-based products like Fusion 360 and PLM 360 are likely to drive the company's business, going forward.Recently, the company announced that its open 3D printing platform, Spark has been embedded into Windows 10 allowing users to get access to 3D printing.However, in the near term, the company's profitability will likely be affected by investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. Further, the discontinuation of perpetual license offerings this year may have some impact on the company's financials. In addition, foreign exchange fluctuations and competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  , Microsoft Corp.  and Google pose concerns.For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $600 million - $620 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 14-19 cents for the to-be reported quarter. The figure does not include stock-based compensation expense of 16 cents per share and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of 8 cents per share.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Autodesk is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Autodesk currently has a negative Earnings ESP as the Most Accurate estimate of 1 cent is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. This equates to a difference of -50.0%. Autodesk's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is a company, which you may consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Campbell Soup Company  with an Earnings ESP of +4.76% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

For the second time this year, the company sliced its earnings estimates. Let's look at why it did that and at its overall performance for the quarter.In the second quarter, Autodesk took in nearly $610 million in revenue, 4% lower than the $637 million of Q2 2015. Hammered by a big provision for income tax, the company swung violently to a loss of $236 million ($1.04 per diluted share) on the bottom line, from a $31 million ($0.13) profit in the same quarter last year.Stripping out such one-time items, net profit on an adjusted basis was $44 million ($0.19) this past quarter, 46% below that of the $82 million ($0.35) in the second quarter of 2015.This past quarter, neither the top nor bottom line was very far off average analyst estimates of $612 million and $0.17 per share, respectively.Total billings, meanwhile, advanced by 7%, while deferred revenue rose 26% to $1.2 billion. The former is the amount the company bills its clients, and the latter is the amount of contract revenue that has not yet been recognized.On a discouraging note, Autodesk once again reduced its estimates for full-year fiscal 2016. The company now believes it will post revenue for the period of $2.47 billion to $2.51 billion, and EPS of $0.60 to $0.72. It had previously forecast $2.56 billion to $2.61 billion and $0.95 to $1.10.Autodesk attributed the lower revenue figure (and the reduced top-line guidance) to a general shift toward subscription services and away from the sale of perpetual licenses. At the end of this past second quarter, the company had 2.39 million subscriptions. It expects to add 375,000 to 425,000 in total this fiscal year.Concurrent to the earnings release, Autodesk also announced an acquisition. The company said it has signed an agreement to buy SeeControl, a San Francisco-based developer of an Internet of Things cloud service platform.Autodesk said that the move \"is the first step on Autodesk's ongoing efforts to develop new technologies and solutions that will help our customers leverage the Internet of Things, starting by enabling them to capture, analyze, and utilize data from their products.\" The details of the transaction were not made public; Autodesk said it expects the deal to have no impact on the guidance it proffered in the second-quarter results.No investor likes to see their company trim guidance twice in less than a year, so it's no surprise the stock traded down in the wake of the results. Transitional phase aside, that steep fall in adjusted net is cause for concern and something to keep an eye on going forward.With the SeeControl buy, it seems the company is getting into a segment that has good potential. But it's too early to tell, and the success of the shift in core business model is far from assured, so perhaps it's better to lay off the stock for now.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Also, the company's business transition (from licenses to cloud-based services) is boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues, which are expected to benefit it in the long run.Autodesk has a comprehensive product portfolio that positions it well to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing. Additionally, the company has been taking initiatives to boost the development of 3D design software. In Jun 2015, the company made the Autodesk Design Academy iTunes U course available for students and educators. This step reflects the company's efforts to enable the youth to acquire skills for the development of 3D technology. Also, it launched its learning platform - Project Ignite, which aims to help in the growth and development of young learners, free of cost. The platform will allow the youth to have access to the novel technology developments, which include 3D printing and electronics, in order to give them a practical exposure of the industry.However, in the near term, the company's profitability might be affected because of investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. Furthermore, in the reported quarter, the company witnessed soft growth in billings that remains a concern.Further, the discontinuation of perpetual license offerings this year may have some impact on Autodesk's financials. Although the company's ongoing business transition is a positive over the long term, it is expected to weigh on the financials, especially margins, over the next couple of years.Autodesk also faces high risks from product and customer concentration. The company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a handful of products like AUTOCAD and AUTOCAD LT (together accounted for 28% of revenues in fiscal 2015). A decline in demand for any of these products will affect the company's growth. Similarly, Autodesk depends on only a few distributors like Tech Data  for the major portion of its revenues. This, also, is a cause for concern.Autodesk currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Tuesday, shares of Autodesk Inc. (Symbol: ADSK) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.6, after changing hands as low as $48.11 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 18.2. A bullish investor could look at ADSK's 28.6 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for ADSK broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 6.9% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for ADSK stock.If that wasn't enough, Autodesk isn't looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 3 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for ADSK.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

While revenues improved significantly, earnings failed to meet expectations owing to the ongoing business transition. The company is benefiting from the increased adoption of cloud-based services. The company's offerings like Fusion 360, BIM 360 and PLM 360 are also gaining traction. However, in the near term, its profitability will remain under pressure due to investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. Further, the discontinuation of the perpetual license offerings in the following year may impact its financials.Autodesk's uneven top-line growth in the recent past has made it over-dependent on cost cutting programs to generate earnings growth. Although restructuring programs are corrective measures to realign costs, their success often depends on execution. We believe that there is a certain limit up to which costs can be curtailed, and investments are necessary to boost organic growth. The restructuring plan also includes the consolidation of eight leased facilities. However, its plan to continue to shift to mobile and cloud computing will increase investments. Over the long term, we believe restructuring programs will not be enough to boost earnings and the company will have to generate organic revenue growth to remain profitable.In the absence of long-term customers, the company has started offering a number of products on a rental basis, which is typically a pay-per-use model. This short-term rental business will mostly cater to project-based needs of clients. Although it will generate revenues, it is worth noting that this low-margin and low-volume business will be a drag on the company's margins.However, we remain positive on Autodesk's long-term growth prospects as it is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing through its comprehensive product portfolio. We expect the company to gain new customers in both domestic as well as overseas markets on the back of its broad portfolio. Moreover, growth in construction and manufacturing activities in the emerging markets present further growth opportunities. Additionally, a low channel inventory, increasing efficiencies through its channel partner framework, simplified upgrade pricing mechanism and electronic software delivery will help it to achieve long-term growth targets.Autodesk has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked stocks in this sector are Advent Software, Inc.  and Aspen Technology, Inc.  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Guidance Software, Inc.  with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In the last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 7.69%. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 10.65%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.In the last quarter, Autodesk reported lower-than-expected earnings. The bottom line was marred by higher expenses due to the ongoing business-model transition in areas like software, subscription and a shift toward cloud-based offerings. Nonetheless, revenues were ahead of expectations, surpassing both management's guided range and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.We believe Autodesk is likely to benefit from its ongoing business transition. Further, the increasing adaptability of cloud-based services remains a positive. The transition is boosting the company's subscriptions and deferred revenues that are expected to benefit it in the long run. Moreover, the increasing demand for the company's novel cloud-based products like Fusion 360, BIM 360 and PLM 360 are likely to drive the company's business, going forward.However, in the near term, the company's profitability will tend to be affected by investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. Further, the discontinuation of the perpetual license offerings next year may have some impact on the company's financials. In addition, foreign exchange fluctuations and stiff competition in the cloud-computing domain pose concern.For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $625-$645 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 25-30 cents, excluding stock-based compensation expense of 16 cents and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of 8 cents per share.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Autodesk is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Autodesk currently has a negative Earnings ESP because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 12 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 14 cents. This equates to a difference of -14.29%. Autodesk's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +4.55% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Intuit Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +2.34% and a Zacks Rank #2.Onconova Therapeutics, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +1.59% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The device, which shares the company's name,can 3D-print conductive ink as well as objects that feature the ability to embed electronic components -- and it sits comfortably on a desk. It holds the potential to revolutionize the way electronics are designed and made, and could be disruptive to other 3D printing companies.During the recently held Inside 3D Printing Conference in New York City, 3D printing specialist Steve Heller had the opportunity to interview Dan Oliver, co-founder of Voxel8.In the following video, the pair discuss the motivation behind co-founding Voxel8, how its technology works, the design implications, the value and future of 3D-printed electronics, proof of concepts, and the interplay between software and hardware in this new and exciting world.A full transcript follows the video.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"... But you'll probably just call it \"how I made my millions.\" Don't be too late to the party --  when the Web goes dark. Hey, Fools, Steve Heller here. I'm joined today with Dan Oliver. He is the co-founder of Voxel8, a very interesting up-and-coming 3D-printed electronics platform is what they've developed, out of a Harvard lab for material sciences. I'll let him do all the technical talking here.Thank you for being here today, Dan, I really appreciate it. Let's just get right into it. What motivated you to co-found Voxel8? I actually graduated from Harvard Business School and received a fellowship to try to commercialize the technology out of one of the labs around Harvard. Jennifer Lewis [Voxel8's founder] had an amazing [3D printing] technology and was already starting to commercialize her technology, and had a number of really awesome Ph.D. students that we actually co-founded the company with.We were really excited to bring a new dimension to 3D printing, allowing these novel [unique] materials to push the limits of functionality that 3D printing could have. We're trying to get past shapes, and really get toward adding embedded electronics and things like that. Can you walk me through how this technology actually works on a high level? Yes. Effectively, we have a number of different materials that we're able to co-print together.The idea is that you can lay down a layer of something like a plastic... if you look at the bottom of this, this is all plastic PLA. You can leave a little channel, and then we come back through with another material and fill in that channel.In this case, it's a highly conductive ink that cures at room temperature, so it's a low-cure temperature conductive ink. What this allows us to do is effectively create electrical interconnections between electrical components, that we can then embed inside.This is actually a half-printed quadcopter. What we've done here is embedded an entire PCB [printed circuit] board, and then run connective traces from the pads on the PCB board, out to the motor connections that we'll stuff in later.You can start adding in electrical components and start adding to the functionality of the part you're printing, so you don't just have a figurine or a statue; you have a fully functioning quadcopter coming off your device. It's not necessarily like you're 3D printing circuit boards with semiconductors on it. It's more that you're creating the pathways so that channels can be embedded into the part. What does that do from the design perspective? We're not really doing semiconductor processes with this.We figured semiconductors are really great at making really small, very useful components that have a lot of power. But if we can break those interconnections between all the components on your circuit board, it really frees up the geometry you're able to create.Imagine trying to get that typical rectangular circuit board into smaller and smaller places, and in more and more integrated devices.Think about a hearing aid, something like that, where you need a large number of electronics in a really small area. Having that freedom of geometry really allows you to stuff that volume full of electronics and get the most processing power and electronics in that small area that you can. Let's talk about why 3D-printed electronics. Let's get into that a little bit more, philosophically speaking. I see a movement in electronics having to become more seamless and more integrated into our everyday lives.Whether that's the Internet of Things movement, where everything needs a sensor, an antenna, and a power source, effectively, to gather all this data, or it's the mobile movement where we need computing on our bodies at all times, whether it's the next-generation wearable or it's your smartphone, I see electronics really needing to get more and more integrated into our everyday lives.Effectively, the way that's going to be done is by the geometry of the electronics that we create being able to be flexible. There's no better technology out there for making crazy [complex] geometries than 3D printing. Today we're talking about laying conductive ink. Where do you think this technology is going in the future? We're super-excited! We launched out of a material science lab. Professor Jennifer Lewis is our CEO and inventor of this technology. She's done so many amazing things that we want to work on. She's 3D-printed lithium-ion batteries, she's done high-strength composites and things like that.We're really excited about combining a number of different materials together and pulling basically whatever you want off the printer: a fully functioning electronic device, directly off your printer, that has seven, eight, nine -- who knows how many -- different materials on that.If you really think about your high-value devices that you play with on a day-to-day level, they're not [made from a] single material. They're a number of different materials working in concert, including electronic components and things like that.This ability to bring a whole host of materials together, print them together, just really opens up the design space and the possibilities we should be able to create. That's very interesting. You've brought some demonstrations with you today. I know you talked a little bit about this quadcopter. I wanted you to touch on that, and I want to see some of the other cool things you've got here. This is the half-finished quadcopter. If you go to our website, Voxel8.co, you can see the fully functioning quadcopter flying. Actually we're at a conference today and my buddy Travis, another co-founder, will be flying it at the talk.I've got a couple other things here.This is actually a 3D circuit board that we printed in the shape of our logo. What's cool about this is, a typical circuit board you basically have to route things on a single plane. If you start moving to other planes it really ups the expensiveness and the complexity of the circuit board you're creating.But since we've made this additively [with 3D printing], effectively layer by layer, creating it like that, it makes it really easy for us to route in three dimensions inside this.If you hold this up to the light, you can see a number of different traces printed inside of this thing. That's really interesting, because that's going to breaking those bonds between electrical components and getting electronics seamlessly integrated wherever you want.Imagine you have a sensor, and you need an antenna and a small electronics package next to it. Instead of having to be that square, flat circuit board, now imagine warping, twisting, folding that over on itself into any shape you want. This is what this [logo] represents.The other thing I brought here is an antenna we printed out. This is a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi antenna we were able to print out with just PLA and our proprietary conductive ink.This is a 2D design that we did as a proof of concept, but what we're really interested in is when we allow antenna designers to use this third dimension. What kind of powerful, high-bandwidth antennas would they be able to create if they were able to design and create antennas in three dimensions instead of just two? How does that interface with electronics? There's a chip that sends some power to this antenna, then the antenna sends out the signal? Is that how it works? Similar to how you would interface this antenna to any other electronics package -- effectively, you would be wired up together. Antennas are a little finicky depending on the frequency level, what that connection is.We're learning lots about antennas; I'm seeing it on a day-to-day basis here, but effectively it would be wired up similar to any other antenna. This would be a stand-alone component we could make, or if we were creating a whole device this is something we could print directly in, and then just print our conductive traces off and wire it back up into the digital circuit. How does software mature to actually work with a platform like this? That's such an important question. We've been lucky enough -- one, we have a great software team. Jack Minardi is a co-founder of the company and a great software guy, and we have a great software team.But the other thing we've been really fortunate about is actually  approached us about how they could help support our project. We basically told them, \"There's not really a CAD package out there that allows you to do 3D routing of electronics.\"They effectively embedded a software designer inside of our team to come up with a new design tool that allows you to import a 3D model, drag and drop electrical components in or on that 3D model, and then wire them up in three dimensions.They basically created a whole new tool, called Project Wire, that's going to be available in a couple of months here. They've been really, really helpful.But it's important to note that while we really pride ourselves on these material innovations, both the software and the hardware have to be right there, supporting it, to really fulfill its full promise. Making the software communicate with the hardware so it knows to lay down some silver conductive ink and some PLA or ABS plastic next to it, that's pretty seamless at this point? It's getting there. One of the great things about having the Autodesk software engineer on our team is on a day-to-day basis, we're using the software. Full disclosure, Project Wire works with our Slicer pipeline, our tool path planning pipeline, so we've had a lot of discussions about where that fence needs to be, how we need to send information back and forth over that fence.Effectively, they tag information about not only the shape the material needs to be printed in, but also what type of material it is. Then our slicer and tool path planner can then make the correct tool path for that from that design file.There's been a lot of communication back and forth on that. It's not a trivial problem.

Carbon3D made a splash in the tech world in mid-March, when DiSimone unveiled and demonstrated the company's seemingly game-changing 3D printing technology, Continuous Liquid Interface Production, or CLIP, at the TED 2015 conference, while simultaneously CLIP appeared as the cover story in  magazine.CLIP harnesses UV light and oxygen to \"grow\" polymer parts continuously at speeds 25 to 100 times faster than the leading 3D printing technologies. Additionally, CLIP can produce objects that have a smoother surface finish than conventionally 3D-printed parts and a structural consistency on par with injection-molded ones, according to Carbon3D.CLIP is generating a lot of buzz because it has the potential to disrupt the global manufacturing sector. That's because speed, surface quality, structural integrity, and materials capabilities (the focus of the second article in this series) are key hurdles that have been holding 3D printing back from moving beyond prototyping and select, short-run production applications into a greater array of manufacturing applications.Source: Carbon3D.DiSimone said they knew they wanted to have the 3D-printed part rise out of a puddle of resin, just like T-1000 rises out of a puddle of liquid metal. From there, the brainstorming led to how CLIP accomplishes its  -like feat: Through the use of a transparent, oxygen-permeable window that's something like a contact lens, CLIP technology controls the exposure of UV light and oxygen to the UV-light-curable resin. The UV light solidifies some parts of the resin while the oxygen prevents the layer bordering the window -- the \"dead zone\" -- from solidifying. This process allows for the object to \"grow\" from the bottom up in a continuous process.After the basic idea came to them, Ermoshkin built a prototype -- \"something he's really good at,\" commented DiSimone, who then added that the inventors knew they were on to something during the initial trial run.During his mention of the patent search, DiSimone -- who has 150 issued patents -- stated that \"patents drive innovation.\" Indeed, without patents, there would be much less incentive for individuals and entities to innovate, as it would be foolish to spend resources if others were allowed to profit from the get-go. CLIP technology is similar to stereolithography, or SLA, which was invented in the mid-1980s by Chuck Hull, who then went on to found 3D Systems. The key difference is that SLA pauses between producing each layer, whereas CLIP operates continuously, thanks to the oxygen-enriched \"dead zone.\"What might seem like a small tweak to an existing technology results in changing 3D printing from a mechanical process into a tunable photochemical one. This results in a greatly revved-up process -- as DiSimone demonstrated at TED -- and, according to Carbon3D, greater structural consistency of the printed object, and the opening up of a wider range of materials possibilities. DiSimone has straddled the academic and private sectors for almost his entire career. He's clearly driven to apply what he learns in his DiSimone Research Group to solve real-world issues. He's already successfully done so multiple times, having leveraged his polymer chemistry expertise to create such diverse products as an environmentally friendly dry-cleaning solvent and nanocarriers for vaccines. These inventions led to spin-off companies Micell Technologies and Liquidia Technologies, respectively.It struck me that DiSimone's telling one of his co-inventors to run a patent search for specific keywords before even discussing starting a 3D printing company seemed a shrewd, practical approach to maximize potential returns while limiting wasting resources. This trait should serve him well in his CEO role.While DiSimone and Samulski are chemists, physicist Ermoshkin rounds out the founding trio. DiSimone's a big believer that there can be wonderful synergy among people with different strengths and backgrounds. This belief put into practice at Carbon3D should help the company as it scales up to compete in an increasingly competitive space.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"... But you'll probably just call it \"how I made my millions.\" Don't be too late to the party --  when the Web goes daThe article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC.

Source: Voxel8.At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, a start-up named Voxel8 debuted the world's first 3D electronics printer. The device, which shares the company's name, can 3D-print objects that feature the ability to embed electronic components and can 3D-print conductive ink -- and sits comfortably on a desk.As a demonstration of its technology, Voxel8 showed off a 3D-printed quadcopter that embedded an aftermarket circuit board directly into the copter's shell, which the company connected to the motors with its silver-based 3D-printed conductive ink.When the Voxel8 begins shipping later this year, it'll usher in a new era of product design that emphasizes designing electronics to fit a product, rather than designing products around their requisite electronics. Longer term, the design and manufacturing implications could be staggering.Source: Voxel8. Voxel8's developer kit starts at $8,499 and enables engineers and product designers to 3D-print, in PLA plastic and conductive ink, objects as large as 4 x 6 x 4 inches. Also included in the price is access to  's  upcoming  , a first-of-its-kind software suite that allows users to place components, route wires, and output multi-material 3D-printing data to the Voxel8. The video below provides an excellent overview of how the Voxel8 creates a compelling platform for 3D printed electronics:Source: Voxel8.Compared to other conductive inks on the market aimed at 3D printing, Voxel8's ink is made with silver particles, a material that has the highest known conductivity and that Voxel8 claims is 5,000 times more conductive than the competing conductive pastes and filaments available to 3D printing users.Source: Voxel8. Although conductive inks aren't a new concept,  for 15 or 20 years commercially, combining the ability to 3D-print objects with the placement of conductive inks makes the Voxel8 groundbreaking. In terms of possibilities, reinventing the way products featuring embedded electronics are designed could lead to creating fundamentally better products.For instance,  has been exploring ways to use conductive inks to act as sensors embedded within components that operate in harsh environments, such as jet engines, with the goal of making them smarter. In the video below from last April, I had the opportunity to speak with GE's Christine Furstoss about conductive inks, which she refers to as \"direct write,\" or \"3D inking.\" Voxel8 was founded by Harvard professor  , who has extensive experience with material science, electronics, and 3D printing. The company also recently secured an investment from Braemar Energy Ventures, likely giving it enough resources to continue developing its 3D printing electronics platform and to introduce new materials. Considering its partnership with Autodesk could also be viewed as an endorsement, Voxel8 appears to taking the right actions to become a formidable competitor in the 3D printing industry.Granted, there's a high possibility that Voxel8 won't be the only company in the marketplace offering 3D printers that can print with conductive inks.  has  on numerous occasions that its \"racetrack\" high-speed 3D printing platform, which is  to be introduced sometime later this year, will feature the ability to produce components that have conductive properties.Ultimately, what makes 3D printing such a compelling technology is its ability to manufacture products that couldn't otherwise be made with traditional processes. Throw in the capability of embedding electronics that the Voxel8 offers, and the 3D printing industry's prospects of having a greater influence in the manufacturing world increases significantly. Although the Voxel8 may seem rudimentary today in terms of its capabilities, 3D-printed electronics are likely to become a whole different animal five, 10, or 20 years from now. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

The leading 3D printing software maker  on Thursday that it's backing Carbon3D with a $10 million investment from its Spark Investment Fund. This is Autodesk's first investment since it launched the fund in August with the aim of investing up to $100 million in those pushing the boundaries of 3D printing.Source: Carbon3D. Perhaps fittingly for a company that claims its CLIP technology is 25 to 100 times faster than leading 3D printing technologies, Carbon3D has been raising money at a fast clip. It's now raised $51 million, as it had previously secured $41 million in private equity funds from tech heavyweights Sequoia Capital and a division of Silver Lake.The start-up has considerable resources to continue developing its innovative CLIP technology. This, of course, makes it a more formidable potential competitor to 3D printing industry leaders  and  .3D Systems had $284.9 million sitting on its balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter 2014, while Stratasys had a cash hoard of $442.7 million. Though Carbon3D's funding doesn't compare to the cash positions of the two industry bigwigs, it's still a big take for a start-up that just began operating in 2013.While we're talking war chests,  's balance sheet was bulging with $12.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. HP's deep pockets are a huge reason the company sent shock waves through the 3D printing space before it even unveiled its impressive Multi Jet Fusion technology. The company plans to release an enterprise-focused 3D printer based on this tech in 2016. The most compelling part of this story to me is that Carbon3D's two co-founders were inspired to develop CLIP by the robotic assassin T-1000 from the movie  which rises from a pool of liquid metal to assume the form of any person or object.Source: Carbon3D.CLIP technology is similar to stereolithography, or SLA, which also uses UV light to selectively cure resin as it produces an object layer by layer. SLA was invented by Chuck Hull, who then went on to found 3D Systems.However, unlike SLA, which pauses between each layer, CLIP operates continuously, as its name -- Continuous Liquid Interface Production -- suggests. This accelerates the 3D printing process to speeds 25 to 100 times as fast as leading 3D printing technologies. Additionally, it results in printed objects that have a smoother surface finish than conventionally 3D-printed parts, and a structural integrity on par with injection molded parts, according to Carbon3D.Eliminating the pauses involved an entirely new way of conceptualizing 3D printing. As DeSimone explained in his TED talk, oxygen has traditionally had a bad name with respect to UV-light-sensitive resin because it inhibits curing. Inspired by T-1000, however, CLIP's inventors turned the thought process upside down so that oxygen is key to making the technology work.Through the use of a transparent, oxygen-permeable window that DeSimone likened to a contact lens, CLIP technology controls the exposure of light and oxygen to the resin. The UV light solidifies some parts of the resin, while the oxygen prevents other parts -- the \"dead zone\" -- from solidifying. This process allows the object to \"grow\" from the bottom up in a continuous process. While 3D printing stock investors shouldn't panic, they should also not underestimate the potential of well-funded Carbon3D's CLIP technology to take business away from their 3D printing companies, most notably 3D Systems, Stratasys, and  , all of which are involved in the plastics space. The extent of the threat, however, remains unknown at this point, as we don't yet have enough information, particularly on Carbon3D's materials capabilities.Unless DeSimone has magical powers on par with T-1000's, his live demonstration showed that CLIP is a potentially game-changing technology with respect to speed. And given Carbon3D's backers, it seems highly likely that the company's others claims are also accurate.If this proves to be the case, then CLIP technology has the potential to disrupt the manufacturing industry. That's because speed, surface quality, and structural integrity -- in addition to materials capabilities -- are key hurdles that have been holding 3D printing back from moving beyond prototyping and select, short-run production applications into a greater array of manufacturing applications.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"...

Source: Voxel8.At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, a start-up named Voxel8 debuted the world's first 3D electronics printer. The device, which shares the company's name, can 3D-print objects that feature the ability to embed electronic components and can 3D-print conductive ink -- and sits comfortably on a desk.As a demonstration of its technology, Voxel8 showed off a 3D-printed quadcopter that embedded an aftermarket circuit board directly into the copter's shell, which the company connected to the motors with its silver-based 3D-printed conductive ink.When the Voxel8 begins shipping later this year, it'll usher in a new era of product design that emphasizes designing electronics to fit a product, rather than designing products around their requisite electronics. Longer term, the design and manufacturing implications could be staggering.Source: Voxel8. Voxel8's developer kit starts at $8,499 and enables engineers and product designers to 3D-print, in PLA plastic and conductive ink, objects as large as 4 x 6 x 4 inches. Also included in the price is access to  's  upcoming  , a first-of-its-kind software suite that allows users to place components, route wires, and output multi-material 3D-printing data to the Voxel8. The video below provides an excellent overview of how the Voxel8 creates a compelling platform for 3D printed electronics:Source: Voxel8.Compared to other conductive inks on the market aimed at 3D printing, Voxel8's ink is made with silver particles, a material that has the highest known conductivity and that Voxel8 claims is 5,000 times more conductive than the competing conductive pastes and filaments available to 3D printing users.Source: Voxel8. Although conductive inks aren't a new concept,  for 15 or 20 years commercially, combining the ability to 3D-print objects with the placement of conductive inks makes the Voxel8 groundbreaking. In terms of possibilities, reinventing the way products featuring embedded electronics are designed could lead to creating fundamentally better products.For instance,  has been exploring ways to use conductive inks to act as sensors embedded within components that operate in harsh environments, such as jet engines, with the goal of making them smarter. In the video below from last April, I had the opportunity to speak with GE's Christine Furstoss about conductive inks, which she refers to as \"direct write,\" or \"3D inking.\" Voxel8 was founded by Harvard professor  , who has extensive experience with material science, electronics, and 3D printing. The company also recently secured an investment from Braemar Energy Ventures, likely giving it enough resources to continue developing its 3D printing electronics platform and to introduce new materials. Considering its partnership with Autodesk could also be viewed as an endorsement, Voxel8 appears to taking the right actions to become a formidable competitor in the 3D printing industry.Granted, there's a high possibility that Voxel8 won't be the only company in the marketplace offering 3D printers that can print with conductive inks.  has  on numerous occasions that its \"racetrack\" high-speed 3D printing platform, which is  to be introduced sometime later this year, will feature the ability to produce components that have conductive properties.Ultimately, what makes 3D printing such a compelling technology is its ability to manufacture products that couldn't otherwise be made with traditional processes. Throw in the capability of embedding electronics that the Voxel8 offers, and the 3D printing industry's prospects of having a greater influence in the manufacturing world increases significantly. Although the Voxel8 may seem rudimentary today in terms of its capabilities, 3D-printed electronics are likely to become a whole different animal five, 10, or 20 years from now. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

Carbon3D made a splash in the technology world in March when DeSimone unveiled and demonstrated the start-up's seemingly game-changing 3D printing technology, Continuous Liquid Interface Production, or CLIP, at the TED 2015 conference, while simultaneously CLIP appeared as the cover story in the journal .I was fortunate to conduct a phone interview with prolific inventor and serial entrepreneur Carbon3D CEO Joseph DeSimone recently. Carbon3D made a splash in the technology world in March when DeSimone unveiled and demonstrated the start-up's seemingly game-changing 3D printing technology, Continuous Liquid Interface Production, or CLIP, at the TED 2015 conference, while simultaneously CLIP appeared as the cover story in the journal  .Briefly, CLIP harnesses UV light and oxygen to \"grow\" polymer parts continuously at speeds 25 to 100 times faster than the leading 3D printing technologies. Additionally, CLIP can produce 3D-printed objects that have a smoother surface finish than conventionally 3D-printed parts and a structural integrity on par with injection-molded objects, according to Carbon3D. You can read more about the process  .CLIP's generating much buzz because it has the potential to disrupt the global manufacturing sector, as speed, surface quality, structural integrity, and materials capabilities are the key hurdles that have been holding 3D printing back from moving beyond prototyping and select, short-run production applications into a greater array of manufacturing applications.Source: Carbon3D. DeSimone told me that the media focus has been on CLIP's impressive speed since it was the capability that was easiest to demonstrate at TED, but that the \"materials properties [enabled by CLIP] are really key\" and the even bigger story. Indeed, as it doesn't matter how fast a 3D printer can churn out  object if customers can't get the materials properties they need for their specific applications.There are two primary things investors should know:(To be clear, DeSimone told me the first item, whereas the related second one is my interpretation after listening to what he had to say and doing my own research. If my take turns out to be incorrect, I'll certainly let readers know.)As to the latter point, I asked DeSimone if CLIP could produce, for instance, a polymer such as one of the tougher, more rigid nylons. What I had in mind was the importance of  ' introduction of Nylon 12 for its Fortus production printers in late 2013. This was a big deal, as 3D printing using nylons was an  at that time.DeSimone said that CLIP can enable the production of a material with properties akin to Nylon 11. Among nylons, Nylon 11 is the most similar to Nylon 12. Both have properties that make them desirable for higher-performance industrial applications. Nylon 11 reportedly has higher strength and heat resistance, but lower impact strength and UV light resistance than Nylon 12, according to my research.3D-printed metal turbine blade. Source: Wikipedia.CLIP is a polymer-based technology, so in its present form it doesn't have metals capabilities. This doesn't mean that CLIP doesn't have the potential to be hugely successful, however.The manufacture of plastic objects is already a humongous market. Furthermore, plastics are increasingly being used to replace metals in some applications where weight is a critical factor. A good example is the auto industry, where corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards are driving automakers to replace as many metal parts with lighter-weight plastic ones as they can. According to  , plastics currently account for 16% of the weight of an average vehicle, but could rise to 25% within five years.This isn't to say that there's not immense potential in the metals 3D printing market -- there is. However, I think it's likely that there will be more than one winning 3D printing technology, given there's an endless variety of materials and applications. It seems to be flying a bit under the radar that CLIP has the potential to enable ceramics to be used to produce 3D-printed parts. This possibility exists because some ceramic slurries use polymers as binders.I didn't get to explore this topic with DeSimone, as our interview time ran out. I'd assume ceramics are on the back burner as the Carbon3D team perfects CLIP's core polymer capabilities. The CLIP machine DeSimone demonstrated at TED can create objects up to three inches by four inches and up to 12 inches long, according to  . However, that was just a prototype, not the only size that works using CLIP, according to DeSimone. I think we can expect more news on this front soon. CLIP machines are now being tested by Carbon3D's partners, including an automotive company, an athletic apparel company, a design studio, and an academic research lab. That's all DeSimone can share, as the company isn't naming names.Source: Nike. was an early adopter of 3D printing. The athletic shoe giant now uses the technology for custom and short-run production, as well as prototyping; 3D printing is currently too slow to use for mass production. So, Nike could be the athletic apparel company that's testing CLIP, especially since its Oregon headquarters is a relatively quick sprint away from Carbon3D's and its venture capital funders' Silicon Valley base.  , New Balance, Reebok, and  are running fast in their 3D printing efforts, so they're also possibilities. All these companies are on Stratasys' roster of customers.CLIP reportedly excels at producing elastomers -- polymers with properties like natural rubber -- a great fit for companies that can charge considerably higher prices for their athletic shoes with superior fits and shock-absorbing properties. If CLIP is as speedy as it's being touted -- and has the potential to further ramp up its speed to 1,000 times that of the leading 3D printing technologies, as DeSimone said in his TED talk -- then CLIP should allow these athletic shoe companies to greatly expand their use of 3D printing. Carbon3D naturally isn't discussing commercialization yet. What we do know is that the first product is slated to be released \"within one year.\"We don't yet know the price of an initial CLIP 3D printer. It seems likely that the price could be prohibitively high  Carbon3D's primary initial goal is profitability. Economies of scale, of course, eventually bring down the cost of new products. However, I think it's probable that early profitability will take a backseat to gaining traction in the market. So, I think we can expect Carbon3D to price its initial printer quite competitively, so as to gain market share. Carbon3D has a $51 million war chest of venture capital cash, including $10 million kicked in from  's Spark Fund. Losing money in the short term to gain market share is the usual game plan for well-funded start-ups. CLIP appears to have the potential to disrupt the conventional manufacturing sector and present a sizable threat to  , Stratasys, and  , all of which are involved in the enterprise-focused plastics space, and perhaps to companies involved in injection molding, such as  . However, it's too early to gauge how much of a threat Carbon3D could present. For instance, we don't yet know how successful the company will be at scaling up the size capacity of its printer's build area, and if and when CLIP will be able to produce multimaterial and/or multicolor objects.I'll continue to follow Carbon3D's progress -- and keep readers updated.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

Adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 25 cents in the quarter, significantly down from 40 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. For fiscal 2015, Autodesk reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.17, significantly down from $1.68 a year ago.The company's bottom line in the quarter was impacted by higher expenses owing to the ongoing business-model transition in areas like software, subscription and a shift toward cloud-based offerings.Revenues for the quarter increased 13.3% year over year to $664.6 million, ahead of both management's guided range of $640-$655 million and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $652 million. Revenue contribution from the Delcam acquisition was approximately $20 million.The year-over-year growth in revenues was primarily attributed to a 16.7% year-over-year jump in subscription revenues to $310.3 million. The improvement in subscription revenues came on the back of strong growth in subscription process through Autodesk eStore and also non-maintenance subscription revenues.License revenues rose 10.5% from the year-ago quarter to $354.3 million attributable to an increase in upgrade revenues. However, flexible enterprise license agreements partially offset the increase.Total billings grew 13% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher license and subscription billings. Total maintenance, desktop (rental), and cloud subscriptions increased approximately 100,000 from the prior quarter, including approximately 17,000 subscriptions related to the recent Shotgun acquisition.Segment wise, revenues from Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) declined about 4% from the year-ago quarter to $189 million.Revenues from the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segment surged 24% from the year-ago quarter to $242 million.Manufacturing revenues increased 23% on a year-over-year basis to $190 million. Autodesk's Media and Entertainment (M&E) segment rose 5% on a year-over-year basis to $43 million in the reported quarter.Revenues from Flagship products reached $298 million, an increase of 4% compared to the prior-year quarter. Revenues from Suites increased 15% on a year-over-year basis to $249 million. Revenues from New and Adjacent products rose 41% from the year-earlier quarter to $117 million.Geographically, revenues in the Americas rose 15% year over year to $238 million. EMEA revenues grew 19% to $273 million, while the same in APAC increased 2% from the year-ago quarter to $154 million. Revenues in emerging economies rose 21% from the year-ago quarter to $107 million, representing about 16% of total revenue.Gross margin contracted 120 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 86.5% in the reported quarter. The decline was primarily due to business model transition and higher cloud-based cost.Operating expenses spiked 21.2% on a year-over-year basis to $561.1 million during the fourth quarter. The increase was primarily due to a rise in marketing & sales (up 24.8%), research and development (up 17.9%), general and administrative expenses (up 32.8%) and amortization of purchased intangibles (up 3.3%).As a result, income from operations plunged nearly 73% year over year to $14 million in the quarter. Autodesk's profitability was negatively impacted by the ongoing business model transition and investment in cloud infrastructure.Autodesk exited the year with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $2,026.4 million compared with $2,267.1 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operating activities for fiscal 2015 was $708.1 million compared with $563.5 million in fiscal 2014.Deferred revenues for the quarter increased 28% on a year-over-year basis to a record $1.16 billion.For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $625-$645 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 25-30 cents for the upcoming quarter. The figure does not include stock-based compensation expense of 16 cents per share and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of 8 cents per share.For fiscal 2016, management expects net billings to grow in the range of 3%-5%. Revenues are also expected to increase 3% to 5%, while operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is expected to be in the range of 13% to 15%. Non-GAAP EPS (excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles) is expected in the range of $1.05- $1.20. The company projects subscription additions for fiscal 2016 to be between 375,000 and 425,000.We believe Autodesk is likely to benefit from its ongoing business transition. Further, the increasing adaptability of cloud-based services remains a positive. The transition is boosting the company's subscriptions and deferred revenues that are expected to benefit it in the long run. Moreover, the increasing demand for the company's novel cloud-based products like Fusion 360, BIM 360 and PLM 360 are likely to drive the company's business, going forward.However, in the near term, the company's profitability will tend to be affected because of the investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. Further, the discontinuation of the perpetual license offerings in the following year may have some impact on the company's financials. In addition, foreign exchange fluctuations and competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon.com Inc. (  ), Microsoft Corporation (  ) and Google Inc.

You might say familiar or trendy terms, such as user growth or the Internet of Things. Or perhaps that the companies with the most innovative products and services will reign king in tomorrow's tech markets. And while those are likely partially correct answers, there's a tremendous amount of growth to be had from a rather unlikely source.It might be difficult to believe that companies that have traditionally relied on silicon chips, mobile apps, and lines of software code could profit from something as seemingly disconnected as making biological engineering as predictable as traditional engineering fields, but a closer look into research and development spending hints that it may not be that far-fetched after all. Why are  ,  , and  quietly investing in synthetic biology, and what could it mean for investors? Computer-aided design, or CAD, software has revolutionized how our world is built. But the seamless efficiency and accuracy won't be relegated to digital movies, buildings, engine parts, and airplanes for long. Autodesk is investing in bioCAD tools for synthetic biology applications through Project Cyborg, which is part of the company's Bio/Nano/Programmable Matter Group. The team is led by Carlos Olguin, whom I  , and is also home to Andrew Hessel, one of the field's most infectious thought leaders and the guest speaker at The Motley Fool's annual writers' conference last September.Autodesk Chief Technology Officer Jeff Kowalski considers design tools for synthetic biology a  than even 3D printing. That's big talk, especially considering that the company plans to  into 3D printing start-ups over the next several years, but he might be right. What is currently referred to as the bioCAD industry is comprised of glorified text editors for building DNA, although it is already beginning to replace less efficient protocols that are widely used in biology laboratories throughout the world. That opportunity alone is worth several billion dollars per year.The Smart Wet Lab Assistant could modernize decades-old laboratory work. Image source: .The Smart Wet Lab Assistant could modernize decades-old laboratory work. Image source:  .The company thinks a successful system could be used to document experiments, train new staff, teach students, and double check the work of stubborn professors. If the complex environment of a wet lab (biology lab) can be quantified with software and machine learning, then other systems, such as a factory or medical facility, could deploy similar technology to reduce unnecessary costs from human error. It is still in the early days, but Intel could very well be developing a revolutionary technology much different from its core business. Everyone wants to discuss the latest edition of the Surface tablet, or if the \"Start\" menu will be added back to the next rendition of Windows, or the Xbox One. But Microsoft could get the last laugh with a newly created programming language. No, it won't build the next great mobile game, although it could make biology much more predictable.Microsoft Research created the Genetic Engineering of Cells, or GEC, simulator that breaks cellular processes into their most basic interactions by focusing on the concept of modularity, or in this case, biological parts. Consider that genes and proteins are largely responsible for dictating how a cell functions, but we are still learning how specific combinations interact in even the most well understood organisms. That can be troublesome when deciding which biological parts are needed to provide a desired outcome, such as producing a specific chemical, and has led to many  for industrial biotech and agricultural companies.Reducing life to its most basic parts could enable predictable designs. Image source: Microsoft Research.GEC aims to solve that by translating desired functionality into DNA code, which is the reverse of current biological engineering efforts. In other words, suppose researchers want certain bacteria to produce a never-before synthesized fragrance compound. They would tell Microsoft's GEC what end product they want, perhaps with known constraints, and the programming language would output the DNA sequence needed to achieve the synthesis of that molecule.The current GEC is quite basic, but it allows researchers to build new organisms without knowing the specific parts available. By comparison, several bioCAD startups have started with less of a foundation and less robust tools and still managed to land multibillion-dollar partners and customers. It will take a bit more tweaking, but Microsoft could jump into synthetic biology tools with a splash before the end of the decade. In the near future, many everyday products will be created from living systems. That includes easy-to-imagine products such as fuels and foods and eyebrow-raising products such as electrical wires and car tires. The wave of innovation will build strength in the next few years and create major opportunities for not just the companies designing the organisms and industrial processes, but also for those supplying them with the tools behind the scenes. Yet, when I speak to most investors, it quickly becomes obvious they are completely unaware of the R&D projects under way today at their favorite tech companies. So, if you're willing to take a closer look at the research being performed at Autodesk, Intel, and Microsoft, then you could be a step ahead of your peers in realizing new avenues of potential growth.

It's that there's always a group of young startups with hot innovations breathing down the Old Guard's necks.There are chances for late-career renaissances, though. And what aging tech leaders need to achieve this is the business equivalent of a performance-enhancing drug - except legal.I've uncovered four aging Silicon Valley legends that have found just that in a certain fast-moving part of the tech sector.And one of them has rediscovered its ace-like prowess - and is making investors hefty gains in the process.Let me tell you about it...According to the forecasters at Market Research Media, the cloud computing sector is undergoing a compound annual growth rate of 30%. And by 2020, the industry will be worth $270 billion.In other words, today we're following  - \"Ride the unstoppable trends.\"The \"cloud\" is just another word for the Internet. And so, cloud computing is the storage of and access to data and software over the Internet instead of your office's network or your PC's hard drive.Cloud computing allows businesses and government agencies to cut way back on what they spend on their computer networks and IT departments. Instead, these enterprises pay vendors (the companies we're going to talk about today) to host data, software, and applications at remote storage \"farms\" and deliver it all back via the Web.With a cloud delivery model, many companies find that it's much easier - and cheaper - to pay someone else to deliver all that data rather than run their own elaborate computer networks. Plus, making sure corporate networks run smoothly and remain secure from hackers has gotten much more complex, because today's workers use their smartphones and tablets just as much as they use their desk PCs.While dozens of young tech firms are pushing the boundaries of cloud computing, the cloud has also turned out to be nothing short of a steroid injection for several aging tech leaders.Let's take a look at four that have done a particularly good job transitioning to a cloud-based business model - and one that I think will be a fantastic addition to your portfolio in 2015 and beyond. (Nasdaq:  ), founded in 1982, is highly regarded for its 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software. That last segment has especially burnished the San Rafael, Calif.-based tech company's image - the last 19 Academy Award winners for Best Visual Effects used its software.Moving Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint slide shows to the cloud is one thing. But Autodesk's software are extremely complex products - the last sort you'd expect to find on the cloud.But there you'll find them - available for subscription.Nearly three years ago, in April 2012, Autodesk Chief Executive Officer Carl Bass predicted his company would make a successful transition to the cloud, with 100% of its products available online.And they've done just that.In the fiscal 2014\u2032s third quarter, ended Oct. 31, deferred revenue, which includes future sales from cloud subscriptions, rose to a record $1 billion. Quarterly revenue from cloud subscriptions rose 15% year over year to $298 million.Autodesk also raised 2015 sales guidance three times last year. However, the company is still working out the cloud's impact on profits.During the third quarter, earnings fell by 80% from the year-ago quarter to $10.7 million.Bass pins the decline on higher R&D spending and the effect of deferring sales over several quarters rather than booking them all at once.Founded in 1982,  (Nasdaq:  ) was synonymous with the rise of desktop publishing in the 1980s.You almost certainly know the San Jose, Calif.-based tech company for its Portable Document Format (PDF) files. Its Photoshop program is still the industry standard for photo editing, and its Illustrator software is a top-rated package for graphic design.But if you visit Adobe's website, you wouldn't even know it's a company deeply rooted in software.These days, it's all about the cloud...Specifically, the firm has had great success in converting sales to recurring subscriptions though its Creative Cloud platform.The shift to a cloud-based model was a big factor behind Adobe's earnings beat when it reported fourth-quarter results back on Dec. 12.Adobe had adjusted earnings of $0.36 per share, 20% above analysts' forecasts of $0.30 per share. It also beat on sales, which came in at $1.07 billion, compared with forecasts of $1.06 billion.And those results mirror Adobe's cloud sales - they came in at 644,000 new subscribers, more than 20% above analysts' projections. For the fiscal year, Adobe grew cloud users by more than 130%, to 3.5 millionAnd for the future of Adobe, the firm also offers powerful cloud-based marketing tools for corporations that need to keep abreast of changes in social media and online and mobile. For the fiscal year, Marketing Cloud sales came in at $1.17 billion, 28% of Adobe's total sales.Of all the older tech leaders improving cloud sales,  (NYSE:  ) may be the most surprising.In 2009, then-CEO Larry Ellison caused a stir when he derided cloud computing as a lot of marketing mumbo jumbo. A video of Ellison's sarcastic remarks quickly made the rounds on YouTube.It also made Wall Street analysts doubt the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company's commitment to increasing subscription sales and Web-based product deliveries.But in the second fiscal quarter, ended Nov. 30, the 37-year-old company finally showed off its cloud bona fides. Oracle's new cloud success helped the database management firm beat Wall Street forecasts for sales and adjusted earnings.Sales rose 3.5% from the year-ago quarter to $9.6 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $9.51 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.69, a penny higher than forecasts.Oracle cloud software offerings include applications for human-resources and sales departments. Those sales rose 45% from the same quarter a year earlier to $516 million.Now serving as chairman, Ellison has become Oracle's biggest cloud champion. He predicts new cloud bookings next fiscal year of more than $1 billion.After years of relying on PCs to drive sales of its software,  (Nasdaq:  ) has made an ace move to our unstoppable trend.And the success couldn't have come at a better time for this Redmond, Wash.-based company, which was founded back in 1975.While global PC sales have stabilized, that comes after years of decline that cut into a big part of Microsoft's growth plan.Fortunately, the company has a new CEO who is clearly both more committed to cloud computing and more adept at wringing up sales in this category than his predecessor, Steve Ballmer.Under Satya Nadella, who will soon complete his first year on the job, Microsoft has turned in an All-Star performance in the cloud.The company's primary cloud product for business clients is Office 365. Microsoft also offers a dynamic customer relations sales tool through its Azure cloud service.That two-barreled approach has worked out great. In its first fiscal 2015 quarter, ended Sept. 30, Microsoft's overall cloud sales more than doubled to $1.18 billion.And that was just one of several improvements the company has made over the past year.And as investors, we can find the results in the stock price. Over the past year,  is up 25.5%, nearly three times the Standard & Poor's 500 Index 9.3% return.Indeed, Microsoft's quick turnaround is why I keep talking about the company - and keep recommending it. In fact, its shares have gained 38.7% since I first suggested them to you back in September 2013.And this late-career renaissance under Nadella is so important - to Microsoft, to the tech sector, and to investors like you - that I want to follow up today's talk by taking a deeper look at the company.In particular, I want to inspect Microsoft under another lens of my five investing rules.Keep an eye out for that column over the next couple of weeks.

In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.09%. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 20.90%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We remain positive on Autodesk's long-term growth prospects as it is well-positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing through its comprehensive product portfolio. We expect the company to record customer growth in both domestic as well as overseas markets in the fourth quarter on the back of its product portfolio.Moreover, the increase in construction and manufacturing activities in the emerging markets present growth opportunities, going ahead. Additionally, low channel inventory, increasing efficiencies through its channel partner framework, simplified upgrade pricing mechanism and electronic software delivery will positively affect the to-be-reported quarter results.However, Autodesk's uneven top-line growth in the recent past increased its dependence on cost saving programs to boost earnings. Although restructuring programs realign costs, their success often depends on execution. We believe that there is a certain limit up to which costs can be curtailed and therefore, the company should invest more in organic growth, going forward.Additionally, foreign exchange fluctuations, increasing exposure to Europe and competition from Adobe Systems Inc. (  ) are likely to hamper the fourth-quarter results. Also, customer concentration poses significant challenges and keeps us on the sidelines.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Autodesk is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at earnings per share of 13 cents. Hence, the difference is of 0.00%. Autodesk's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Veeva Systems Inc.

Developers at National Harbor -- a 350-acre waterfront property in Prince George's County, Maryland -- announced their plans earlier this month to open a facility for Local Motors by year's end. The facility, which is expected to be approximately 40,000 square feet, will include a 3D printing microfactory, lab, and showroom.By year's end, visitors to National Harbor should be able to watch cars being 3D printed. Source: Peterson Companies, developer. The business model ofPhoenix-based Local Motors, founded in 2007, involves crowdsourcing the designing of vehicles, and then building and selling them locally. Its ultimate goal is to open microfactories near all major urban centers. Manufacturing autos close to their ultimate buyers should cut down drastically on distribution costs.The company currently has locations in Phoenix and Las Vegas, but according to the  , the National Harbor site would be \"the first Local Motors outpost to print, refine and assemble a fleet of cars via 3-D printer.\"\"It's like an IKEA. People will come from all around to experience it,\" the  quoted Justin Fishkin, chief strategy officer for Local Motors, as saying. I think that might prove true. Surely, many 3D printing aficionados, as well as tech lovers and auto enthusiasts, will probably find something of interest to do and see at the facility, which promises to have a major demonstrative -- and perhaps even a participatory -- bent.Additionally, there reportedly will be hundreds of other 3D-printed items for sale. So, members of the general public who don't fall into the above-mentioned groups might also find something that appeals to them -- and their wallets. OK, so this is cool, but where's the investing link?The Strati. Source: Local Motors.Software maker  announced last fall that it's collaborating with Local Motors. Local Motors is using Autodesk's Spark, a new open platform for 3D printing, as it continues to work with privately held Cincinnati Inc. and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop the Strati, the world's first 3D printed full-size car. In September, the trio used the  that Cincinnati and ORNL are developing to produce the Strati electric vehicle live at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago. They repeated the feat earlier this month at the Detroit Auto Show.The Strati will initially be classified as a neighborhood electric vehicle, limited to driving on roads with posted speed limits of 45 miles per hour or less, according to  However,  also reports, \"Local Motors is seeking approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for highway-capable vehicles.\"If the Autodesk-Local Motors team-up can demonstrate that the Spark platform increases the ease and efficiency of Local Motors' 3D printing efforts on its Strati project and beyond, Spark could accelerate the adoption of 3D printing for industrial applications. This in turn would likely benefit Autodesk, which makes computer-aided design, or CAD, software for 3D printing as well as for other applications. If Local Motors' efforts help light a fire under the adoption of 3D printing for industrial applications, the entire size of the 3D printing industry could grow faster than projected. And estimates are already robust: Industry analyst Wohlers Associates expects that the global 3D printing industry will grow from $3.07 billion in 2013 to more than $21 billion by 2020; that's greater than a 31% compounded average annual growth rate.In this scenario, manufacturers of 3D printers and companies that provide 3D printing services for industrial applications could benefit to varying degrees. These companies include  ,  ,  ,  and  . (Materialise doesn't make 3D printers like the others; however, it does provide 3D printing services.)Granted, Cincinnati's BAAM machine could be looked upon as a competitive threat to the existing 3D printing players. However, for the near and intermediate terms, I think it's more likely than not that the introduction of BAAM to the scene will help the existing 3D printing companies more than it will hurt them. The target markets of Cincinnati Inc. and the existing players do not currently overlap, as Cincinnati is solely targeting large-scale 3D printing.Stratasys, in my opinion, could especially benefit from the increased use of 3D printing for both prototyping and short-run production applications in industrial settings. The 3D printing industry leader offers printers that can print in an impressive range of tough thermoplastics, well suited for various industrial applications. Unlike its main rival, 3D Systems, Stratasys currently doesn't sell systems that can print in metals, though I think it's just a matter of time until it does. Stratasys does, however, provide metal 3D printing services via its on-demand 3D printing services operation.I also think it's likely that Stratasys will eventually possess capabilities to print in carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics. Stratasys has been working with Oak Ridge National Lab since 2012 to develop FDM carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics. (FDM stands for \"fused deposition modeling,\" one of Stratasys' three 3D printing technologies.) Successfully infusing reinforcing fibers into plastic feedstock is widely considered a major key to scaling up 3D printing to produce large parts for automobile, aerospace, and other applications where strong but lightweight materials are needed. And, in fact, the Stratis that are being produced by Cincinnati's BAAM machine are largely being made using reinforced plastic. The proposed opening of the first factory to use 3D printing to produce vehicles is surely a positive for the 3D printing industry as a whole. It's too soon, however, to predict how the success of such an endeavor will affect the fortunes of the existing players. But I'll continue to follow the Local Motors' story and keep 3D printing investors abreast of new developments. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 41.18%. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 22.33%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We remain positive on Autodesk's long-term growth prospects as it is well-positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing through its comprehensive product portfolio. We expect its broad product portfolio to generate new customers in both domestic as well as overseas markets.Moreover, the increase in construction and manufacturing activities in the emerging markets present further growth opportunities. Additionally, a low channel inventory, increasing efficiencies through its channel partner framework, simplified upgrade pricing mechanism and electronic software delivery will help it to achieve long-term growth targets.Autodesk's uneven top-line growth in the recent past has made it over-dependent on cost saving programs to boost earnings. Although restructuring programs are corrective measures to realign cost, their success often depends on execution. We believe that there is a certain limit up to which costs can be curtailed; the company needs to invest to boost organic growth.However, foreign exchange fluctuations, increasing exposure to Europe and competition from the likes of Adobe Systems Inc. (  ) are the headwinds. Additionally, challenges in the form of customer concentration keep us on the sidelines.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Autodesk is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 11 cents. Hence, the difference is of 0.00%. Autodesk's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Best Buy Co., Inc. (  ), with an Earnings ESP of +4.17% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).GameStop Corp. (  ), with an Earnings ESP of +1.61% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

We believe Apple's strategic decision to collaborate with the Chinese payment system remains concurrent with its plans to penetrate further into one of the fastest-growing ecommerce markets.However, the news failed to satisfy the market and Apple's stock price fell 19 cents (0.8%) on Monday closing.The App Store remains one of the rapidly growing revenue drivers for Apple which accounted for $10 billion revenues in 2013. Further, the division in the reported quarter posted revenues of $4.6 billion up 8% year over year. In terms of China sales, App Store is rapidly gaining ground and China represents one of the biggest markets next to Japan. The App store sales remained strong this year and grew almost 20% in the second half of the year.We believe these tie ups will considerably resolve issues faced by customers while purchasing from the App Store in China. It will simplify the existing payment processing system, which requires a pre-paid bank account and an online banking password.Simplifying online transactions would not only boost App Store sales in China - Apple's second largest market for app downloads - but also increase the popularity of Apple products in the country, giving it an edge over domestic smartphone makers. Most importantly, the collaboration with China UnionPay will also help Apple promote its newly-launched Apple Pay. Notably, it has been reported that Apple is planning to tie up with e-Commerce giant, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (  ) to establish a payment system alliance.Though the iPhone maker already enjoys a substantial market share, its revenues from the Chinese market was somewhat marred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. While overall revenues increased 12.4% year over year, China's contribution dropped around 3%.The decline can be partly attributed to competition from domestic smartphones and the delayed launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owing to regulatory hurdles. However, the rapid growth in wireless infrastructure in China offers Apple an opportunity to counter competition given its brand power. Despite a subdued revenue growth, Apple garnered around 14% of its fourth-quarter revenues from this market.China UnionPay is a popular alternative to Visa (  ) and MasterCard (  ) in the Chinese market. It enjoys a quasi-monopolistic position in the payment processing business in the country given its extensive network in the urban as well as rural areas. Founded in 2002, the company rapidly expanded in the international market, spreading across 140 countries and has now issued 4.5 billion cards worldwide.This year, China UnionPay also debuted in Russia in collaboration with some major banks. Notably, Russia signifies an emerging market (1.6 million iPhones sold in 2013).Apple currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other well-performing stocks in the technology sector are Akamai Technologies, Inc.

(  ) reported third-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings of 13 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate quite convincingly.Driven by the robust third-quarter result, the company raised its fiscal 2015 guidance. Shares were up 3.56% ($2.08) in after-hours trading following the upgraded guidance.Revenues increased 11.3% year over year to $618.0 million, ahead of management's guided range of $590 to $605 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $603 million. Revenue contribution from the recent acquisition of Delcam was approximately $14 million.The year-over-year growth in revenues was primarily attributed to a 15.4% year-over-year jump in subscription revenues to $297.5 million. The improvement in subscription revenues came on the back of an increase in maintenance subscription revenues.License revenues increased 7.7% from the year-ago quarter to $320.5 million attributable to an increase in upgrade revenues.Total billings increased 25% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher license and subscription billings. Total maintenance, desktop (rental), and cloud subscriptions increased approximately 121,000 from the prior quarter, including approximately 25,000 subscriptions related to Delcam.Cloud-based PLM 360 billings registered robust growth. During the quarter, the company announced plans of introducing cloud-based data management to complement the existing cloud-based PLM.Segment wise, revenues from Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) increased 3% from the year-ago quarter to $188 million. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT contributed 27% of total revenues in the quarter.Revenues from the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segment surged 17% from the year-ago quarter to $217 million. Continued adoption of BIM in the building and infrastructure industries drove growth in AEC suites, which increased 23% from the year-ago quarter.Manufacturing revenues increased 1.2% on a year-over-year basis to $170 million. Autodesk's Media and Entertainment (M&E) segment declined 2.3% on a year over year basis to $43 million in the reported quarter.Revenue from Flagship products was $288 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue from Suites increased 13% on a year over year basis to $225 million. Revenue from New and Adjacent products rose 29% from the prior year quarter to $105 million in the third quarter.Geographically, revenues in the Americas increased 11% on a year-over-year basis to $231 million. EMEA revenues increased 17% to $238 million from the third quarter of last year. Revenues in APAC increased 5% from the year-ago quarter to $149 million. Revenues from emerging economies represented 15% of total revenue in the reported quarter.Gross margin (including stock-based compensation) contracted 170 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 88.2% in the reported quarter. The decline was primarily due to business model transition and higher cloud-based cost.Operating expenses (including stock-based compensation) increased 24.4% on a year-over-year basis to $507.9 million. The increase was primarily due to a rise in marketing & sales (up 20.5%), research and development (up 23.4%) and general and administrative expenses (up 41.4%) in the quarter.As a result, operating profit (including stock-based compensation) plunged 59% year over year to $37.2 million in the third quarter. Autodesk's profitability was negatively impacted by the ongoing business model transition, investment in cloud infrastructure and key initiatives and the dilutive effect of the Delcam acquisition.Net income (including stock-based compensation) was $29.5 million or 13 cents per share compared with $76.9 million or 34 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. However, earnings per share (EPS) declined approximately 62.3% from the year-ago quarter due to higher operating expenses.Autodesk exited the third quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $1.90 billion compared with $1.91 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $136 million compared with $96 million in the previous quarter.Deferred revenues increased 31% on a year-over-year basis to a record $1 billion at quarter end.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $640-$655 million while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $635 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 22 cents to 25 cents for the upcoming quarter. This is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents.For fiscal 2015, management expects net billings to grow in the range of 15% to 17% (up from 10% to 12%). Revenues are expected to increase 9% to 10% (up from 7% to 9%), while operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.5%.We remain positive on Autodesk's long-term growth prospects as it is well-positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing through its comprehensive product portfolio. We expect its broad product portfolio to generate new customers in both domestic as well as overseas markets.Moreover, the increase in construction and manufacturing activities in the emerging markets present further growth opportunities. Additionally, a low channel inventory, increasing efficiencies through its channel partner framework, simplified upgrade pricing mechanism and electronic software delivery will help it to achieve long-term growth targets.The company's focus on expanding its mobile applications for both Apple's (  ) iOS and Google's (  ) Android platforms would also drive market share, going forward.Autodesk's uneven top-line growth in the recent past has made it over-dependent on cost saving programs to boost earnings.

Here's what you should know about this still-in-the-lab technology that rivals a Houdini escape trick in the \"wow factor\" department.Stratasys' programmable materials can be coded to change properties when exposed to water. The pictured strand was programmed to spell \"MIT.\" Source: Stratasys. While the name might sound a bit intimidating, 4D printing is a simple concept. The fourth \"D\" -- or dimension -- refers to time, which means that 4D printing is 3D printing plus the variable element of time. In other words, 4D printing involves 3D-printing objects that can eventually do one or both of two things: self-assemble and/or change properties based upon certain conditions.The main name to know in 4D printing is Skylar Tibbits,director of the Self-Assembly Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who coined the term. Tibbits, a TED Fellow, introduced the topic of 4D printing when he presented at last year's TED conference. (TED stands for \"technology, entertainment, and design.\") Notably, MIT has early and deep roots in 3D printing.Two public companies --  and  -- are collaborating with Tibbits' MIT lab.The Self-Assembly Lab is using Stratasys' unique multimaterial Objet Connex 3D printing technology to print the materials that can self-assemble or change properties over time. These \"programmable materials\" were developed by Stratasys' researchers, and allow programmers to code for qualities that include color, transparency, stiffness, and flexibility.The big breakthrough came when researchers coded the materials for water absorption. This opened the door to exploring using low-cost \"environmental energy\" to complete the manufacturing process. Researchers can now code a material to change its properties in a certain way when exposed to water.Tibbits' research involves coding the material that comes off a 3D printer bed to change in specific ways when sprayed with water or dunked in a tank of water. His experiments involving strands of material squirming their way into certain shapes when exposed to water are reminiscent of the fun of Grow Monster toys -- but considerably higher-tech. The lab's long-term plan is to explore using other forms of environmental energy to transform products over time; water is simply the first step.Researchers are working with hybrid plastics, wood grains, textiles, and carbon fiber. Stratasys' proprietary programmable material is not yet commercially available.Autodesk's Cyborg software, which is under development, is being used to code the materials. This design platform has applications from the nano-scale to the human-scale. There are a host of benefits of 4D printing, but the high-level boons can be thought of as a ballooning of the main advantages of 3D printing: increased innovative possibilities and financial savings.A major value proposition of 3D printing is that it opens up innovative new design possibilities. That's because it's an additive manufacturing process that builds up a product layer by layer. It can be used to make products that can't be manufactured, or are cost-prohibitive to produce, using traditional subtractive techniques. Essentially, 4D printing blows open the design possibilities to an unfathomable extent, as it will allow designers to conceive of products that can change properties over time.Cost savings is another huge benefit of 3D printing, because the technology eliminates the need for tooling and uses less raw material than conventional manufacturing techniques. With 4D printing, the moneysaving possibilities could expand to gigantic proportions. Remember, in 4D printing an object is coming off a 3D printer bed before it is fully assembled. So 4D printing involves transferring a good part of the manufacturing process from one that is energy intensive to one that costs much less because it uses environmental energy. This energy savings would also hold true with objects transforming themselves over time based upon certain conditions. Currently, manufacturers spend significant amounts of money embedding products with sensors, electronics, and other means of sensing and reacting to various conditions. The basic idea behind 3D-printing an object that has the ability to transform itself over time is simple: Under certain circumstances, it would be desirable for an end product or component of a finished product to change shapes and/or other properties. These circumstances could involve conditions such as temperature, humidity, light/darkness, or pressure.Some examples include tires with treads that change shape to increase traction in wet or snowy weather; or a piece of wood furniture that becomes impermeable, or less permeable, when it senses humidity or water. Essentially, these products become \"smart.\" While 3D printing is surely an amazing technology in and of itself, the fact that it makes 4D printing a potential reality could very well turn out to be its greatest legacy.It seems that 4D printing has a strong potential of becoming reality at some point in time. However, even if this mind-blowing technology never makes the leap from laboratory to commercialization, investors in Stratasys and Autodesk should be pleased that their companies are at the forefront of exploring new technologies that might emerge from -- or are related to -- 3D printing.

Innovative product portfolio, strong return of approximately 24% over the last one year on improving results and positive outlook make Autodesk an attractive investment opportunity.Autodesk continues to invest in expanding its product portfolio that now includes new functionalities like composite analysis technology for its simulation offering. As a result, the company is seeing greater penetration in industries like aerospace and automotive.Moreover, the company's focus on expanding its mobile applications for both iOS and Android platform will further drive market share despite stiff competition.We believe that Autodesk's new cloud-based offerings are gaining traction. The ongoing transition from license-based to subscription-based business model will boost the company's profitability in the long run.In its recent investor day, Autodesk reiterated the third-quarter and fiscal 2015 outlook. For the third quarter, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $590-$605 million. Non-GAAP earnings are expected in the range of 17 to 23 cents for the quarter.For fiscal 2015, management expects net billings to grow in the range of 10% to 12% (up from 7% to 9%). Revenues are expected to increase 7% to 9% (up from 4% to 6%), while operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is expected in the range of 15% to 16% (up from 14% to 16%).Autodesk believes that the momentum from the BIM product portfolio will help it to penetrate the $7.0 trillion construction market fast. Apart from industries like aerospace and automotive, we believe that Autodesk has significant growth opportunities in the AEC and manufacturing markets due to its innovative product pipeline, going forward.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2015 has remained stable at 71 cents per share over the last 30 days.

Poor employee morale could become problematic for 3D Systems in terms of attracting and retaining talent longer term, which could lead to unfavorable long-term stock performance.The book  explored the relationship between high employee satisfaction rates and a company's stock performance, and found a strong connection between the two. Between 1997 and 2011, companies that appeared on  \"100 Best Companies to Work For\" list in the U.S. significantly outperformed the overall stock market. During the 14-year period,  's  100 Best earned an average return of 10.32% per year while the S&P 500 returned 3.71% per year. For an even deeper understanding of how a strong work culture affects a company's stock financial performance, head over to the  , which produces  's 100 Best list behind-the-scenes.  Having acquired nearly 50 companies in the last three years, 3D Systems is challenged to integrate different work cultures into one streamlined operation. However, it seems the company's  could be creating a work environment in which employees of companies that were acquired by 3D Systems are at risk of becoming disengaged. Here's  take:Although it'd be difficult to determine the impact of an uninspired workforce companywide, it's easy to see that disengaged employees could affect 3D Systems in terms of lost productivity and higher employee turnover rates. For investors, a weak employee culture could become a liability that doesn't show up on the balance sheet, but could still negatively impact operating results longer term. Some 3D Systems Glassdoor reviews expressed that the company doesn't offer a solid work-life balance because management regularly expects employees to work well beyond 40 hours per week. This critique comes at a time when the company has chosen to  in the backdrop of an industry that's  by more than 580% between 2013 and 2020. Putting the two together, it isn't necessarily surprising to learn that some employees aren't pleased with the company's fast-paced and demanding work environment.Arguably, the window of opportunity for 3D Systems to gain significant market share and solidify its positioning as the  3D printing company in the industry may be limited to only a few years, and some employees may be frustrated that they're bearing the brunt of its aggressive strategy. Still, it's extremely important for 3D Systems' management to get its employees and its business objectives in sync longer term, because its employees will play a major role in contributing to the company's long-term performance.However, with an appalling 15% approval rating on Glassdoor.com, based on 28 reviews 3D Systems CEO Avi Reichental, who ranks bottom-of-the-barrel compared to the CEOs of the company's 3D printing peers, may have a difficult time conveying the need for this unity to employees.\n  \n If 3D Systems is dealing with a potential culture crisis, it could indicate that the company's strategy of acquiring other businesses to grow its market opportunity may be flawed, and management would have to make great efforts to address any underlying issues it has with its culture -- especially around how it integrates acquisitions. Additionally, the longer these potential issues go unaddressed, the greater the risk that 3D Systems could tarnish its ability to attract top talent.Judging by this small collection of Glassdoor reviews, it seems that 3D Systems has an opportunity to improve in this area. Although it's too early to declare that there's a full-blown culture crisis under way at 3D Systems, it's definitely something I'll be monitoring going forward.

Sure, it's going to be big... but how big?TJ McCue decided to hop into an RV and find out. He's in the middle of an eight-month road trip around the U.S., stopping more than 100 times along the way to see how American businesses -- and individuals -- are putting 3D technology to use.Among the findings on his 3DRV tour: We'll all soon be able to print out a full-size T-Rex dinosaur, and charge our cell phones with our shoes.Our roving reporter Rex Moore caught up with TJ in Washington, D.C., to hear more about this crazy journey. \"Made in China\" -- an all too familiar phrase. But not for much longer: There's a radical new technology out there, one that's already being employed by the U.S. Air Force, BMW and even Nike. Respected publications like  have compared this disruptive invention to the steam engine and the printing press;  calls it \"the next trillion dollar industry.\" Watch The Motley Fool's  to learn about the next great wave of technological innovation, one that will bring an end to \"Made in China\" for good.  ! TJ McCue is living the dream... if the dream is to travel the country and live out of an RV for eight months. But,  do the same thing if I had the chance. The big idea is go around and meet the people who are doing cool stuff with 3D technology, from 3D design software to 3D scanning to 3D printing. TJ is a seasoned tech journalist and entrepreneur, and a 3D enthusiast. His journey started in San Rafael, California, in mid-May at  headquarters -- the main sponsor of his tour. Along the way, he's driven a virtual Ford Mustang and seen 3D-mapping drones flying in Toledo. He's also done his own laser scans of buildings and monuments. And it's sort of a preservation thing. We give them the file, and they can put it up like  street view on their website. So your consumer, your visitor, can go in and see that on their own. Today, I'm hanging out with TJ at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in Washington. A group called the \"laser cowboys\" from the Smithsonian's 3D Digitization program is scanning the bones of a Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur. One of the outcomes we want to see from this project is to be able to make each individual bone downloadable at home. So this means classrooms and enthusiasts are going to have access to the exact same data sets that scientists at the Smithsonian have access to. What we're looking at here is a T-Rex humerus. This is an arm bone, and it's actually about the same size as an adult arm bone. So this is a really cool way to relate to an enormous creature from millions of years ago. This is something that we can now hold in our hands. Anyone can download these files and print them themselves. Actual T-Rex bones -- scanned and 3-D printed. Just another stop on TJ's unforgettable tour. It's really awesome and amazing to see what people are doing. If you give people tools -- there's so many low-cost and free tools now -- they iterate on an idea or design and come up with fantastic things. One of the teams that I met, in Pittsburgh, SolePower Tech, came up with the idea to create an insole for your shoe that charges your cellphone battery while you walk. Here in the U.S. not big deal, but if you get outside the U.S., 5 million don't have power in their homes. So they've got to walk somewhere to charge. These guys just solved that equation. An insole can't be that expensive for most people, and it can charge your phone battery for you. We've seen some amazing stuff so far, but one of the biggest questions for investors is how big will 3D printing be in the  market? I've personally seen the 3D section at CES -- the world's largest consumer electronics show -- explode over the last couple of years, and it will double again in size for this January's show.But is this just wishful thinking from the industry, or a real indicator of the future of the consumer market? When I started, I was really skeptical that a 3D printer in the home was a good idea, but now that I've met lots of people and talked to them and seen the lightbulb go off, absolutely. I think it's for the kids and grandkids, you want them to think in 3D. You want them to know they can use these tools and get proficient. It's $200-$300 to get a 3D printer, and it gives you the opportunity to mess around with your kids and grandkids and create something, and it starts a younger mind thinking about what you can do in 3D. That's the big shift. I don't think it's so you can print toys and trinkets in your home, or everything that breaks. I think there's an opportunity within 3D-thinking to be had by having a small, inexpensive printer in your house. And so... at about the halfway point of his journey, TJ is on the road again, heading to Civil War battlefields, national parks and monuments, even the Grand Ole Opry. He winds it all up in mid-December, back in California.

However, earnings per share (EPS) declined approximately 40% from the year-ago quarter due to higher operating expenses.Nonetheless, Autodesk raised its fiscal 2015 guidance. As a result, share prices increased 5.72% to $59.50 in after-hour trading.Revenues increased 13% year over year to $637.0 million, ahead of management's guided range of $595 to $610 million, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $596.0 million. Recently acquired Delcam contributed $11 million in revenues.Backlog increased by $24 million year over year in the reported quarter. Total billings increased 27% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher license and subscription billings (up 31%). Total subscriptions increased almost 74K on a sequential basis.The year-over-year growth in revenues was primarily attributed to a 15.4% year-over-year jump in subscription revenues to $286.7 million. The improvement in subscription revenues came on the back of an increase in maintenance subscription revenues.License revenues increased 11.9% from the year-ago quarter to $350.4 million attributable to an increase in upgrade revenues.Cloud-based PLM 360 billings almost doubled on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, Autodesk launched the PLM 360 mobile application.Segment wise, revenues from Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) increased 5% from the year-ago quarter to $208 million. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenues increased 8% on a year-over-year basis to $186 million. Revenue from PSEB suites declined 21% year over year, primarily due to a decrease in educational suites.Revenues from the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segment surged 23% from the year-ago quarter to $218 million. Continued adoption of BIM in the building and infrastructure industries drove growth in AEC suites, which increased 40% from the year-ago quarter.Manufacturing revenues increased 17% on a year-over-year basis to $168 million. Revenues from manufacturing suites increased 9% from the year-ago quarter.Autodesk's Media and Entertainment (M&E) segment remained flat year over year at $44 million. Revenue from Animation products decreased 2% year over year, while revenue from Creative Finishing increased 7% from the year-ago quarter.Autodesk reported a 20% year-over-year jump in revenues from Suites (36% of revenues). Revenues from flagship products increased 6% year over year. Revenues from new and adjacent products surged 24% on a year-over-year basis.Geographically, revenues in the Americas increased 11% on a year-over-year basis to $223 million. EMEA revenues increased 21% to $244 million from the second quarter of last year. Revenues in APAC increased 8% to $170 million from the year-ago quarter. Revenues from emerging economies increased 14% to $98 million on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin (including stock-based compensation) contracted 130 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 88.8% in the reported quarter. The decline was primarily due to business model transition and higher cloud-based cost.Operating expenses (including stock-based compensation) increased 22.3% on a year-over-year basis to $488.4 million. The increase was primarily due to the rise in marketing & sales (19.9%), research and development (20.4%) and general and administrative expenses (36.7%) in the quarter.As a result, operating profit (including stock-based compensation) plunged 28.7% year over year to $75.3 million. Autodesk's profitability was negatively impacted by the ongoing business model transition, investment in cloud infrastructure and key initiatives and the dilutive effect of the Delcam acquisition.Net income (including stock-based compensation) was $51 million or 21 cents per share compared with $78.8 million or 35 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk exited the second quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $1.91 billion compared with $2.12 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $96 million compared with $219 million in the previous quarter.Deferred revenues increased 22% on a year-over-year basis to a record $981 million at quarter end.For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $590-$605 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 17 cents to 23 cents for the upcoming quarter. This is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents.For fiscal 2015, management expects net billings to grow in the range of 10% to 12% (up from 7% to 9%). Revenues are expected to increase 7% to 9% (up from 4% to 6%), while operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is expected to be in the range of 15% to 16% (up from 14.0% to 16.0%).Autodesk's second-quarter results reflect an improving demand environment in the AEC market. We believe that the company will have significant growth opportunities in the AEC and manufacturing markets in the long run.Autodesk believes that the momentum from the BIM product portfolio will help it to penetrate the $7.0 trillion construction market fast. We believe that Autodesk's new cloud-based offerings are gaining traction. Moreover, the business transition will boost the company's top line and profitability in the long run.The company's focus on expanding its mobile applications for both Apple's (  ) iOS and Google's (  ) Android platforms would also drive market share, going forward.However, increasing competition from Adobe (  ) is a concern. Continued investments in new products might also hurt margins in the near term.Currently, Autodesk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The investment thesis is simple: As long as the global population grows, so will the need for infrastructure. With that said, it's a broad sector, and growth rates are likely to vary across elements of it. In addition, it's a highly cyclical industry that requires specialized knowledge within its individual segments. It's time to take a closer look at how you might invest in construction and engineering.Source: Motley Fool Flickr Account In a nutshell, it's the architecture of life. Wherever communities are growing, they will need public infrastructure, churches, military infrastructure, water and wastewater treatment works, ports, energy infrastructure, roads, bridges, dams, airports, bus stations, residential and non-residential buildings...While the immediate investor focus will fall on the traditional engineering companies undertaking construction activity, like  and  , increasingly it includes technology companies that are servicing the sector. For example,  's AutoCAD is used in engineering design. The product lifecycle management software of  and the U.K.'s  allows engineering firms to manage and model a project's lifecycle from design to completion. What's the benefit? When operators take over a completed power plant, for example, they can learn about it in great detail by looking at the 3-D model of the plant beforehand. This helps reduce any potential downtime in starting operations. According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers' \"Global Construction 2025\" report, \"[T]he volume of construction output will grow by more than 70% to $15 trillion worldwide by 2025.\" China, India, and the U.S. together are expected to contribute 60% of all global growth, but Western Europe's construction market is expected to decline by 5%.This suggests that exposure to emerging markets, which is expected to make up 63% of construction activity by 2025, according to PwC, and the types of infrastructure those markets will need to build, is of critical importance to your stock selection.Source: Motley Fool Flickr Account A typical construction and engineering project will involve four main parties. An engineering consultant or technical services company like  or  will design the project for a client. Once that's done, the client will put work out for tender, and then hire an engineering contractor like  to undertake construction. A project manager will also be hired to oversee the contractor's work, and liaise with the consultant on the client's behalf.One feature of the industry is the tendency for cost overruns to occur. For example, China's Three Gorges Dam was estimated to cost $8.4 billion at the time of approval, but the eventual figure was closer to $37 billion. Cost overruns can cause complications for engineering companies, and arbitration and legal actions are not uncommon in the industry. Furthermore, foul play is also part of the industry, with two-thirds of engineering and construction CEOs surveyed by PwC expressing a concern that bribery and corruption could slow growth.As discussed above, the key driver is likely to be emerging market growth, and a combination of an increasing population and urbanization. In particular, public spending on infrastructure within emerging markets is likely to guide growth. Emerging market growth has its own demand drivers, with an area like water resources -- where a consultancy like  is well placed -- is likely to see good growth in future years.Within developed markets, you should also consider that the defense industry is traditionally an important factor in the construction and engineering industry. In addition, new residential construction tends to lead to new construction investment as infrastructure is built up around the new community.All told, the sector looks set for long-term growth -- but don't expect a smooth ride. It's still a cyclical industry with its own risks. For example, in an upturn, consultants tend to hire lots of new, highly specialized staff in order to service the work. Unfortunately, when a downturn hits, their margins take a hit, as some of their employees are unproductive due to lack of work. Similarly, when contracting work dries up, contractors may have to decrease the prices they charge in order to secure work, and their margins take a hit accordingly. It's a cyclical industry, but the long-term trend looks positive for investors. The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their non-dividend paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute. They also know that a well-constructed dividend portfolio creates wealth steadily, while still allowing you to sleep like a baby. Knowing how valuable such a portfolio might be, our top analysts put together a  that should be in any income investor's portfolio.

Instead, NQ Mobile appointed Marcum Bernstein Pinchul LLP (MBP) as the new auditor for fiscal 2013 and subsequent periods.NQ Mobile shares fell as much as 21.0% to hit a 52-week low of $3.45 on July 18, 2014. However, the stock rebounded 15.2% to close the day at $5.01.PwC's dismissal came after NQ Mobile management decided that it will be difficult for the company to comply with the auditor's request of expanding its scope in the operations going forward.Expanding PwC's scope in operations would have resulted in delaying filing of its 2013 Annual Report, as the auditor had asked for certain third-party related information, which would have been difficult for the company to obtain. However, NQ Mobile insisted that there was no disagreement with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or otherwise.We believe that the dismissal of PwC at such a crucial time may adversely impact investor confidence, which will remain an overhang on the stock. In such a scenario, speeding up of Annual Report filing will be a major positive that will revive trust among investors.Of late, the company has been facing headwinds related to its corporate governance practices. NQ Mobile recently responded to a Muddy Waters' research report dated Jul 7, 2014, which accused the company of being a \"massive fraud\" with at least 72.0% of its 2012 China security revenue fictitiously coming from a shell company called Yidatong, which was actually owned by NQ itself.Moreover, NQ Mobile was also accused of concealing important information from public including the stepping down of the head of the company's audit committee, Ying Han.NQ Mobile responded to these accusations by conducting an independent investigation. This investigation was conducted by a Special Committee comprising four of its independent directors along with two renowned firms, Shearman & Sterling LLP and Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services Limited. The aim of the investigation was to determine whether NQ Mobile had resorted to any unfair means or not.The results of the investigation were revealed to the public soon after it was over. Per the investigation, NQ Mobile had submitted all material information within the stipulated timeframe as well as in full compliance with all Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.Hence, the Committee concluded that no fraudulent practice had been adopted by NQ Mobile. However, in this case PwC refrained from commenting.NQ Mobile reported mixed fourth-quarter results.

Notably, the acquisition of Desktone by VMware will enable the company to offer DaaS through its Cloud Hybrid Service. Moreover, Citrix's desktop platform faces competition from VMware's View product and Oracle's broad virtualization stack. Furthermore, as the company forays into different markets, it will be exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risks.Citrix provides software and equipment for streamlining business computer systems. The demand for its products and services significantly depends on the general demand for business-related computer appliances and software. Fluctuations in the demand for these products and services could have an adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition.The global economy is still suffering from fluctuation and has not come out of the woods completely. Various geo-political concerns in the European and African countries have limited the momentum of economic recovery. This could make Citrix's near-term financials volatile. Any adverse macroeconomic situation may result in the slowdown of enterprise IT spending. Hence, the desktop virtualization market may turn out to be less booming and Citrix may lose its market share sooner than expected.During the reported quarter, geographically, total net revenue fell 4.4% from the past quarter. At present, Citrix is facing two main problems, namely the continuation of global macroeconomic headwinds limiting the momentum of new license sales and secondly, the rising demand for tablets instead of PCs or notebooks. As per Gartner Research firm, sale of Pcs is expected to decline in the coming years and will lag behind tablet sales by the end of 2015.For the current quarter, in the past 90 days, there has been downward movement in the earnings estimates.

Also, the company reported strong first-quarter 2014 financial results with both the top and the bottom line outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The desktop virtualization market is expected to accelerate in the near future. Currently, server virtualization has an addressable market size of approximately 35 million servers worldwide whereas desktop virtualization has the potential to impact more than 600 million desktop users in corporate environments alone.Citrix is continuously introducing innovative products that will facilitate business flexibility, security and centralized management system. In order to counter installation difficulties, Citrix has launched XenDesktop 7.5 suites. XenDesktop 7.5 is a cloud-ready platform that allows easy access of Windows apps and desktops from any console. At present, it is one of the most popular products with 360,000 users and has witnessed 50% year-over-year growth in demand. Moreover, an aggressive sales force for the XenMobile business has already created a $300 million pipeline for 2014.With Cloud.com in its kitty, Citrix is now comfortably placed on par with the cloud computing software leader, VMware. Citrix has also become a strong competitor for  's (  ) web services software and  's (  ) Windows Azure software. Separately, Citrix has teamed up with VMware to install NetScaler programs in networks allowing cloud administrators to incorporate program-based NetScaler services into application-based datacenters built on the latter's virtualization platform.

Kinect 2.0 is available for pre-order now in Microsoft stores and will hit the markets for sale on Jul 15 at $199. Kinect was originally launched as part of Microsoft's Xbox gaming console.The PC-compatible Kinect costs twice as much as the console Kinect. The device works with the Kinect for Windows Software Development Kit 2.0 and requires a license for non-commercial purposes.The Kinect for PCs is a productivity tool, with which Microsoft expects to attract more developers. It will allow them to experiment with the sensor's functionality and explore what the peripheral can offer for their Windows applications with reduced latency. With improved technology, it will enable developers to access a high level of control and broader range of apps.The Kinect for Xbox 360 is designed to boost the experience of gamers. It is basically an advanced webcam packed in a box that allows users to control and interact with their console or computer through gestures and commands. Therefore, it allows gamers to utilize Kinect's interactive motion-sensor tools to play games without a controller.Kinect 2.0 is more or less similar to its gaming console counterpart. The product features a higher reliability 1080p camera, microphone, wider field of view, new active incorporated infrared, improved motion sensor system with the ability to identify individual users and improved skeletal tracking.Kinect was also incorporated as part of Microsoft's latest Xbox One gadget. But last month Microsoft declared that the Xbox One gaming console would be available without Kinect, following lower demand for the peripheral. Xbox One users were previously compelled to buy an extra accessory for the system, which made the console more expensive than Sony's new device.

The Americas (36.8% of revenues) and Europe (63.2% of revenues) increased 8.0% and 10.3% year over year, respectively.The year-over-year growth in the Americas was primarily driven by strong growth in the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. results were aided by robust performance from small and medium size business and strong growth in the education, federal and healthcare segments.Although, Tech Data will benefit from stabilization in personal computers through the rest of 2014, we believe that the company's growing exposure to volatile European markets remains a concern. Moreover, Tech Data's back-end loaded guidance will remain a headwind in the near term.Recently, Gartner revised down its IT spending forecast to 2.1% from 2.8%.

Both revenues of $637 million and earnings of $0.21 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company provided an upbeat guidance for the third quarter. We believe that increasing competition from the likes of Adobe pose a major concern for the company. Moreover, increasing investment in new products is expected to hurt margins in the near term. However, we believe that the company has significant growth opportunities in the AEC and manufacturing markets going forward. Further, the business transition to cloud-based offerings will boost its profitability in the long run. Additionally, its efforts to expand its mobile applications for iOS as well as Android platforms will drive growth going forward. Thus, we upgrade ADSK shares to Outperform and set a target price target of $71.00.San Rafael, CA.-based Autodesk (ADSK) develops model-based design, engineering and documentation software and also offers consulting, support and training services.

(Symbol: ADSK) has taken over the #355 spot from NRG Energy Inc (Symbol: NRG), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Autodesk Inc. (Symbol: ADSK), the market cap is now $10.64 billion, versus NRG Energy Inc (Symbol: NRG) at $10.53 billion.Below is a chart of Autodesk Inc. versus NRG Energy Inc plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (ADSK plotted in blue; NRG plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ADSK vs. NRG:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.At the closing bell, ADSK is up about 2.2%, while NRG is up about 1.1% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n early trading on Monday, shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (  ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 2.4%.

The company's fourth-quarter results were negatively impacted by business model transition toward subscription revenues, it announced late fiscal 2014.Revenues decreased 3.3% year over year to $586.6 million, which were ahead of management's guided range of $560.0 to $580.0 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $572.0 million. Backlog was $20.0 million, flat on a year-over-year basis.Revenues exclude $30.0 million related to business model transition, as Autodesk recognized revenues ratably instead of up front payment. Wider variety of pricing also hurt revenue growth.The year-over-year decline was primarily attributed to lower license and other revenues, which declined 12.1% year over year to $320.7 million. Subscription revenues increased 9.8% from the year-ago quarter to $265.9 million. Net subscription billings increased 2.0% year over year in the last quarter.Segment-wise, revenues from the Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) were almost flat on a year-over-year basis at $196.0 million. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenues increased a modest 1.0% to $171.0 million. AutoCAD's weak performance reflects continuing migration of customers to the company's Design and Creation suites.Revenues from the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segment decreased 5.8% from the year-ago quarter to $196.0 million, due to the negative impact of business model transition.In the quarter, Autodesk booked more than 20 BIM-360 transactions worth over $100K including two new transactions worth over $1.0 million each.Manufacturing revenues decreased modestly on a year-over-year basis to $154.0 million. Autodesk continues to win new deals in industrial machinery, consumer products and automotive. The company launched Fusion 360 a cloud-based CAD tool for mechanical and industrial designers during the quarter.PLM 360 product continues to attract new customers as is evident from the fact that 25.0% of last quarter customers were first timers for Autodesk. The recent acquisition of CAM technology provider Delcam is further expected to expand the company's market share in manufacturing process.Autodesk's Media and Entertainment segment recorded a revenue decline of 12.8% year over year to $41.0 million. Animation products revenues (includes Maya, 3ds Max, and Entertainment Creation Suites) decreased 5.0% year over year, while Creative Finishing revenues decreased 28.0 % from the year-ago quarter.Media and Entertainment segment suffered from lower end-market demand. The company also moved some products in other Autodesk industry suites, which hurt revenues in the last quarter.Although Autodesk reported 15.0% jump in revenues from Suites (37.0% of revenues), revenues from its flagship products were down 13.0% year over year. Revenues from new and adjacent products decreased 6.0% on a year-over-year basis.Geographically, revenues from Americas and Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) revenues decreased 6.3% and 3.8%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter, while Asia-Pacific revenues increased 1.4%.Revenues from emerging economies, which represented 15.0% of consolidated revenues, were up 5.0% on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin (including stock-based compensation) contracted 180 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to business model transition and higher cloud-based cost.Operating expenses (including stock-based compensation) as a percentage of revenues expanded 370 bps on a year-over-year basis to 76.3% in the quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher marketing & sales (up 70 bps) and research and development expenses (up 310 bps), which fully offset higher general and administrative expense (down 60 bps) in the quarter.Operating margin (including stock-based compensation) contracted 530 bps from the year-ago quarter to 16.5%, primarily due to lower revenues and gross margin base.Net income (including stock-based compensation) was $66.5 million or 29 cents per share compared with $91.0 million or 40 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents.Autodesk exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $2.27 billion compared with $2.48 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $184.0 million compared with $90.6 million in the previous quarter.Deferred revenues increased 8.0% to a record $901.0 million at the end of fiscal 2014.For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $560.0-$575.0 million. Earnings (excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges) are expected in the range of 19 to 22 cents for the upcoming quarter. This is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents.Management expects net billings to grow in the range of 5.0% to 8.0% for fiscal 2015. Net new subscription additions are expected to be in the range of 150K to 200K for the full year. Revenues are expected to increase 3.0% to 5.0%, while operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is expected to be in the range of 14.0% to 16.0%.Management reiterated long-term guidance that includes 12% billing CAGR, 20% more annual value from new and existing subscriptions, and a 50% increase in subscriptions. Autodesk expects operating margin of 30.0% by the end of fiscal 2018.Autodesk's fourth-quarter result reflects improving demand environment in the AEC market. We believe the company has significant growth opportunities in the AEC and manufacturing markets, going forward.Autodesk believes that the momentum from the BIM product portfolio will help it to faster penetrate the $7.0 trillion construction market. We believe Autodesk's new cloud-based offerings are gaining traction. Moreover, the business transition will boost the company's profitability, going forward.Moreover, the company's focus on expanding its mobile applications for both  's (  ) iOS and  's (  ) Android platform will further drive market share, going forward.However, sluggish macro-economic environment, weakness in emerging markets, customer concentration and increasing competition from  (  ) are the major concerns.

The upgrade came on the back of positive estimate revisions over the last 30 days. Akamai also delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.2%.Upbeat fourth quarter results contributed to the upgrade. The outperformance was driven by a stronger-than-expected growth in revenues and earnings per share. Also, the speculation that had been going on for some time regarding whether  (  ) would develop a CDN of its own has been put to rest as per Bloomberg reports.Akamai reported fourth quarter earnings of 55 cents per share, which increased 10.0% on both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. Revenues jumped 15.4% year over year and 10.2% quarter over quarter to $436.0 million, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $422.0 million.Revenues were higher than management's guided range of $412.0 to $430.0 million. The strong growth in revenues was primarily driven by robust performance of most of the categories and regions.Akamai expects revenues for the first quarter of 2014 to be in the range of $426.0 million and $440.0 million. The company expects gross margin (excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization) to remain flat sequentially at 78.0%. Operating expenses are projected to be in the range of $145.0 to $150.0 million.Earnings are expected to be between 51 cents and 55 cents per share, including tax charge of $48.0 to $52.0 million. Akamai forecasts capital expenditure to be in the range of $72.0 to $77.0 million for the first quarter.Over the last 30 days, Akamai witnessed three upward revisions for the current quarter and four upward revisions for fiscal 2014. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter went up by a penny to 41 cents per share while the same for fiscal 2014 went up by 4 cents to $1.80 per share.The long-term expected earnings growth rate for Akamai is 13.9%.Other players in the industry, which look attractive at current levels include  (  ) and  (  ), both with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ith its fourth-quarter 2013 operating earnings of 30 cents per share exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.3%,  (  ) delivered five straight quarters of positive surprises. The result also outpaced the year-ago quarter's earnings by 18.5%.The company's GAAP earnings for the quarter were 26 cents a share compared with earnings of 7 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.For 2013, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.20 a share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 and reflecting an increase of 39.5% year over year.The income was driven by the company's continued efforts to optimize its products. Further, Blackbaud is persistently pursuing innovation to efficiently cater to the increasing demand for subscription and cloud-based products and services in the non-profit industry.Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $134.9 million, up 12.3% from $120.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $132 million.For full-year 2013, the company reported revenues of $503.8 million, an increase of 12.6% year over year.The top line was primarily driven by strong performances of the company's enterprise and general markets businesses, both of which grew in double digits in the quarter.Blackbaud reported its non-GAAP operating income of $25.1 million for the quarter, an increase of 12.7% compared with $22.3 million in the prior-year quarter.The company's total general and administrative expense declined to $1.6 million from $1.7 million in the prior-year quarter. Research and Development (R&D) expense was $0.8 million, a decline from $1.1 million in the prior-year quarter.Exiting the year, cash and cash equivalents were $11.9 million, down from $13.5 million as of Dec 31, 2012. Free cash flow for the quarter was $29.3 million, while cash from operating activities was $107.2 million. In the quarter, the company also disbursed $5.6 million as dividends to stockholders.Along with the earnings release, the company also announced a quarterly dividend of 12 cents a share that has been approved to be disbursed on Mar 14 to stockholders of record as of Feb 28.The company expects to leverage its growth potential further by focusing on its operational investments in 2014. This is expected to enhance Blackbaud's competitive advantage while making it more efficient in the long run.Blackbaud currently carries a Rank #3 (Hold).

Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  (  ), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in SSNI.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 3 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 86 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 49 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Silver Spring has seen 1 downward estimate revision versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 6 cents a share from 15 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 26.4% in the past month.So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the computer network sector, you may instead consider some better-ranked stocks including  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

The company has significant growth opportunities in the AEC and manufacturing markets going forward.Autodesk believes that the momentum from the BIM product portfolio will help it to penetrate the construction industry faster, which is a $7.0 trillion market. We believe that Autodesk's new cloud-based offerings are gaining traction.Moreover, the company's focus on expanding its mobile applications for both Apple's iOS and Google's Android platform will further drive market share, going forward.However, a sluggish macro-economic environment, weakness in emerging markets, customer concentration and increasing competition from Adobe Systems Inc. are the major concerns. Moreover, continued investments in new products are expected to hurt margins in the near term.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Autodesk is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 21 cents. Hence, the difference is of 0.0%. Autodesk's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

The acquisition is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. However, financial details of the transaction were not divulged.Autodesk has always adopted an aggressive acquisition strategy to develop its business over the last couple of years. The company acquired four companies and nine business combination and technology units during fiscal 2013, for a total of $273.3 million.The company continues to expand its product portfolio through the acquisition of small start-ups that are easy to integrate into its own business line. We believe that Autodesk will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions in order to expand its offerings over the long term.Although acquisitions are good for the company but it will take considerable amount of time for the company to gain from these acquisitions. We are concerned about the decline in the top line.Revenues declined for the second straight quarter (down 1.2% in the second quarter), primarily due to a downturn in some of the company's end markets, which negatively impacted the company's products like AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT in the quarter.In spite of considerable efforts, the company is witnessing revenue decline in the different geographical regions. The global markets have not fully recovered from the great recession. Most of them, particularly Southern and Central Europe, emerging economies and BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries, continue to suffer from volatile macro-economic conditions.We believe that this will remain a major headwind over the next couple of years.

These customers use Autodesk software to design, visualize, and simulate their ideas before they're ever built or created.But the shifting sands of technology -- both the company's and customers' access to it -- have been creating some headwinds for this pioneer.Two weeks ago, Autodesk (ADSK) reported fiscal second-quarter 2014 non-GAAP earnings that beat consensus. But the reaction among investors and analysts since has been mixed and the stock recently fell to a Zacks #5 Rank Strong Sell due to steeply falling EPS estimates, as the following chart displays...While Autodesk's competitors sell advanced software for upwards of $10,000, AutoCAD sells for only about $4,000, maintaining its foothold as the de facto standard with 85% market share. The software's price means AutoCAD is the only option for smaller firms -- a market the company's competitors have only recently begun to target as we will see in a moment.Autodesk has grown revenues since the recession by convincing customers to switch to a subscription model for AutoCAD software. In this model, customers get automatic updates and new features in exchange for a recurring fee. The model is much more profitable for Autodesk -- only 22% of Autodesk's customers buy software in this way, but they account for nearly half of the revenues.But this transition was recently modified to include a move to offer more rental and usage-based pricing options. And this gave the company a lack of financial visibility, causing them to withdraw revenue and profit guidance for the next several quarters -- which of course left analysts no choice but to take their estimates down.The news isn't all bad. It's really about how the company is altering strategy and responding to the shifting sands of technology, customer needs, and the competition.According to WikiInvest, \"Autodesk is trying to increase the adoption of 'next generation' 3D software products as compared to the 2D market. It recognizes that the 3-D segment would be a key driver for growth for the company in the future. This would definitely provide Autodesk with the opportunity to up-sell its massive 2-D installed base into higher average sales price (ASP) 3-D software and to boost growth.\"The \"3-D printing\" and design industry has become front-page news thanks to innovative companies like  (DDD) and  (SSYS). You could say these guys have put the CAM back in CAD/CAM with \"additive manufacturing\" techniques which use constructive polymers to \"assemble\" new products, almost a molecule at a time.And Autodesk not only must answer these innovation calls, they could see challenges to their own turf. 3D Systems recently acquired the cloud-based collaboration software Relevant Products/Services portal, TeamPlatform. This acquisition will help DDD in attracting architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) customers engaged in computer-aided design (CAD) and other 3D projects.ADSK also faces competition in its conventional markets from UGS (Siemens) who is offering its 2-D software very competitively online.Again from WikiInvest, \"UGS has indicated that there have been over 33,000 downloads of the Solid Edge 2-D drafting tool in the four months since its introduction. While the number of downloads does not pose any major threat, UGS's decision reflects a belief by some that basic 2-D tools will become commoditized and could be given away for free in an effort to help drive 3-D adoption.\"Recent optimistic comments by analysts at Wedbush Securities confirm that Autodesk is still a force to be reckoned with in its home markets, even as it reinvents itself. They view the acceleration of ADSK's model change as a net positive, and even though they had to lower estimates into next year, they maintain their Outperform rating and 12-month price target of $43.But until the earnings estimates stabilize and begin to rise, it might be best to stay on the sidelines because the stock will probably only get cheaper. Until then, investors interested in the future of Autodesk might want to check out the upcoming Inside 3D Printing Conference & Expo in San Jose, California on September 17-18.Joining Avi Reichental, President & CEO of 3D Systems, and S. Scott Crump, Founder of Stratasys, will be Carl Bass, President & CEO of Autodesk, to deliver one of the conference's three keynote addresses. His future vision of the company might have a multidimensional effect on both investors and analysts.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) reported fiscal second-quarter 2014 non-GAAP earnings of 35 cents, which decreased 8.4% from the year-ago quarter and was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents.Revenues for the quarter decreased 1.2% year over year to $561.7 million, but just managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $561.0 million. Revenues were adversely affected by a downturn in some of the company's end markets, which negatively impacted the company's products like AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT in the quarter.However, the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segment performed well. Region wise, Americas and Asia-Pacific (APAC) posted strong growth, particularly Japan.Segment wise, revenues from the Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (\"PSEB\") were down 9% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues from the AEC and Manufacturing business segments increased 9% and 2% respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Autodesk's Media and Entertainment segment recorded a revenue decline of 11% year over year. Though, Autodesk reported an 18% increase in revenues from Suites, revenues from its Flagship products were down 11% year over year.Geographically, declines in revenues from Asia Pacific (down 1.0% from the year-ago quarter) and EMEA (down 4.0% year over year) were offset to a certain extent by increased revenues from Americas (up 2% year over year).Revenues from emerging economies, which represented 15.0% of the total revenue, were down 9% on a year-over-year basis.Gross profit on a non-GAAP basis decreased 2.9% from the year-ago quarter to $493.9 million. Gross margin came in at 87.9% compared with 89.5% in the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower revenues and unfavorable revenue mix. Including stock-based compensation, gross profit came in at $504.9 million.Operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis decreased 1.6% from the year-ago quarter, to $369.7 million due to lower marketing and sales expenses (down 6.2% year over year), somewhat offset by higher research and development expenses (up 3.1% year over year). General and administrative expenses were also up 4.0% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, contracted 30 basis points (bps) to 65.8% in the quarter.

Operating margin contracted 100 bps from the year-ago quarter to 24%, primarily due to lower revenue base. Including stock-based compensation of $31.0 million, operating income came in at $105.6 million.Net income on a non-GAAP basis was down 8.4% year over year to $101.8 million. Including stock-based compensation, net income came in at $78.9 million or 35 cents, compared with $84.6 million or 36 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk exited fiscal second quarter 2014 with total cash and cash equivalents of $1.40 billion compared with $1.66 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $65.0 million compared with $224.1 million in the prior quarter.For the third quarter of 2014, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $540 million-$555 million and earnings per share in the range of 36 cents - 40 cents on a non-GAAP basis. Autodesk did not provide full year 2014 guidance.Autodesk's second-quarter results were negatively impacted by the macroeconomic environment and soft end-market demand. This led to lower margins. However, Autodesk witnessed continued demand for design related suites and the AEC business segment.Moreover, going forward, Autodesk's new cloud-based offerings are expected to gain traction. The company's focus on expanding its mobile applications for both  's  iOS and  's  Android platform will further drive market share, going forward.However, sluggish macro-economic environment, weakness in emerging markets, customer concentration and increasing competition from  (  ) are the major concerns.

Given its history, traders can expect very active trading in the upcoming After-hours session immediately following the company's release of its quarterly earnings. An analysis of historical premarket and after-hours trading activity and liquidity conditions in ADSK following an earnings release indicates that the price change in the extended hours is likely to be of significant value in forecasting additional price movement in the following regular session.Analysts at MidnightTrader have tracked how ADSK's stock price has reacted to quarterly earnings events the past both in the after-hours and following regular session. The result of that study is below.Over the last year, when shares of ADSK rose in the extended-hours session in reaction to its earnings announcement, history shows that 25% of the time (1 out of the last 4 quarters) the stock posted additional gains in the following regular session by an average of 2.80%.Over that same historical period, when shares of ADSK dropped in the extended-hours in reaction to its earnings announcement, history shows that 25% of the time over the last 4 quarters the stock dropped further, adding to the extended-hours losses by an average of 0.50% by the following regular session close.Our analysis of over a decade of company specific earnings related news and price data on over 5,000 US companies demonstrates that earnings event related trading opportunities can exist for those trading in the after-hours and premarket sessions.

Although earnings of 35 cents comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents, revenues of $561.7 million just managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $561.0 million.Revenues declined for the second straight quarter (down 1.2% in the second quarter), primarily due to a downturn in some of the company's end markets, which negatively impacted the company's products like AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT in the quarter.Significantly, revenues declined in Asia Pacific (down 1.0% from the year-ago quarter) and EMEA (down 4.0% year over year), partially offset by the Americas (up 2.0% year over year) in the reported quarter.The decline in revenue base had a negative impact on margins. Gross margin contracted 160 basis points (bps), while operating margin declined 100 bps from the year-ago quarter.For the third quarter, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $540.0 - $555.0 million and earnings of 36 - 40 cents per share. A sluggish demand environment, increasing challenges in emerging markets and shift towards a subscription and rental based model are expected to hurt top-line growth in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2014 declined 34.1% (14 cents) to 27 cents per share over the last 60 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 decreased 17.8% (27 cents) to $1.25 per share over the last 60 days.

Also, key housing indicators and housing-related stocks will be in focus.Key EarningsIn the coming week, the key earnings are from Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:  ), Home Depot (NYSE:  ) and Target (NYSE:  ).Hewlett-PackardHewlett-Packard is expected to report its third quarter results on Wednesday. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.86 vs. $1.00 a year ago on revenue of $27.25 billion vs. $29.67 billion a year ago.Analysts at Morgan Stanley weighed in on the stock ahead of the earnings report. The bank has an Overweight rating on the stock and a $28 price target.\"HP is two-thirds of the way through a 29K workforce reduction but front-end loaded investments in R&D and process improvements mitigated savings in F1H13. With cost per employee at the lowest level in five years, new product introductions, a revamped channel program, and improving US enterprise IT demand should begin to drive operating leverage in F2H13.\"\"The combination of printer supplies growth (plus some Yen benefit), less bad PC trends, improving storage growth, better software deal close rates, and services restructuring ahead of plan with slower revenue run-off, all lead us to believe HP can do better than the -7% Y/Y revenue, flat gross margin, and -1% Y/Y OpEx assumptions for F2H13. Currency swings and aggressive server pricing are headwinds that do not fully offset the long list of tailwinds in our view.\"\"Sustainability of cash flow remains a key investor concern but our in-depth analysis of peer cash conversion cycles and HP's historical ranges suggest a low 20 day cash cycle is a reasonable target. This, combined with fewer restructuring outlays, leads to FCF growth in FY14, to $4+/share. With FCF above EPS for the first time in four years, earnings quality is improving and we believe the company will be rewarded for EPS beats with multiple expansion. As this plays out, our bull case of 8x FY14 FCF of $4.20, or $34, becomes increasingly likely.\"Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs is taking the contrarian view on the stock heading into earnings. The bank has a Sell rating on the stock and a $17 price target.\"While HP's earnings and cash flow performance have handily exceeded expectations over the past two quarters, we continue to believe the company's historical underinvestment and continued end-market challenges could force a reset in expectations, and we remain below consensus as a result. For the July quarter, we model EPS of $0.78 versus guidance of $0.84 to $0.87 and consensus of $0.87. While continued savings from recent restructuring actions and a lower reinvestment rate could allow the company to exceed our forecast, we believe the secular trends in the business remain impaired.\"\"While the company's reinvestment rate has been lower than we expected and resulted in higher net savings, it remains our view that this strategy is unsustainable and that the company's room to maneuver is growing more limited with each passing quarter. We do believe that HP's turnaround efforts have been encouraging thus far, but we also believe that expectations for the pace of the recovery and steady-state earnings are too high.\"J.P. Morgan, however, is neutral on the stock heading into earnings. They raised their price target to $29 ahead of the release from $24.50.\"For Jul-Q, our revised revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates are $27.09bn and $0.89, versus $27.02bn and $0.85 previously. We also are lifting our non-GAAP EPS estimates for succeeding quarters. Our research indicates that our revenue assumptions for services and imaging segments may have been too cautious. Meanwhile, our assumptions for PCs, servers, storage, and networking require modest revisions lower. Net result is that our revenue estimates change little, but the EPS increases are meaningful.\"\"Our new C2014 non-GAAP EPS estimate is $3.75. Considering our Dec-14 price target of $29, the implied P/E multiple is 7.7x, which trails the current peer group average of 10.6x. If HP can continue improving EPS and develop a clear path to YoY revenue growth, the stock's trading multiples stand to improve, in our view.\"Home DepotHome Depot is expected to report second quarter EPS of $1.20 vs. $1.01 a year ago on revenue of $21.72 billion vs. $20.57 billion a year ago. The report is expected before the market open on Tuesday.Deutsche Bank maintained their $80 price target and Hold rating heading into earnings. They are looking for Home Depot to raise guidance though.\"Consensus estimate for HD are $3.63 for the year on 4.8% comps, compared to current guidance of $3.52 and 4.0%. DB is at $3.58 and 4.8%. Guidance includes another $4.4b in buybacks on top of the $2.1b bought in 1Q13. DB is estimating another $5.2b, including $1.1b in 2Q13.\"\"Consistency is the key for HD, with investors increasingly comfortable that HD is in control of their business regardless of the macro or competitive environment. Therefore we think any color around the potential impact of higher interest rates will be a key focus for investors. We also expect an update on the potential to add more debt this year and increase the buyback plan this year to above the already announced $6.5b.\"TargetTarget is expected to report second quarter results on Wednesday before the bell. Analysts are looking for EPS of $0.99 vs. $1.06 a year ago on revenue of $17.33 billion vs. $16.78 billion a year ago.J.P. Morgan recently downgraded the stock to Neutral and kept their price target at $74. \"We are downgrading TGT to Neutral as the current stock price is just 3% below our December price target of $74 and there are significant pressure points on earnings ahead. First, the stock is trading at 16.5x our 2013 EPS estimate of $4.35 (vs. consensus of ~$4.32 and guidance of $4.25-$4.45 adjusted to include Canadian dilution of $0.45) and there is a lot of uncertainty regarding EPS growth into 2014.\"\"Second, we believe the pressures on the low-end consumer persist with the 2% payroll tax increase nearly offsetting 2.9% YTD wage growth and mitigating the lift from TGT's merchandising efforts (e.g., REDcard and PFresh). Third, this backdrop affects the near-term outlook and that plus six fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas portend a promotional environment in 4Q while TGT continues to play catch up in ecommerce. Moreover, the comp lift from PFresh is estimated to fall from 130 bps last year to 70 bps this year and 40 bps in 2014.\"\"Finally, as we look to 2014, the EPS contribution from Canada remains uncertain while representing the single largest driver of expected earnings growth YOY. We are modeling $0.08 of accretion vs. an estimated $0.45 drag in 2013 (representing 43% of our incremental earnings YOY). Over the last nine months, TGT is up 15% vs. the S&P 500 increase of 20%.\"Meanwhile, Piper Jaffray remains bullish heading into earnings. They have an Overweight rating and a $80 price target on Target.\"We remain positive on Target's ability to develop new and innovative programs to gain or maintain market share in key categories. The Beauty Concierge program appears to be a successful example, having expanded to a total of 200 stores in four markets this summer after debuting in 28 stores in one market last year. We believe the expanded Beauty Concierge program can deliver a couple cents of incremental EPS in 2014 and potentially up to $0.15 in 2015 if expanded to half the store base.\"\"Beyond the beauty category, Target continues to test new concepts focused on individual categories, such as Ticket streaming video, a baby department with dedicated and trained staff, expansion of the organic food assortment and renovation of parts of the electronics department for the launch of new video game consoles - evidence, in our opinion, that Target is now evolving with the consumer.\"\"Assuming base beauty sales in Beauty Concierge stores are currently $1.5M/ store ($2.7B in total), annual cost of $50,000 per concierge and a 40% gross margin, we estimate the potential EPS contribution to 2014 EPS is in the neighborhood of $0.01-0.02 assuming a 15-25% realized lift in the beauty category.\"\"Because the markets Target is running the program in are some of the company's better markets, we believe the first 200 stores could be generating closer to $2.0M in annual sales, suggesting the range could be slightly higher at $0.02-0.03. If the program was expanded to half the U.S. store base during 2014, we estimate the contribution to 2015 EPS would be $0.05-0.15 based on initial sales of $1.5-2.0M per store.\"Key Economics ReleasesOn the economics calendar next week, the FOMC minutes will be in focus as investors fear tapering.

This translates into a 33% increase from the prior dividend. The increased dividend will be paid on May 20, 2013, to stockholders of record as of Apr 30, 2013. Prior to this announcement, Texas Instruments had been paying a quarterly dividend of 21 cents per share.The strength of TI's business model is reflected in the company's strong cash generation capabilities and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. We believe that the continued share buybacks and dividend hike will increase investor enthusiasm for the shares.TI's strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. During the last-concluded quarter, it spent $600 million on share repurchases and $235 million on cash dividends. Cash and cash equivalents were $3.97 billion at quarter-end, up $0.31 billion during the quarter. The debt to total capital ratio was just 27.6%. We remain encouraged by TI's strong cash position and its ability to service its long-term debts.Texas Instruments is one of the largest suppliers of analog and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits. The company's fourth quarter earnings surpassed our expectations but were down sequentially as well as from the year-ago quarter due to softening demand and weak macro conditions.However, TI's compelling product lineup, the increasing differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm capacity should drive earnings in the longer term.

Moreover, higher Service and Technology revenue coupled with increased hardware revenue impacted the top line positively.Moreover, litigation proceeds from  (  ) boosted operating results. Management expects fourth quarter revenue to gain from the MSO revenue and Verizon licensing revenue. Moreover, it expects subscription acquisition costs to be lower on a year-over year basis, primarily due to higher subscription additions and a shift in mix to higher SKU's.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter stands at a loss of 12 cents per share while that for fiscal 2013 stands at a loss of 5 cents per share.Estimate revisions have been minimal in the last 30 days, while two upward estimate revisions were made in the past 60 days. Over the last 60 days, fourth quarter loss as per Zacks Consensus Estimate has improved by a penny to a loss of 12 cents. For fiscal 2013, over the last 60 days, loss as per Zacks Consensus Estimate improved by a penny to 5 cents.The lack of downward movement in estimates signals that the fourth quarter might not be too different from the past quarters.

Currently, the company expects a restructuring charge of approximately $15 million for severance-related benefits during the first quarter of 2013.Management is looking to save costs by reducing its workforce and revamping its product portfolio. Intersil has been suffering from the slowdown in the Flat Panel Display (FPD) and global PC markets. We believe that the weak computer market, strong competition and the company's failure to deliver strong results have forced it to refine its cost structure.According to the latest NPD Display Search report, spending on manufacturing equipment for Flat Panel Displays (FPDs) is expected to rise 121% from $3.8 billion in 2012 to $8.3 billion in 2013. The growth is expected to be driven primarily by the widespread use of FPD displays in various electronic gadgets such as TVs, notebook computers, personal computers, mobile phones and public display systems.We believe that the company's focus on the development of new products and design wins will likely improve the demand for its products. The leaner cost structure will also boost margins and earnings growth in the near future.This is not the first time that the company has resorted to restructuring actions. The company had reduced its workforce by 9% in 2008 and then again by 11% in May 2012.Intersil Corp makes power management chips used in flat panel displays and DVD players.

We believe  (  ) Ultrabook partners and  (  ) Windows 8 adopters may have also helped demand.The fourth quarter was very weak for Applied in terms of margin growth. Despite the company seeing some improvement in demand, the heavy expenditure incurred on the launch of new products and higher input costs impacted margins.Though there is potential in the solar energy market over the long term, the company's solar division has taken longer than expected to reach profitability. The company posted weak results in the last quarter due to a sluggish macro environment. Given lower overall semiconductor equipment spending levels and lack of momentum in the solar energy market, we do not see much improvement in the company's results in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter stands at 3 cents while that for fiscal 2013 stands at 54 cents.Applied has beaten estimates in all of the last four quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average positive surprise of 42.90%.

This is a diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments.

The decline was broad based, with the largest sequential decrease coming from the wireless infrastructure sub-segment. Though the market performed poorly in the last quarter, management expects the business to improve, as there is great focus on 4G and LTE by leading phone makers, such as Samsung and  (  ). Analog Devices has offerings for both the traditional and 4G networks, so it stands to gain when there is any increase in demand. Additionally, it has higher content in the 4G segment, which along with its position at leading OEMs should remain a positive factor influencing revenue growth.The  segment, which Analog clubs with the computing and handset businesses, was down 22.0% sequentially and 6% year over year, due to seasonality.The  segment generated around 17% of Analog Devices' first quarter revenues, down 3.0% sequentially and 11.0% from the year-ago quarter. Sluggish demand in Europe due to weaker sales affected Analog's automotive revenues in the last quarter. The growing electronic content in vehicles remained a positive however, with demand for products like driver assistance and powertrain efficiency systems remaining strong.The sequential and year-over-year decline in revenues was broad-based across product lines.Analog signal processing products (85% of total revenue) were down 11.0% sequentially and 3.0% year over year.

The year-over-year decline was mainly due to the macro-economic slowdown and a lackluster PC market, which badly affected chip demand.

The application can also be used in sync with other visual effects and animation software such as Autodesk Maya and 3ds Max.Meanwhile, Autodesk announced a new partnership with The LEGO Group. The partnership will develop a 3D interactive building instruction application for LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 platform, which allows users to build and program robots.The application not only provides alternative to conventional instructions but also allows users to digitally view how the components of the platform fit. This makes it easier for builders to develop sophisticated robots.The mobile application will be available for both Apple's iOS-based devices as well as  Android-based devices in the second half of 2013.The application can also be accessed over the Internet at MINDSTORMS.COM.Autodesk enjoys a leading position in the computer-aided designing market. The new applications reflect Autodesk's focus on improving its penetration in the emerging technologies. The new mobile applications will further boost Autodesk's market share going forward.We believe that Autodesk's expanding product portfolio, broadening industry applications and geographic reach will help sustain long-term growth. Moreover, the new cloud-based products will boost Autodesk's subscriber base in the near term.Acquisitions have also helped Autodesk to expand its cloud-based product offerings in the recent times. In the first nine months of fiscal 2013, Autodesk acquired 8 companies that include a number of software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers for approximately $204.2 million.However, Autodesk's high exposure to Europe amid the lingering financial turmoil in the region keeps us cautious.

Last quarter it posted an 18.03% negative surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Garmin's sales growth rates in the third quarter were higher than the year-ago quarter due to strength in Outdoor and Aviation segments. Garmin is witnessing great success in the Aviation segment due to opportunities in the Part 25 certification market and Outdoor segment owing to the launch of many new products, which are gradually expanding its markets.However, all other segments performed poorly in the last quarter due to weak economic conditions across the world and particularly in Europe. In terms of margin growth, the second quarter was strong for Garmin due to favorable product mix and higher volumes.The company has been introducing various new higher-margin products and growing its strength in all segments other than the portable navigation device (PND) segment. We believe that the company's significant exposure to the PND segment, which is on a secular decline, will continue toweigh on results.Though the company has seen significant pricing stabilization in the PND market, it has failed to deliver in terms of volumes. We think that Garmin could ultimately improve upon the situation by focusing on auto OEMs for in-dash solutions and by building a presence in emerging Asian countries.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Garmin is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Most Accurate estimate stands at $0.64 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher at $0.75. That is a difference of -14.67%. Garmin's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) lowers the predictive power of ESP because the Zacks Rank #4 when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with an ESP of +15.79% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). (  ), with an ESP of +42.86% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). (  ), with an ESP of +33.33% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is set to report first quarter 2013 results on Feb 14. Last quarter it posted a 5% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Though Agilent was affected by the recent economic downturn, the company's sales growth rates in the fourth quarter were above the prior quarter and better than Zacks consensus owing to strong performance in all the segments except Electronic Measurement segment. In particular, the company's life sciences segment has been improving over the last few quarters due to the launch of some new products.The strength in the new Diagnostics segment was a positive for overall gross margin, since the segment generates significantly higher gross margins than the legacy Agilent business. Also, the company's efficient cost management contributed to margin expansion in the last quarter.Though we believe that the company's efforts to introduce new products will generate strong growth and help to grow its market share, the heavy expenditure incurred due to the launch of these products and higher input costs will remain a challenge for the company. Also, the lingering macro conditions will continue to affect the spending environment, not allowing much improvement in the company's results in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter stands at 66 cents while that for fiscal 2013 stands at $3.03.Agilent has missed estimates once in the last four quarters, met estimates once, while beating estimates the other two times. Moreover, the stock has seen downward estimate revisions in the past 60 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged for the first quarter but was down by 0.3% for 2013 over the last 60 days. Over the last 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has gone down by almost 12.0% and 9.6%, respectively for the first quarter and fiscal 2013.The downward pressure on estimates signals a weak first quarter. Moreover, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Our model states that astock needs to have both a positive earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 to beat earnings estimates.

The adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items, but include stock-based compensation expense.Revenues increased 5.2% year over year and 1.7% sequentially to $12.1 billion. Products (78.0% of total revenue) were up 3.3% year over year to $9.4 billion. Services (22.0% of total revenue) jumped 12.5% year over year to $2.7 billion.Revenues grew year over year across most of the geographies. The Americas region increased 9% year over year, while Asia-Pacific, Japan and China collectively known as APJC surged 8.0% from the year-ago quarter. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) declined 5% on a year over year basis due to continued macroeconomic challenges in Europe.NGN Routing (16.1% of total revenue), Collaboration (7.8% of total revenue) and Other Product (1.6% of total revenue) segment revenues declined 6.0%, 11.0% and 29.0% year over year, respectively.However, this decline was fully offset by strong performances from Switching (30.8% of total revenues), Service Provider Video (10.0% of total revenue), Data Center (4.5% to total revenue), Wireless (4.3% of total revenue), Security (2.8% of total revenue), and Service (22.0% of total revenue) segments, which increased 3.0%, 20.0%, 65.0%, 27.0%, 1.0% and 10.0%, respectively.Cisco's total product orders in the quarter remained flat year over year. The APJC region saw the strongest growth at 3%, with the Americas growing 2% and EMEA declining 6% from the year-ago quarter (consistent with broad market trends).In the APJC region, India again witnessed a growth of over 50%, Japan was up in the mid-single digits, while China was down approximately 4% from the year-ago quarter.Reported gross margin for the quarter was 60.7%, down 80 basis points (bps) from 61.5% in the comparable year-ago quarter due to an unfavorable product mix.Cisco's operating expenses of $4.4 billion were 4.0% higher than $4.2 billion incurred in the year-ago quarter. Research and development and general and administrative costs were both up as a percentage of sales from the year-ago quarters, while sales and marketing expense declined. The net result was an operating margin of 23.0%, down 70 bps year over year from 23.7% in the year-ago quarter.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, Cisco recorded a net profit of $3.14 billion or 59 cents per share compared with $2.18 million or 40 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. On a pro forma basis, Cisco generated adjusted net profit of $2.51 billion or earnings per share of 47 cents per share in the last quarter compared with $2.31 billion or 43 cents in the year ago quarter.Our pro forma figure excludes certain one-time items but includes stock-based compensation expenses.Cisco ended with cash and investments balance of $46.4 billion, down $2.3 billion during the quarter. Trade receivables were$4.46 billion, up from $3.94 billion in the prior quarter.The company generated operating cash flow of over $3 billion and spent $1.2 billion on share repurchases and dividends.For third quarter of fiscal 2013, Cisco expects revenues to increase in the range of 4% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 61-62% and non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 26.5-27.5% of revenues. The company expects a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%, yielding non-GAAP earnings of 48 to 50 cents per share.Cisco reported strong second quarter results and its outlook remains positive. However, a sluggish macro-environment is the primary headwind going forward.It is apparent that Cisco's focus on various growth businesses including cloud computing, mobile, data center, and others is paying off. Additionally, Cisco's strategy of pursuing growth opportunities in international markets has helped to deliver positive results. Cisco is already the best entrenched company across the world and despite growing competition from several smaller players, the company appears to be holding its own.Additionally, the focus on new products and various acquisitions resulted in continued market share gains in the last quarter. Order growth in the last quarter was quite encouraging and the trend is reflective of Cisco's superior strategy and innovation.Of course, competitors like  and the Chinese company Huawei have manufacturing operations in low-cost countries, which make them more competitive. They are also interested in sacrificing margins for market share gains. This remains a major concern for Cisco in the near term.Currently, Cisco shares carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company, which has seen its revenues fall sharply in recent years, has become a target of activist investors amid its struggles.In 2008, Carl Icahn purchased a large stake in the company and proceeded to muscle his way onto Yahoo's board of directors after it inexplicably turned down a $47.5 billion, or $33 per share, acquisition offer from Microsoft (NASDAQ:  ).Originally, Microsoft bid $44.6 billion or $31 per share for the company in February 2008. At the time, the offer represented a 62 percent premium over the stock's closing price. Even after the deal was sweetened by $2 per share, Yahoo co-founder and CEO Jerry Yang wouldn't bite. That mistake ended up costing Yang his job.He was replaced by former Autodesk (NASDAQ:  ) CEO Carol Bartz in 2009. Eventually, Icahn gave up on the company, resigned from his board position, and sold his holdings in the stock. Bartz' tenure at Yahoo was filled with controversy due to her outspoken and aggressive nature and a tendency towards internal secrecy. Under her stewardship, the stock also went nowhere to the chagrin of investors.In 2010, Bartz was named the \"most overpaid\" CEO in America by proxy voting firm Glass-Lewis after she reaped $47.2 million in compensation. In September of 2011, Bartz was fired and replaced on an interim basis by CFO Tim Morse. She was also forced off Yahoo's board of directors.By this time, well-known activist hedge fund manager Dan Loeb's Third Point LLC had established a large stake in the company. Currently, Third Point owns 6.17 percent of Yahoo, making it the company's largest shareholder. Loeb was happy to see Bartz go and had been agitating for change.In a letter to the company's board of directors, Leob wrote:\"It is now widely accepted that the Board made a serious misjudgment in approving the hiring of Carol Bartz as Yahoo's Chief Executive Officer, given her inexperience in the consumer-oriented internet space. Although we are pleased that the Board has terminated Ms. Bartz's employment, we fail to understand why this decision was so long in coming given her abysmal performance over the last two and a half years. During this period, Ms. Bartz's poor decision-making and communication skills publicly alienated the Company's highly respected Asian partners, as well as its shareholders, sell-side analysts, bloggers, customers and employees.\"Eventually, the board hired PayPal President Scott Thompson to lead a turnaround. This proved to be a disaster. Loeb was displeased with the decision and began looking into Thompson's background. He discovered that the CEO's resume claimed he held a degree in accounting and computer science from Stonehill College.The school, however, did not begin giving out computer science degrees until four years after Thompson graduated and only had one computer science class in its curriculum while he was there. Subsequently, it was proven that Thompson only held a degree in accounting and that the resume had been embellished.This was a major embarrassment for the Yahoo board and Thompson was dismissed. The company, however, ended up paying him $7.3 million for a tenure which lasted only 130 days. Throughout all of this, Yahoo shares remained depressed, trading under $16.On July 16, 2012, however, the company scored a major coup in poaching longtime Google (NASDAQ:  ) employee Marissa Mayer to be Yahoo's next CEO. Mayer joined Google in 1999 as employee number 20 and was largely responsible for the iconic look of Google's homepage. She also has been credited with overseeing the simple, clean and user-friendly aesthetic of many of Google's other services.She held key roles in Google Search, Google Images, Google News, Google Maps, Google Books and Gmail. Prior to leaving for Yahoo, Mayer was Vice President of Local, Maps, and Location Services. Mayer is young at 37, attractive, and high energy. Many on Wall Street have applauded her hiring and Loeb was pleased.In subsequent months, the stock also began to move. Over the last 6 months, shares are up better than 23 percent. During Mayer's short tenure, Yahoo closed the sale of part of the company's considerable stake in Chinese Internet company Alibaba Group Holding. The deal was originally reached in May prior to Mayer's hiring, but it closed in September of 2012.The asset had accounted for a large chunk of Yahoo's market cap, but was not a part of its core business and was not being fully valued in the stock price. As a result, shareholders had long been frustrated by the company's reluctance to monetize the stake, which was acquired in 2005 for $1 billion.On September 18, Alibaba said that it had completed an initial repurchase of about half of Yahoo's 40 percent stake, netting Yahoo around $4.3 billion after taxes and fees. Mayer further pleased investors by going ahead with a previous plan to return around $3.65 billion of the proceeds to shareholders through buybacks.At the time, Mayer said of the Alibaba deal, \"This yields a substantial return for investors while retaining a meaningful amount of capital within the company to invest in future growth.\" Following the transaction, Yahoo retains a roughly 23 percent stake in the Chinese company with Alibaba retaining the right to repurchase half of Yahoo's remaining holdings.The company also owns a 35 percent stake in Yahoo Japan which it has been attempting to divest in recent years. An eventual sale could further unlock value in the stock. The first reports of a Yahoo Japan sale came in March 2011 when  that a $8 billion deal with SoftBank was being discussed. In October 2011,  that an imminent sale was likely, but it did not materialize.In November of the same year, allthingsd's Kara Swisher  that a deal was in the works. Similar stories have cropped up with regularity ever since. The speculation has always been that the sale would be made to SoftBank, which already owns 42 percent of the business. In December, the Yahoo Japan stake was worth around $6.7 billion pre-tax or $4 billion after taxes and fees.In any event, a divestiture of Yahoo Japan would further boost Mayer's reputation with investors, particularly if it is done in a tax advantageous way. One of the sticking points of a deal has always been how to structure it so that Yahoo isn't stuck with a massive tax bill. Currently, however, SoftBank is in the process of acquiring a 70 percent stake in Sprint (NYSE:  ) for a whopping $20 billion and may  in adding to its position in Yahoo Japan.Under Mayer, Yahoo has been focusing its efforts on mobile and search. In unveiling her strategy to Wall Street, Mayer said Yahoo \"has a unique set of content that we can provide our users,\" while noting that a strong mobile strategy will also drive more search.Other sources have indicated that Yahoo's top brass want the company to become the \"Google of content,\" by personalizing and tailoring the site to individual users. Whereas Google is the place to search for links, Yahoo's goal is to become the place people come for content. Mayer envisions a more personal user experience built around relevant content.According to allthingsd's Swisher, \"that means more partnership deals from third-party sources, with an additional social component layer and synced across a number of devices and platforms, especially video.\" Mayer has said that she wants to make the site one of the \"world's daily habits.\" For the time being, investors are pleased with the direction of the stock price and there are more catalysts on the horizon.Given the ongoing turnaround at Yahoo, Wall Street was keenly interested in the company's fourth-quarter earnings results which were released on Monday. Yahoo reported net income of $272.3 million or $0.23 per share, compared to $295.6 million or $0.24 per share, in last year's fourth-quarter.On an adjusted basis, which is comparable to analysts' consensus, Yahoo said that net income was $369.6 million or $0.32 per share, an increase versus the $306.7 million or $0.25 per share, the company reported last year. This solidly beat Wall Street earnings per share expectations of $0.28.Revenue in the quarter was up 2 percent to $1.35 billion from $1.32 billion in the year ago period. Revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs rose 4 percent to $1.22 billion compared to $1.17 billion last year. Analysts had consensus revenue estimates of $1.21 billion heading into the report. The year over year growth in revenue was a very welcome sign to investors who have grown weary of falling sales trends at the company.Initially, the stock rose around 4 percent in after hours trading, but gave back its gains after Yahoo guided for first-quarter sales of $1.07 billion to $1.1 billion. This was less than the $1.12 billion that analysts had been expecting. On Tuesday, the stock closed the session down around 3 percent after gapping higher at the open. Overall, however, the uptrend in the name remains intact and it would finally appear that Yahoo's prospects are starting to brighten.(c) 2013 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide .

Revenue also fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $561.0 million.The lower-than-expected revenue was a result of tepid demand for Autodesk's solutions. License revenue for the quarter was down 4.3%, which fully offset the 6.3% increase in maintenance revenue and resulted in a decline in overall revenue.Management also cited that 'Superstorm Sandy' had a negative effect on quarterly revenue. Moreover, sluggishness in the macroeconomic environment also led to the weaker-than-expected revenue.On a segmental basis, Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (\"PSEB\") revenue decreased 2.0% year over year to $205.0 million. Revenue from the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (\"AEC\") business segment increased 7.0% year over year to $163 million, while revenue from Manufacturing segment inched down 1.0% from the year-ago quarter to $132.0 million.

Revenue from emerging economies, which represented 15.0% of the total revenue, was down 9.0% compared with the year-ago quarter.Gross profit (including stock-based compensation) remained flat on a year-over-year basis to $499.9 million. Gross margin also remained flat on a year over year basis to 91.2%.Operating expenses (including stock-based compensation) increased 4.1% year over year to $406.7 million, primarily attributable to higher research & development expenses (up 8.8% year over year) and general and administrative expenses (up 12.3% year over year) which fully offset the 0.8% decline in marketing & sales expenses. Moreover, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue expanded 300 bps to 74.2% in the quarter.Operating income (including stock-based compensation) of $93.2 million was down 14.9% year over year. Operating margin came in at 17.0% in the quarter, down 300 bps year over year, primarily due to higher-than-expected operating expenses.Net income on non-GAAP basis came at $107.8 million or 47 cents per share, which improved from $102.1 million or 44 cents in the previous-year quarter.Our non-GAAP calculations may differ from management's presentation due to the inclusion/exclusion of some items that were not considered by management.The company exited the third quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $827.0 million compared with $930.2 million in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $157.0 million compared with $107.0 million in the prior quarter.For fourth quarter 2013, Autodesk expects revenue in the range of $570.0 million to $600.0 million.

In the first nine months of fiscal 2013, Autodesk acquired 8 companies that include a number of software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers for approximately $204.2 million.We believe that Autodesk will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions in order to expand its digital prototyping solutions. These solutions are expected to cater to manufacturers of all sizes, enhancing their ability to design, visualize and simulate their products before they are built.Moreover, the new cloud-based products will boost Autodesk's subscriber base in the near term.

Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 40 cents to 45 cents, which excludes 18 cents related to stock-based compensation expense, 12 cents for restructuring charges and 8 cents related to amortization of acquisition related intangibles.The company reduced its outlook for fiscal 2013. Autodesk expects revenues to increase in the range of 4%-6%, against earlier expectation of 10% growth over fiscal 2012. Autodesk expects non-GAAP operating margin to improve 150 bps (earlier expectation was 200 bps) annually in fiscal 2013.The company also announced restructuring measures that would facilitate the shift to the cloud computing and mobile computing. The company expects to reduce workforce in the coming quarters and expects to consolidate certain leased facilities. The company expects a pre-tax charge of $50 million to $60 million for these restructuring activities in this fiscal year 2013. Autodesk expects the pre-tax charge to be $40 million to $45 million in the third quarter and the remaining amount in the fourth quarter.Autodesk maintains a dominant position in the computer-aided designing market. We believe that Autodesk's expanding product portfolio, broadening industry applications and geographic reach will help it sustain longer-term growth.The company's initiatives to shift towards cloud and mobile computing are expected to be long-term positives. The company's restructuring activities reduced the sales outlook for the fiscal year. However, we believe that this will help the company's to achieve its long-term goals to optimize its cost structure and facilitate investments in the cloud computing services portfolio. The company is also increasing its penetration in the mobile market by developing software for smartphones and  's (  ) iPad. We believe that these initiatives will boost Autodesk's top-line growth going forward.However, Autodesk's high exposure to Europe amidst the lingering financial turmoil in the region keeps us cautious. Moreover, customer concentration and increasing competition are the other headwinds.We have a Neutral recommendation on Autodesk's shares in the long term.

But it will not look materially different from Thursday's trading action when it does arrive. Once investors realize that the fairy dust of more Fed QE has simply no relevance to the issues facing the U.S. economy, they will start walking back from some of the more optimistic bets they put in the summer.But investors are still double minded whether more QE is coming or not. Minutes of the Fed's last meeting stated in plain words that a majority of FOMC members favored more accommodation. But the economic ground realities at the time of that FOMC meeting on July 31/August 1 were somewhat different from what transpired afterwards.Most economic indicators are still no different now than how they have been in the last few months. For example, this morning's July Durable Goods report can hardly be called positive; it was at best neutral, though I would argue that it is actually in the negative column given what it tells us about the state of capital spending in the economy. But we did get in recent days relatively healthier looking readings on retail sales and monthly jobs.This has raised doubts in investors' minds that the Fed may not come through after all. It is this backdrop that has put the spotlight on Bernanke's speech next Friday at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole meeting. The expectation is that Bernanke will provide more color on the Fed's latest thinking about the economy, which will help the market handicap the odds of more QE in next month's FOMC meeting. The Fed's Beige Book report next week (Wednesday) will also be relevant to this discussion.My view, on the other hand, is that more Fed action is simply irrelevant to the U.S. economy. Monetary easing helps the economy by improving liquidity and bringing down interest rates, both non-issues for the U.S. economy at present. As such, while more QE may give stock market investors a temporary psychological high, it will have even less impact on the economy than the preceding version.In corporate news, results from  (  ) and  (  ) after the close on Thursday provide a less than inspiring view of the tech spending outlook going forward as both companies guided lower. Business spending in general has been losing steam lately, as was confirmed by this morning's July Durable Goods report. Not to beat a dead horse, but more QE will do little to prompt companies to spend more if they are not doing already given where interest rates are at present.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is down -3.2 to 2,758.82.

Although terms of the transaction were not disclosed, the deal is expected to have no impact on Autodesk's earnings guidance issued earlier on August 23, 2012.Boston-based Inforbix develops software solutions that allow users to scan and access on-premise product data from multiple sources without any extraction, import or conversion. The software also helps in connecting disparate data elements. Since it is cloud-based, Inforbix software is easy to deploy and much more cost-effective than traditional applications.Autodesk plans to integrate Inforbix software into Autodesk PLM 360 (its first cloud-based PLM suite launched early 2012), which will expand the suite's indexing, searching, personalizing, and data visualization capabilities.Autodesk has been expanding its cloud-based product offerings primarily through the acquisition of small start-ups and Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") providers such as Inforbix.We believe that Autodesk will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions in order to expand its digital prototyping solutions. These solutions are expected to cater to manufacturers of all sizes, enhancing their ability to design, visualize and simulate their products before they are built.Moreover, accretive acquisitions will enable Autodesk to take advantage of the staggering growth potential in cloud computing. According to Forrester, the  for cloud computing will grow from $40.7 billion in 2011 to more than $241.0 billion by 2020. As per data available from Deloitte, cloud-based applications will replace 2.34% of enterprise IT spending in 2014, finally rising to 14.49% by 2020.We believe that the new cloud-based products will boost Autodesk's subscriber base in the near term. The company is also increasing its penetration in the mobile market by developing software for smartphones and  iPad. We believe that these initiatives will boost Autodesk's top-line growth going forward.However, foreign exchange fluctuations and sluggish macroeconomic environment remain the primary headwinds. Autodesk's high exposure to Europe amidst the lingering financial turmoil in the region keeps us cautious. Moreover, customer concentration and increasing competition are the other headwinds.We have a Neutral recommendation on Autodesk's shares in the long term.

(  ) is scheduled to release its fiscal second quarter 2013 results after the market closes on August 23, 2012. In the run up to the earnings release we do not notice any movement in the analysts' estimates. However, Autodesk has a negative average earnings surprise of 0.4% over the trailing four quarters.Autodesk reported mixed first quarter results. The bottom line of 36 cents (including stock based compensation) missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. However, the reported earnings increased 12.5% from the previous-year quarter on the back of revenue growth across all geographies and business segments.The top line increased 11.4% year over year to $588.6 million in the reported quarter and was slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $587.0 million. The year-over-year growth was driven by improved performances from Manufacturing, and Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segments and strong revenue from Suites.For second quarter 2013, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $580.0 million to $600.0 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $592.0 million. Management expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of 46 cents to 51 cents.For further details please read: Over the past 30 days, none of the five analysts covering the stock revised their estimates in either direction. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter remained at 40 cents.Analysts covering the stock expect revenue to be positively impacted by the price rise and increasing mix of recurring subscription revenue. The migration of AutoCAD customers from 2D to 3D will be incrementally beneficial for the company to drive revenues. Moreover, the company's foray into the emerging economies is expected to be the positive catalyst for Autodesk. However, the sluggish macroeconomic environment remains the primary headwind for the company in the near-term.In our view, the company's innovations in 3D design technology provide a competitive edge. Moreover, Autodesk's expanding product portfolio and broadening industry and geographic reach will help it sustain its longer-term growth strategy of providing high-volume, lower-cost CAD software. We believe that this will likely drive earnings going forward.Moreover, the company's expanding cloud computing services portfolio will expand its customer base going forward. The company is also increasing its penetration in the mobile market by developing software for smartphones and  's (  ) iPad. We believe that these initiatives will boost Autodesk's top-line growth going forward.However, Autodesk's high exposure to Europe (approximately 40% of revenues) amidst the lingering financial turmoil in the region keeps us cautious on the stock.

However, details of the transaction were not available. Autodesk said that the acquisition will have no material effect on guidance provided on March 17, 2012.Vela Systems develops web-based software and mobile applications primarily used for Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the construction management industry. BIM refers to a building design methodology that creates a reliable digital representation of the building to facilitate design-related decision making, construction planning, high-quality construction document production and performance predictions including cost estimates.Vela Systems brings BIM directly into the field, which helps to smoothen up the construction management process. Its technology is unique in the sense that other BIM applications can only be used in the office environment and in job trailers. However, Vela's flagship web-based platform can be accessed from any where on any device. Its mobile portfolio includes applications for  (  ) iPad tablet and  (  ) Blackberry smartphone.Autodesk plans to integrate Vela Systems products with its project management software portfolio that includes Navisworks. We believe that the Vela Systems acquisition will not only boost Autodesk's presence in the construction management industry but will also expand its growing cloud and mobile services over the long term.According to Forrester, the  for cloud computing will grow from $40.7 billion in 2011 to more than $241.0 billion by 2020. Both private and public cloud markets are expected to grow at a significant rate primarily due to higher computing speed and agility, which is available at a lower cost. As per data available from Delloitte, cloud-based applications will replace 2.34% of enterprise IT spending in 2014, finally rising to 14.49% by 2020.Autodesk has been expanding its cloud services offerings lately through the integration of Autodesk's 2013 family of products with Autodesk 360 (previously known as Autodesk Cloud), a family of hybrid cloud-based and on-premises software solutions launched in 2011.Autodesk has also been acquiring companies particularly of web-based communities in order to boost its cloud offerings. The acquisitions reflect Autodesk's strategy of expanding its digital prototyping solutions, which is expected to cater to manufacturers of all sizes, enhancing their ability to design, visualize and simulate their products before they are built.These efforts should enable Autodesk to take advantage of the tremendous growth potential in cloud computing.In our view, the company's innovations in 3D design technology provide a competitive edge.

After all, the questions raised by the recent indecisive Greek elections about the country's place in the Euro-zone can only be answered by another round of voting in the coming weeks. Till that time, Greece related questions will likely remain the primary headwind for the markets.But investors in the U.S. are holding a big party today to forget all about Greece and Europe, even if it's only for a single day or a few hours. The party is for  (  ), where the iconic social-networking site will get the biggest tech IPO in history title. The event has protagonists on both sides, with detractors questioning the market's willingness to give the company a $100 billion-plus valuation. It is hard to escape the feverish debate surrounding the Facebook event anywhere you look. But while the saturation coverage is becoming a little too much, I nevertheless prefer this over Greece and Europe any time.The Faccebook story is the biggest corporate news of the day, given the absence of any major economic or earnings reports. But we did have a number of major earnings reports after the close on Thursday when we got better than expected results from  (  ) and  (  ), while results from  (  ) proved underwhelming.

However, the reported earnings increased 12.5% from the previous-year quarter on the back of revenue growth across all geographies and business segments.Revenues increased 11.4% year over year to $588.6 million in the reported quarter and whiskered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $587.0 million. Reported revenue for the quarter was at the higher end of management's guided range of $575.0 million to $590.0 million. Revenue for the quarter was positively impacted by strong growth in the Manufacturing and Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segments and strong growth in revenue from suites (34% revenue growth), which more than offset the decline in Media and Entertainment business segment.Moreover, license and other revenues (61.3% of total revenue) increased 11.8% from the year-ago quarter to $361.0 million and maintenance revenues (38.7% of total revenue) rose 10.9% year over year to $227.6 million in the quarter.On a segmental basis, Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) revenues jumped 9.0% year over year to $229.0 million in the reported quarter. Revenues from the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segment were $163.0 million, up 16.0% from the previous-year quarter, while Manufacturing revenues increased 18.0% from the previous-year quarter to $146.0 million. However, revenues from the Media and Entertainment business declined 5.0% on a year-over-year basis to $51.0 million in the quarter.Autodesk posted significant upside across all its geographical regions on the back of continued adoption of its products. Revenues in America jumped 14.0% year over year to $208.0 million. International businesses continued to be strong during the quarter. EMEA revenues climbed 4.0% year over year to $224.0 million. Among the EMEA countries, Russia and China recorded strong revenue growth, while Brazil and India were the laggards when compared with previous-year quarter. Revenue from Asia-Pacific region jumped 19.0% year over year to $157.0 million. Revenue from emerging economies (14.0% of the total revenue) was up 6.0% year over year to $82.0 million.Gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding one-time charges) was $539.6 million, up 12.0% year over year. Gross margin increased 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 91.7% on the back of higher revenue base and favorable business mix.Operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding one-time charges) increased 10.1% year over year to $428.0 million, primarily attributable to higher marketing & sales expenses (up 10.5% year over year) and research & development expenses (up 11.8% year over year). General and administrative expenses also increased 5.8% from the year-ago quarter. However, operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, contracted 80 bps to 72.7% in the quarter.Operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding one-time charges) of $111.6 million was up 19.7% year over year. Operating margin came in at 19.0% in the quarter, up 140 bps year over year, attributable to strong revenue growth and cost controls in the quarter.The company exited the first quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $1.07 billion compared with $1.16 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $139.3 million compared with $175.0 million in the prior quarter.For second quarter 2013, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $580.0 million to $600.0 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $601.0 million.Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 46 cents to 51 cents, which excludes 12 cents related to stock-based compensation expense and 5 cents related to amortization of acquisition related intangibles. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 41 cents per share, which is evidently below the guided range.For fiscal 2013, Autodesk expects revenues to be 10% higher than fiscal 2012. Autodesk expects non-GAAP operating margin to improve 200 bps annually in fiscal 2013.Autodesk maintains a dominant position in the computer-aided designing market. We believe that Autodesk's expanding product portfolio, broadening industry applications and geographic reach will help it sustain longer-term growth through the development of high-volume, lower-cost CAD software.Moreover, the company's expanding cloud computing services portfolio will expand its customer base going forward. The company is also increasing its penetration in the mobile market by developing software for smartphones and  's (  ) iPad. We believe that these initiatives will boost Autodesk's top-line growth going forward.However, Autodesk's high exposure to Europe (approximately 40% of revenues) citing the lingering financial turmoil and gloomy economic environment in the region keeps us cautious on the stock.

By the closing bell, the energy sector had dented the S&P 500, while investors' apprehensions about Hewlett-Packard's decision of merging its printing and personal computing businesses dragged down the Dow. However, tech shares boosted the Nasdaq into the positive zone.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) dropped 0.3% to settle at 13,124.62. The Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) edged down 0.2% to finish yesterday's trading session at 1,402.89. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was the only gainer among the other benchmarks and moved up by 0.04% to settle at 3,075.32. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 2.9% and finished at 15.13. Total volumes on the New York Stock Exchange was 3.58 billion shares. The advance-decline ratio on the NYSE was almost even, as for 48% of the gainers, 49% stocks traded lower. The remaining stocks were left unchanged.Gains for the Nasdaq may seem meager, but on a day when other benchmarks finished in the red, it was the only benchmark to chalk up an increase. On that note, Nasdaq's gains were important, thanks to technology shares. Not only yesterday, but even in the past the Nasdaq has outperformed the other benchmarks on a few occasions. On Monday in particular, the Nasdaq was boosted by an event that also played a role in sparking off the broader rally. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:  ) settled over $600 a share, on Monday, for the first time in its history, and the uptrend was a direct result of its announcement which bolstered shareholders' value. Apple announced a quarterly dividend of $2.65 per share, to be paid in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company announced a three-year share buyback plan worth $10 billion, which will begin in fiscal 2013.The technology sector has performed decently so far this year and has lent support to the markets' uptrend. Yesterday, Nasdaq components like Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:  ), Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:  ), Google Inc. (NASDAQ:  ), priceline.com Incorporated (NASDAQ:  ) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:  ) gained 1.2%, 1.5%, 1.0%, 1.0% and 4.4%, respectively.Coming to the S&P 500, the index might have dropped a few points yesterday, but it is still hovering near four-year highs. Last Thursday, the S&P 500 had finished above 1, 400 for the first time since June 2008. Till yesterday, the S&P 500 had been able to sustain the 1, 400 level for five-consecutive-trading days. Yesterday the energy sector dragged the S&P 500 lower, but it still remained at high levels.What dragged the energy sector lower was Baker Hughes' (NYSE:  ) projection of a declining profit margin in the first quarter. The energy major cited that the company's transition to natural gas exploration from crude would hurt its business. Baker Hughes lost 5.8% to close at $45.04 a share, recording its lowest closing level since mid-December 2011. The Energy SPDR Select Sector Fund (  ) was down 1.2% and shares including Halliburton Company (NYSE:  ), Schlumberger (NYSE:  ), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:  ) and Western Refining Inc. (NYSE:  ) lost 1.8%, 2.3%, 1.1% and 2.8%, respectively.Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:  ) ended up as a big loser among the 30 Dow components, dropping 2.2%. The company announced business restructuring plans, which did not go down well with investors. HPQ said it was planning to merge its printing and personal computer businesses. Meg Whitman, the company's CEO, said: \"By providing the best in customer-focused innovation and operational efficiency, we believe we will create a winning scenario for customers, partners and shareholders\". However, with shareholders remaining apprehensive about the move, the stock had to suffer a battering.On the economic front the National Association of Realtors came out with data on existing home sales, reporting a 0.9% dip in February. Total existing-home sales dropped 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.59 million in February. This was lower than January's revised figure of 4.63 million, but was higher than prior-year's 4.22 million-units. Consensus estimates had projected that total-existing home sales would come in at 5 million. Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said: \"The market is trending up unevenly, with record high consumer buying power and sustained job gains giving buyers the confidence they need to get into the market\".

Wednesday's minutes of the Fed's last meeting, which took place before a number of key economic reports showed renewed strength, clearly show bias towards more monetary easing. The negative drag from global economic slowdown, as highlighted by soft manufacturing readings from China and the Euro-zone today, further confirms that course of action. But the recent improvement in U.S. economic indicators could mean that the central bank could hold off on doing a full fledged bond purchase program. The focus will now shift to the Fed's Jackson Hole huddle later this month, pronouncements from which will be closely watched for signs of the central bank's next course of action.Today's flash purchasing managers index (PMI) readings for China and the Euro-zone provide further confirmation of the global economic slowdown. The weakness in Germany is particularly worrisome as it could potentially reduce its ability and willingness to do the heavy lifting needed to stabilize the region's faltering financial health. This soft international backdrop has contributed to expectations that central banks, including the U.S. Fed, would come out with more accommodative policies.Minutes of the Fed's last meeting confirm that the central bank was thinking along those lines as well. But that meeting on July 31/August 1 was followed by a few stronger looking economic data points, with the July non-farm payroll and Retail Sales readings reversing the preceding the three months of negative trend. This morning's not-so-bad Jobless Claims data is also along the same lines. This could mean that the Fed does not need to rush a new bond purchase program to juice up economic growth. And this lack of clarity on the course of Fed policy in the coming days will likely be the key hurdle for stocks to make any decisive move in either direction.On the earnings front,  (  ) came short of expectations and guided lower, while results from  (  ) were on the positive side.

While this trend has led to some optimism across the economy, one downside to this increased demand from a variety of sectors looks to be in the commodity world.A number of products have seen rising prices so far this year with some of the biggest gains coming in the energy world. Oil prices are now firmly above $100/bbl. while coal, heating oil, and RBOB have all seen price increases in the first part of the year as well.If these positive economic trends continue, high prices in this segment could be in the beginning of a bull market, if not at the very least poised to stay at elevated levels for the time being (see  ).This development could boost demand for those engaged in the exploration and production of new fossil fuel areas as higher prices make fields that were once off limits profitable again. Another end result of this trend could be renewed interest in alternative fuels such as wind and solar power.These energy forms tend to be much more competitive with their 'traditional' cousins when prices are high in the hydrocarbon world, spurring some to make the switch to clean energy. Yet, while exploration for new deposits and the broad clean energy sector look to be winners, investors could also see huge gains in stocks that promote energy efficiency as well.Companies in this segment could be key components in a time of high energy prices, helping to stretch supplies in all forms of energy. By utilizing these techniques offered by some firms in this corner of the market, companies can cut down on costs and possibly become more profitable in the process. Seemingly, a commitment to energy efficiency by power intensive businesses could be a competitive advantage in times of high prices (read  ).As a result, it could be ideal for some investors to consider making a play on this space for investment. While it is true that a move into broad clean energy or oil firms could be another way to play high prices, both of these sectors look to be among the first places that investors target with their capital in times of rising energy prices, suggesting that energy efficiency firms may be overlooked in comparison.Thanks to this, valuations in this corner of the market may be more tolerable at this time than most other plays on the growing trend. Furthermore, the sector looks to be less volatile, and more profitable, than many in the alternative energy space while also offering more growth than many oil firms, implying that it could be the best of both worlds if energy prices remain elevated.For investors intrigued by these trends, any of the following three ETFs could make for intriguing selections that could possibly benefit from a boom in demand for energy efficient technologies and processes: ( For investors who are unsure of which segment of the sector is going to perform the best, an ETF targeting the entire space could be the best bet. In order to do this and make a play on emerging technologies that could be useful to those looking to increase energy efficiency, PZD is hard to beat.The product tracks the Cleantech index which focuses in on firms that primarily engaged and involved in electric grid, electric meters and devices, networks, energy storage and management, and enabling software used by the smart grid infrastructure sector. With this focus, the fund should be a solid barometer for the health of the industry at large (see  ).PZD holds just under 70 securities in total, putting a heavy weight in industrials (54%) and technology (30%) companies. From a market cap perspective, the product is pretty well spread out, allocating about 38% to small and micro cap securities, 37% to mid caps, and the rest in large cap stocks.Top individual securities include European firm Schneider Electric, Autodesk (  ), and  (  ), all of which make up around 3.1% of the total holdings profile. This fund was down significantly in 2011, but as the economy has rebounded and energy efficiency has come into focus, the product has produced strong gains, adding nearly 12% so far in 2012. ( According to recent research, more than half of all energy produced in the U.S. is wasted thanks to inefficiency in the power system. Given that the U.S. produces over 4,300 TWh of power per year, this is clearly a huge area of improvement for those seeking to increase the use of energy efficient technologies.For investors seeking to hone in on this potentially high growth segment the aptly named fund GRID could be an intriguing choice (read  ).The product tracks stocks that are in the grid and electric energy infrastructure sectors, holding 36 securities in total. GRID focuses in on companies primarily engaged and involved in electric grid, electric meters and devices, networks, energy storage and management, and enabling software used by the smart grid infrastructure sector.The ETF also tilts holdings, 80/20, towards pure play companies, ensuring that more diversified companies are represented but do not dominate the index. Top individual holdings include NGK Insulators,  . (  ) and Schneider Electric, each of which make up about 8% of the total. Much like the other ETFs on this list, the fund had a rough 2011 but has seen a rebound in 2012 gaining close to 14.8% since the start of the year.Some investors may be scratching their heads wondering what a basic materials play like LIT is doing in an article about energy efficiency, but lithium is an increasingly important story in the space as well. That is because lithium is a key component in many electric batteries which are vital to electric cars, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. As alternative energy takes off, efficient and clean ways to store this power will be needed, and lithium looks to easily take over this role (see  ).In terms of holdings, LIT has 22 securities in total, giving heavy weights to Chilean firm  (  ) and  (  ). For sectors, metal and mining takes up about 26% while agricultural chemical firms 19% and electrical equipment 19% companies round out the top three sectors.Investors should also note that the fund has a focus on mid cap securities, which is unlike many basic materials focused funds which seem to have a definite large cap tilt. In part thanks to this, the fund has had a weak 2011 but it has roared higher in 2012, gaining about 16.6% so far this year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

I'm the editor of  , and for the first time in nearly two years, my subscribers may be looking at their first total loss on a recommendation.If you trade options as long as I have, you know that you are going to get the occasional extreme situation: a stock will gap up sharply when you are holding puts, or a stock will gap down while you are holding calls, but it still stings.In this case, I had recommended the June 36 Call on  on May 11. The stock was riding the lower rail of an upward sloped trend channel and it was oversold based on the 10-day Relative Strength Index. The RSI measures a stock's recent performance against its past performance. A reading above 70 is considered overbought and a reading below 30 is considered oversold.The setup had seemed ideal, but the stock gapped sharply lower on Friday after a disappointing earnings announcement Thursday night. The gap lower created a situation where the June 36 Call was virtually worthless, so unless the stock can rally sharply between now and June 15 (the expiration date), subscribers to  will suffer their first total loss on a recommendation.That's the ugly part of options trading.The bad part of options trading is that if you are buying puts and calls, your winning percentage is likely to be in the neighborhood of 50%, considerably less than a typical long-term stock investing system. I discussed this in an article for  last month, Now let's get to the good part of options trading.While a 100% loss is something none of us want to deal with, it is inevitable when you trade options for a long time. Autodesk was my 75th  recommendation in almost two years. So although I'm disappointed, I can live with one total loss every two years, especially when I look at the seven trades where subscribers made over 100% on the recommendations. There was even one recommendation where subscribers averaged 190%.The fact that you can lose 100% is the risk of buying short-term options. But 100% is also the maximum you can lose, while your gains are unlimited. The best trade I ever made on an option was in December 1990 when I had calls on a stock and the company got a takeover bid. The calls I bought for $1.75 each were worth $22 each overnight. (Remember when talking about options prices, each option represents 100 shares, so you have to multiply the price of the option times 100, so the $175 options were worth $2,200 each.) That's a 1,157% gain.---The key to surviving a complete loss on a trade is to use proper money management. In the  , there are suggestions for proper money management. I recommend that no more than 20% of your total portfolio be used for trading options, and I recommend not putting more than 20% into any one trade.So if a person's investment portfolio is $50,000, no more than $10,000 should be dedicated to options trading. Out of that $10,000 dedicated to options trading, no more than $2,000 should go into any one trade. So in the case of a total loss, the options account takes a 20% hit and the total portfolio takes only a 4% hit.Proper money management is important no matter what you are investing in, but it is crucial when using an options buying strategy. You can take a loss like the one we're holding on ADSK, but you live to trade another day.Good luck and good investing,Rick PendergraftEditor of The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nternet security major  (  ) recently came out with the latest version of Symantec Data Insight 3.0, which will improve information management and facilitate the usage of unstructured data such as documents, presentations, spreadsheets and emails.The improved version of Symantec Data Insight 3.0 will help organizations to enhance their storage operations, transforming their information governance processes, and thereby, help companies to better manage costs, reduce risk and achieve compliance.We believe that the new solution will have a number of takers as most enterprises are looking to transform their information governance process. As per research data published by Gartner, the growth rate of data in today's businesses lies in the range of 40.0% to 60.0%, with unstructured data growth in the enterprise at around 80.0%. This is becoming increasingly difficult to manage and protect.Symantec has recognized this opportunity and has developed this software for IT organizations, which are encountering the challenging task of data management and governance.Apart from tapping new opportunities in data management, the company is also winning new orders for its Internet mobile security solutions. This fact is further emphasized by Samsung Electronics selecting Symantec's flagship product, Norton Mobile Security for a 90-day complimentary subscription on its Galaxy smartphones. Samsung is one of the largest smartphone sellers in the U.S., selling phones that run on  (  ) Android OS.Moreover,  (  ) has selected SymantecCorporation's Clearwell eDiscovery platform.On the other hand, the integration between McAfee and Intel has occurred within the embedded business and industry experts are of the opinion that this will form the first phase of its mobile security approach. McAfee and  (  ) jointly announced a foray into the mobile device space, which is set to enhance competition between McAfee (now a part of Intel Corporation) and Symantec.Increased competition notwithstanding, the company's third quarter results were impressive, with both the top and bottom line surpassing our estimates. Geographical and segmental performances were largely good although the EMEA and Service segments turned out to be the spoilers.Although the company is slowly gaining a foothold in the mobile security and data management market, uncertainty regarding PC sales is expected to affect its Consumer segment this year. Moreover, reduction in tech spending by different government and private organizations, stiff competition from McAfee as well as the prevailing economic turmoil in Europe may have a dampening effect on the company's business prospects. Symantec's guidance was also weak, and we believe that this could be due to the above mentioned reasons.Currently, Symantec has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold rating. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) announced the acquisition of modeling technology assets fromT-Splines , a surface modeling software company. Although the transactional details of the deal were not available, Autodesk confirmed that the transaction would not affect its current quarter guidance.T-Splines is a privately-held company and makes 3D modeling software for designers and professionals. The CAD modeling software is expected to boost Autodesk's Digital Prototyping portfolio. Through digital prototyping, professionals can cost-effectively and efficiently design in 3D format, and thereby deliver quality products.3D is becoming an integral part of film production, video game development and television, which could mean considerable growth for Autodesk. The company's 3D products currently make up around a third of its top line and we anticipate that increasing 3D adoption will drive significant top line growth while expanding margins over the long term.Autodesk has been on an acquisition spree and has acquired several companies to enhance and strengthen its product portfolio. It has also expanded its reach in the cloud based services that would be incrementally beneficial for the company going forward.Moreover, the recent acquisitions (GRIP Entertainment, Micro Application Packages Ltd. andKoblenz , Germany-basedNumenus GmbH) in the CAD and gaming middleware sections will provide the company with long-term opportunities, particularly in the web-based communities that will likely boost its cloud offerings going forward. In 2011 alone the company has acquired 12 companies so far.Autodesk has a strong balance sheet with no debt. This provides the company with necessary liquidity to make further acquisitions, which can be easily integrated into its existing operations. We believe this will further strengthen its stronghold in the CAD design market going forward.Moreover, the company's improvements and innovations in 3D design technology and superior product portfolio provide it a competitive edge over  (  ) and  (  ) in our view.

While it is true that most funds in the space have seen solid returns in 2012 so far, the gains have done little to ease the pain not just of last twelve months, but indeed of several of the past years in the sector.Given the lack of available government subsidies, a push towards natural gas, and extreme competition in the clean energy market, many believe that the hurt could continue for this downtrodden sector as we head further into the year. Strong prices for oil have had a troublingly small impact on a push towards clean energy sources suggesting that many investors have put off investing in this space for the time being (See  ).This is especially true given the ongoing budget worries in many of the key clean energy markets in Europe, and fears over a slowdown in China. If these two markets, which are among the most important ones for various alternative energy segments, look likely to remain subdued, it will be hard for many investors to stay bullish on this sputtering market segment (read  ).So while double digit gains have been in some of the most popular segments of the market-such as a nearly 11% jump in the  this year-returns have already begun to fall in recent trading sessions. In fact, TAN has slumped by nearly 20% in the past month alone, suggesting that the bear market in some types of clean energy is already back.Yet, with that being said, some broader segments of the have been holding up better-both in the short and long term-and could be more attractive picks for investors in the space. These ETFs could be ideal for investors seeking to make a bet on clean energy at large, but are worried about some of the major issues hitting the solar and wind segments at this time. For those intrigued by this, any of the following ETFs could make for better choices in the clean energy world:This little-known ETF tracks the WilderHill Progressive Energy Index, which is a benchmark that focuses on the following industries; alternative energy, power efficiency, emission reduction, and new energy sources. This focus results in a global fund that has roughly 54 securities, charging investors 70 basis points a year in fees (read  ).The ETF is heavily focused on industrials (46%) while energy firms account for another twenty percent of assets. From a country perspective, American securities occupy roughly two-thirds of the fund, putting a great distance between itself and second place Canada (11%), and third place Brazil (5%). Top individual holdings include  and  , although investors should note assets are pretty well spread out among components.In terms of performance, PUW shines when compared to the solar ETF, TAN. PUW has outperformed TAN by about 750 basis points in year-to-date terms, although the trailing twelve month period is even more impressive. In this time frame, PUW is down about 6.6% while TAN has lost a whopping 64.7%, demonstrating how vital diversification can be in this corner of the market.For another option in the cleantech space, investors can take a look at PZD. The fund tracks roughly 70 companies that are engaged in the broad cleantech industry with a focus on improving efficiency or performance. The ETF is equally-weighted, charges investors about 67 basis points a year, but sees solid AUM of a little over $100 million.This fund also has a focus on industrials (54%) although tech companies comprise another 29% of assets. In fact, energy firms do not really make up an allocation at all, instead putting the focus on firms in the machinery, electrical equipment, and semiconductor industries (read  ).In terms of country exposure, U.S. firms account for the majority at just over 54%, while European firms account for another third of assets. The fund also has a decent breakdown between cap levels, as no one segment makes up more than 35% of the total. Top individual holdings include weights to French firm  , and then two American companies;  , and  .For performance, PZD has also outperformed TAN, although by a much smaller margin. It has outgained the solar ETF by about eight basis points in year-to-date terms, and has outperformed over the past 52 weeks by a margin of -12% to -64.7%. While this performance has not been as good as PUW, the volume on PZD is better implying that it may have tighter bid ask spreads for most investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This helped the company to not only surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but also exceed management's guided range. Despite an improved top-line Autodesk's bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.For further details, please read: For first quarter 2013, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $575.0 million to $590.0 million. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $587.0 million. Earnings (excluding stock based compensation of 10 cents and amortization of 7 cents) is expected to be in the range of 46 cents to 48 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 39 cents per share.For fiscal 2013, Autodesk expects revenues to be 10% higher than the prior year. Autodesk expects non-GAAP operating margin to improve 130 bps annually. Moreover, management expects the tax rate to remain uniform at 26.5% for both first quarter and fiscal 2013.In the last 30 days, none of the six analysts covering the stock revised their estimates for the first quarter of 2013. We note that Autodesk has posted an average earnings surprise of 1.70% in the trailing four quarters, implying that the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that magnitude in the stated period. We don't expect a major change in the earnings trend pattern for the current quarter.For fiscal 2013, out of the 8 analysts covering the stock, one downward revision was witnessed in the last 30 days. This reflects steady growth trends in our view.Most of the analysts believe that the company's market share gains and its presence in emerging market. These positives are expected to drive the top-line going forward. Moreover, the acquisitions in the field of CAD and gaming middleware sections will provide the company with long-term opportunities, particularly in the web-based communities that will likely boost the company's cloud offerings going forward.Autodesk maintains a dominant position in the computer aided designing market. We believe that Autodesk's expanding product portfolio, broadening industry applications and geographic reach will help it sustain longer-term growth through the development of high-volume, lower-cost CAD software. We believe that this will likely drive earnings going forward.Moreover, the company's expanding cloud computing services portfolio will expand its customer base going forward. The company is also increasing its penetration in the mobile market by developing software for smartphones and  (  ) iPad. We believe that these initiatives will boost Autodesk's top-line growth going forward.However, Autodesk's high exposure to Europe (40% of revenues) citing the lingering financial turmoil and gloomy economic environment in the region keeps us cautious on the stock.

Pursuant to the deal, Horizontal's BIM solutions are expected to be incorporated into Autodesk 360. Financial details of the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 (Jan 31, 2012) were not disclosed.The acquisition is expected to boost Autodesk's cloud-based BIM. Autodesk and Horizontal clients will now enjoy the benefits of more efficient workflows, easy availability of project data and simplified business processes, resulting in higher profitability and quality product delivery. The Horizontal acquisition will provide added strength to Autodesk's Architecture, Engineering and Construction (  ) business segment.Horizontal systems would be Autodesk's second acquisition in quick succession in the BIM segment.

We all know that oil is a limited resource. But we also know that if we don't find alternative sources of energy, the world as we know it today will no longer exist.That's why alternative energy ETFs are so tantalizing to think about. There is so much discussion about the older energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas that have been moving our economy for decades. Climate change discussions as well as rising commodity prices have helped bring alternative or renewable energy discussions to the front table.The problem of course is that these new energy sources are often much more expensive and while that may change in the future, it is not clear how much time it will take. Another important factor when it comes to energy is government regulation. Other sectors are relatively free of government interference as long as they obey the basic laws. Governments have put their money where their policy is by granting huge financial incentives to alternative energy companies but with financial support comes regulations. Energy, including alternative energy, is seen as something with national security implications and is keenly under the radar of most governments. Since there's no way to know how the governments would react in the future, it adds a good deal of risk to any alternative energy investment.As an investment perspective, recently, with the drastic drop in oil prices, alternative energy funds have suffered. It should not come as a surprise that coal related stocks and ETFs have continued to be one of the best performing sectors this year. Considering that alternative energy is yet to produce sensible economics, oil and coal continue to be cheaper to use than alternative energy. Another basic disadvantage that holds true for most of the alternative energies is that their supplies are mostly dependent on nature and thus are not constant.However there is no denying the fact that eventually there will be some big winners in the alternative energy field but as of now there is a deep uncertainty as to how much time it will take to get alternative energy in the driver's seat. The advantages of using alternative energy will be only be realized when people are forced to make the changes to their lifestyles and businesses.Alternative energy ETFs come in two basic forms: those that invest in a wide swathe and those that invest in a concentrated area of the alternative energy market. PBW tracks the WilderHill Clean Energy Index, a benchmark that tracks companies that focus on greener and generally renewable sources of energy and technologies that facilitate cleaner energy. It holds 53 securities and is heavily exposed to companies in the electrical equipment sector. : PBD consists of 88 securities and has nearly one-third of its exposure to U.S. firms, the largest single country allocation. Additionally, the fund is heavy on mid and small cap securities; just 14% of the assets are classified as large cap firms. The WilderHill  Index (ECO) is an index that defines and tracks the Clean Energy sector: specifically, businesses that stand to benefit substantially from a societal transition toward use of cleaner energy and conservation. Stocks and sector weightings within the ECO Index are based on their significance for clean energy, technological influence and relevance to preventing pollution in the first place. The WilderHill Clean Energy Index (ECO) is a index that tracks the clean energy sector and the PowerShares Clean Energy Portfolio (  ) is the investment vehicle that replicates it.: PZD consists of 78 firms which focus on knowledge-based products\nor services that improve operation, performance, productivity, or\nefficiency, while reducing costs, inputs, energy consumption,\nwaste, or pollution. : PZD consists of 78 firms which focus on knowledge-based products or services that improve operation, performance, productivity, or efficiency, while reducing costs, inputs, energy consumption, waste, or pollution. : This iShares fund allocates its holdings to a wide variety of alternative energy sources. Besides solar and wind, the fund also invests in firms that produce biomass and ethanol and geothermal producers. The top sector is electrical equipment, which makes up about 53% of assets. : The index is a modified market capitalization weighted index designed to track the performance of clean energy companies that are publicly traded in the United States and includes companies engaged in manufacturing, development, distribution and installation of emerging clean-energy technologies including, but not limited to, solar photovoltaics, biofuels and advanced batteries. : This ETF focuses on mid cap securities, which make up more than half of the fund's total assets. KWT's top holdings are Renewable Energy Corp. and MEMC Electronic Materials, which combine to make up 22.6% of the fund's total assets. : TAN offers investors a greater level of exposure to small cap securities by investing slightly more than two-thirds of its total assets in small cap firms. Its largest holding is First Solar, which makes up 10% of the fund's total assets. FAN offers investors global exposure to the wind industry, allocating 26.2% of its assets to Spanish equities, 16.3% to the U.S. and 14.9% to Germany. This ETF also offers investors global exposure, and is diversified across market capitalization levels with nearly equal allocations to large, mid, and small cap securities.The alternative energy sector is undergoing a recovery after having absorbed the global recession and falling waterfall in the world price of crude. Earlier this year, very few alternative energy companies have been in the trough. Although these alternative energy companies have recovered from their low, their valuations are still well below the 52-week high. The growth of alternative energy companies is closely tied to the fortunes of the economy.A World Bank report has suggested that six major East Asian economies will together need roughly $80 billion in investment in alternative energy sources per year in order to stabilize their greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. Since 2005, investment in clean energy increased by 230% to $162 billion in 2009.Under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act ((ARRA)) passed in February 2009, the U.S. Treasury Department has implemented a program to issue cash grants in lieu of investment tax credit for renewable energy projects. Asian governments, most notably China, have increased their financial support for solar projects. China is aiming at increasing its installed solar power capacity to 2GW by 2011 from 140MW capacity at the end of fiscal 2008.

The popularity of the AutoCAD WS among professional architects, designers and engineers and non-CAD professionals can be gauged by the number of downloads that has reached more than three million to date.The feature that is warranted to popularize the AutoCAD WS is the 3D mode, which will allow users to view and share 3D drawings in their mobile devices. Moreover, the GPS capabilities will store the geographic location within the drawing.Additionally, the users can easily access and print their designs on any web-connected  's (  ) HP Designjet printer, directly through the AutoCAD WS application. The new feature, with the support of the cloud application, plays a key-role in the design segment as it allows professionals to print, or, document and share their designs irrespective of their location.In our view, the company's improvements and innovations in 3D design technology and product portfolio provides a competitive edge. Moreover, Autodesk's expanding product portfolio and broadening industry and geographic reach will help it sustain its longer-term growth strategy of providing high-volume, lower-cost CAD software.

(For further details, please read:  )For the fourth quarter of 2012, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $575.0 million to $590.0 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $584.0 million.GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 26 cents to 29 cents. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the 42 cents to 45 cents range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 38 cents per share, which is evidently below the guided range.For fiscal 2012, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $2.20 billion to $2.21 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21 billion. GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 and non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $1.70 to $1.73. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.39. Autodesk expects non-GAAP operating margin to improve by between 210 and 240 basis points in fiscal 2012.Additionally, the company provided a sneak peak into their fiscal 2013 when the company reported its third quarter. For fiscal 2013, Autodesk expects revenues to increase 10.0% on a year-over-year basis, with about 150 basis points increase in the GAAP operating margin and roughly 200 basis points increase in non-GAAP operating margin, over the fiscal 2012 figures.Out of the six analysts covering the stock, one upward revision was noticed in the last 30 days, while none of the analysts revised their estimates downward. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents moved up a cent over the last 30 days.For fiscal year 2012, out of the 8 analysts covering the stock, one positive revision was witnessed in the last 30 days, although the EPS estimate for fiscal 2012 remained at $1.39.Most of the analysts covering the stock are optimistic about the company's market share gains and presence in emerging markets, which will likely drive the top-line going forward. Moreover, the acquisitions in the field of CAD and gaming middleware sections will provide the company with long-term opportunities, particularly in the web-based communities that will likely boost the company's cloud offerings going forward.However, some analysts are cautious about the high exposure of the company in Europe (40% of revenues are derived from Europe), citing the lingering financial turmoil and gloomy macro-economic environment in the region.Autodesk posted a positive average earnings surprise of 4.02% in the trailing four quarters, implying that on average, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that magnitude in the stated period. Given the upward trend in positive surprises, the improving product line and growth prospects, we expect the company to post another positive surprise in the upcoming quarter.In our view, Autodesk's expanding product portfolio, and broadening industry application and geographic reach will help it sustain longer-term growth through the development of high-volume, lower-cost CAD software. We believe that this will likely drive earnings going forward.However, foreign exchange fluctuations, increasing exposure to Europe, and competition from  (  ) and  (  ) are the headwinds. Additionally, challenges in the form of customer concentration keep us in the sidelines for the time being.We have a Neutral recommendation on Autodesk's shares in the long term. Currently, Autodesk has a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates into a short-term (1-3 months) Sell rating. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) reported fourth quarter 2012 earnings of 37 cents per share, a penny shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, earnings per share, including stock-based compensation but excluding one-time charges increased 27.6% year over year on the back of revenue growth across all geographies and business segments.Revenues increased 12.3% year over year to $592.4 million in the reported quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $584.0 million. Revenues were also ahead of management's guided range of $575.0 million to $590.0 million.The year-over-year growth in revenues was driven by higher license and other revenues (62.5% of total revenue), which increased 12.3% from the year-ago quarter to $370.2 million. Maintenance revenues (37.5% of total revenue) rose 12.2% year over year to $222.2 million in the quarter. Moreover, robust business across all geographies, particularly from America, boosted revenues as well demand for suites in the quarter.On a segmental basis, Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) revenues jumped 18.0% year over year to $214.0 million in the reported quarter.Revenues from the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (  ) business segment were $175.0 million, up 8.0% year over year while Manufacturing revenues increased 11.0% year over year to $148.0 million in the quarter.

However, gross margin decreased 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 92.0%.Operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding one-time charges) increased 8.8% year over year to $434.8 million, primarily attributable to higher marketing & sales expenses (up 2.9% year over year) and research & development expenses (up 17.8% year over year). General and administrative expenses also increased 12.9% from the year-ago quarter. However, operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, contracted 230 bps to 73.4% in the quarter.Operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding one-time charges) of $110.4 million was up 25.9% year over year. Operating margin came in at 18.6% in the quarter, up 200 bps year over year, attributable to strong revenue growth and cost controls in the quarter.Autodesk's balance sheet remains strong with no debt. The company exited the fourth quarter of 2012 with total cash and cash equivalents of $1.16 billion compared with $1.34 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $175.0 million compared with $138.0 million in the prior quarter.For first quarter 2013, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $575.0 million to $590.0 million.

Autodesk expects non-GAAP operating margin to improve 130 bps annually in fiscal 2013. Moreover, management expects the tax rate for the first quarter of 2013 as well as fiscal 2013 to be 26.5%.In our view, Autodesk's expanding product portfolio and broadening industry and geographic reach will help it sustain its longer-term growth strategy of providing high-volume, lower-cost CAD software.

Fueling the bears is the latest report from Eurostat, which indicated that the combined gross domestic product (  ) of the 17-nation euro zone rose a meager 0.2% in the third quarter, exacerbating fears of a stalling regional economy. Echoing that angst,  have continued their rise above the benchmark 7% level, while 10-year Spanish bonds have soared 17 basis points amid re-emerging questions about the nation's fiscal fate. Against this backdrop -- and thanks to a lackluster earnings report from blue-chip bigwig Wal-Mart Stores (  ) -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is headed for another double-digit drop out of the gate.In earnings news, Home Depot (HD - 38.25) said third-quarter net income improved a year-over-year 12% to $934 million, or 60 cents per share. Revenue, meanwhile, rose 4.4% to $17.33 billion. The results exceeded expectations, with analysts calling for a per-share profit of 59 cents on sales of $17.11 billion. Meanwhile, HD also declared a dividend of 29 cents per share -- up 16% from its previous dividend -- and upped its fiscal 2012 earnings projection to $2.38 per share. Analysts, on average, are expecting a fiscal-year profit of just $2.36 per share. In pre-market action, HD is up 1.4%.Wal-Mart Stores (WMT - 58.89) collected a third-quarter profit of $3.34 billion, or 96 cents per share, down 2.7% from its year-ago earnings of $3.44 billion, or 95 cents per share. Meanwhile, revenue ramped up 8.1% to $110.23 billion. The mega-retailer fell short of analysts' bottom-line estimates, as Wall Street was anticipating a profit of 98 cents per share on $108.22 billion in revenue. Looking ahead, WMT predicted fourth-quarter earnings of $1.42 to $1.48 per share, and a full-year profit of $4.45 to $4.51 per share. Analysts are projecting a profit of $1.45 per share for the fourth quarter, and $4.50 per share for the full year. At last check, WMT is bracing for a 2% retreat.Elsewhere, Zagg Incorporated (ZAGG - 12.19) last night reported a third-quarter profit of $2.2 million, or 7 cents per share, compared to its year-ago profit of $3.9 million, or 16 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, earnings arrived at 16 cents per share. Revenue, meanwhile, soared 99% to $45.9 million. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 7 cents per share on revenue of $44.7 million. Heading into the holiday season, ZAGG upwardly revised its full-year revenue guidance to $170 million. By comparison, analysts are expecting full-year sales to total $168.5 million. Ahead of the bell, ZAGG is down 2.4%.Specialty retailer  (URBN - 26.83) said its third-quarter earnings fell to $50.7 million, or 33 cents per share, down 31% from its year-ago profit of $73.1 million, or 43 cents per share. Despite a 7% decrease in same-store sales, net sales rose 6.3% to $610 million. URBN's results were mixed, however, as analysts were looking for a profit of 32 cents per share on sales of $626.2 million.

Italian bond yields rose to a euro-era high of 6.2% during a Monday auction, suggesting that newly appointed technocrat Mario Monti has been saddled with quite a task in leading the country from the brink of default. The ongoing euro drama propelled the safe-haven yen higher, which weighed heavily on Japanese exporters. By the close, South Korea's Kospi declined 0.9%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.8%, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.7%, and China's Shanghai Composite managed to gain 0.04%.The major equity benchmarks are pointed south in Europe, with bond yields on Italian and Spanish debt both creeping toward uncomfortably high levels. Also weighing on sentiment is a dismal earnings report from Italy's UniCredit, which confessed to a hefty third-quarter loss of 10.64 billion euros.

Today offers up another test for the blue-chip barometer, as Wall Street must contend with retail sales, consumer inflation data, consumer sentiment, and a speech on \"Too Big To Fail\" by Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Given the past week's worth of poor economic data, traders are understandably a bit jittery heading into the open. Futures on the DJIA and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) are trading roughly 37 points and 5 points below fair value, respectively. Support for the Dow has materialized in the 10,300 region, with additional support from its 10-week trendline hovering just below the average. Resistance, meanwhile, should materialize near 10,350 if the bulls remain asleep, while 10,400 could step in to cap the DJIA if this year's tendency to rally on Fridays takes hold late in the session.In equity news, NVIDIA Corp.

Suvall, John A. Gibbons III and William Muggia.The fund's management team takes a fundamental, bottom-up approach to investing that carefully scrutinizes all aspects of the fund's current and potential holdings. The team builds earnings estimates internally and each member spends roughly 20 to 30 percent of their time on the road visiting the individual companies in the portfolio.\"We like to get to know the management teams to better assess the state and direction of the firms,\" Muggia said.Despite having a strict screening process, there's no specific calculated range in which a company's fundamentals must fall for consideration.Management has recently found significant opportunities in emerging markets. The team increased the fund's positions in the technology, industrials, energy and materials sectors, which now account for Touchstone Mid Cap Growth's largest sector weightings.\"We have the flexibility to move into whatever industry presents the strongest growth potential,\" Muggia said. \"These industries are where we expect the highest growth right now, whereas historically we looked to health care and consumer discretionary stocks.\"Management favors the energy sector because of what Muggia calls \"an undeniable lack of oil supply\" on a global basis. While oil prices have hit record highs, producers have failed to raise production to a commensurate level.The world's \"easy energy\" has already been exploited, requiring increasingly complex and expensive technologies to both find and drill for energy resources. Emerging-market economies will need massive amounts of resources of all stripes to fuel growth. All of this will only raise global demand for oilOil services companies such as Weatherford International (  ) are in the sweet spot to profit from these long-term trends. Future oil drilling will require more money to be allocated to servicing oil rigs. As pricing for these critical services increases, Weatherford and its peers will benefit greatly.In the technology space, management seeks companies with an attractive risk-reward spread through a barbell strategy that encompasses both fast-growing companies and conservative names. Firms like Red Hat (  ) or Akamai Technologies (  ) may not garner flashy headlines, but they're rapidly growing and increasing their market share.More conservative growers such as Autodesk (  ) and Nice Systems (  ) boast stable and dominant businesses, strong free cash flows and defensive market positions.The team is also bullish on industrials. This space suffered massive capacity losses as firms reduced their workforces and closed plants to survive the 2008-09 meltdown. But the sector is now getting back on track.\"Our industrials are some of the most well-known distributors in the industry,\" Muggia said, noting that many of these industrials have significant exposure to high-growth emerging markets.Management also believes that the materials sector provides exposure to the growth of food- and agriculture-related industries. One such company is Crown Holdings (CCK), a firm that packages consumer goods. Crown Holdings benefits from an expanding presence in Europe and the emerging markets. The stock represents a back-end play on a US economic recovery.Touchstone Mid Cap Growth is well-positioned to benefit from a recovery in cyclical sectors that will improve in step with the broad US economy. The automotive industry is one such sector that may surprise investors as the economy finds its footing.Muggia and his team have identified two non-traditional names that will benefit from the auto recovery: Solutia (SOA) and Lear Corp (NYSE: LER).Solutia is a specialty chemical company that produces plastic films for car electronics. The firm is also the leading provider of rubber chemicals used to manufacturer vehicle tires. As consumers regain confidence and purchases of cars and auto parts rises, demand for Solutia's products will increase. Management also likes the firm's exposure to emerging markets, where auto sales remain robust.Automotive supplier Lear Corp is gaining market share for key electronic components in new cars. The firm's productivity is strong as is its earnings growth potential.The fund favors a concentrated portfolio of around 50 holdings. As is the case with portfolio additions, management only sells holdings after a thorough and disciplined analysis.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe major market indexes have  , and are headed modestly higher this morning, as traders turn their attention to the domestic economic reports that are finally begin to roll in.

Ahead of the bell today, the bulls are set to resume the reins, with a slew of retailers shining in the earnings spotlight.

Geico, Allstate, Progressive, 21st Century... I'm not sure how they can all be the cheapest, but that's entirely another story.The point is, these messages don't really hit home with me. I'm fond of the Geico cavemen, but they don't compel me to switch insurance carriers.First, there's always the concern about whether the price comparisons are truly apples-to-apples when it comes to specific features and benefits. Even if one of these companies could save me a few dollars initially, what's to stop them from jacking up those premiums a few months down the line?Plus, I get multi-line discounts for having auto, homeowners and other policies with the same agency -- and switching might jeopardize those favorable rates I'm paying for other products. Finally, dealing with a new insurance agent can be a wild card, who knows how responsive they will be with claims and other customer service issues?And then there's the hassle of paperwork.Don't tell State Farm, but they could raise my premiums and I probably still wouldn't switch. The point is: Customers on the books tend to stay on the books. This can translate into big rewards for shareholders.Very few companies escaped last year's downturn unscathed. But for a handful, it was business as usual.Take  , for example, which handles billing and other services for cable and satellite TV providers like  and  . The company gets paid to mail out monthly statements to roughly half the households in the United States, and it processes about $3 billion in transactions every month.Setting up the firm's complex billing infrastructure can cost millions and take months to complete. Once a customer like  has made that type of commitment, it is usually very reluctant to take its business elsewhere. Most sign long-term multi-year contracts. As a result, CSG Systems has money coming in the door rain or shine.Despite a sharp plunge in consumer and business spending, the company posted a healthy +13% increase in revenue last year. Those improvements help explain why CSG Systems swam when the rest of the market sank like a rock. The shares delivered +19% in 2008, while the S&P 500 nosedived -38%.The stock is a prime example of how a sticky customer base can keep a company's stockholders happy in any environment.We all know that neighborhood gas stations have basically zero pricing power. It takes almost no effort to pull in next door to save a few cents a gallon, so pricing is cut-throat and margins are razor thin.At the other end, there are well-placed firms like CSG Systems that can milk their customers. Clients aren't going to throw away millions in upfront installation expenses and then spend time and money retraining its employees on a new system just to save a few bucks.As a result, the business tends to be highly stable.Banks and asset management companies often benefit in much of the same way. It's not that we couldn't find a cheaper checking account or better performing mutual fund somewhere else, but the headache of signing papers, transferring assets, filling out new direct deposit forms, etc. is enough to dissuade most of us from jumping ship.Simply put, these \"switching costs\" usually outweigh any benefit associated with moving to a competitor. . The company provides the software that process millions of ATM withdrawals, checking deposits and other transactions for banks and credit unions. It's not a glamorous business, but can you imagine the possible disruption of handing this critical behind-the-scenes task to a rival that might not be as reliable.Fiserv rarely loses customers -- the company boasts a near-perfect retention rate of 99%. That's a big reason why its shares have delivered an eye-popping gain in excess of +4,000% during the past two decades.There's no easy way to screen for a sticky customer base. Superior pricing power often shows up in lofty margins and robust returns on equity relative to industry peers. Along with CSG Systems and Fiserv, the companies in the table below are all worthy of consideration.a:link {color:#125AD3; } a:visited {color:#125AD3;}    Disclosure: Nathan Slaughter does not own shares of any security\nmentioned in this article.Nathan SlaughterEditor:Market AdvisorHalf-Priced StocksThe ETF AuthorityP.S.
