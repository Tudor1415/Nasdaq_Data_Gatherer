Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL for its part denounced the U.S. allegations and called the new measures \"arbitrary and pernicious.\" Established in 2004, HiSilicon develops chips mostly for Huawei, and for most of its existence has been an afterthought in a global chip business dominated by U.S., Korean and Japanese companies. Like most electronics firms, Huawei relied on others for the chips that powered its equipment.But heavy investment in research and development helped drive rapid progress at HiSilicon, and in recent years the 7,000-employee unit has been central to Huawei's rise as a dominant player in the global smartphone business and the emerging 5G telecom networking business.END", "A lot has changed since Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) kicked off its 2020 fiscal year with a rebound in sales after a U.S.-China trade war and memory chip market slump the year prior.

(Symbol: AMAT) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $0.88), with the stock changing hands as low as $36.64 on the day.  Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return.  To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back on 12/31/1999 \u2014 you would have paid $146.88 per share.  Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years.  But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%.  Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AMAT options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $53.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMAT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $60.46/share today.\n\nBecause the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.83% return on the cash commitment, or 16.97% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Applied Materials, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND", "Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) started 2020 with a bang, but the stock has pulled back of late. The impact of the coronavirus outbreak has forced major tech companies\u00a0to slash revenue guidance, and this has weighed on chip stocks as well. But the pullback at Applied Materials could be an opportunity in disguise, as the stock is slightly cheaper now than it was at the beginning of the year.AMAT data by YChartsApplied Materials' latest quarterly results and guidance give out a clear indication that the impressive rally clocked by the stock last year is here to stay. Applied Materials was a top growth stock last year; it smashed the broader market's performance by a convincing margin even though its revenue and earnings were heading in the wrong direction.And now that Applied Materials' top and bottom lines have started heading north, don't be surprised if the stock manages to improve upon its 2019 performance.END", "Wall Street analysts\u2019 wealth of experience and in-depth knowledge of the market can help investors determine whether to add a new name to a portfolio.

A slowdown in tech hardware started in 2018, sending shares into a tailspin and halving the value of the company -- only for signs of a rebound in the industry to send shares all the way back up and then some in the past year.After all is said and done, the roller coaster has still yielded shareholders a better than 90% return over the last trailing three-year stretch.
