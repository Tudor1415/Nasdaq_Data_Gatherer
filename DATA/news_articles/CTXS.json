At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTXS options chain for the new July 24th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $138.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.70.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $138.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $134.30 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTXS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $139.39/share today.\n\nBecause the $138.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.

The index, however, remains up 19% from its March 23 low. Much of Wall Street's recent recovery has been thanks to a $2 trillion package aimed at stimulating the economy as much of the country hibernates to slow the spread of the coronavirus.Still, many investors remained skeptical that Wall Street's recent rise represents the start of a sustained recovery.END", "Investors in Citrix Systems Inc (Symbol: CTXS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the May 22nd expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTXS options chain for the new May 22nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.30.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $129.70 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTXS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $138.03/share today.\n\nBecause the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.93% return on the cash commitment, or 31.15% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND", "In early trading on Monday, shares of Ulta Beauty topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 15.1%.

Several tech stocks are showing their worth as COVID-19 changes the technology industry. Some firms are already enjoying considerable upside amid various shifts, such as the implementation of \"social distancing,\" and should remain aloft as long as those efforts remain in play.
