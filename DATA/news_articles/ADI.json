By now, we all know the advantages that 5G will bring: faster connection times, lower latency, and improved connectivity \u2013 especially in networked systems and Internet of Things. First introduced at the end of 2017, 5G is going to dominate the digital landscape. The current crises \u2013 health and economic \u2013 have only slowed it down slightly.The major US providers \u2013 Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint/T-Mobile \u2013 have all introduced 5G coverage, at least in the largest urban markets.

Analog is well known for its data conversion and signal processing chips.END", "Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI) has made a nice recovery since the March crash on the back of a turnaround in the broader stock market, but the chipmaker's comeback isn't backed by a robust financial performance.The company had to pull its fiscal second-quarter guidance in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak that spawned uncertainty with respect to demand and disrupted supply chains. The novel coronavirus pandemic compounded Analog Devices' problems as the company was already witnessing a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business.ADI data by YChartsAnd now, the company's latest quarterly results and the accompanying guidance provide further evidence that a turnaround in its fortunes is still some way off.
