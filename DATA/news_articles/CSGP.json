One interesting put contract in particular, is the July 2020 put at the $510 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $19.20.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.8% return against the $510 commitment, or a 6.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to CSGP's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $510 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  (Do options carry counterparty risk?  This and six other common options myths debunked).  So unless CoStar Group, Inc. sees its shares fall 13.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $490.80 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $19.20 from $510), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6.1% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for CoStar Group, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $510 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\nEND", "Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.
