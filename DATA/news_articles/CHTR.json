And for good reason -- Netflix's subscriber headcount has grown from just under 38 million then to nearly 70 million U.S. and Canadian subscribers now. Digital market research house eMarketer estimates the country's cable industry has slimmed down from 100.5 million paying households to somewhere around 85 million customers now.

That is to say, what if the two options weren't as mutually exclusive of one another as we've been led to believe is inevitable?That may actually be the case, given some curious data from The Diffusion Group.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHTR options chain for the new June 26th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $505.00 strike price has a current bid of $20.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $505.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $484.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $511.63/share today.\n\nBecause the $505.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
