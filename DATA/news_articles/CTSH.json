At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTSH options chain for the new July 10th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $53.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $53.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $51.60 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTSH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $54.11/share today.\n\nBecause the $53.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.55% return on the cash commitment, or 30.15% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., and highlighting in green where the $53.50 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND", "By Anirban SenBENGALURU, May 18 (Reuters) - Top technology services firms are offering payment deferrals, discounts of up to 20% and other sweeteners to some U.S. banks to keep their business as the pandemic forces Wall Street to cut tech budgets, according to executives involved in the talks.Large Wall Street banks are widely expected to reduce overall budgets and discretionary tech spending, which includes areas such as technology consulting services, business analytics, research and design and process management projects.Accenture ACN.N, Tata Consultancy Services TCS.NS, Infosys INFY.NS and Cognizant Technology Solutions CTSH.O - among the world's largest tech services vendors - have offered to do more for them at lower rates, three executives who have taken part in the discussions told Reuters.The aim is to secure new contracts as well as to keep the relationships with the banks ticking over so that they can be expanded once more post-pandemic, they added.END", "Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 5/19/20, Assured Guaranty Ltd (Symbol: AGO), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTSH options chain for the new February 28th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $61.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.70.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $61.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $59.30 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTSH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $61.53/share today.\n\nBecause the $61.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
