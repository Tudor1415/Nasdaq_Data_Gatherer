{"Content": ["Investors in Cerner Corp. (Symbol: CERN) saw new options become available this week, for the July 17th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CERN options chain for the new July 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $62.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.35.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $62.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $60.15 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CERN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $65.16/share today.\n\nBecause the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 66%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.76% return on the cash commitment, or 21.78% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., and highlighting in green where the $62.50 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $67.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.30.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CERN stock at the current price level of $65.16/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $67.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.12% if the stock gets called away at the July 17th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CERN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CERN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $67.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $67.50 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.53% boost of extra return to the investor, or 20.45% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 37%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 32%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $65.16) to be 28%.

Cerner assumes no Obligation to update any forward-looking statements Or information except as required by law.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brent Shafer, Chairman and CEO of Cerner Corporation. You may begin. -- Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and Welcome to the call. And before we start, I'd just Like to express our appreciation for you being with Us and hope that you and your families are healthy And safe. Like most of you, we're doing this call from Different remote locations, so please bear with us If we have any technical challenges today. We'll do The best we can to make it smooth. I'll spend the First few minutes from just giving my thoughts about The business and our current environment, then hand It over to the leadership team, including our CFO Marc Naughton; Chief Client and Services Officer John Peterzalek; and President, Don Trigg. So as we all know, it'd be an understatement to say That this was an eventful quarter. It's been Extreme. Since we talked at our last virtual Investment community meeting, the week HIMS was Canceled, the corona virus pandemic has affectedNearly all aspects of our daily lives. And in Mid-March, we made the decision to transition our Associates to a remote workplace. As part of our Long-standing business continuity plans, we moved Seamlessly, the vast majority of our 27,000 Associates, to a virtual environment, and we've been Really pleased with the productivity and performance Since taking this important step. So first and foremost, I'd like to express my Appreciation for the incredible dedication of all Cerner associates working tirelessly while balancing Home commitments to ensure that we're delivering on Our mission during this critical time. The driver of Our associates to support our clients and improve Health care has always been impressive. But over the Past six weeks, it's been simply humbling. I'm Grateful for all our associates who do it for Cerner And for our clients. In addition to enacting our virtual workforce Continuity plans, we also immediately activated a COVID-19 task force to inform our clinical business and operational decision-making. This task force has regular interactions with the CDC, the World Health Organization, and other global health agencies to guide their input. And protecting the health and wellbeing of our associates is a paramount concern as they provide critical support to Cerne's global client base.Doing never before has our mission been brought more to life than in these last couple of months. Cerner has engaged rapidly to support healthcare providers around the world as they respond on the front lines. You may have read in the United Kingdom, for example, there's been tremendous pressure on the ability of the national health service to manage surging demands for care. And Cerner teams have worked around the clock with the NHS clients to provide digital innovation and technology to stand up 4,000-bed temporary hospital. So the Nightingale field hospital sits on 100 acre repurposed convention center and is fully utilizing Cerner's Millennium platform visit Our clients by hardening our infrastructure to Fortify capacity, increase uptime and provide Greater flexibility of the system. We recognize the Importance of their routine -- excuse me, of their Frontline work and have prioritized Cerner resources To ensure client system stability. I've talked -- I personally talked with many health Systems CEOs in recent weeks who've witnessed Cerner's swift actions and are very appreciative of Our tireless efforts. Another important role for Cerner during this Pandemic has been to effectively, securely and Responsibly use our vast data stores to provide Actionable insights. We're working with the CDC to Participate in surveillance network that can better Scope and mitigate the impact of COVID-19.And so Far, nearly 1/3 of Cerner's clients have given Consent to provide de-identified data to the Surveillance network. We're also providing health systems and researchers Access to Cerner's healthy data lab. That's a Next-generation secure research tool. Healthy data Labs sits on the AWS cloud platform. It enables Researchers to query healthcare data to identify Demographics, spread trends, underlying Conditions, treatments and outcomes that could drive Future decisions. This solution has been well Received by existing clients, a number of Researchers and charitable organizations, including The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Last week, we partnered with the U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs Organizations on a Successful go-live of a joint health information Exchange that supports each department's efforts to Combat COVID-19 through simplified and streamlined Data sharing when they need it most. The exchange Allows DoD and VA providers to access and retrieve Consolidated records from community partners or Health systems, providing them a standardized, more Holistic view of the patient's health.This is the Crucial advancement in Cerner's continued efforts Advocating for and developing open cognitive Platforms to deliver true interoperability. DoD and VA will further advance nationwide interoperability Via the HIE by connecting to the CommonWell Health Alliance of 15,000 community providers later this Year. This is yet another example of Cerner Delivering on its vision of a seamless and connected World, which, of course, has taken on greater Importance since the outbreak of COVID-19. There are challenging months ahead. Cerner is Prepared to support our clients, associates and Communities where we live and work. This crisis has Validated our strategies and underscores that we'll Need to work at an even greater pace to provide Innovation, technology and data analysis across many Care venues. Whether it's in traditional care Settings, field hospitals or a remote Telehealth Environment, Cerner's technology will be prominent In the support of our clients.The future of how healthcare is delivered will Undoubtedly change as we navigate beyond this Pandemic. Rules around reimbursements, for example Will need to be reevaluated as virtual care becomes More of a normal course for the physician-patient Relationship. Additionally, increasing adoption of Telehealth during this crisis also emphasizes the Continued need for providers to opt into national Data exchange frameworks by CommonWell. To that end We are pleased that more than half of our acute Provider clients are active participants on the Common Well network. More than anything, the world's collective response To COVID-19 makes me proud of the -- to be Affiliated with so many healthcare professionals. And today, at Cerner, we employ nearly 2,000 Clinical associates including 800 nurses Approximately 200 physicians, over 200 pharmacists And many other clinical technicians and Therapists. Dozens of them had volunteered to work In acute settings in the U.S. and U.K. We've also Had many associates who heroically serve as Volunteer paramedics during their off hours at Cerner. As for the results, I'm pleased we delivered a solid First quarter with only minor impacts from the early Stages of the pandemic. As Marc will discuss, we do Expect a bigger impact the rest of the year Particularly in the second quarter. However, we're Fortunate to have a resilient business model Relevant technology for healthcare and a solid Transformation plan that we continue to advance, all Of which positions us to manage through the pandemic With less impact than many other companies.And now I'll hand the call over to Marc to take you Through the numbers. -- Thanks, Brent. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going To cover our Q1 results and share our current views On the impact of COVID-19. This quarter, we Delivered bookings and revenues slightly below our Expectations due to some impact of COVID-19, but our Ongoing expense control helped drive earnings at the High end of our guidance. As we'll discuss, we do Expect an impact on our results for the rest of the Year, but we are taking several steps to mitigate The impact and currently expect most of it to be in Q2. Now I'll open Q1 results, starting with bookings Which were $1.09 billion and just below our guidance Range as we saw a lower-than-normal volume of Contracts signed in the last two weeks of the quarter Due to our clients rightfully shifting their full Focus to caring for patients amid the coronavirus Outbreak. Looking to the quarter, we're on track to come in at The high end or above our guidance range prior to The upgrade and the resulting business Disruptions. These opportunities remain in our Pipeline, and we believe we will close in the future Quarters as the global environment stabilizes. We Ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $13.47 Billion, which is down 9% from a year ago Primarily due to the termination of a revenue Agreement that I discussed on our Q3 call as well as The lower level of bookings in the first quarter.Our backlog revenue, combined with other contracted Revenue, is excluded from the ASC 606 backlog Definition, provides revenue visibility of Approximately 85% over the next 12 Months. Obviously, additional delays on being able To work the services backlog could impact when the Backlog rolls out, but this is consistent with our Current view. Revenue in the quarter was $1.41 billion, up 2% over Q1 of '19. This is slightly below our expectations But would have been comfortably in our guidance Range if it weren't for lower technology resale and Software bookings and lower reimbursed travel Revenue related to the COVID-19 crisis. I'll now go through the business model detail and Year-over-year growth compared to Q1 of '19. Licensed software revenue in Q1 grew 2% over Q1 of '19 million to $158 million, primarily due to strong growth In our SaaS offerings, offset by a decline in Traditional license software attributable to lower Bookings in the quarter. Technology resale of $51 Million in Q1 was also impacted by the lower level Of bookings, decreasing 7% compared to Q1 of '19. Subscriptions revenue grew 12% in Q1 to $94 Million. Professional services revenue grew 4% in Q1 To $511 million, primarily driven by solid growth in Implementation services and partially offset by $42 Million less outsourcing revenue due to the Termination of the RevWorks agreement we previouslyDiscussed. Managed services was up 2% in Q1 to $309 Million, in line with our expectations. Support and Maintenance of $274 million was down 1% Year-over-year, flat to last quarter, which is our Expectation range and reflects the impact of Attrition and reduced hardware maintenance revenue. And finally, reimbursed travel of $13 Million was down 43% in Q1 due to travel Restrictions that went into place mid-March. Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic Revenue was up 1% from the year ago quarter at $1.25 Billion and non-U.S. revenue of $165 million was Up 4% from the year-ago quarter. Moving to gross Margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 82%, up from 80.8% in Q4 of '19 and 81.8% Year-over-year, with the improvement primarily Driven by the reduction in outsourcing and Reimbursed travel revenue, slightly offset by higher Third-party services.Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin and net Earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and Adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results Exclude share-based compensation expense Acquisition-related adjustments, organizational Restructuring and other expenses, COVID-19-related Expense and other adjustments that are detailed and Reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter GAAP operating expenses of $979 million were up 4% Compared to $939 million and in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating expenses were down 1% Compared to Q1 of '19, primarily resulting from our Cost optimization efforts. Looking at the line items for Q1. Sales and client Service expense decreased 2% year-over-year Primarily driven by a decrease in personnel Expense. Software development expense increased 3% Over Q1 of '19 as gross R&D was essentially flat Amortization increased by 8%, and capitalized Software was down 1%. G&A expense in Q1 was down 5% Driven by a decline in both personnel and Non-personnel expenses. Moving to operating margins.Our GAAP operating Margin in Q1 was 12.6% compared with 14.2% in the Year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin for The quarter was 19.4%, up from 17.5% in Q1 of '19 Reflecting the impact of our cost optimization Efforts and improved revenue mix. As I'll discuss When I get to guidance, we do expect the pandemic to Impact our results for the rest of the year. While We remain on track with our planned cost Optimization efforts and are implementing additional Measures to mitigate the impact of the crisis, we do Not expect to fully offset the impact. As a result We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to Be around or slightly below 20% compared to our Previous expectation that we could be closer to 21%. I'd note that this would still reflect Approximately 150 basis points of full year margin Expansion, which we view as impressive given the Extreme circumstances.For Q4, we currently expect our operating margin to Be 50 to 100 basis points below our 22.5% target Reflecting the reality that even with going beyond Our original optimization targets, we won't fully Offset the top line impact of COVID-19 by the end of The year. Similar to the full year, this would Reflect strong margin expansion of approximately 150 Basis points compared to Q4 of '19, which was our Strongest margin quarter of the year. We also believe the framework for ongoing margin Expansion we shared at our Investor Day remains Valid, and we expect to continue improving margins Beyond this year as we implement additional Optimization efforts and aim to realize a Longer-term opportunity to benefit from platform Modernization. Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net Earnings in Q1 were $147 million or $0.47 per Diluted share, which is down from $0.51 in Q1 of '19. Adjusted net earnings in Q1 were $223 million. And adjusted diluted EPS was $0.71 compared to $0.61 In Q1 of '19. Both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates Were 20% for the quarter. For the remainder of 2020 We continue to expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax Rates to be between 20% and 22%. Moving to our balance sheet. We remain in a solid Position, which is good given the uncertain Environment.We ended Q1 with $399 million of cash And short-term investments and $1.34 billion of debt After deploying $650 million for share repurchases And $56 million for dividends. Our debt of $300 Million issued in Q1 and 2.5% to 10 years under our Shelf agreement. In our relatively low leverage, we Remain well positioned to access additional capital As needed to support our growth and capital Allocation strategy. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.15 Billion, essentially flat relative to the $1.14 Billion in Q4 of '19. Our Q1 DSO was 74 days, which Is up from 72 days in Q4 of '19 and Down from 76 Days in the year-ago period. We expect some impact On collections from COVID-19 in the near to Intermediate term. This impact is difficult to Measure, but we do not currently expect it to Materially impact our operations and view it as more Of a timing issue than a collectibility issue.Operating cash flow for the quarter was $284 Million. Q1 capital expenditures were $49 million And capitalized software was $74 million. Free cash Flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital Purchases and capitalized software development Costs, was $160 million for the quarter. For Q2, we expect lower operating and free cash flow As we believe that is when our cash collections may Be most impacted and is also a seasonally high Quarter for our capital expenditures. We expect both Operating and free cash flow to improve in the Second half of the year based on our assumption that The impact of the pandemic will moderate after Q2. Moving to capital allocation. We repurchased 9.2 Million shares in the first quarter for $650 Million. That brings our total for the past 12 Months to 28 million shares repurchased for $1.95 Billion at an average price of $69.59.This exceeded Our initial plan to repurchase $1.5 billion of Shares by the end of Q1 '20 and leaves us with $1.03 Billion remaining on our current Authorization. Given the uncertain nature of the Current environment and our significant level of Repurchases in Q1, we expect to pause our repurchase Activity for now, but we'll continue to evaluate our Program, which may also be impacted by the amount of Funding used for other purposes such as acquisitions And investments. Moving to our dividend program. We paid a dividend In Q1 of $0.18 per share or $56 million. I realize Some companies have suspended their dividend due to The pandemic, but our strong financial position Allows us to continue our dividend program, subject To board approval. Before moving to guidance, I'd like to comment on The announcement we made in February that Compugroup Medical agreed to purchase certain Cerner assets in Germany and Spain. This transaction is consistent With the portfolio management activities we've been Discussing will provide over $200 million after Working capital and other closing adjustments for Ongoing capital allocation and allow us to focus on Profitable growth in our core non-U.S. regions. The Transaction is expected to close in early Q3 Subject to certain closing conditions.We affected In approximately $40 million less revenue into our Full year guidance to reflect this timing. These Assets are profitable, but we expect to largely Offset the impact on earnings with cost optimization Efforts. We expect to remain active in M&A and portfolio Management this year as we continue to align our portfolio with our growth strategy. Moving to guidance. While it is not possible to Precisely quantify the extent to which the COVID-19 Pandemic will affect our business operations and Financial results going forward, we believe it is Helpful to investors to provide our current view of Expected results for the second quarter and full Year. Our business is generally resilient with Significant recurring elements. And I would comment That this guidance is subject to a Higher-than-normal amount of risk, given the Unprecedented environment which we are operating.Now I'll go through the guidance with some Additional commentary on how we are factoring in the Expected impact of the pandemic. For Q2, we expect Revenue to be between $1.34 -- $1.34 billion and $1.39 billion. The $1.365 billion midpoint of this Range is approximately $95 million less than our Original plan for Q2, representing the biggest Expected impact of the pandemic. Not only half of This impact is in professional services, which is Expected to have lower utilization in Q2 due to Several pass on delayed projects that can't be fully Worked remotely. We expect utilization to improve in Q3 and Q4. Most of the remaining impact is lower Expected levels of software, technology resale and Reimbursed travel revenue. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.55 Billion and $5.7 billion, with the $5.625 billion Midpoint reflecting a 1% decrease from 2019. This is Down approximately $225 million from our previous Midpoint of $5.85 billion. Approximately $40 million Of this reduction is due to the expected Q3 closing Of our global divestiture, which is expected to Reduce both Q3 and Q4 revenue by approximately $20 Million. We believe the remaining $185 million Reduction is largely attributable to COVID. The rough breakdown of this impact is $30 million Already realized in Q1; $95 million expected impact In Q2, which I discussed; and $60 million of Additional expected impacts spread over Q3 and Q4. One note on revenue growth. Recall that our full Year revenue is also impacted by us executing a Large RevWorks contract in late 2019.If you adjust For this and the global divestiture, our expected 2020 growth rate will be 2%. Adjusting out the Revenue from our AbleVets acquisition would bring Pure organic revenue growth back to 1%. But we don't View all of the revenue from AbleVets as inorganic Because we are leveraging their associates on the VA Contract as it ramps up. As I mentioned, there could be additional portfolio Management and M&A activity this year that could Further impact revenue. Overall, 2020 remains a Reset year for our top line, and the unexpected Addition of the COVID-19 pandemic amplifying the Magnitude of that resale. Moving to EPS. We expect Q2 adjusted diluted EPS to Be $0.60 to $0.64 per share. The Met midpoint of This range is 6% lower than Q2 of '19, reflecting The expected impact on the pandemic. We expect Adjusted diluted EPS to return to growth after Q2. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to Be $2.78 to $2.90, with a $2 -- $40 -- $2.84 Midpoint, reflecting 6% growth over 2019. This is Down from the previous range of $3.09 to $2.19, and Due to the projected impact of pandemic, with about Half of the impact related to the second quarter Guidance. Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings Revenue in Q2 of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The Midpoint of this range reflects a 23% decrease Compared to the second quarter of 2019, reflectingOur expectation of sales activity will be most Impacted in Q2, with improvements expected later in The year. Now I'd like to discuss the assumptions that Factored into our guidance and how we are Approaching the rest of the year. As I mentioned Our current expectation is that the largest impact Of the pandemic will occur in the second quarter due Primarily to lower expected sales activity and the Impact of multiple project delays and pauses that Result in lower utilization or professional services Resources. We do expect projects and sales Activities to begin improving in the second half of The year, assuming the impact of the pandemic and Related restrictive measures subside during the Second quarter but there's still an impact through Q4 as the project delays and lower bookings expected In the middle quarters will flow-through impact on Future orders.We are mitigating the impact to the Extent possible by shifting services resources to Other work on our backlog that can be done with less Client engagement and doing as much work remotely as Possible. We've also identified optimization Opportunities beyond the significant amount we Already have in place. We believe taking more Aggressive measures could impact our ability to Deliver our IP commitments and meet project demand As our clients reengage. We also don't think it Makes sense to reduce our capacity too much now Given our expectation that activity will pick up as We move through the year. In summary, this is an unprecedented and very fluid Situation. We are constantly testing our Assumptions. We'll adjust as needed throughout the Year, but we feel like our current guidance captures A reasonable range of scenarios. The midpoint Reflects our assumption that project activity beginsTo ramp in late Q2. Our low of employs room first for Lower return to normal sales and project activity And our high end captures a scenario where clients Reengage sooner. In conclusion, we are pleased we were able to Deliver solid results in the first quarter despite The initial impact of COVID-19. While the pandemic Has decreased our financial outlook for the Remainder of the year, we're still pleased that we Are projecting solid margin expansion and earnings Growth in a very challenging environment, which Would have been very difficult if we hadn't Implemented our new operating model, started putting Optimization that was in place last year.With that, I'll turn the call over to John. -- Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I Will provide results, highlights and an update on Our federal business. I'll start with our bookings. As Marc mentioned, we delivered very solid bookings Given the circumstances, and we were on track to Come in at the high end or above our guidance range Prior to the outbreak and the resulting business Disruptions. We do not believe these opportunities Will be lost, and we expect to close them in future Quarters as the environment stabilizes. Highlights of the quarter were a large expansion With the investor-owned client that purchased our EHR solutions for 11 additional sites to displace two Different competitors, a strong contribution from Our federal business and a large client purchasing Care Aware Connect, our care team communication Offering, for 25 sites. We had a lower level of Long-term bookings compared to last year, which Contributed to the decline in overall bookings. For the quarter, the percent of bookings coming from Long-term contracts was 27% compared to 30% in Q1 of Last year.Moving to our federal update. Many of you have seen Headlines about pauses in the DoD and VA projects Due to the COVID pandemic. Like the vast majority of Our clients, they've had to shift attention to the COVID-19 pandemic. We're doing all we can to support Them during this time, including reducing Interaction with the frontline staff, enabling them To focus on their patients and ensuring they have The key technology capabilities they need. The program continues to progress as we actively Work and push forward on critical elements Including virtual deployment activities, technical Build, interfaces and program management. Further Evidence of the continued progress with both VA and DoD is the recent HIE go-live that Brent discussed. As we look to future deployments, we are currently Working with both programs to revise time lines Accordingly, but we believe the impact is manageable And we have factored it into the guidance Marc Shared. Looking at the broader marketplace, as Marc And Brent discussed, we are in an unprecedented Environment. While this has created some disruption To business activity in the near term, I've been Pleased that a clear message we are hearing by our Clients is they want to move forward with their Strategic plans, and Cerner is an essential part ofTheir strategies. The time frame for some clients Remain uncertain as they work through the various Stages of the COVID surge and recovery. However, the Message is clear, they need Cerner to help advance Their initiatives and strategy. In the near term, we are focused on supporting our Clients in any way we can with a focus on supporting Those experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases. We're Also advancing projects by doing as much work Remotely as possible. In the short time we've been Doing this, we've learned a lot about how we can -- How much work can be done remotely and our clients' Willingness to engage virtually. Not only is this Helping us mitigate the financial impact of the Pandemic. These represent an opportunity to rethink How we approach projects going forward. I believe we Will walk to a model that requires less travel and Less on-site presence, which will save Cerner and Our clients time and money. More broadly, the pandemic has created a heightened Focus on a need for interoperability, secure access To information, analytics and other needs that align With our capabilities. We believe this could be a Catalyst for an industry to move faster to realize The potential that has yet to be realized from a Base level of digitization that it was established During the meaningful era, not doing so would be a Missed opportunity. Another reason we're cautiously optimistic about Business activity being able to resume is we believe The funding providers receive from the Cares Act help them recover from the significant near-term Impact of the pandemic and put them in a better Position to move forward with prime projects and Consider new ones as they look to address needs that Have been identified during this crisis. In summary, I'm pleased with that we have managed Through this pandemic to date, and I believe that in The long run, this will lead to healthcare further Embracing technology.With that, I'll turn the call Over to Donn. -- Thanks, John. In his opening comments, Brent framed the impact of the pandemic on our clients, our associates and our communities where we work and live. I want to talk for a few minutes this afternoon about what we believe the COVID crisis will mean for healthcare, and our work is systemically transformative. The impact of any crisis is an acceleration of macro trends already playing out. The government became the top regulator in payer for healthcare in the 2010s. We think COVID will accelerate Washington's ground role. Health system consolidation has been a multiyear trend, we believe it will accelerate in the quarters to come. The home is a venue to include teleservices has had a quickening adoption curve. The pandemic has already accelerated it. From behavioral health to deployment value of the cloud acceleration of existing forces of change is the no known of any crisis.As we think about our strategies for capital allocation, we look for areas with significant macro trend, clearly understood regulatory requirements leverage from existing Cerner assets, high gross margin business models and speed to revenue. It's created a set of strategic growth businesses that in the main are important to pandemic response and essential for durable recovery. Within the four walls of a hospital, our real-time hospital system solutions are comprised of enterprise communication, hospital operations and workforce and capacity management. As providers have served to deliver additional supply, our Care Aware capacity management and clear via solutions are -- have had a significant impact servicing data sets to drive real-time decision making on workforce equipment and bed management. Outside the hospital, our EMR agnostic healthy and test platform also has been crises response. Health Intent aggregates it normalizes the central information set to include clinical administrative and geospatial data.Our HealtheIntent team developed and fully deployed pivots and drum in surveillance, all clients and jeopardy St. Joseph Helin New Jersey called it a key tool in the arsenal. As our clients move from prices response to durable recovery, these same tools can help restart their health systems and larger health networks. We believe these reactivation campaigns will drive critical revenue recovery, and over time, be part of how our clients remained their larger health network strategies and business model. We also believe these physical and virtual health networks will be a medium-term tailwind for cyber security. For all the disruptive promise of data liquidity, alternative venues of care like the home and new staffing models to support them, secure protection of health information will be paramount. And as policymakers increasingly view healthcare as critical infrastructure for national security, cyber will be further elevated. Our latest announcement with Fortified Health gives us a compelling total solution offering and the business is on path for another solid year. Beyond the health network, our data business has also continued their momentum.The release of information business signed multiple new legal and life insurance clients in the first quarter. In addition, our Cerner Learning Health network in the life sciences and pharmaceutical space also made solid progress. And his team have grown our learning health network to represent one of the largest clinical data sets in the U.S. with 89 million de-identified patients and over 11.5 billion lab results. We leave the first quarter confident in our ability to drive strong year-over-year organic growth. Finally, our efforts across the enterprise, the health network and the larger health economy center on the person. David Bracho and his consumer treating drove strong bookings in Q4 and again in Q1. Our digital experience platform is helping clients connect and deliver important continuity amid the pandemic disruption.And in the first quarter, Event is Health launched a new digital patient experience built on the Cerner consumer framework. It moves us one step closer to the digital front door for health and care that we believe consumers are seeking. In his recent shareholder letter, Jamie Dimon said entering into a crisis is not a time to figure out where you want to be. Prices don't just accelerate existing trends, the optic opportunity to shake and lead them. The crisis response to provider organizations worldwide has had an impact on every Cerner associate. We've been humbled by the efforts of frontline caregivers and see what we call the Spirit of Cerner and our businesses like Workforce Health, where we're directly supporting essential workers. The pursuit of a durable recovery for its part will once again place our technologies and services front and center. We look forward to that challenge and that opportunity in the quarters to come.And with that, I'll turn the call over for questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open. -- Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Yes just wanted to ask really about how you're thinking about this durable recovery. I think yourself along with many other companies as we've seen them report so far, looking at 2Q as the worse. And obviously, to a degree, is getting better as we get through the course of the year. But when you think about your clients, particularly hospitals, as they are -- you'd be sort of, I guess, a derivative impact as they kind of get their business back online, how do you see sort of that kind of time frame in terms of when they start recovering to when you'd think they'll start spending? And do things like the stimulus plan and the Cares Act, do those funds, do you see them helping that mitigate some of the impact in terms of sort of a spending slowdown you might expect otherwise? -- Yes. This is Marc. I think the primary impact on us is our services business, which a lot of that in the implementation project. Many of our clients that were forced to pause a project or defer start are eager to get on with those projects. And I think everything that's going on currently is emphasizing and how important these projects are for them further operations to operate more efficiently. Certainly, the Cares Act and likely subsequent stimulus packages are going to help our clients be financially able to go ahead and run their businesses. I think the fact that in the U.S., we've seen how critical healthcare really is and how many -- how it's important that we have adequate healthcare and adequate number of beds and adequate facilities. So the funding of healthcare, we believe, is likely to be maintained or strengthened. And we think our clients are going to be looking at, as Donn mentioned in his comments, for something that not only helped them respond but also recover and then take advantage of what the next opportunities are than some of them wouldn't sort have opened, such as tele health and other things. -- This is John. I think we're at our best when we're aligned with our clients around business strategy and this has put us front and center in terms of that dialogue with our clients. And I think that's a structural advantage that we have because our systems are heavily deployed and are mission critical. And so what we're really talking about with clients now is how can we be relevant to COVID response, but we're having a parallel conversation around how can they begin to think about our strategies around recovery. And many of those solutions that are part of response, the Care Aware Solutions suite that I used as an example, it's a great use case. We're working on search capacity and how they think about management of their supply side, but those are the same tools and capabilities that are going to be relevant to them in terms of how they think about medium-term strategies to manage the expense line, to think about labor and workforce strategies and what it looks like to make money at Medicare and at Medicaid rates. So I think we're -- relevant to COVID response, we're going to be central to those economic recovery strategies and those revenue recovery strategies. And if we're smart, we'll play into larger strategies around the efforts of our clients to rethink their business strategies on a multiyear basis. -- And maybe just to follow-up real quick. In that $1 billion to $1.2 billion bookings guidance for next quarter, maybe is it possible to give us a sense on maybe how much of the mix, in your expectations for new sales, is shifting to more of a coved response more of how do you realign your business post pandemic versus what you might have expected, let's say, business planning at the start of the year? -- Yes. This is Marc. John, you want to -- Yes. I mean, I've commented on what we're looking at in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion in bookings, it frankly isn't much different than we normally see. It's -- and in terms of what our clients are doing in and when they're willing to engage in their strategy. It's a little bit by depending on where you are in the world, depending on where you are geographically in the U.S. in terms of when you start. But the mix isn't much different than we normally see in any quarter. It's just that the volumes are a little bit off from what we'd see in a normal quarter. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Your line is open. -- Thank you. I want to continue on the assumption on purchasing activity and maybe a different tack, which is you've been through a couple of recessions in 2001, 2008 experience might be helpful as we think about how hospitals will manage through what goes beyond the COVID experience? Can we start with that? -- Sure. This is Marc. I may be the the old guy in the room, I remember all of those. Clearly, back on '07 '08 time frame, the capital markets shut down in healthcare didn't have access to cash for an extended period of time. That just shut the big it off. I think what you're seeing now is much of healthcare economically is doing OK prior to this environment. We believe that the stimulus packages will help them get back on their feet post this environment. So I think, in my mind, this is much different from those in that this is a relatively short-term-defined event where they're going to be providing care to their patients. They don't have the cycles to go work on their infrastructure. We believe that will dissipate. And as we kind of get out, start rolling out in Q2, that will be reengaged and with an even a higher level of passion on taking advantage of some of the opportunities. A lot of these projects were already in flight and we slowed. Some of them were still working on actually because if you look at -- we really look at the revenue impact that we're talking about for Q2, we're still delivering 90% of our services growth. It's still a significant amount of that revenue coming through we're working in remote another way. So from our expectation, I don't see them stopping that as we saw in the '07, '08 time frame. I think this is different to me, my experience would be a little bit more short-term in nature, we should finish coming pretty strong out of us. And once people are really ready to reengage or ready to engage in contract discussions, engage in project activity. -- Yes. The only other thing I would say is you tend to see a sector-specific orientating to the previous downturn. So focus on the transportation sector in a material way, post 9/11, financial sector, in '07 and '09. I think one of the focal points for government emphasis here will be the provider supply side, and it will feature in a meaningful way in terms of their thinking and approach. And in particular, sort of thinking about our provider supply side clients as critical infrastructure. And it's probably too early to sort of describe what that would mean from a government focus perspective. But that's a perspective we share and that we think our technology strategies will help enable. -- That's helpful. And the services element, is that primarily that today, you don't want to take up the cycles and attention? Or is there a need to reinvent some of the model for services that really were always delivered on the ground, it may not be now? Well, certainly, it's a little bit of both, John? -- Yes. I think it's a good point because as we're working through a different new normal right now, I think both us and our clients are looking at different ways to deliver the services. As we've mentioned in the previous question, it's important to note that the majority of our clients have not stopped their projects. We continue to make progress, and we're working on new and innovative ways to deliver those services. And I do believe we'll see a new normal evolve, both the impact and realities of today as we gradually come back to work. But I give -- I give a lot of credit to our clients and how we work with our clients that we've been able to work very effectively virtual. And I think some of that have become the new normal.Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. And let me commend you on the work that Cerner does just to keep hospitals running efficiently during the pandemic. A couple of questions here. First, I guess, given that a lot of hospitals still have fiscal years that end on September 30, I guess I'm curious if there's any variables in your guidance for the full year that, with the reset of some hospital budgets for their fiscal '21, starting October one this year, that your calendar 4Q that could see some rebounding results tied to that? Or is it more related just to the flow of volume across the overall acute care hospital customer base? -- Yes. This is Marc. None of our guidance is obviously tied to our forecasting process. We go through each opportunity based on when the clients can engage or when we think the processes are going to result in a completed contract. We didn't see a lot of changes or any thoughts around budget processes. Our clients are very busy providing care to people in need. So what we've done is what we always do, laid out forecast data, pull it into a projection, and that's where we bake our guidance on. We provide a little wider range, just to give us some room for upside and downside relative to what could happen. But there isn't anything that's inside the healthcare purchasers relative to them changing their view as to their purchasing behavior at this point. -- Okay. One other quick one. This one is kind of tough to ask about or answer a little bit. But I guess, a big picture, from our view, there seems to be a very strong amount of federal liquidity and stimulus relief being provided to the overall customer base. But I guess from your perspective, is there any concern that you see in relation to either solvency of hospitals and/or clients in the ambulatory setting? Or do you think there's also enough federal liquidity in stimulus to avoid that sort of risk? I mean how do you think about that just in general in this environment? -- I think the -- to your point, I think it's incredibly difficult to speculate. So I can't share that view. Having said that, we do think that there's an accelerating impact that the current environment is having, I think one of the things that is going to accelerate is the level of hospital consolidation. And so that is going to extend out into the ambulatory, and our vernacular, the health network space. So I think you're going to see trends around practice and larger health system consolidation as a meaningful feature of what the landscape looks like over the next 24 to 36 months. And what we need to be doing is thinking about HealtheIntent and our HealtheIntent platform as a key enabling technology for the integration strategies that need to feature in those acquisition approaches. It was built, it was purpose-built as an EHR-agnostic platform and is very well suited to the kinds of strategies that will be required to make those practice acquisitions work inside a larger clinically integrated network. So we think there is a trend there. We think it's a trend that probably accelerates, and we need to be smart and effective in terms of positioning HealtheIntent, our capabilities to make it work. -- Okay, all right. Appreciate the extra color. Thank. You[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Good evening. Thanks for taking my question.I guess, and I know this is doubling down on some of what's already been asked, but on the pro services front, since that seems to be the area where things are relatively weak incrementally, are there some activities where it's just not possible to do them remotely? Or is this really a question of coming up with creative solutions, or maybe the client having the staffing available to kind of work with your people to get the work done? If you could just qualitatively touch on that, that would be great. -- Yes. This is John. I'll expand on that a little bit. Yes, there are things that you really can't do virtually. So you can't do everything virtually. If you think about a large activation or those type of things, those tend to be people-heavy type of go-lives, and likely so, because of the patient safety aspects and those type of things. So where you see some of the challenges being is if you're a mid-project working along, you tend to go on course and continue as is. As you get closer to activation, depending on where you are and the possibility of being able to come back on-site and those type of things, you may see pushes of go-lives as you get closer. But that's the primary issue that's pretty difficult to do virtually. However, I will say that we have done some virtual activations at some of our all smaller projects, and they've actually gone well. So it will be a combination of both, but the expectation there is you can't do everything virtual. -- Okay, thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. -- So another follow-up there, but on guidance. Does your guidance today reflect kind of the maximum amount of conversion to remote activity in professional services? Or would there be upside there? And then maybe sneak in a second part of the question would be, is we're calculating incremental detrimental margin of low 40s. Is that reflective of your decision to keep professional services employees fully employed? Or is that more a mix of the revenue that's coming out? -- Yes, this is Marc. Yes, the impact, which might not been fully realized by some investors, is that when the revenue from those services go away, because of we think the relatively near-term nature of the impact, we are not reducing our workforce. In the normal world, we would adjust our professional services workforce to match the demand. And you would be basically missing that on the contribution margin in that business. In this case, we know there's a lot of demand out there. We have government contracts that are ramping up, we have commercial contracts ramping up. So we need to have those people they're trained. They're going to be ready when the client is ready. So we are duplicating that workforce, which means and every dollar of revenue we don't get is basically a dollar of operating earnings that we're not getting. So I think that's an important point to make. And it is because of our expectation that we are going to see the bounce back, and we're going to meet every one of those people working on it. I actually do believe we will get some efficiencies in how we do our projects.And ideally, that will be reflected in the higher utilization rate on those consultants. That there will be a higher percent of their time is effective, perhaps from reduced travel, perhaps just from techniques, we're learning as we go through this. There are things we have to do on-site absolutely go-lives, the interfacing with the users in a meaningful way. But I think we're going to come out here more efficient and be able to drive these prices. Keep in mind, most of our projects are fixed fee in nature. So any efficiencies we can drive on implementing those can benefit us relative to the bottom line. I think once again, from an upside perspective, we've tried to give a fairly wide guidance range. Certainly, if we can be more efficient, if we can get -- continue to expand what we do virtually before the projects start opening up, that's potential for upside. If there's -- if this lasts longer, if there's something in the fall that slowed us down, then that's a downside opportunity. But right now, given our best view, we think our guidance reflects when we think we're going to get back to work. -- Okay, thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. -- So you mentioned telemedicine is going to become part of the normal course, which I think many would agree with. But specifically, what changes are you making to help your clients with this transition from a go-to-market perspective, from a product and workflow perspective? And any other perspectives you'd like to add? -- Yes. Sean, this is Donn. That's a great question. So I think the first thing we've attempted to do in thinking about virtual health, as we've tried to think through what it means to actually have an enterprise strategy for our clients and what it means to provide telehealth services in a higher acuity setting, with our hospital capabilities and our patient server capabilities, but then also to have effective strategies outside the hospital predominantly through our relationship with AML. And so what does it look like to give them end-to-end capabilities across the enterprise. I think secondly, we think, as you see normalization around the regulatory and payment landscape, which have sort of been the sort of clinicians, probably with some change dynamics relative to provider and how they want to think about the provider patient relationship. As we see those impediments fall back we think then there becomes this sort of interesting conversation around what it looked like to think about the mix of physical and digital capabilities required to optimize for business strategy. We think that looks one way in fee-for-service. It looks another way and fee for value. And so we see some pretty interesting opportunities there in terms of helping our clients think through that mix. And then the final thing I'd say is, in the strategic growth businesses, I think there's some very interesting emerging conversations around how we think about net new offerings in areas like security, say, in the BH space, where we know there's going to be elevated levels of sensitivity and where the solutions technically need to do things like support group business. So I think you'll see us look to support the enterprise strategy, think through it from a business model perspective, and then really look to capitalize on some niche areas that we think have macro trend.Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Davis Demko with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. -- I 've got another 1 on virtual health. Just you've integrated with only a few virtual care players to date like ml and video. Do you plan on remaining aligned with only a few players? Or could this expand as you look at some adjacencies as we go to further virtual fair? And as a quick follow-up to that, how should we think about the economics for these virtual solutions? -- Yes. So a couple of things on that, Stephanie. One we support integration strategies in all of our major clients across multiple players in the tele space. So if a large client has a relationship with Teladoc or with MD Live or Doctors On Demand, we're going to support that strategy and help them make it successful. The second thing is we do have some preferred partnership strategies, inclusive of the strategy with Amwell. And that's fairly key to how we think about go to market, particularly with our large enterprise clients today. The final thing I would say relative to the economics is I think our view is there's some commodity trend around the technology, so A. B, like mobile, we think it will become an expectation of the provider to be able to provide those services to the market against their business strategy. And so the more interesting question for us, just like the questions around mix of channel and how we think about mobility is what are the business model strategies that we're activating around the teleservices. So how do we think about the home as a venue and teleservice relative to the Medicare Advantage space and how we think about differentiating and helping clients manage first dollar risk. Those are going to be the kind of things that we're going to push ourselves to think through, and we think that ends up being the bigger longer-term impact from a market perspective. -- Understood, thank you for that.Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of Americas Securities. Your line is open. -- I want to step back and take another big picture question. I appreciate all the commentary that you've given us regarding your conversations with customers going out of your way to make sure that they're doing as best they can. That being said, so many of the data points that we see continue to point to them essentially having no idea what the pathway forward is for their operations, when electives are going to come back, cash flow dynamics, etc. So as you think about your guidance going forward, how does some of that variability in terms of the lack of client understanding of parts of their own business play into the thought process on your guidance? Or is it a straightforward, as you mentioned, Marc, about essentially a massive dip rather than necessity for so many of your clients as key participants within their local geographies, allows them to get back to normal operations, at least in terms of how they think about running their business, even if volumes are still slower to come back? -- Yes. This is Marc. Clearly, our business has a lot of visibility to it, right? It's fairly durable. So we have a lot of recurring revenues, we have a lot of relatively highly visible revenues. So when you're getting to the point of -- we go into a year we can see 85% of our kind of revenues being in that category. As you get further in, that can even go up as you have a shorter period of time to get to the end of the year. So I think from -- as we look at the backlog, which is how we look at opportunities and then the new business pipeline, we've gone through and we've tried that handicap based on our knowledge of each individual client. What we think their focus is going to be as they work through the next 60 to 90 days. The majority of what we're hearing from our clients certainly, the recurring is going to continue all of those elements. But it's a project where is saying that are very interested in getting started back up. We're starting to get into conversations of when can I get in the queue for the restart because I think our clients realize that there's going to be a lot of demand for those services by a broad client group, and they're going to want to be able to be in line to make sure that they're giving getting bids, if you will, on those services. So clearly, many of them are trying to figure out how are they going to address all of the elected procedures that didn't get done. I think some of the things that we can -- we do in that space, all that we can do in that space is help them analyze how the appointments got canceled.One of the -- how -- is there an effective way of using some of our tools to help them start rescheduling those procedures. And we have tools that help them manage their facilities, we have tools to help them manage their workforce. So how can they use all these tools to maximize the opportunities to go address those deferred elective procedures. So I think all of those things, as we talk to our clients, they're looking for us to help them solve business problems. But I agree, that right now their business problems in making sure their people are safe. And they're delivering high-quality care. But that's going to more pretty quickly into, all right, now how do I recover, and that's what Donn was talking about earlier. -- And I would add that I think you'd mentioned that in your comment, you probably do media that they don't understand when they can get back. I would say that the vast majority of all be specific to our clients. Many of them are already thinking post surge. They have plans in terms of when they believe they can open up. We've been doing activity, I'll call it, unsurge activity, as we work to convert beds that were converted for the pandemic back to what would be considered a normal use. So I think the planning has begun. There's a -- it isn't certain by any means, but there's an idea when we can get back, when they came back to as close to normal as they can. And they're preparing for how to address some of this volume that's going to come back to them. So I think preparations are under way and the uncertainty is getting less uncertain every day. -- John, this is Brent. I'd just add to that. I think Marc, you both made important points. Marc made a very important one, which is these elective procedures, that demand is not gone, right? It's delayed. So if you talk with hospital systems CEOs they're trying to figure out how do they accommodate that demand -- that demand, the elective demand as it does come back. And if you think about it there's -- there's a lot of delayed elective procedures where people want to move ahead or need to move ahead for various reasons. So everything that we can do to help plan that is key management.Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro with William Blair. Your line is open. -- I think I'll follow-up on that last one a little bit, but maybe try to translate a little to the Cerner business model. Just trying to better understand the impact of COVID-19 and then looking ahead to a more normalized business outlook. And in what areas of the business would you expect that 2020 revenue is a new base to go off of in 2021? And what areas would you call out as expecting higher growth due to a catch-up element in 2021? -- This is Marc. I would, first of all, indicate that I don't know that there's a catch-up element for Cerner. Certainly, our clients are looking to catch up with some of those elective procedures. But for us, certainly, the services revenue that is going to be -- we're not going to be able to address in Q2. It will occur, but it's going to occur in future periods as we have the same size workforce. We're not going to expand our workforce in order to meet higher short-term demand, we'll just continue to work through it in ideally a more effective way which might drive more revenue per associate out of that organization. But I don't see a surge of demand as we go into 2021 necessarily. So I think that's from my perspective. I think Donn might want to address some of the opportunities from a strategic growth perspective that we see relative to kind of coming out and how those things start really helping to jump-start some of those businesses. -- Yes. I think if you just think about that where we've got COVID response, durable recovery and the chance of that process for folks to really create elevated levels of certainty around their business model on a five year basis. That's the sweet spot we see for engagement with our clients. And so if I'm using HealtheIntent to think about an engagement strategy with elderly seniors to -- that I'm taking first dollar risk on to keep them out of the ES and utilizing the hospital that's part of my surge strategy. Those same capabilities, to Marc's use case, become the opportunity to start to think about recovery strategies around key procedures around service line, let's say, a service line like orthopedics. And that overlay, that network capability is also in the same capacity that I need on a multiyear basis to start thinking through shift in payment model and what it looks like to manage the top and bottom line. So to John's point, I think there's a fair degree of sophistication in the client base in terms of how to think about that progression. There's a lot of noise, but that's the signal that you see in the dialogue with the market. And I think what we believe on an out-year basis is the areas that we have made big bets on from a strategic growth perspective are a set of things that are going to have significant trend. We love the real-time in the hospital space. I talked about it, we think it's going to have elevated rates of trend. Behavioral health has been an area we've talked consistently with you about in the LTPAC space. We think BH and well-being end up being a big area of focus on a multi-quarter basis.And then finally, I think as you're seeing in the bookings data, you're going to continue to see us have traction and trend around our consumer strategies, you may see some shift in the mix including things like Amwell and virtual being a more material piece of the revenue mix, but it's absolutely going to be something that has traction and trend. There are other areas where we are watching and thinking actively about headwind tailwind dynamics, employer would be one that I think we believe, given our engagement with our clients around return to work, that there's a centrality to the employer in that employer-employee dynamic right now that could create some how quarter out-year trend around that business. We'll see. And so I think across all the strategic growth businesses, we're playing through near-term and medium-term dynamics. But I think in the main, we feel very good about mix and long-term potential. -- Yes. And I would add one thing to Donn's list is data. I mean that's one of the things that we've learned in this time frame is how valuable the is you can tell what kind of how certain tools can help us predict some of the pandemic areas, where are the hotspots going to be help? And when are they dying down. So we've announced some of the activity that is, Donn, I don't know if you want to quickly -- Yes. No, no. It's a great point. So if you just think about the main businesses that make up the data strategy, when it relates to information perspective, a ton of trend there kind of interestingly, the success we've had around legal and life insurance, this is the same dialogue we're having around professional services. How do you think about virtual interactions in a way that deals with current situational reality. So a ton of trend around the core ROI business, similarly, Brent talked about the work we've been doing to put together a purposeful data set for COVID and to allow academic researchers to explore key protocols and discovery strategies. Again, part of a larger narrative that really plays into the opportunity set around life sciences and pharma. So unquestionably we think a lot of what's playing out in this space ends up being net positive in terms of the focal point areas that we have for that business. -- Great, thanks very much.Our last question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Marc, a lot of Co has been provided here. I don't know if I count as old, but I remember 2007, 2008 and 2002, 2003. And so I guess my question is on -- so on the bookings guide, I guess, can you talk about how much is in hand and given that you guys have a high visibility recurring revenue model, I guess, can you talk about how much of this year's revenue is already contracted for? And I guess what I'm thinking about is how much of the bookings guide or the revenue and earnings guidance at risk if the crisis persists longer than expected. -- Marc, a lot of Co has been provided here. I don't know if I count as old, but I remember 2007, 2008 and 2002, 2003.

And I guess what I'm thinking about is how much of the bookings guide or the revenue and earnings guidance at risk if the crisis persists longer than expected.Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- I guess maybe, John, I appreciate the update on the government business, government work going on. I'm just curious if maybe you could specifically share a little bit more on the VA, what revenue do you still expect, if any, to be in guidance for this year? I know that there was a pause relative to the work there. Just curious, of the roughly $250 million a year increase that you guys had shared previously what, if any, is contemplated in this year's work? And then how do you think about that plan catch up next year? -- Yes. Bob, this is Marc. We don't disclose specific revenue from the VA or for our specific government contracts. Certainly, the VA is in a similar position to many of our clients, right? There's work we can do virtually, but they are starting to get into a go-live phase, and some of that work is needs to be done on site. So they are not a lot different than many of our clients. In a similar way, there isn't necessarily a catch-up time, right for these projects. These projects tend to kind of be on a time line. And if the initial project is going to be delayed a little bit, then those -- that come waterfall. Now depending on when we're able to get back to work and relative to the VA, there is an opportunity to perhaps do more to live in the fall and get us back on track, which would mean that we've kind of get caught up and get back to where we would normally be in the process. But that would just allow us to then to deliver the revenue that we've originally expected to come in 2021, which we obviously haven't talked about at this point. So can I want to give you any more specific guidance than that. But just to say the third in the same boat as many of our clients are. But we do have an opportunity there to perhaps to get working on multiple projects at one-time as opposed to doing some sequential work that could let us get caught up by the end of the year. -- Well thank you all for your time this afternoon. Please be safe to take care of yourselves and your families.

That's what\u00a0\u00a0 stock has delivered so far in 2020. But considering the upheaval brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, many investors probably aren't disgruntled with Cerner's performance.Cerner announced its first-quarter results after the market closed on Tuesday. And the healthcare technology provider gave reasons for shareholders to be both disgruntled and gruntled.\u00a0Here are the highlights of Cerner's Q1 update.Image source: Getty Images.Cerner reported first-quarter revenue of $1.41 billion. This reflected a 2% year-over-year increase. However, it fell short of the average analysts' Q1 revenue estimate of $1.43 billion.The company announced Q1 net income of $147 million, or $0.47 per share, based on\u00a0generally accepted accounting principles (). In the first quarter of 2019, Cerner posted GAAP earnings of\u00a0$166 million, or $0.51 per share.However, Cerner's adjusted non-GAAP numbers looked a little better. The company recorded Q1 adjusted earnings of $223 million, or $0.71 per share. This reflected a solid increase from adjusted earnings of\u00a0$199 million, or $0.61 per share, generated in the prior-year period. It also narrowly topped the consensus Wall Street estimate of $0.70 per share.There were two factors behind Cerner's lower-than-expected revenue in the first quarter. Both of them related to the COVID-19 pandemic.The company noted that bookings in Q1 totaled $1.09 billion, at the low end of its expectations. It stated that the volume of contracts was lower than normal in the last couple of weeks in March as a direct result of the COVID-19 outbreak. This lower level of bookings weighed on Cerner's Q1 revenue. So did the travel restrictions the company implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Cerner's year-over-year decline in GAAP earnings stemmed primarily from a big jump in general and administrative (G&A) expenses. G&A costs soared 45% to $139.9 million. Software development expenses also increased by nearly 3% year over year to $185.3 million.\u00a0Cerner now anticipates full-year 2020 revenue of between $5.55 billion and $5.7 billion. This is lower than the company's previous guidance of $5.725 billion\u00a0to\u00a0$5.975 billion. Cerner expects full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $2.78 and $2.90. Its previous outlook estimated a range between $3.09 and $3.19.The company also looks for Q2 revenue of between $1.34 billion and $1.39 billion. Q2 adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.60 and $0.64. Both top- and bottom-line projections are below Cerner's Q1 results and far short of what analysts were expecting.The culprit behind this disappointing guidance, of course, is the COVID-19 outbreak. Cerner thinks that the worst impact will be felt in the second quarter. However, the company looks for a rebound in the second half of the year.\u00a0Like all , though, Cerner faces risks that the COVID-19 crisis could last longer than expected and have a greater impact than expected.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: CERN) saw new options become available this week, for the December 18th expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CERN options chain for the new December 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $63.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CERN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $71.45/share today.\n\nBecause the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CERN stock at the current price level of $71.45/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $72.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.27% if the stock gets called away at the December 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CERN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CERN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $72.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $72.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

These rules would compel insurers and hospitals to make patients' healthcare information easily shareable by modern technological standards. The idea is that once these rules are in place, patients will be able to store and share their medical records on their own devices.Image source: Getty Images.HHS Secretary Alex Azar went on to describe these rules as the beginning of a new chapter in how patients interact with the American healthcare system. \"From the start of our efforts to put patients and value at the center of our healthcare system, we've been clear: Patients should have control of their records, period. Now that's becoming a reality.\" Most of the key requirements stated in these new rules are expected to come into effect by January 2021, although some will start later that year. These requirements include allowing increased patient access to information through a third-party app of their choice, making healthcare provider directory information available to the public, and letting patients take their information with them as they move from provider to provider.A number of  technology companies have expressed support for these new rules.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.\n\nIn trading on Friday, shares of Cerner Corp. (Symbol: CERN) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.0, after changing hands as low as $67.91 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 17.1.

After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Cerner wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0 Hey, everyone, it's Austin, thanks for listening, just want to give you a heads-up that today's show was recorded in late-February, as Dylan is on vacation. So, if there's no mention of the recent news, that's why. Enjoy! It's Wednesday, March 11, time for another -focused . I'm your host Dylan Lewis, and we're stuck with the \"just OK\" Brian Feroldi. Brian, just becoming a meme at this point; the underwhelming intro. That would be amazing, if I could become a meme on the internet. And Dylan, I want to start this episode off a little bit differently, because I was at a trivia night at a local bar and we came in first place. And even though we got the final question wrong, we still won out of 12 teams. So, I'm curious, if any of our super-smart listeners know the answer to this ridiculous trivia question, and that is, \"Which 19 century U.S. President was elected to the Senate after his term ended?\" And I got to say, you put this in the notes, I have no idea what the answer is. We will reveal the answer at the end of this episode, something for people to marinade on. We're talking about electronic health records. If that's not really your jam, just stick around. Tune out the entire conversation, then stick around for the end and you'll get the answer to that question.Brian, having you on today to talk e-health and the records management business. Really, a lot of companies that are focused on digitizing and modernizing the way that health records are done. We're doing that because people want some more  stuff on the  show. Yeah, and this is a topic that marries two of my favorite industries; tech and healthcare. And I was at my doctor's office a couple of weeks ago; and I just go to a small local physician. And they use electronic health records at their office, and yet, when I walked in the door, they still handed me a pencil and a piece of paper and said, \"Here, fill out your name and address and phone number.\" Even though I've been to the office dozens of times before, so there's still work to do. It sounds like we go to the same doctor. I mean, that's the experience that pretty much everyone seems to be having. And it does seem like we're a little too far along with technology to still be there. Yeah, exactly. And when you dig into the numbers, the market for IT healthcare products is enormous. I mean, the spending was $280 billion last year. And there are just dozens of ways for investors to play the trend of the gradual digitization of healthcare. I mean, you can go with the IT providers themselves, there's also consultants, there are pure play software companies, there's also software companies that look to healthcare to bolster their growth potential. So, there's huge potential here for investors across the board. And the idea here is a very similar pitch to what you would see with software coming into almost any space. You're getting more efficient, you're avoiding mistakes. In the case of healthcare, you're probably getting better patient outcomes, all the things that hopefully come with more efficient operations. Yeah. And that's exactly right. And electronic health records, which is a big focus of the show today, EHR, they really just help the healthcare industry tremendously. They hold a huge potential to lower costs. And, as you know, healthcare and regulation go hand-in-hand and there's a big focus around privacy and security of data. So, developing an electronic health record system that is scalable and used everywhere has enormous potential to save the healthcare system huge money in, both, direct and indirect costs in the long-term. We've started to see a lot of offices adopt EHR systems over the last 15 or so years, the adoption has really grown dramatically. Yes. So, some quick stats on that. So, in 2004, only about 20% of physician offices had any electronic health record system at all in place. But the government has put incentives in place to push the industry to go in that direction. And as of 2018, about 86% of offices had an EHR in place. There are still some holdouts; many of them that are those small offices that haven't made the jump just yet, but the trend is absolutely toward digitization. And you sent me a screenshot of the way that the industry breaks down; just kind of getting a sense of all the different players in the space, and it's pretty fragmented. There are some people that have a pretty big stake, but there are dozens and dozens of companies that play in this industry. Yeah. I mean, just in the electronic health records industry alone there are dozens of providers. And there's some big companies that have a decent size market share -- we're going to talk of one a little bit later in the show. But there are literally dozens of companies that have developed their own electronic health record system and have had some success in the marketplace. So, this is a hugely fragmented market right now. I could easily see the market continuing to consolidate over time, so that there's a few enormous companies that really dominate and provide interoperability to make sure that health records are easily accessible and portable, but we're not quite there yet.Folks that follow the industry probably know the names Epic Systems and Athenahealth. These are the big giants that are private. We're going to be focusing a little bit more on the public companies in the space, because we want to give people the investable ideas in this industry. One of the first companies that I want to talk about, another pretty big player, is . Yeah. So, Cerner; their ticker symbol is CERN. They are one of the largest providers of IT solutions to the entire healthcare industry. To give you a sense of scale, these guys, 70 of the top 100 health systems are currently users of Cerner's project. They have about a 24% market share of the entire industry, so they are definitely the top dog in the space. And they are a leader in electronic health records and they make it easy for hospitals and providers to share and record data with each other. And they also offer a number of ancillary services to the hospitals and healthcare providers, such as, billing, operational improvements, consulting services.And their business is actually split -- they make money in a couple of different ways. They make it through professional services as well as licensed software. And this company is in the middle of \"wait for it\" a SaaS conversion, which we both love. So, their revenue is becoming even more dependable. And they also make money off of support and maintenance contracts. And more recently, they announced a major partnership with  to leverage their AWS services, to bring their technology, to make their platform even better. So, this is the top dog in the space and it's easy to see them remaining so for years to come. You mentioned the SaaS transition. This is something that folks that have heard us talk before, probably know pretty well, but for anyone who hasn't caught those conversations, basically you have a business that is going from the old school model of software licenses sold on a less predictable basis to a as-a-Service model, where you have nice, recurring revenue coming in. The software offering becomes much stickier and much harder for customers to leave. It takes a little bit of time, it's a little painful for businesses to go through that transition, but ultimately, it's a far better business model.Yeah it takes lumpy software sales and makes them into recurring monthly payments. It works out best for both customers and the providers of the technology themselves. We've seen almost every software company -- I mean, almost every legacy software company switch to a SaaS model over the last ten years, because it's just such a homerun decision.One downside of the transition is it can temporarily lower companies' reported revenue, because SaaS model pulls in less revenue upfront. So, when we're talking about Cerner's growth rate, you just need to keep that in mind. Yeah. And you mentioned legacy software. This is definitely a little bit of an older business, probably not as high-growth as some of the other software companies that people are used to hearing us talk about, Brian. But with that comes a little bit more stability.Yeah. This is a company that's been profitable, cashflow positive for years. They've been a terrific long-term investment. So, this is not the most exciting company that we're going to talk about today, but for an investor that's looking for a steady-Eddie business, this is certainly one to checkout.And just to throw some numbers around there, last quarter this company reported a revenue growth of about 6% to $1.44 billion. They were able to squeeze out some even faster growth on the bottom-line, thanks to some margin enhancements and stock buybacks. So, adjusted earnings grew 23% to $0.49. For the year ahead, for 2020, even with the SaaS kind of dragging them down and some recently, businesses that they decided to exit, they're calling for a low single-digit revenue growth, but they're going to be able to leverage through margin enhancements that into about 15% growth in adjusted EPS.And this company regularly buys back stock and they also initiated a dividend within the last year. And they pay about a 1% yield.So, over the longer-term, I think this company should steadily be able to maintain its market share, provide a small boost to the bottom-line that outpace topline growth, and provide double-digit profit growth for the foreseeable future. And on a valuation basis, this company is not priced for hypergrowth by any sense. They're trading for about 20X next year's earnings. And again, they do come with a small dividend. So, if you're looking for a slow-moving way to profit from this trend, I think Cerner is a great choice. Yeah. I think that TL;DR on Cerner is, legacy business that's going through the tough part of becoming a SaaS company, but they have a really steady, solid business backing that transition up. And they give you the return to shareholder type capital allocation decisions that a lot of people love; the stock buybacks and the dividends, nothing wrong with that. Yeah, totally. So, this is a great stock for low-risk investors to check out. Our second stock is one that I know quite well, because I'm a shareholder, and that is . This is a stock that has really rewarded shareholders over the last year-and-a-half or so. Yeah. So, DocuSign, we talked about on the show before, mostly on the show. And they're a leader in electronic signature. So, anytime you electronically sign your name, DocuSign is the brand that has the dominant market share. And you and I did a deep dive on this show, after it came public in 2018. And we both gave it the thumbs up, and I think we both became shareholders right away. And shares have just gone on to produce great returns, I mean, they're talking about more than double since 2018.And the reason I wanted to highlight it for healthcare investors is, DocuSign is obviously not a pure play on healthcare IT, but this company is placing an emphasis on using their services within the healthcare market and they are starting to see some traction. More than 100 hospitals are actually currently using DocuSign's products for all kinds of reasons for patient intake, physician credentialing, hiring on their own side, HIPPA compliance.And DocuSign is also focusing on the health plans, as a way to get them to connect better with their members. So, they have UnitedHealthcare [,] which is the largest health plan in the United States is a DocuSign customer, as is  Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ,  Permanente.And DocuSign also has been going after the global life sciences businesses to partner with drug developers, because there's huge compliance and signing for things when you're running clinical trials. And these guys have already landed 18 of the top 20 global pharmacy company. So, healthcare is definitely a growth industry for DocuSign. If you look at what they're doing in healthcare too, I think what you see is a very similar roadmap to what they've done with other industries, namely, the financial industry. They have some big deals inked with some of the major players in that space. And that's just going to create a ton of volume for them and is going to get them entrenched with the players that really shape the industry. I mean, I know so many people that have gone through the mortgage process and used DocuSign here at The Fool. And so, I think they're very smart in, who they're working with, who they're partnering with and really getting themselves out there. I they're kind of the go-to name when it comes to the electronic signature and document management process. Yeah, exactly. And you think about healthcare, even as a patient, how many times you have to sign your name, when you check in, when you fill out your HIPPA compliance form, when you're filling out your beneficiaries, I mean, there's dozens of times that you have to sign your name related to healthcare. So, DocuSign naturally plays right into that. And as we alluded to previously, this is a company that is just getting it done. I mean, they are producing fantastic growth numbers.So, last quarter, this company added 25,000 new customers. And that brought their total up to 560,000 total customers. So, that kind of growth is just driving a strong growth in the topline. We saw 40% growth in the topline to $250 million. It's a software company, so they produce great gross margins of 75%. They are still producing GAAP net losses, but if you adjust for that, they are profitable on an adjusted basis. And one of the key metrics that we always look for in any Software-as-a-Service company is dollar-based net expansion rate, which is a measure of same customer spending from period-to-period. This company just recently produced 117%, which means that even if they weren't adding any customers at all, the top-line would have grown 17%. So, really, when you look at this company's numbers, there's just so much to like. Yeah. One of the other things that I really like too, is they have this deepening relationship with . And we talked about how they very smartly approach the healthcare industry and the financial industry. I think, being in Salesforce's good favors or being on their good side is probably a good thing if you're a software company, because they have such outsized influence in this industry, particularly with enterprise clients. Yeah. Salesforce is a major player, and by deepening their relationship with them, DocuSign is actually helping with contract lifecycle management as well as the entire negotiation process. So, the combination of Salesforce and DocuSign is helping with negotiations in the background to really automate that process as much as possible.So, when we first talked about them on the show, we talked about how DocuSign sees a total addressable market opportunity of about $25 billion, management believes that their recent integrations and new products that they've launched has the potential to double that in time. So, this company is still deeply underpenetrated with its long-term potential. And although it's not, by any means, a healthcare pure play on the IT front, it's definitely an accelerator. So, this is definitely a stock that growth-focused investors should get to know. Alright, let's switch gears and talk about our third stock. This is one that I had to check on the pronunciation of, and a little bit out of my element here, this is , ticker PHR, another Software-as-a-Service company. Yeah. And these guys, if you're looking for a pure play on healthcare IT, that's exactly what Phreesia does. And this company is hyper-focused on the patient intake process, so that includes registration, scheduling, checking-in, bill pay, anything that a patient would experience when they're interacting with a healthcare office. So, Phreesia partners with healthcare providers, and they have a mobile app that patients can use to sign-in and schedule the appointments, as well as there's also a tablet, an iPad-like device, that Phreesia puts into some offices that patients can use when they walk-in to electronically sign-in. And this just greatly speeds up the check-in process and scheduling new appointments. I wish that my healthcare provider would adopt Phreesia's technology, because it just sounds so much better than what I'm doing now. Yeah, Brian, I mean this is solving the exact pain point that we were talking about at the beginning of the show. Yeah, exactly. And Phreesia, as we talked about, is really focused on patient intake, but they also have direct integrations of their product with dozens of other electronic health record companies. So, they have partnerships with Cerner, Meditech, Athenahealth, , they partner with payors, they partner with payment networks. So, they are on the frontend, and that's what their specialty is, but their fingers do extend out to other companies.And this is a company that actually has currently has three sources of recurring revenue, all of which are growing. So, the first is healthcare providers pay them a subscription fee to just offer the service at their office, but whenever a patient makes a payment on its platform -- so, for copays or deductibles -- Phreesia also gets a portion of that sales. And then, lastly, they actually partner with life sciences companies -- so, medical devices, drug developers -- to provide targeted digital marketing services. So, this company has numerous ways that it's monetizing its user base. And that's something that excites me as an investor. Yeah. And they're all kind of slightly playing in different elements of the healthcare home office and these things that really businesses need to be able to do. I like that they have an arm in payment processing, in particular, because it gets them a little outside of just the core operational elements of healthcare. They already have a pretty decent book of clients and provider organizations. Yeah. So, they've already signed up about 50,000 healthcare providers already. Management believes that their addressable market opportunity, just in the U.S., is about 900,000 offices, so there's still plenty of room to go. And independent, third-party reviewers have rated Phreesia's software and service as the top choice for patient intake management. So, that certainly gives this company a nod from a third-party. And that could help them, in time, to continue to grow within their target market.And this company is pulling in about $100 million in annualized revenue and last year that grew at about 25%. Management seems to think that its total addressable market opportunity is about $7 billion. That might be a little bit aggressive given what we know about how companies like to talk up that number, but I do think it shows that this company has a nice niche for itself and it is growing. To your point about them being best-in-class too, that's the kind of thing that gives a software provider some pricing power. If you are able to be the one-stop-shop and really the best solution for someone in a space, especially a smaller space where there aren't going to be nearly as many software providers, then you're able to demonstrate your value, and over time, either upsell folks or slowly increase prices to reflect the better service that they're getting. Yeah. So, I think Phreesia is so hyper-focused on the intake process, that they can make that process as seamless as possible for patients. And that's I think a defendable market. I mean, there's lots of other companies, even like Cerner, as we talked about at the top of the show that provide these kind of services, but because Phreesia is hyper-focused on just the intake and it offers integration with Cerner for a whole bunch of other processes, there is a reason that some healthcare providers can choose to work with one or even more of these companies at just one time. So, this isn't a market where there's just going to be one solution necessarily, there could be multiple solutions, even within a single office. If Cerner was your too boring, too mellow, and maybe DocuSign was you're too aggressive, too growth-oriented, this could be the just right stock of the three for some folks that are looking for something a little bit in the middle. A 19% revenue growth next year and they're currently trading at about 10X sales. So, not nearly as aggressive a valuation as what we saw with DocuSign, but more impressive growth rates than what we're seeing with Cerner. Yeah. And the company has reached enough scale to start showing adjusted net income, at least on an EBITDA basis, which always needs some context. On a GAAP basis, they are still showing net losses, but that's very common for fast-growing Software-as-a-Service companies. One thing I did want to call out is this company does have some customer concentration issues that investors need to be aware of. So, their top four clients comprised about 19% of sales last year, that should continue to fall and become less of an issue over time, if this business can continue to grow, but that is something that, I think, investors do need to know ahead of time. Alright, Brian, we threw out three stocks. I have to ask you at the end of the show, which one is your favorite play on the space? I think you know the answer to that, and that's going to be a DocuSign. I mean it's hard for me -- DocuSign has become one of my personal biggest holdings, just because of the outstanding performance and the strong growth. And I think it's just growing its customer count so good. And I like that healthcare is an accelerator of its growth, it's not completely dependent on healthcare for growth. So, of the three, it's definitely my favorite choice. How about you? I'm right there with you. I mean, you know, it's my kid, I own it in my brokerage account. [laughs] How can I vote against it? It's a great business and it is in so many industries, and just really making things so much easier. And the stock has performed so well; I only expect that to continue. I think that the tailwinds there are just so strong.Before we wrap up, Brian, we threw a trivia question out there at the beginning of the show. We got to give people the answer. Yeah. So, again, the question was, \"Which 19 century U.S. President was elected to the Senate after his term as President ended?\" And the answer is, Andrew Johnson. So, congratulations, if you knew that. You should come be on my trivia team. Yeah, I mean, those should be the folks living in Washington D.C., not me, because they clearly have a better sense of the nation's history.As we wrap up, listeners know that, if folks give us a five-star review, I'll give it a shout-out on the air. We have one from JPort, who writes in, \"Thanks so much for bringing Healthcare back.\" Look at that, Brian, reading it on a show we're doing on healthcare right now. \"Love the new intro.

So far this year, though, there hasn't been much excitement from the big health information technology provider.But Cerner gave investors something to like when it announced its fourth-quarter results after the market closed on Tuesday. Here are the highlights of the company's Q4 update.Image source: Getty Images.Cerner announced Q4 revenue of $1.44 billion, a 6% increase from the $1.37 billion reported in the same quarter of the previous year. This matched the average analyst Q4 revenue estimate.The company reported net income of $154.3 million, or $0.49 per share, based on generally accepted accounting principles (). This reflected a solid increase from GAAP earnings of $131.3 million, or $0.40 per share, recorded in the prior-year period.\u00a0Cerner posted Q4 adjusted net income of $237.2 million, or $0.75 per share, up from adjusted net income of $208.1 million, or $0.63 per share, in the same quarter of 2018. The consensus Wall Street estimate was for Q4 adjusted earnings of $0.74 per share.CEO Brent Shafer said, \"I am pleased with our strong finish to the year, with all of our key operating metrics at or above our expectations in the fourth quarter.\" Shafer had a good reason to like what he saw in Q4, since Cerner delivered solid revenue growth in nearly every category and topped Wall Street's earnings estimate for only the second time in the last five quarters.Cerner makes 35% of its total revenue from professional services. That revenue jumped 9% year over year to $509.3 million. All other revenue sources for the company also delivered year-over-year growth except for support and maintenance and reimbursed travel.The company's bottom-line improvement in Q4 was largely through revenue growth. It also helped that Cerner's operating expenses rose by only 1.8% year over year. In addition, the company paid around $3 million less in taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 than it did in the prior-year period.Cerner reported bookings in the fourth quarter of $1.665 billion, above its expectations. Its total backlog at the end of 2019 was $13.71 billion.\u00a0The company expects revenue for full-year 2020 between $1.415 billion and $1.465 billion. It anticipates adjusted non-GAAP (adjusted) EPS between $3.09 and $3.19. First-quarter 2020 new business bookings are forecast between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion.The 2020 presidential election could be pivotal for how  perform this year. Cerner's customers could be affected by various proposals from the candidates, and anything that impacts its customers would likely impact Cerner as well.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Today's date is February 4, 2020 and this call is being recorded. The Company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating and capital expenses, bookings, new solutions, services, and offering development, and capital allocation plans, cost optimization, and operational improvement initiatives, future business outlook, including new markets or prospects for the Company's solutions and services, and expected benefits of certain of our acquisition or other collaborations. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.Please see Cerner earnings release, which was filed with the SEC today and posted to the Investor section of cerner.com and other filings with the SEC for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in the  can also be found in the Company's earnings release. Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, except as required by law.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brent Shafer, Chairman and CEO of Cerner Corporation. -- Thank you, Delim and good afternoon everyone and welcome to the call. I am joining the call from a client event, so I'll start the call with a few comments then hand it over to the team in Kansas City, including our CFO, Marc Naughton; Chief Client Officer, John Peterzalek; and EVP of Strategic Growth, Don Trigg.2019 was an important and productive year for Cerner. We began the year by introducing a new operating model to refine our organizational alignment, enhance our client focus, and to accelerate scalable innovation to make Cerner easier to do business with. We also initiated a Companywide transformation focused on operating efficiencies, business simplification, portfolio management, and refining our growth strategy to position Cerner for long-term, profitable growth. Further, we enhanced our governance through the addition of four strong Board members, who, along with our existing members, have been invaluable as we work through our transformation.Our 2019 progress is reflected in our fourth quarter results, which included good performance across all key metrics, including exceeding our adjusted operating margin target and delivering record free cash flow. We also returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2019 through our share buyback program and our first two dividend payments, all reflecting our commitment to delivering value to shareholders.Also significant in 2019 was the announcement of our multi-faceted collaboration with AWS and Amazon. We view this relationship as an enabler to many of the growth strategies we've discussed on previous calls, including Cerner's development of a cognitive platform and our evolution to becoming the Software-as-a-Service healthcare IT partner. Leveraging the powerful combination of Cerner technology, the AWS infrastructure, their artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, we expect to create next-generation user experiences and innovations to deliver more predictive, patient-centric care.#####Now before turning the call over to Marc, I'd like to discuss Cerner's position on the topic of interoperability, data security, and privacy. For several decades, Cerner has been a trusted steward of health information and a leader in the pursuit of data interoperability. We've seen a vocal proponent of -- we have been, excuse me, a vocal proponent of the 21st Century Cures Act, and look forward to continuing our work with the ONC, with clients, and with other key stakeholders to ensure a secure flow of information across disparate systems and healthcare entities. We do this because it's the right thing to do.And I'm reminded of it today, I started my career at Intermountain Healthcare. And this is where I spent the day today talking with other leaders about the future of health and care. And we talk a lot about the fact that healthcare is too important to stay the same. And I love the chance to get together and collaborate with other organizations like Intermountain, who are working to help people live the healthiest lives possible. We fundamentally believe it's wrong to ask patients striving to get better to manage a collection of faxes, PDFs and paper-filled shopping bags. It's wrong to ask providers to leave their workflows to review and leverage relevant patient information. It's wrong to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on the highest administrative costs in the world when we're in the middle of an affordability crisis in United States healthcare. So we're going to continue to be a positive voice for change in the industry. Access to the right information at the right time in the right place continues to drive our advocacy in Washington and in the global markets we serve.In summary, I'm very pleased with everything we accomplished in 2019. We consistently delivered against expectations we set while driving a significant amount of change throughout Cerner. This was hard work and I specifically appreciate all the Cerner associates' hard work throughout the year and their contributions to this progress. We have a lot more to do in 2020, but we're off to a good start and I'm optimistic we'll continue to advance our transformation. And more importantly, I believe the work we're doing will position us to create meaningful value in healthcare, while also driving good long-term growth for Cerner.And now I'll turn the call over to Marc. -- Thanks, Brent. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I did want to cover the most important numbers from the weekend, which are 31 and 20 reflecting the 11-point win for the Super Bowl champion: Kansas City Chiefs. Go Chiefs.Now I'll cover our Q4 results and future period guidance. This quarter we delivered all key metrics at or above our guidance. I'll start with bookings, which were $1.665 billion in Q4, exceeding the high end of our guidance. This is down from Q4 '18 which was the second highest bookings quarter in our history. Full-year bookings were $5.99 billion, which is down from $6.721 billion in 2018. Decline in Q4 and for the year was primarily due to a decline in long-term bookings related to us being more selective on our outsourcing contracts as we've discussed throughout the year. We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $13.71 billion, which is down 10% from a year ago, primarily due to the termination of a RevWorks agreement that I discussed on our Q3 call. Also recall that our backlog calculation of the new revenue standard excludes revenue from contracts with termination clauses, even though such clauses are rarely exercised. When you combine the expected revenue from our backlog and the additional revenue expected from contracts not included in our backlog, our revenue visibility remains at nearly 85% over the next 12 months. Revenue in the quarter was $1.442 billion, up 6% over Q4 of '18 and in line with our expectations. Total revenue for the year was $5.693 billion, reflecting growth of 6% over 2018.Now I'll go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q4 '18 and full year 2018. Licensed software revenue in Q4 grew 5% over Q4 of '18 million to $174 million and full year licensed software revenue grew 11% over 2018 to $681 million, both primarily due to strong growth in our SaaS offerings.Technology resale of $60 million in Q4 increased 31% compared to a weak Q4 of 2018. Full year technology resale revenue was up 1% to $247 million. Subscriptions revenue grew 7% in Q4 to $93 million. Full year subscriptions revenue was $359 million, up 10% from $326 million in 2018.Professional services revenue grew 9% in Q4 to $509 million, primarily driven by solid growth in implementation services and partially offset by approximately $23 million less revenue due to termination of the RevWorks agreement we previously discussed. Full year professional services revenue grew 10% to $1.992 billion. Managed services was up 3% in Q4 to $309 million. Full year managed services revenue was $1.214 billion, an increase of 5% over 2018. Support and maintenance was down 1% to $274 million for the quarter, which is our expectation range and reflects the impact of some past attrition that we discussed last quarter. Full year support and maintenance revenue was also down 1% from 2018 at $1.105 billion. And finally reimbursed travel of $22 million was down 9% in Q4 and down 2% for the full year at $95 million.Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue was up 6% from the year-ago quarter at $1.276 billion and non-US revenue of $166 million was up 3% from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 7% and non-US revenue grew 3%.Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 80.8%, down from 81% in Q3 of '19 and 82.6% year-over-year. Full year gross margin of 81.2% is down from 82.5% in 2018. The declines in our quarterly and full-year gross margin are both driven by higher third-party services largely related to our federal business and a lower margin mix within technology resale.Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, acquisition related adjustments, organizational restructuring and other expenses and other adjustments that are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.Looking at our operating spending, our fourth quarter GAAP operating expenses of $982 million were up 2% compared to $965 million in the year-ago period. Full year GAAP operating expenses were $4.021 billion, up 10% from $3.654 billion in 2018. Our adjusted operating expenses were up 4% for the full year with the fourth quarter essentially flat compared to Q4 of '18, reflecting good progress on our cost optimization efforts. Looking at the line items for Q4, sales and client service expense increased 1% in Q4. Software development expense increased 4% over Q4 of '18, driven by 1% increase in gross R&D, a 7% increase in amortization and a 3% decrease in capitalized software. G&A expense was 15% driven by decline in both personnel and non-personnel expenses.Amortization of acquisition related intangibles decreased slightly year-over-year. Moving to operating margins, our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 12.7% compared to 12% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 20.3%, up from 18.7% in Q4 of '18 and 18.1% last quarter. Our Q4 adjusted operating margin is in line with our expectations and above the 20% adjusted operating margin target for Q4 of '19 that we committed to last April.Our GAAP operating margin for full year of 2019 was 10.6% compared to 14.4% in 2018 and full year adjusted operating margin was 18.5% which is down slightly from 18.8% last year. We believe our ongoing business optimization efforts keep us on track for delivering our targeted Q4 '20 adjusted operating margin of 22.5%. I'd note that some of the margin expansion is expected to be back-end loaded like last year due to the timing of our initiatives and some seasonality. However, our guidance, which I'll discuss in a minute, does reflect a full-year adjusted operating margin of approximately 21%, which is about 250 basis points higher than 2019 and reflects the cumulative impact of all of the optimization work we have done and expect to do this year. We also believe we can continue improving profitability beyond 2020 through ongoing optimization efforts and a longer-term opportunity to benefit from platform modernization.As we discussed, the benefits from platform modernization will be a multi-year process, particularly for Millennium and most near-term benefits are largely offset by modernization investments. However, we expect the lower operating costs associated with this move, along with efficiencies and improvements we are driving in our development process, to meaningfully contribute to our profitability while also helping us deliver a differentiated solution to our clients at a lower total cost of ownership. Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $154 million or $0.49 per diluted share. It is up from $0.40 in Q4 of '18. For the full year GAAP net earnings were $529 million, or $1.65 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings in Q4 were $237 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.75 compared with $0.63 in Q4 of '18.For the full year adjusted net earnings were $862 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.68, up 9% from 2018. Our GAAP tax rate was 19% for the quarter and year. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 20% for the quarter and year. For 2020, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 20% and 22%.Moving to our balance sheet, we ended Q4 with $542 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $633 million last quarter with our free cash flow being offset by our $75 million acquisition of AbleVets and $300 million of share repurchases in Q4.For the year, we repurchased 18.8 million shares for $1.3 billion at an average price of $69.06, keeping us on track against our plan to repurchase 1.5 billion by the end of Q1 of '20 [Phonetic]. Moving to debt, our total debt remained flat to last quarter at $1.038 billion. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.14 billion, down from $1.155 billion in Q3 of '19. Our Q4 DSO was 72 days, which is down from 74 days in Q3 of '19 and 79 days in the year-ago period. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $438 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $83 million and capitalized software was $63 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $292 million for the quarter.For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.313 billion, capital expenditures were $472 million and capitalized software was $274 million. Full year free cash flow was $568 million, which is down $166 million from 2018, driven by higher capital expenditures and restructuring costs.For 2020, we expect some level of restructuring cost to continue, but we still expect higher operating cash flow and lower capex to drive strong free cash flow growth. Moving to capital allocation, as I indicated, we repurchased $1.3 billion shares of stock in 2019 and we remain on track to meet our targeted level of $1.5 billion by the end of Q1. In December, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of an additional $1.5 billion of stock, bringing the total authorized amount available for repurchase up to $1.7 billion. We intend to continue funding these repurchases with a combination of cash from operations and debt and the timing and amount of repurchases will depend on how much funding is used for other purposes, such as acquisitions or investments.Moving to our dividend program, we paid our first three quarterly dividends of $0.18 per share on July 26th, October 9th and January 9th. Our quarterly dividend payments and the increased authorization in our share repurchase plan reflect our continued commitment to return capital to shareholders and our belief in Cerner's long-term potential. I'd also note that we completed our acquisition of AbleVets in Q4 and have begun to integrate their service offerings into our portfolio to accelerate our success in the federal space. As we've discussed, we expect to be more active in M&A as we believe there are opportunities that could be foundational to our growth in several of the markets our strategic growth organization is pursuing. I'd also note that our portfolio management efforts are expected to lead to some divestiture activity as we look to create more focus in areas most aligned with our refined growth strategy.Now I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q1 to be between $1.415 billion and $1.465 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 4% over Q1 of '19. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.725 billion and $5.975 billion with a $5.85 billion midpoint reflecting 3% growth over 2019. The midpoint of this range is slightly below consensus growth of 4%. We suspect [Phonetic] this could be due to estimates not fully factoring in the impact of reduced levels of outsourcing bookings in 2019 and our continued approach of being more selective with those types of contracts.Also I'd like to walk you through an organic growth view of 2020. If you adjust for our exit from the Adventist Health contract by taking that revenue out of 2019, our 2020 growth would be over 5%. Adjusting out AbleVets revenue would bring pure organic growth back to 4%, but we don't view all of the revenue from AbleVets as inorganic because we expect to leverage their associates and performing on the VA contract as it ramps up. This normally would have been done through organic hiring. But we believe there is value in leveraging their highly qualified workforce. As we've discussed there will likely be additional actions we take this year that could result in revenue reductions. There is also the potential that we do M&A which could serve as an offset to divestiture activity. Overall, we do expect there to be several moving parts on the top line in 2020. But we believe the actions we take will set us up for solid and profitable growth.Moving to EPS. We expect Q1 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.69 to $0.71 per share. The midpoint of this range is 15% higher than Q1 of '19. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance reflects a ramp-up throughout the year that is similar to last year. With the biggest sequential increase in Q4, this reflects the expected timing of ongoing efficiency and operation efforts.For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.09 to $3.19 with a $3.14 midpoint, reflecting 70% growth over 2019. As I mentioned, we also expect our adjusted operating margin to ramp during the year. With Q4, we are expected to be slightly higher than our 22.5 % target due primarily to a lower mix of outsourcing revenue. I'd also note that our expected full year non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 21% and is 1% higher than 2019, impacting EPS by about $0.04.Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 3% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2019, driven by an expected decline in long-term bookings. In summary, we are pleased with our strong results in the fourth quarter and believe we made a lot of progress this year. There is a lot of hard work left to meet our profitability and growth targets, but we have a good plan in place and expect to execute it in 2020 and beyond.Before I wrap up, I'd like to remind you that we will host our annual investment community meeting at HIMSS on Tuesday March 10. If you plan to attend and have not registered, please do so through the link at the top of the Investors section of cerner.com. If you're unable to attend in person, there will be a webcast available.With that, I'll turn the call over to John. -- Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide results, highlights and an update on our federal business. I'll start with our bookings. As Marc mentioned, we delivered bookings ahead of our guidance range for the quarter, driven by strong contributions across multiple segments such as investor-owned, academic and IDNs. We also had good contributions from revenue cycle solutions and across our strategic growth businesses which Don will discuss.Consistent with recent quarters, we had a lower level of long-term bookings compared to last year, which drove the decline in overall bookings. For the quarter, the percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts was 29% compared to 38% in Q4 of last year. Long-term bookings for the year represented 28% of total bookings, compared to 36% last year, with this decline in long-term bookings, driving total bookings down for the year. Bookings excluding long-term contracts increased slightly for the full year.Looking at the broader marketplace, many of the same trends continued to play out during 2019, with healthcare cost growth outpacing the economy; elevated levels of industry consolidation; rising consumer expectations around cost, convenience, and service; and the continued gradual evolution of reimbursement models adding to pressure on providers to lower costs and advance their risk-based strategies.These forces are contributing to an overall challenging macro environment. Providers are simultaneously seeking to grow key service lines, drive operational efficiencies to make money at Medicare rates, and build out the competencies required to take and effectively manage risk and participate in value-based reimbursement models. Information technology is seen as an enabler of these efforts, which represents an opportunity for Cerner. At the same time, the low-margin nature of provider businesses can make it difficult to fund required investment, making it important for solutions and services to have a clear return on investment.As we look at 2020, we see solid opportunity both in our installed base as well as continuing to gain new clients. This opportunity is reflected in our pipeline, which is up year-over-year for both new business and opportunities for sales back into our base. In our base, we are focused on getting our clients current while also filling out their Cerner solution suite, with a focus on increasing penetration of revenue cycle solutions, and solutions supported by our CareAware and HealtheIntent platforms. Our CommunityWorks pipeline remains strong and we have opportunities outside of our traditional provider base in areas such as state government, employer, and long-term, post-acute care. We also have opportunities to continue growing the presence of our EHR-agnostic CareAware and HealtheIntent solutions beyond our EHR base.Moving to our Federal business, we continued to advance both our VA and DoD projects. On the VA project, Cerner along with the VA and our partners, remain focused on the Initial Operating Capability, or IOC, go live. We have completed initial integration validation and are doing a significant amount of training and site-preparation activities ahead of the scheduled go live in March. Looking beyond the initial go live, we also expect to go live at additional IOC sites in 2020 and continue to steadily scale our work to provide additional value and capabilities to the VA in upcoming quarters. As Marc mentioned, we expect to leverage the AbleVets team as these activities ramp throughout the year.We are also making good progress on DoD. We successfully completed a code upgrade during the quarter and kicked off the Coast Guard project and two additional deployment waves. Go-lives for these waves are slated for late 2020.With that, I'll turn the call over to Don. -- Thanks, John. Good afternoon everyone. Our Strategic Growth organization launched in 2019. Our ambition was a simple one: scale a set of focused business units that position Cerner beyond the hospital, beyond our Cerner Millennium EMR and beyond the traditional fee-for-service payment model.The six business units that make up Strategic Growth each target large addressable markets in excess of $3 billion with a path to meaningful share in each market. They gain leverage from existing Cerner assets ranging from the industry-leading data processing and aggregation capabilities of HealtheIntent to our subject matter expertise around the last-mile EMR workflow. Regulatory requirements are understood, surmountable and offer opportunities for differentiation. All six businesses overweight on recurring revenue and have high gross margin potential. And finally, Strategic Growth leaders focus squarely on speed-to-revenue as they pursue their larger category-leading positions.For full year 2019, our Strategic Growth businesses generated $520 million in revenue, representing 22% growth year-over-year. We believe we can deliver similar growth in 2020 and look forward to our Investor Day at HIMSS in Orlando which will afford us an opportunity to review the long-term targets for each business.As we look at areas of particular strength in 2019, cybersecurity frames our strategic approach. U.S. healthcare is seeing data breaches at a rate of one per day. Our technologies are core to how CIOs and CSIOs are building out their enterprise strategies. Cyber is an area of growing internal competence driven, in part, by our critical work to support our armed services and veterans. As a result, our security revenue from health systems grew nearly 40% in 2019.Our provider communication business, leveraging our EMR-agnostic CareAware platform, also benefited from strong market tailwinds and delivered record bookings in 2019. CareAware Connect solution adoption was strong with an over 100% year-over-year increase in utilization to almost 75,000 monthly users.We also were pleased with the full year progress in the Long Term and Post-Acute Care market with 23% year-over-year growth. Our Behavioral Health solution, within our LTPAC solution suite, was a particular bright spot. It delivered almost forty new footprints with 80% of total bookings revenue coming from outside our Millennium base.Our unified Behavioral Health solution is not only strongly differentiated in the market, it also was announced Friday as the 2019 Best-in-KLAS category leader. For individuals and families that seek help, our unified Cerner solution strives to make it easier for providers to deliver the integrated care that successful treatment demands.While LTPAC is an area where we sell at the point solution level, it also fits solidly into our larger strategic push to build out Health Network strategies across every MSA in the U.S. and all five of our focused global regions.At the technical platform level, our HealtheIntent platform is a strategic linchpin of our Health Network efforts. Our market-facing push to drive adoption of HealtheIntent continued to progress in 2019 bringing us to 175 HealtheIntent clients worldwide including the addition of leading providers like Prospect Health and Davita Health.As Brent noted in describing our AWS partnership, HealtheIntent was built as a native cloud platform, is EMR-agnostic and has been recognized by industry analysts like Chillmark as having the best product capabilities in the category. It also has been at the heart of our work with AWS. As we move nearly all of our non-federal HealtheIntent clients to the AWS public cloud in the first half of 2020, it will establish the clear value proposition of the cloud technology approach for provider healthcare. We also see it as a key enabler of our Health Network strategy in focused global markets, such as England as the NHS accelerates its push to advance Integrated Care Systems.Finally, with the content of healthcare digitized, we also are advancing a set of strategies around data services. Art Glasgow and team our Learning Health Network to make it easier for patients to be identified and participate in clinical trials. The Duke Clinical Research Institute partnership announced in 2019 played a central role in generating research opportunities for Cerner clients. Top health systems, such as Medstar announced yesterday, are helping us activate a network we believe can make it less expensive to create the next-generation of life-saving therapeutics.Across all six business units, our efforts to drive strategic growth fit into an emerging enterprise discipline around portfolio management across Cerner. In 2019, we were as intentional about the things we decided not to do as the things we decided to do.Several important Strategic Growth partnerships help tell this story. Our partnership with ResMed offers new revenue-generating opportunities in the post-acute care and also advanced analytics round sleep and respiratory. It also featured a decision to make ResMed's Brightree home health offering our preferred go-to-market solution. Similarly, our partnership with GetWellNetwork embedded their HealthLoop asset into our consumer application framework. It also came with a portfolio decision to not invest further in our MyStation patient engagement solution in favor of GetWell's industry-leading offering.We believe a combination of thoughtful build, buy, partner assessment will bring us closer to our long-standing vision to build a system of health and care with the individual at the center. It is a system where consumers not only have a right to their data, but also have the ability to mobilize it in pursuit of better health.We believe the entrepreneurial opportunities at the intersection of healthcare and IT have never been greater. We are excited about what 2020 -- and the 2020s -- hold for a setting an emerging area of strategic growth for Cerner. 2019 performance for its part laid a solid foundation for moving further, faster in the quarters to come.With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions.Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks for all the comments tonight and for taking the questions. I guess, Marc, just to go back to some of your comments, you highlighted 4% growth ex AbleVets addition and less the revenue cycle service contract that you guys exited. I guess just out of curiosity as we frame the year and understanding that 2020 has been put aside as kind of a transition year, how much of that remaining growth came from federal? And then clearly more importantly and I know we'll hear more in March, maybe just some of the major building blocks as you think about returning to profitable growth in the future, what are the pieces we should be at least starting to frame out as we think about growth beyond 2020? -- Yeah, no this is Marc, I think from a -- certainly as we look at the year and trying to get apples to apples, we'll be a little bit challenged in 2020. We're going to do our best job to do that. That's a [Phonetic] little bit why we try to talk a little bit about organic growth. I think if we get back to the overall view of top line growth, we've talked last year about kind of that being in the 6% to 9% range. Clearly the outsourcing selectivity and certainly the Adventist contract could impact that. And I think as we look through that that's probably a 100 basis point potential impact, which would put you some place in a 5% to 8% top line growth level. I think that's certainly something that we would expect to be doable for us. I think from a -- from the things that are going to continue driving, certainly federal will be part of that growth. As that contract, the VA contract ramps its way up to $1 billion a year of annual revenue, that's $250 million or so of additional annual growth in revenue that's just coming out of the VA contract depending on the time period. So that's certainly a good driver.And then strategic growth is obviously another area that we're expecting to see growth out of that will take the -- to $500 million to $600 million business it is today, and continue to grow that at strong growth rates. We also look at the opportunity that we have just within our existing base business. So, our core business, the opportunity to sell revenue cycle solutions back into that base, the ability to go attack the white space, all of those are things that we think overall are elements that can contribute to us having overall top line growth. And that really all of those things I talked about are primarily organic. We've talked in the past that we also expect there to be a level of inorganic growth for us and some M&A that will support primarily the opportunities and strategic growth and depending on the size of those opportunities an the size -- the revenue impact they bring that certainly could be accretive to those -- to the top line growth that we've talked about.But certainly as we go -- get to HIMSS and can have a little bit more time with everyone, we'll try to take you through a more detailed view of strategic growth and the elements of those businesses and how we've got -- how we've got the opportunities for growing the top line kind of just in the range that we've traditionally discussed. But I think to your point, we have talked about 2020 being a reset year. We are looking at opportunities to divest certain things as we do our portfolio management. That's going to negatively impact revenue. The M&A will positively impact revenue. And what we will try to do on a quarterly basis is kind of give you an update as to where we're going. Obviously, we'll be giving you quarterly guidance to if there is any adjustments. But right now we think the guidance we provided for the year is really solid. -- No, Marc, I appreciate all that. I guess, just a quick follow-up on your comments then would be around those potential further divestitures and potential M&A. Are those contemplated in the 2020 guidance or is this kind of best case of what we know today is just where the business stands? -- Yeah, the way we did our guidance was basically kind of on a same store basis. So it does not contemplate any of the divestitures. It does not contemplate any of the M&A potential activity because that's still, as of today, something to be determined. We think it's going to be more effective as those items occur that we can talk about them at that point.Keep in mind the AH, if you will, divestiture or that RevWorks business going away, is by far the largest item that was on the list, the items after that would be smaller items. So whether they even impact the overall guidance to a great extent will be something we determine that the point they occur. But right now, the guidance is based on current course and speed and then we will adjust as we -- as anything comes up in that space, one way or the other. -- Thanks for all that. -- Sure.Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for -- thanks for taking our call. I know you don't guide for bookings for the full year. But given the shift away from LT service bookings when do you think it's reasonable for you to assume you can return to year-over-year bookings growth? And when I look at the 1Q guide, is there any additional comp headwind for the shift or do you view the year-over-year long-term bookings compares already normalized entering the year? -- Yeah, I mean, I think clearly we don't guide beyond the Q1 because we do want to be pretty accurate relative to our guidance. I think as you -- the solid results that we delivered in Q4 actually delivering above our guidance range with the opportunity -- based on some opportunities to pull things in to the quarter based on some of the timing of our clients and their year-ends. This is going to impact Q1 a little bit because those things would have normally been landed in Q1. But I think we're still normalizing for some of the outsourcing elements in the bookings. So I think for 2020 what's kind of a year for resetting the top line from a growth perspective. I think it's fair to say that the bookings we'll get through the full year of 2020 and then we should get some pretty comparable bookings to be able to do apples to apples growth thereafter. But Q1 is still being impacted by the more focused view of anything that we're going to do on the services side that might be in the outsourcing space. -- Okay. And one quick follow-up if I might. So we are reading the VA deputy secretary was let go yesterday and I guess he was the one who is technically in charge VA implementations. I was wondering if you had been in contact with them, with leadership over there since that decision was made. Is there any concern or any issues about timing or potential bottlenecks for the implementation of the VA contract? -- Yeah, this is John. I won't comment specifically on the -- on that activity, but what I would say is that both the veterans VA, the modernization project they have significant bipartisan support. And the fact that there are changes and political activity, it's not a surprise or unexpected. And from the beginning of this project, we took great effort in making sure that we had broad support throughout the hill. The VA, veterans groups and other constituents and supporters to ensure when things like this do happen or political activity occurs, it doesn't impact where we're going. So we don't anticipate any impact from that and we think that our broad base of support is incredibly solid and we're just going to continue on. -- Great. Thanks so much for the color on that.Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Maybe you want to touch on -- I think at the beginning, you guys talked about the interoperability rules, the final rules right expected soon. Any thoughts on sort of the -- I know there were some concerns, particularly on providers around compress timelines or perceived compressed timelines for implementation. How do you view those challenges? And what would you, I guess, say about your preparedness to help clients to work through that? And any thoughts on maybe seeing a phased implementation schedule put in place instead? -- Yeah. So, this is Don. I think first and foremost, just to echo Brent's comments, this is a space that we've been very vocal on and pushed aggressively on for a number of years. So we have a lot of, I think, personal passion around interoperability, Semantic interoperability and what this space needs to look like for patients and providers and payers, so that's first and foremost, I think.Secondly, we feel like we're very well positioned to meet the implementation timelines that are being discussed, both from a technical and a non-technical business perspective. We'll obviously finalize those strategies as the final rule comes out and they're completely understood. But we think they're manageable and that we're well positioned to do that. And I think finally, just to reiterate some of the framing on the call, we think there is going to be a ton of business opportunities associated with these elevated rates of data liquidity. So when I think about the types of things that we're doing to enable our strategies around Medicare Advantage, alternative payment models like bundled payments and BPCIA, the opportunity to think through the technical strategies required to help provider organizations make those business models work, we think, create tons of opportunity for Cerner and frankly for the industry as a whole. -- Great. And maybe if I could just follow on, in terms of sort of the strategic -- the new model that you are working on, I'm not sure -- I might have missed it, but didn't hear any mention of Lumeris. Just curious on an update on how that partnership is working. Thanks. -- No, I appreciate it. We think we're making a ton of progress there and I'll tether back to the comments I just made. So, first and foremost, really the thing that was -- one of the things that was super exciting to us was to take the methodology, sort of the best-in-class methodology of Lumeris for Medicare Advantage, our technical capabilities and their service expertise and use it to bring a total solution offering to the market.In terms of progress made around that, we were very excited to use HealtheIntent as a foundational platform for running a provider sponsored plan focused on MA. And we over-attained against those IP milestones over the course of 2019. And now we're deploying the solution as part of the go-to-market strategy for Lumeris and Cerner.And again just to come back to the topic around information sharing, if you think about the Forestar MA plan that Lumeris runs in the St. Louis market, 14 different practices, high degrees of technology heterogeneity and how do you think about elevated rates of data liquidity both to drive through your strategies for activating that network as well as integrating their best practice capabilities into the last mile workflow of the physician, it's nicely complementary to the regulatory trends that are playing out. And we think it represents one of several very big business model opportunities for us going forward. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, hi. Good evening. Going back to the revenue growth guidance and some of the comments, Marc, that you made. So first of all, just to clarify, because I might have missed it, I think at some point you said 5% to 8% is doable for longer-term revenue growth. And just trying to understand the building block there. That's one.Second of all, I think you highlighted that the VA is a long-term revenue opportunity. So just wanted to make sure that we hear it right that you expected to grow that $250 million that you mentioned beyond the term of the initial contract.And then lastly as we think about the potential divestitures that are not included in this guidance range that you provided us today, who is making this bit of decision? Is this a decision that you are making based on the margin mix or is this something that the client when the contract is up for renewal decides to not renew? I just -- just if you can just clarify why is this taking such a long time to make a decision of what contracts are being divested or not. -- Sure. First of all, the 5% to 8% was really just discussing the long-term growth we kind of provided last year at HIMSS of 6% to 9% with a little bit of a -- 100 bps haircut based on the lower amount of outsourcing activity that's going to happen. So we're going to be, as I indicated a little bit earlier, at HIMSS we will be taking you through that long-term growth rate, what that looks like, where it's coming relative to our core businesses, our strategic growth businesses, our federal business. So you'll be able to see how it lays out. And then we'll give you some more details as to the strategic growth businesses that underpin all of those growth assumptions. So our goal is to lay out a very clear path that kind of falls within that range with the opportunity to over attain depending on what we do from an M&A perspective.Relative to the VA contract, when we first talked about it, be the $10 billion contract and it's a 10-year contract, the math would say that's $1 billion a year. Obviously there is a ramp-up period. And when we talk about it -- and when we talked about it, we said it ramps up over a four-year period growing about $250 million a year until we get to the $1 billion. So my reference to that $250 million increase was basically the revenue we're going to be ramping up to in that contract that gets us to the $1 billion run rate. We have talked about the opportunities to certainly sell more of our solutions and services to the VA, which could increase the $1 billion to a bigger number, but certainly the $250 million I referenced is just kind of current course and speed ramping up the projects, doing more and more on implementations and how that drives that revenue stream forward. So nothing new there. That's just really reiterating what we've talked about but it's another piece of the growth puzzle that is -- we've talked about, and does drive a good amount of growth.And finally on the divestitures, AH was a little bit of an anomaly in that space. That was really a business we're looking to kind of decide whether we want to be in or not. They were our largest client in that outsourcing. So that was more of a client contractual agreement. Going forward, it will be much more of us reviewing relative to our portfolio management, relative to our growth options for the business, where do we want to focus our attention. And those areas that we don't want to -- don't think are the growth areas for the Company we want to focus on, we're going to consider divesting as one of the options. We'll consider divesting, we will consider partnering. There are a variety of things that we will consider, but those divestitures will be in many cases of an existing business. It won't be a specific client relationship that will be unwound in some way. It will be an existing business that we will basically go out to market and look for opportunities to say here is this asset, it's something we're willing to let go and some of these -- some of these assets have significant value.So I think -- and from why is it taking so long standpoint, there is a lot of work we've done in our portfolio management to decide what are the key things we want to drive as we talk that work really was a lot of the 2019 work and really it was kind of finalizing as we ended the year. And certainly some of these activities on divestitures are already under way and ideally will be things that we can share with you in the very near future. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Garro from William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, good evening, and thanks for taking the questions. I want to ask a little bit more about the AWS partnership and maybe putting aside the very important work around migration and those long-term benefits of efficiency and lower TCO for clients. More curious on the consumer experience innovation side and what type of milestones either IP milestones or bookings related milestones that we can look for in 2020 from that partnership? -- Yeah, it's a great question, Jeff. Thanks. So let me talk to kind of multiple pieces of it. Just in terms of, one, the framework for the relationship. I think one of the things that we were excited about from a AWS and Amazon perspective was not just the opportunity to think through technical migration to the public cloud, but to really think about broader opportunities around the Amazon relationship and what it would look like, in particular to leverage their deep competencies around the consumer, coupled with their strong interest in being part of the healthcare ecosystem. So that was, I think, a design feature of the relationship, and I think we've been very happy with our opportunity to kind of engage with them and to look at key strategies around approach, whether those are publicly disclosed activities around how they think about their employee population and some of the things that they're doing in concert with JPM and with Berkshire portfolio companies or acquisitions that they've made around capabilities like PillPack. So we've had good visibility to that. We think it's an exciting piece, potential piece of the relationship and an important part of how we want to think about making the partnership work going forward.Secondly, from a technical perspective, I talked a little bit about the fact that HealtheIntent has really been a tip of the spear, if you will, relative to the migration to the public cloud, most of that work will be completed in the first half of the year. CareAware similarly is part of that early strategy and path. And I think we've been very transparent in terms of saying that the time frames around Millennium will be more elongated.Finally, in terms of what this is going to look like in terms of targeted bookings or revenue impact, I think there's businesses within strategic growth that are very excited about the potential pull-through impact relative to revenue. I would say our consumer and employer businesses in particular have a lot of energy here and have been real drivers around the strategic collaboration, but we're probably not at a point in the life cycle of the dialog where I could put out a revenue target or a bookings target that we would feel confident we could hit or over attain. -- Great. That's very helpful. One quick follow-up maybe on the technical side on HealtheIntent and CareAware and those this first-half migrations, maybe just some more specifics around where the benefits are for Cerner with those migrations and where the benefits are for clients. -- Yeah, well, first of all, I think just the ability to be able to stage and think through the migration to the public cloud has had a real value proposition for us as we try to think really comprehensively about not only the technical components but also how we have this conversation with our clients, how we think about innovation potentials in concert with our provider clients as part of the dialog and the approach.In terms of benefits, I think there are clear and demonstrable benefits that our clients are going to see. There is a performance -- system performance benefit that's very real. There is a benefit around latency and how we think about the path to near real-time data assets that I think could be very important around strategies like hospital operations. And I think this is also relevant as we start thinking about growth opportunities like cyber security where clients need our competency and expertise around how they manage hybrid environments with on-prem and cloud.So I think real benefits that we're deriving from a performance perspective, from a data and utilization of the data against business strategy and some really interesting, from my perspective, conversations around capability that we have that create white space opportunities for growth. -- Excellent. Thanks again.Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Wieland from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks so much. So on the restructuring cost that you're talking about, Marc, you said 2020 your restructuring costs are going to continue. Can you quantify the impact that these costs are to the operating margin that you're forecasting both in 2019 and 2020? -- Well the operating -- the restructuring costs that we're incurring that are the restructuring costs currently are being adjusted out of earnings. So, our adjusted earnings, there is zero impact on that. And that is the number on which we have based our operating margin targets. -- Okay. Thanks. And then -- that's helpful. And then a quick clarifying question, you said you're going to move almost all your hosting clients to AWS in the first half of '20 that's consistent with what you've said. But does that impact the revenue or profitability cadence throughout the year or are you going to be back filling that with government tenants? -- Well, for the most part the -- moving them to AWS the primary impact is freeing up hardware and space in our data center and that will absolutely be used to support our federal clients as well as other clients we have that are hosted by us on Millennium platform. All of these devices are basically interchangeable relative to the various architectures we use. So that will be the savings, the impact on [Indecipherable]. -- Okay. Thanks very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Dodge from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe staying within the platform modernization for a moment, understanding the entire project is going to be multi-year effort and ultimately long-term positive for margin, can you give us a little more insight into the impact it will have on margins in the interim, the investments you're going to have to make as part of it? Can you put some bookings around how big, how much, are they going to be consistent or chunky and are there efficiencies you're going to be able to garner in the meantime that will help offset some of it or is this something where the margin lift really doesn't come until the entire project is done? -- Yeah, this is Marc. As John kind of went through, each time we move an element to AWS there is some savings garnered. So certainly from a -- as we move HealtheIntent being able to manage that in the AWS environment it's -- it has a savings on the people it takes for us to run those environments in our data centers. So there are incremental, they aren't significant, but they are incremental.The investment we're going to make relative to our cloud investment on the other platform, primarily Millennium, that's part of our R&D expense, right. Part of our portfolio management goal is to free up dollars that we're spending on things that we don't see as long-term growth opportunities and put that in to some of the things that are going to be growth opportunities such as the cloud environment. We are still actually going through the exercise in the process of deciding exactly what the path to modernization is going to entail, exactly what's going to move and exactly the timing. So it's a little bit hard for me right now to give you an idea of what those dollars are. But our expectation is that much of that work is going to get funded out of our normal R&D spend that we will be focused on those efforts as opposed to potentially some other efforts on things that we're going to not be moving forward with.So there is -- that's -- it's going to be a refocus on it. So we're not going to garner some of the savings that we might have from some of those divestitures, although we will get -- gather some. But we shouldn't have a large influx of costs relative to this effort. And it will, as Don said, be a period of time before that gets there.No, once we get there the benefits are significant. We've got well over $100 million of annualized costs for hosting our clients in our data center just from software that we run them on in our data center that we won't need to use when they go to the cloud. There will -- the advantages of running a single version of the software in the cloud is a significant decrease in the cost we have for supporting our clients. They will get a much better experience, so clients stat goes higher. So the appetite for more solutions goes higher.So those are harder to quantify at this point other than the actual cost savings from sub-licensed software. But I think for the most part, that's the goal. Those benefits aren't going to happen in the next two or three years. That's -- we have to get through a lot of work and would be able to give you more of an update on that as we do our work to make -- to identify the path forward. But it isn't something I think is going to be a big expense impact, but the benefits will be a little bit longer term relative to margin improvement. And that's one of the things we've kind of talked about is we've got our path. We did -- we delivered '19, we have our path to 2020. How you keep delivering thereafter you continue on the optimization and then the next iteration is going to be basically platform-based that you bring these other additions and other opportunities to increase operating margins. -- Okay, that's great. Thanks, Marc. And then maybe on margins more broadly, you are still expecting to exit 2020 around the 22.5% level, you said maybe even a little bit better. I think you touched on it briefly in the prepared remarks, but could you just walk us kind of quickly through what you see being the primary levers or buckets of opportunities you can take out to get you from the 20% you just printed to something north of 22.5% in the next four quarters? -- Yeah, I think the key to remember is a lot of what we did in '19 really started impacting us late in the year, right. It really -- the margin improvement from Q3 to Q4 was significant. So -- but we have in place over 50% of the actions we need to go drive the margin uplift for 2020. The next set of things that are going to happen are going to happen toward the end of 2020 as we do things based on location of associates and things like that that will drive kind of some of those next year benefits for us.So the reason that Q4 and 2020 will be a little bit of a back-end loaded once again is because those are the next tranches and it takes time and effort to go get those in place. But I would point out that basically after Q1, we'll be delivering about 250 basis points of margin improvement each quarter year-over-year Q2, Q3 and Q4 and actually for the full year. So that level -- those margin improvements are the continuation of what we put in place in '19 and delivering on the next phases that occur in 2020. -- Got it. Okay. Thanks again. -- Hey, just to clarify before we get to the next question. My comments around 5% to 8%, it seemed like there is a little bit of confusion on people that talking about that comment. I'm just trying to -- the indication that I was trying to portray is that if you took our previous 6% to 9% target and lowered it for the impact of outsourcing it would reduce the range by 100 basis points. So I was just doing math and subtraction is one of the skills I do have. And we basically were taking those down to the 5% -- 8% just based on what our prior view was and kind of what the impact of the outsourcing that we've talked to you about is. But certainly at HIMMS we will give you a more detailed view of what we think the right answer is and how we get to that right answer. So I just want to clarify that because there's a little bit of confusion.Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. -- Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This might be one for Don. I know Don, historically -- this is an interoperability question, historically interface management has been an attractive part of the business with pretty good margins. And as we think about kind of changing interoperability regulations that will probably create some opportunities. So can you talk about how much business risk there might be departing the legacy business? -- Yeah, it's a good question, George. I think we're pretty comfortable that that business -- I mean you're right, it's relatively small and it does have a good margin profile. I think we're relatively comfortable that the things that we've been doing on SMART on FHIR enablement and our code program mean that the net impact is de minimis. And I think more to my earlier point, we think it's actually enabling to some of the bigger swing business strategies that we're advancing inside strategic growth.So while I can't perfectly net that out for you, I think we look at it and say it enters [Phonetic] to our advantage into the upside relative to where we want to go from a top line perspective. -- Okay, that's super helpful. And then Marc maybe just two quick number follow-ups. Can you talk about -- can you give maybe any color around the capex guidance for 2020? You talked about the number coming down from the $471 million number in 2019. Maybe just something about that. And is any share repo assumed in the 2020 EPS guidance? -- Yeah, I think that from a capex perspective, you can take $100 million out of that number to be kind of the range that we would expect as we look at 2020 for capex based on our buildings being slowed down or basically being completed. And I think the repurchase, we obviously have $200 million scheduled for Q1 to complete our 12 months. And I think going forward, certainly our capital allocation will look at M&A opportunities and other things relative to the use of capital, but I would think, at least $200 million a quarter of repurchases would seem to be kind of a base amount that we would then adjust relative to what our M&A is. -- Okay. I appreciate that color. Thank you. -- Why don't we take one last question?Thank you. Our last question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Question on federal contracts and I know that early in the uptake, you've had third party service that appears to be weighing on the margin. As we think about 2020 versus 2019, does that level of third-party support remain about stable or is there any increase or decrease? -- Yeah, this is Marc. For 2020 it will be about the same. We continue to leverage our partners in that space. Clearly AbleVets was one example of us working to bring a larger workforce quickly inside Cerner that we can then move to focus on the VA as some of the -- as we work through their existing projects which are relatively short term and get them on the VA that will allow us to bring that down. But that's probably more of a 2021 event at this point. -- That's helpful. And then last on the ex-US 3% growth last year as you look to 2020, I don't think that was part of the items you ticked off on growth opportunity. But what is your perspective on growth ex-US? -- This is John. I will answer that. I think it will be consistent with previous years. There's still a lot of opportunity outside the US in the form of new business, new regions and countries and those type of things, which we will look at pursuing each one of those opportunities and make a decision. But similar to the US we are also doing portfolio analysis on non-US as well. So we're going to look to be follow the same process and become much more focused and -- outside the US as well. So we may see both ups and downs outside the US as well. -- Thanks. -- Hey, this is Marc. I want to thank everybody for participating. One last comment there is still might be a little confusion about our long-term top line growth target. The 5% to 8% I mentioned is absolutely something, I think, we can [Phonetic] deliver, absolutely. And in fact, I think there is upside to that. So I think the number something closer to the 7% range is probably more reasonable. But once again my point is, we really want to take you through it in detail, show you what the building blocks are so you're not just blindly putting the number in. But 5% to 8% level is a level that I have a great deal of confidence in. So with that I want to thank you for attending this afternoon and look forward to getting together with you at HIMSS on March 10th. Until then have a good evening.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's a great growth opportunity for Veeva to reach even more healthcare providers, especially those that may not be all that familiar with CRM.Image source: Getty Images.What investors will love about Veeva is that not only did the stock's revenue climb 25% in the company's , but a big chunk of its revenue came from subscriptions. Subscription services totaled $227 million during Q3 and made up 81% of the company's top line, and that's up from 79% in the prior-year quarter.The company's commercial cloud revenue, which includes CRM, makes up a little less than half, 48%, of Veeva's top line. Veeva Vault, a suite of apps that focuses on data management, had a slight majority this past quarter, but that wasn't the case a year ago when commercial cloud sales had the upper hand with 52% of revenue.Cerner is also a big player in healthcare and tech and generates significantly more revenue than Veeva does. The company released its third-quarter results in October, and with revenue of more than $1.4 billion, Cerner makes more than Veeva does in 12 months. But where Cerner falls short is growth; revenue last quarter grew by just 6.7% from the prior-year quarter. And over the past nine months things aren't any better as sales are up only 6.3% from a year ago. The one strength in Cerner's financials, however, is that the company has a lot of diversification in its top line. Professional services make up the bulk of Cerner's sales, and that's still only a little more than one-third of its revenue through the first nine months of 2019. The downside is that while the company has multiple segments that are growing at more than double-digits, there's not one segment that's driving Cerner's growth and that investors can rally behind the way they can around Veeva.One benefit for income investors is that Cerner pays a dividend of around 1% per year. While it may be well below the S&P 500 average of 1.85%, it compares favorably against Veeva, which doesn't offer investors any payout.Over the long term, Veeva looks like it has the edge over Cerner, especially when looking at future growth. Veeva has some exciting products that are showing terrific growth, and a partnership with Salesforce is bound to lead to even more potential down the road. The company may only be scratching the surface of its potential.The one negative for Veeva is that the stock is very expensive, trading at 76 times earnings and a price-to-book multiple of 14. Cerner, however, isn't a cheap stock, either. While its P/E multiple of 49 is lower than Veeva's, it's still a high price tag given the modest growth the company has generated.When it comes to picking a good , it's key that a company has an exciting product that can drive home some strong results. And in Veeva's case, it has two -- CRM and Vault.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The pilot program -- called Amazon Care -- is a healthcare service being offered to the company's employees and their families in and around its Seattle headquarters. The program provides a number of innovative offerings, including both in-person and virtual options, while offering patients follow-up care and prescription drug delivery.While the nascent program might not seem particularly noteworthy, anyone who's followed the company for any length of time knows that Amazon has a history of developing products and services for in-house use at the company, only to offer them to customers and businesses later on.More importantly, this is just one in a number of recent moves that form a clear pattern that should put the industry on notice that Amazon's coming -- and it could mark the beginning of a dramatic shift in how healthcare is done.Image source: Getty Images.Amazon says the initiative offers \"the best of both virtual and in-person care.\" One virtual tool is the care chat option: \"Our in-app text chat connects you with a nurse in minutes for advice and answers on any health topic.\" Another option -- video care -- will \"launch an in-app video visit with a doctor or nurse practitioner for advice, answers, diagnosis, treatment, or referrals,\" according the website.\u00a0In-person options include a visit from a mobile care nurse, who can be dispatched to the patient's home or office to conduct in-person exams, testing, or treatment. Additionally, a \"care courier\" can deliver prescription medications.The Amazon Care Website is \"your first stop for healthcare,\" with a listing of issues it can address, including colds, allergies, infections, and minor injuries, as well as preventative health consultations, vaccines, and lab work. Patients can also get assistance with sexual health services like contraception and sexually transmitted infection testing.Earlier this month, Amazon announced the launch of Transcribe Medical, a medical transcription service that uses machine learning similar to what's found on smartphones and smart speakers. The new service can be turned on during a medical visit and capture the spoken interactions between the doctor and patient and transcribe them into a digital format that becomes part of the patient's digital medical records.\u00a0Medical technology specialist  \u00a0recently expanded its relationship with AWS by naming the unit its preferred cloud and machine learning provider, and has also became one of Transcribe Medical's first customers.\u00a0This followed close on the heels of the revelation in October that Amazon acquired Health Navigator, a start-up focused on providing technology and services solutions in the digital health arena. The features it provided were quickly folded into Amazon Care, forming the cornerstone of its live chat and video features.\u00a0Investors may recall that Amazon also raised eyebrows when it \u00a0in 2018 for about $753 million. The online pharmacist is licensed in all 50 states, giving Amazon a strong foothold in prescription fulfillment. The company announced last month that it was rebranding the company to PillPack by Amazon Pharmacy, and PillPack's CEO, TJ Parker, was also promoted to the level of vice president within Amazon.\u00a0The pharmacy unit is reportedly thriving, with revenue expected to double to $635 million in 2019, then double again to $1.2 billion in 2020.\u00a0These steps emerged from an initiative that started a couple of years ago, when Amazon, , and said they would partner,  whose mission was to search for ways to reduce their spiraling healthcare costs.\u00a0At the time, executives from the companies said they were searching for a solution \"free from profit-making incentives and constraints\" that would provide employees with lower-cost healthcare options. While that may be true, Amazon is in the business of making money, and CEO Jeff Bezos has famously said, \"Your margin is my opportunity.\"Each of these announcements, taken independently, doesn't amount to much. Taken together, however, they paint a compelling picture of how Amazon is slowly but systematically building out its  business. It won't be long before the company will be a force in the industry.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Healthcare, in particular, is a significant opportunity for technological advancements, and it's one area where Amazon could become a significant player in the years to come.Amazon made a big splash last year when it announced it was purchasing online pharmacy PillPack for $753 million.\u00a0That's chump change for Amazon, a company with more than $23 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its books,\u00a0as of its most recent earnings.\u00a0But it's an investment that could unlock significant opportunities. With an aging U.S. population, more patients are looking for convenient ways to access their medication. PillPack will sort medication for patients and put them into individual packets. The company also assists with refills and will deliver the medication every month, right to a patient's door.\u00a0\u00a0However, Amazon is looking beyond just prescriptions, as it launched\u00a0Transcribe Medical earlier this month at an Amazon Web Services (AWS) conference, which could change the way patients interact with their doctors. Transcribe Medical can automatically and immediately convert conversations between patients and doctors into written text, and then store that into an electronic medical record.\u00a0Through AWS, developers can access the medical information through an application program interface (API) and integrate it into their apps. Transcribe Medical is currently available to AWS customers and it offers users a pay-as-you-go pricing model that is based on how much audio is transcribed during a month.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Amazon isn't the only company offering this type of service.  has also been working on developing a similar tool, partnering with Nuance Communications. Nuance already has Dragon Medical, which is a transcribing service and together with Microsft Azure could produce a similar technology to Transcribe Medical. Nuance and Microsoft expect to have a technology available for physicians to test by early next year. -owned Google is also looking at developing a digital scribe service, although that still looks to be further away. Late in 2017, the company announced it would be working with Stanford Medicine on a pilot study, although there is yet to be a further update on that.\u00a0The important question is whether patients will feel comfortable with Amazon saving their sensitive medical information online. With breaches being more and more common and 's data practices shining a light on just how bad companies have been with protecting user information, consumers are reluctant to share anything private online.While Amazon itself hasn't been involved with any high-profile breaches, concerns surrounding privacy are on the rise, and that could prove to be the biggest impediment to Transcribe Medical's success. However, Amazon says that there has been significant demand for the service from existing AWS customers, including healthcare tech company\u00a0, which is one of Transcribe Medical's early users. Cerner also assisted with the development of the software.\u00a0Amazon did not provide details on if the software will have any controls or safeguards to protect patient information, but it day confirm that Transcribe Medical is eligible with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\u00a0Overall, getting deeper into healthcare is a good move for Amazon as it further diversifies the company's products and services. Although the tech giant still saw solid sales growth of 23% in its most recent quarter,\u00a0having more avenues to grow its top line will be crucial in not only maintaining that growth but increasing it as well.By getting into the  and expanding into healthcare, Amazon is strengthening its offerings in two industries that can provide the company with a lot of long-term stability and that have many growth opportunities, especially when it comes to technological advancements and auotmation.This gives Amazon the versatility to pivot its focus from one sector to the other, depending on which one may offer the more exciting opportunities at the time.Transcribe Medical isn't going to revolutionize the way that patients and doctors interact, at least not yet. The important takeaway for investors is that Amazon is focusing more on healthcare and using its competencies to help add value in that sector.With fears of economic conditions worsening in future quarters, the more Amazon can minimize its dependence on online retail while expanding into more recession-proof industries, the stronger the stock will be should consumers scale back their spending. E-commerce will still be a large part of the company's business for the foreseeable future, but the key is that Amazon is taking significant steps today toward more diversification. With strong profits and many potential opportunities for future growth, Amazon is one of the top  that investors can buy today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, except as required by law.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brent Shafer, Chairman and CEO of Cerner Corporation. You may begin. -- Thank you, Towanda. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll spend the first few moments providing my thoughts on the business and then I'll ask our CFO, Marc Naughton, to take you through the financial results. When Marc concludes, our Chief Client Officer, John Peterzalek, will provide some marketplace commentary, and I've also asked Donald Trigg, our EVP of Strategic Growth to talk about Cerner's growth strategies.It's been an eventful quarter at Cerner. At the end of July, we announced our collaboration agreement with AWS and Amazon, and the Company has made good progress around our transformation efforts, and we recently concluded our annual healthcare conference, Cerner Healthcare Conference, and it was really another successful CHC where we hosted over 11,000 clients, partners, media, and other healthcare affiliates from around the world. The theme of this year's conference was NOW and NEXT, and during my keynote I shared Cerner's improvements in addressing our clients' need today and our innovation plans for the future.As we discussed last quarter, our strategic framework to deliver on this innovation and growth is focused on three key areas: software-as-a-service, health networks, and data-as-a-service. Our recently announced relationship with AWS and Amazon is foundational to these areas. Our work with AWS is expected to enable delivery of scalable and secure solutions in a faster, more agile way with the power of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning tools embedded in the workflow.Our clients can expect to see advancement in the overall user experience for consumers and care teams as well as their overall health system and financial operations. We plan to modernize our platforms and software development approach, increased the pace of innovation and speed to market, and lower the operational burdens for our clients. This also represents an opportunity to reduce Cerner's costs over time and it's part of our focus on long-term profitability improvements. Further, the possibilities with the Cerner and Amazon collaboration are substantial given their vast consumer knowledge.I'd also like to provide an update on other activity that's part of Cerner's broader transformation. We spent most of this year focused on identifying and addressing inefficiencies in cost optimization opportunities. And while this was work is ongoing, we are now putting additional focus on other improvements to drive long-term business transformation. This includes work on capability building, automation, product management, and go-to-market strategy.To help us deliver on the market and product management elements of our transformation, we recently created and filled the [Indecipherable] September. And Darrell Johnson is joining us from Cerner following a successful career at Medtronic and he has a very deep expertise in healthcare data ecosystems and is a recognized leader in marketing innovations and global brand positioning for devices, software, services, and data platforms. I believe instituting this new CMO role and integrating strategic marketing into our organizational structure will strengthen Cerner's portfolio and product management processes and also improve our brand and go-to-market strategies.As it relates to the financial results, I'm pleased with this quarter's numbers. Against the backdrop of advancing our transformation, the team executed and delivered against the expectations we set. There is more work to do, but I'm confident we have the right balance, focus on executing the near-term, and recalibrating the Company for the long term and the profitable growth ahead.And I'd like to hand the call over to Marc. -- Thanks, Brent. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover our Q3 results and future guidance. In the quarter we delivered solid bookings, revenue, and earnings. I'll start with bookings, which were $1.651 billion in Q3, up 4% over Q3 of 2018 and the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $13.31 billion, which is down 9% from a year ago, primarily due to the termination of a large outsourcing contract that I'll discuss in a minute.Also recall that our backlog calculation under the new revenue standard excludes revenue from contracts with termination clauses. Even though such clauses are rarely exercised, we had a higher than usual amount of these types of contracts in Q3. When you combine the expected revenue from our backlog and the additional revenue expected from contracts not included in backlog, our revenue visibility remains at approximately 85% over the next 12 months. Revenue in the quarter was $1.429 billion, up 7% over Q3 of '18 and in line with our expectations.I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q3 of '18. Licensed software revenue in Q3 was $155 million, up 10% over Q3 of '18, driven primarily by our strong growth in our SaaS offerings. Technology resale was $70 million, increased 16% compared to both Q3 of '18 and last quarter. Subscriptions revenue grew 16% to $92 million. Professional services revenue grew 11% to $507 million, primarily driven by solid growth in implementation services. Managed services was flat at $302 million, with the lack of growth primarily related to the phase out of revenue from Health Services clients that made the decision to leave in past years and are just now getting transitioned out of our data centers.Note that our retention rate for Health Services clients is solid at about 80%, but there is still some impact from those that have left. Overall attrition remains very low, and we expect managed services to return to modest growth in 2020. Support and maintenance was also flat at $277 million, which is in line with our expectations and also reflects the impact of attrition. And finally reimbursed travel of $26 million was up 6%. Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue was up 6% from the year ago quarter of $1.265 billion and the international revenue of $164 million was up 8% year-over-year.Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 81%, down from 81.2% in Q2 of '19 and 82.8% year-over-year, driven by higher third-party services largely related to our federal business and a lower margin mix within technology resale.Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin, and net earnings. For these items we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, acquisition-related adjustments, organizational restructuring and other expenses, and investment gains that are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.Included in the organizational restructuring line this quarter is a $60 million charge related to the termination of our revenue cycle outsourcing contract with Adventist Health. This was a joint decision based on what we agreed was best for both parties and is also related to our previously communicated portfolio management process. This will result in revenue cycle operations being assumed by Adventist and Huron beginning in early November with nearly 1,700 Cerner associates transitioning back to back to Adventist Health and Huron at that time. This will reduce annual revenue by approximately $170 million but have little impact on earnings. Note that Adventist Health has recommitted to all clinical and revenue cycle solutions and IT work services. This only pertains to the revenue cycle outsourcing services. One other item of note that is included in GAAP results but not our adjusted results is a $9 million non-operating unrealized gain on one of our equity investments.Now, I'll walk through our operating expenses. Our third quarter GAAP operating expenses of $1.069 billion were up 18% compared to $903 million in the year ago period, largely driven by the restructuring charges. Our adjusted operating expenses were up 6% compared to Q3 of '18. Looking at the line items for Q3. Sales and client service expense increased 6% year-over-year primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to the growth in professional services. Software development expense increased 10% over Q3 of '18 driven by a 7% increase in gross R&D, a 6% increase in amortization, and flat capitalized software. G&A expense was down 8% driven by a decline in both personnel and non-personnel expenses. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased slightly year-over-year.Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 6.2% compared to 15.5% in the year ago period. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18.1%, down from 19.2% in Q3 of '18 but up from 18% last quarter and in line with our expectations. The adjusted operating margin implied by our revenue and earnings guidance that we'll discuss in a moment implies an expected adjusted operating margin slightly over our targeted 20% for Q4. We also believe our ongoing business optimization efforts keep us on track for delivering our targeted Q4 '20 adjusted operating margin of 22.5%.As I mentioned last quarter, we believe our ongoing cost optimization and business simplification efforts position us to continue improving our profitability beyond 2020. Further, we believe our platform modernization and move to the cloud represents another driver of margin improvement longer term. This will be a multi-year process, particularly for Millennium and most near-term benefit is largely offset by modernization investments. However, we expect the lower operating costs associated with this move along with efficiencies and improvements we are driving in our development process to meaningfully contribute to our profitability, while also helping us deliver a differentiated solution to our clients at a lower total cost of ownership.Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $82 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, which is down from $0.51 in Q3 of '18. Adjusted net earnings in Q3 was $212 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.66 compared to $0.63 in Q3 of '18. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were both approximately 20% in Q3.Moving to our balance sheet, we ended Q3 with $633 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $954 million last quarter with our free cash flow being offset by $400 million of share repurchases. For the year, we have repurchased 14.4 million shares for $1 billion at an average price of $69.53 and currently have $483 million of remaining authorization under our repurchase program.Moving to debt. Our total debt remained flat to last quarter at $1.039 billion. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.155 billion, down from $1.229 billion in Q2 of '19. Our Q3 DSO was 74 days, which is down from 78 days in Q2 of '19 and 82 days in the year ago period. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $351 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $111 million and capitalized software was $66 million. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs was $174 million for the quarter. We expect free cash flow to remain solid in Q4 and solid growth in free cash flow in 2020.Moving to capital allocation. As I indicated, we repurchased $1 billion of stock in Q2 and Q3 leaving $483 million remaining on our current authorization. We still expect to execute the majority of the repurchase authorization by the end of Q1 of next year subject to market conditions and other factors. We intend to continue funding this with a combination of cash from operations and debt with the amount of debt depending on the timing of our repurchases and whether we use cash for M&A and other purposes.Regarding M&A, we did just announced a definitive agreement to acquire AbleVets. The cash consideration for this acquisition is expected to total approximately $75 million, and we expect it to close in Q4 of this year. We expect this to contribute approximately $90 million of revenue in 2020. As John will discuss, AbleVets is a great fit given their experience and the importance of our federal business. Moving to our dividend program. We paid our first two quarterly dividends of $0.18 per share on July 26th and October 9th.Now I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q4 to be between $1.41 billion and $1.46 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 5% over Q4 of '18 and will bring full-year 2019 revenue to $5.685 billion, which reflects 6% growth over 2018 and is within our previously provided full-year guidance range. Note that guidance includes approximately $25 million of impact from the termination of our Adventist RevWorks agreement and our Q4 guided growth would be 7% without this change. Also note that our guidance reflects minimal impact from AbleVets given it is not closed. We expect Q4 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.73 to $0.75 per share. The midpoint of this range is 17% higher than Q4 of '18 and would bring full year 2019 adjusted diluted EPS to $2.67, which reflects 9% growth over 2018.Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 21% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 and will bring full year 2019 bookings to $5.876 billion, down 13% from 2018. Year-over-year decrease in Q4 is primarily driven by a couple of factors. Historically, Q4 bookings have included large RevWorks extensions from Adventist Health that will no longer occur given the transition of those services back to Adventist. Additionally, as we discussed this year, we are taking a more selective approach to low margin long-term contracts, and this has led to a decline in those types of bookings that is expected to continue. We expect to provide our outlook for 2020 on our Q4 call.In summary, we are pleased with our solid results in the third quarter. We've made good progress this year, but there is still a lot of work to do, and we expect to continue executing against our plan as we finish 2019 and move into 2012.With that, I'll turn the call over to John. -- Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will provide results highlights and a quick update on our federal business. I'll start with our bookings, which grew 4% over last year and were at the high end of our guidance. Consistent with recent quarters, we had a lower level of long-term bookings compared to last year with a percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts in the quarter at 29% compared to 34% in Q3 of last year. Excluding these long-term bookings, our bookings grew at a double-digit rate in Q3.We had solid contributions this quarter from all key areas, including revenue cycle, federal, and our strategic growth businesses, which include population health, health networks, employer, consumer, data-as-a-service, and other adjacent markets.Coming out of our Health Conference earlier this month. I had several positive takeaways. First, our clients are creating tremendous value with our solutions. Clients led over 200 presentations, education sessions, and demonstrations where these accomplishments were shared with over 11,000 attendees. They are committed to getting current and staying current, which is an important foundation for our longer-term shift to a single instance cloud platform. They are excited and enthusiastic about our collaboration with AWS and Amazon, our commitment to innovation, and the best opportunities that a cloud-enabled platform brings.Finally, we heard positive feedback on our revenue cycle progress and this sentiment is also reflected in our pipeline, which includes some large clients initiating to move to Cerner's revenue cycle. I also wanted to share a noteworthy success story that demonstrates the benefits of changes we have made over the past 18 months to become more client-centric.This client is an academic system that had low satisfaction with our Cerner solutions just a couple years ago. By turning our focus to getting them current on our latest software release and a strong alignment with our model experience, they have become a top reference site with strong system performance and improved clinician productivity. We're also in the process of converting 125 of their clinics from our primary competitor system to Cerner. This demonstrates the value of our client-centric operating model with a focus on getting clients current, aligned with standards, and which makes them successful and can drive broad levels of satisfaction and opportunities to expand our relationship.Now, I'll provide an update on our federal business where we had a very busy quarter. We brought a wave of four sites live for DoD in September and expect the next wave of sites to go live in the fall of 2020. We are also kicking off the Coast Guard project this quarter. For VA, we expect the initial operating capability, go live, and the kick-off for additional waves to occur in the spring of 2020.Before I close, I'd like to provide a little more color on the AbleVets acquisition that Marc mentioned. We believe, bringing the AbleVets team onboard will provide Cerner additional capacity and technical expertise that will be very valuable in the federal space. As a trusted partner in our EHR modernization program with the VA, they are highly specialized in cybersecurity, agile engineering, analytics, technology enablement with deep experience in delivering value to federal health clients. As we prepare for the upcoming key milestones on our federal projects, integrating the AbleVets team in our business is a natural next step as we expect their expertise will accelerate Cerner's success in providing integrated, seamless care for veterans, service members, and their families.With that, I'll turn it over to Don. -- Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. We believe our vision to create a health network architecture for providers of care in every community will be realized in the coming decade. The addressable market is far larger than the integrated EMR category that Cerner helped create and progress was made in the third quarter to lead it.One of the strongest provider brands in healthcare is Pennsylvania-based Geisinger. They share our vision to architect a system of health and care. In Q3, Geisinger designated our EMR-agnostic HealtheIntent as their preferred health network platform for a 10-year term. They also will continue to leverage our Wellbeing [Phonetic] application for member engagement within their health plan. Market reaction has been quite favorable.Health systems are seeking solutions to help them scale growing health networks with high levels of technology heterogeneity and a shifting mix of employed and affiliated physicians. Cerner is well positioned to meet that market need. Beyond Geisinger, the emerging market reach of HealtheIntent can be seen in the recently released CMS data, a Medicare Shared Savings ACO performance. CMS announced over $700 million in 2018 MSSP savings after accounting for shared savings and losses. Cerner clients generated nearly 200 -- more than $200 million of those savings. The other MSSP ACOs, Advocate Physician Partners or APP, Hackensack Alliance, Memorial Hermann were among the top performers.As long-term and post-acute care become an increasingly meaningful part of the health network, we also took steps in Q3 to strengthen our continuum of care strategy. We announced ResMed's Brightree home health product will be our go-forward market solution. ResMed's and Cerner also will use HealtheIntent as a health network platform for post-acute care assets. This strategy, coupled with condition and [Indecipherable] specific analytic opportunities in areas like sleep, give ResMed and Cerner the potential to build a category-leading presence in a post-acute market that we believe has significant momentum.In the state government space, we extended a meaningful relationship in the third quarter with the Texas Department of Aging and Disability to bring a holistic care offering to Texas seniors and disabled population. It's a solid use case for how Cerner's extended care and behavioral health assets, our managed services, our proven history of innovation, and our solid delivery record created a compelling win strategy.We also announced an investment and partnership in the third quarter with i2i Systems. i2i command 25% market share within the federally qualified health center segment, covers nearly a third of our Medicaid patient data, and has a strong payor business with 13 managed care clients. The relationship already has delivered our first material win, an FQHC community health network based in North Carolina. Cerner technology will help provide Medicaid recipients with care coordination and management across the state level network looking to tackle rising Medicaid costs.Whether financing model is Medicaid, Medicare Advantage for commercial insurance, we see the person at the center of any true health network architecture. During Q3, we delivered a new version of our [Phonetic] Wellbeing application. We also launched a Consumer Framework that delivers one seamless consumer experience for both our application as well as client-developed and third-party applications. And as part of that overall strategy, we added consumer self-pay capabilities from Palo Alto-based Simplee and we also augmented our patient access and online scheduling capabilities through a partnership with Boston-based Kyruus.Cerner's health network architecture vision has four core pillars: automate the care process; connect the person; structure, store, and study the data; and then close the loop by pushing those analytic insights back into the care process. I believe our health network architecture vision is more relevant today than it was when it was first sketched for an MBA class in the 1990s. Our strategic urgency to advances has never been greater, and the quarter just concluded was foundational for doing so.With that, let me turn the call back to Brent. -- Thanks a lot, Don, and thank you all for being on the call. As you heard from the team, we're continuing to execute against our targets and advance our strategies. And just to summarize, our transformation work remains on track and is advancing beyond cost optimization to include broader structure and process changes and automation. We're executing against opportunities in our core, while also building pipeline and capabilities in our strategic growth areas. And we're actively executing our portfolio management strategy, demonstrating increased willingness to partner when it accelerates opportunities and strengthens our capabilities.In summary, I believe this represents solid progress on our pursuit of sustainable and profitable growth, which I believe can be achieved while playing a key role in driving meaningful improvements in healthcare quality and efficiency.Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open.Hi, this is Jonathan Yong on Steve. I just had a question on the Adventis transition. I'm just curious if it has had any impact on future revenue opportunities. I guess what's the client feedback that you're exiting these Cerner relationships and I guess to that extent does it hurt future relationship opportunities where a client may want a one-stop-shop type of vendor? -- This is John Peterzalek. I don't think it hurts either our position or where we're trying to go, because what we do is we try to align with the needs of our clients, and as those needs change it may result in something like we did with Adventist. So as long as we have a good solid reason, explanation and the reason that that happened, it hasn't been an impact. So we haven't got a tremendous amount of questions about it. And as this is one of the areas we're being more selective about, I think it's understood by our clients in terms of what we're doing. So in the short term, it hasn't had any negative impact. -- Yeah, this is Marc. We've talked about being selective. So that doesn't mean we're not going to do certain elements of that business. But we aren't going to do the full outsourcing; we're going to handle all the bodies. We can still do tactical assistance to our clients often when they need help them but at margins that are attractive to us. So I think we can still add that benefit to that client base without them saying, hey, Cerner can't offer everything I need. So I think -- and we're seeing that in the marketplace. -- Okay, that makes sense. And then I guess, as we kind of think about the top line revenue algorithm moving forward, how do you expect these exited businesses and future exits to change the top line dynamics. Will you guys end up bleeding a bit more in acquisitions moving forward with respect to the 6% to 9% long-term revenue outlook? -- Yeah, this is Marc. I think the clearly, as we're going through these optimization and restructuring efforts, there'll be some level of reset at the top line as certainly we exit certain businesses and certain approaches to driving revenue. But I think if you look at the -- and M&A absolutely will be a component of how we look to grow the businesses. I think John's comments really indicate that we have a lot of internal growth opportunities, some organic growth opportunities. By leveraging those with some M&A to make them go quicker and grow them more quickly, I think it's clearly one of our strategy. So it's not going to be us just going out and acquiring revenue, it's going to be us investing in the business and in some case that investment will be M&A in a business that can help us grow and identify the opportunity faster than if we do it organically. -- Okay, great. Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. Check to see if your phone is on mute. -- Thanks. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the portfolio review. Would it be possible to I guess get a little bit more specific as you transition out of the Adventist relationship in revenue cycle, you have I think a remaining smaller revenue stream with some other revenue cycle services that you're providing. Does it still make sense to stay in that business? And then I think at your recent -- at CHC in the analyst discussion, you talked about kind of maybe the varying levels of of scale and penetration that you might have achieved in some of your international markets. What are your thoughts about your persistency in international markets? Thanks. -- Yeah, this is Marc. Clearly, the non-US market is still a huge opportunity for us. And John can comment on that. I think, overall, we are still in the process and working through that portfolio review process. So I don't want to talk a whole lot about the results of that until we're at a point where we've worked through it and could be more precise. Clearly, one of the things we've talked about for a while is being selective in some of these outsourcing opportunities and the fact that we could work with Adventist who is interested in taking back those associates. Every Cerner associate that was working on Adventist now has a job with Adventist. So all of those people are employed. So that was a great result for them to take that over. It was consistent with the strategy they currently have, consistent with our strategies.But there are going to be a lot of opportunities. We're going to look at the remainder of that revenue cycle business. If it doesn't meet our selective criteria relative to margins, we're going to determine what needs to be done with that business. From a global's perspective, we're going to look at the same lens. We're going to look at the operating margins, the opportunities we see, and how we might address those markets in a more efficient method that can drive margins where they might -- we might not be driving them today. John, do you have additional comments on global. -- Yeah, I'll make a comment on the international market. I still remain incredibly optimistic and positive about the markets outside the US in a couple fronts: when we addressed a call or two ago which there are large RFPs pending or about to be released for some statewide and municipalities that regional components out there that we're looking at pursuing; as well as our strategy of where we have embedded in a country the ability to expand beyond that first initial region or footprint and expand beyond. And both of those are playing out right now, not to mention opportunities in countries we've already embedded in, in Canada, UK, Europe, Middle East, and Australia. So outside the US still remains a positive opportunity for us, and we look at opportunities every day there. -- And Marc, on ... -- And just ... -- Sorry, go ahead. Sorry. -- No, that's OK. I was just going to say, just to go back to sort of the previous question on growth and the discussion around portfolio management. From a growth perspective, we're going to be looking at a combination of built-by partner strategies as Marc discussed. I think relevant to that there is also a divest and partner component that's been a significant piece of how we've been thinking about the business. And I think over the last 180 days, there is a good cadence there. Certainly the decision we made last quarter to partner with GetWell from a myStation perspective, which gives us a best-in-class offering there from an experience perspective, and with their GetWell Loop asset. And then this quarter with the decision around home health and the partnership with ResMed. So I think we are running a process. We have selectively looked to make some decisions there, and it's part of a framework that we see continuing into 2020 that will be part of how we position for growth long-term. -- Got it. Thank you. I'll cede the floor. Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open. -- Okay, great, I'd love to hear maybe a little bit more elaboration on the ResMed partnership, maybe kind of what they brought that you thought you could not do. And did you -- and maybe, I don't know if it's material or may not be, but roughly the size of the business that you had previously that you're I guess sunsetting, can you talk about that, how that process will play out? -- Sure. I'll do a little bit of high-level framing on how we thought about the relationship. So I think first and foremost, we really like the macro trends playing out from an addressable market perspective in the post-acute space. We think it's got interesting trend around it, particularly with large regional IDNs who are building out network strategies within their MSAs. So it's a space we like a lot and areas like behavioral health continue to be huge growth areas for us within the strategic growth business.I think. secondly, from a home health perspective, you'll recall that we acquired a solution in that space called BeyondNow. So we had an acquired solution in that area and we stepped back and looked at it and said, is this is an area where we want to make significant investment or alternatively is there a chance for us to partner. We like the Brightree solution offering. It's cloud-based. We think it's industry leading. it has a very accelerated implementation timeline around it. And as I started the conversation with ResMed, we saw an opportunity for HealtheIntent to be a material network overlay around our post-acute assets. And we also thought they brought some interesting sort of non-traditional assets from our perspective around areas like sleep and respiratory that could be very interesting for us as we play through our strategy on a 5-year basis and start thinking about member and consumer strategies where that ends up being relevant around premium and first dollar risk strategies. So that's how we thought about it at the decision tree level, if you will. And I can tell you, as John said, the reaction from Cerner Health Conference and from our early client conversations has been quite positive. -- This is Marc. From an economic standpoint, it was not contributing a whole lot of revenue. We had not invested in the business significantly. The revenue was actually declining from that business and by this agreement with ResMed being able to get some additional dollar from the HealtheIntent platforms and leveraging those elements, we actually expect that to turn and actually become a growth business for us, which it hadn't been. But today's contribution is very small, if you will, it's a blip on the radar today. And one of the reasons we want to take an action to turn that into something that would be a growth driver going forward. -- Okay. And then maybe with regard to the Amazon AWS relationship, how does -- sort of, how should we think about that juxtaposed against your hosting business over time? Like, how are you going to sort of balance kind of some of the overlap there? -- Well, I think clearly, 80% of our clients are hosted today. The first AWS, there is a kind of a strategy of when we're moving things there. HealtheIntent is going to be the first platform we move there. It's a cloud developed solution that we host today. Very natural to move that over the AWS, and that's the first thing you're going to see move, and we'll have that primarily moved in the first half of next year.The benefits of doing that are lower cost of operation from using a platform that I can buy on an as-needed basis, hour-by-hour as opposed to building out the maximum capacity I need at the height and having to provision for that in my data center. It also allows me to take those data center components and space and rededicate them to projects such as the DoD and the VA, which is a significant savings of capital as we roll forward. So relative to the kind of hosting versus AWS at a tactical level, it will drive efficiencies and drive up cost optimization. As we move forward, we'll continue to move the platforms [Indecipherable] where will be the next platform we move over to AWS, and then obviously over time then we start moving elements and components of Millennium over to that platform. But the first mover, if you will, is going to be HealtheIntent, perfectly designed to go do that. We already have HealtheIntent running in AWS. All new clients we've had in the last two quarters have been brought up in AWS. So they will be a very clean transition to go capture those benefits and the capital savings. -- And real quick, could you say what the currency impact was for foreign revenues? -- It was slightly negative. -- Okay, thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Demko with Citi. Your line is open. -- Thank you, and thank you for taking my question, guys. So I saw some improvement in free cash flow conversion this quarter and I was hoping you could kind of walk us through the puts and the takes that will be impacting your go-forward cash flow conversion. Just given you have this move away from some of these lower-margin outsourcing businesses [Indecipherable] and AWS all going online. -- Yeah, I think clearly from a -- as the business moves to more recurring in nature, healthcare is always a challenging collection environment just because the pace of play. You usually get paid, but it always takes longer to get paid in most businesses. That's why you're actually pretty happy when your DSO is 74 days.But I think as we continue to move more and more toward these -- the SaaS business models, toward the monthly payments, you'll start getting into a mode where those checks will be more repetitive in nature, similar to our support checks that we get as we go through this business.So obviously, in our mind as we move to those platforms, it is going to help our conversion, lower our DSO, lower the AR, as we move forward. We are very happy with the free cash flow that we delivered this quarter, very strong, and want to replicate that again in Q4 to get us to a fairly good position for '19. And then just as a reminder from overall free cash flow, we will complete the work on our new campus in the first half of 2020, which will then start allowance for a lot of the expenditures that are being spent on that campus adding potentially $100 million of free cash flow as we [Indecipherable] that completion. -- If you want all of these projects net out in the second half of 2020 and beyond, how should we think about your longer-term free cash flow conversion evolving? -- Well, I think clearly as we look forward to '20, '21 and beyond. if you're looking kind of as a percent adjusted net income, say, we're between 50% to 60% in 2019, we'd expect to be quickly aggregating up to where you're getting to the -- going from the 70%s into the certainly the mid 80%s by the time you get into kind of the end of the three- or four-year period. So the lower -- we're not going to be spending more money on buildings, that's clear. So the cash flow [Indecipherable] will be part of our capital allocation analysis and certainly will help us both as we look at opportunities to invest in M&A, to invest organically, and to look at share repurchases. -- All right, thank you. And just one quick follow-up, what drove the backlog decline for the third quarter? -- The backlog decline -- obviously, the AH contract that was in the backlog isn't in the backlog anymore. So that was the biggest element. -- Got it. All right, thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Marc, are you able to -- will you quantify for us, you talked about the roll-off of the Adventist business. I guess can you quantify the total value if we think about like on a 2019 basis other works business that might roll-off? And then I guess, as we think about the 2019 and the 2020 margin targets, how much should we think of is kind of the rolling off of the low-margin business versus the cost tackling initiatives the Company is taking? -- Yeah, George. we've been very clear that our focus on the margin expansion is focused on cost optimization and fit-for-growth efficiencies. The top line may impact that one way or the other, but what we're focused on delivering is on the cost side. I think as you look at the AH business, Q4 it might be $25 million of revenue impact that's going away. So that's a sense of what that number looks like. And I think the -- so that will give you a kind of a sense for the total. But I think that over the entire time, it's going to be some place around $150 million, some place in that vicinity would be the annual impact. Once again from the earnings impact, it's zero impact on the earnings side. And I think that's clearly one of the reasons or the reason that we were looking to get out of that business.So I think there'll be some impact. Obviously, if you look at $25 million in Q4 that might be 30 basis points of impact. But I think if you look at our guidance, we're kind of guiding to be at 20 point something which kind of takes into account, getting to $20 million without the impact of that. But I think, once again, our focus is on the driving the optimization cost. There'll be some impact on top line relative to that, but our focus definitely is on the cost side of the business. -- No, that's helpful. And then maybe just kind of as a follow-up. I think what a lot of investors are going to focus on is, the Adventist is going to roll-off to, call it, 150, 160. There's probably other business that rolls off. Thinking about the business that rolls off versus the M&A versus kind of what the Company's longer term top line targets are, which probably will need to be tweaked at the Investor Day. I guess, stepping back kind of maybe just do you have a timeframe for when you wash through the businesses that you want to exit even if you don't want to quantify them, just so I guess we can think of when the business rebases and kind of construct a road back toward the Company's long-term targets. -- Yeah. No. Good question. I think our goal through this portfolio management process is to make those decisions, identify those areas, and basically as we exit 2020, we've got our base of revenue that we are expecting to deliver from and grow from going forward. And ideally, we'll be able to kind of keep investors in the loop on each of the -- as each of those decisions becomes public, what the impact of those is, because as you indicated, yeah, I've got an element of AH is going away. But starting 2020, I've got an element of AbleVets that's coming in. So right now, there's going to be a lot of puts and takes, and I can't give you with clarity when those are going to hit. But as we get the hands, we start rolling into 2020, we should be able to give you a better view of kind of the revenue that is in the bucket that we think is likely something that we're going to adjust out relative to portfolio management and the other things that we would expect to be able to bring in as we roll forward.So I think it is -- the point that we're getting to is really important is that 2020 will reset the base, our revenue number, and it's going to be, taking out low margin revenue and bringing in big opportunities for growth and higher-margin revenue. And once we get that kind of base reset, we absolutely look to grow from that in levels we've kind of consistently talked about in the past. -- Good stuff. All right, Marc, thank you. -- Sure.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper with SunTrust. Your line is open. -- Thanks very much. Maybe a follow-up on George's question. Marc, with the bulk of the revenue that you're between AH and another potential is most of that going to show up in managed services or are there other revenue lines where that would show up? Just trying to make sure I'm thinking a little bit more near-term and trying to fine-tuning the model. -- Yeah, Sandy, there is a -- as we go through the portfolio management process, some of those businesses impact all of the lines, and some of them aren't as high impact on the hosting side, because there are some benefits. There are some businesses, if you look at our home health, that had nothing to do. Small number, but it was more illustrative of solution sales and client revenue stream that we could turn into something that we saw as an opportunity.There'll be other businesses that are more focused on shared services, and there'll be other businesses that are just in areas that are kind of the full complement of business models, but that we do think they are in areas that we don't see the growth opportunity that we're going to go invest in them. So I can't really give you today what business models, they are all going to fall out, because there are a variety of business models that are going to be impacted. Ideally, as we get start working our way through 2020 we'll be able to give you something that lets you get a little bit more of a sense of where those are going to hit. -- Okay, that's helpful. And then a quick follow-up on support and maintenance. I missed what you said. I can't remember. Is there any 606, 605 this year that's impacting support and maintenance, or just remind me what it is that's caused support and maintenance to be flat-to-down this year, and do you think that starts to pick back up going forward? Thanks. -- Yeah. Support and maintenance once again is really more tied to the HS clients that basically when we kind of did the acquisition were in-flight or beginning to be in-flight. We're starting to see those clients actually complete their contracts with Cerner and move on to a different platform and that's offsetting growth that you would see in the support stream normally. Once those kind of get fully embedded, which for us should be over the next 12 months or so, I think you're going to see going back to kind of low-single digit increases in what is a very large number from a denominator perspective. But we should return to growth in that space, but there is going to be a near-term impact headwind to get through some of those clients. -- Okay, thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor with Baird. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the federal bookings side. I was hoping to confirm that the VA awards helped drive some of the upside to the 3Q bookings toward the high end, I should say. I think, Marc, can you give us a sense for what's embedded within the fourth quarter guidance with respect to VA bookings? -- Well, this is Marc. We don't talk about exactly what's in our guidance relative to a client specific characterization. I think from a bookings guidance perspective coming into this quarter, certainly there wasn't any large single transaction that we were looking to get from any one location. I think we had a good contribution from the federal business as is kind of expected given the end of the government fiscal year. So I think that was a contribution, but given the percent of that business versus the total business, I don't know that I'd say that was the upside to our bookings. We had some other things that came in at a larger number than we originally expected. So I don't know that that was a source of us getting to the high end of the guidance range. It was pretty good performance across. John, I don't know if you have ... -- Yeah, I'll start by saying has really happy with the Q3 results. And I think the strong areas is where you would want to see them strong. So revenue cycle, not RevWorks but the actual revenue cycle solutions and those that surround it, we had a really solid quarter there, which also reflects the progress we've been making on revenue cycle. So I think that's incredibly positive. Services were up incredibly positive. And then some of our strategic growth things that Don had mentioned in his components, whether they include population health adjacencies and those type of things made a strong presence as well. I see that continuing, and I think it's where I want to see my bookings come from as well it's because what we've been focusing on. And then we surround it with the normal opportunities we have. -- Got it. That's all I had. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Marc, given what your commentary about growth and how much you need to work through in 2020, when we get to February, obviously, there'll be a moment where we see what you've accomplished for 2019. As you think about the budget process for 2020 and what you'll be able to communicate for the year with all those moving parts, what should we expect in terms of communication at that point? -- Yeah, well, I think obviously in Q4 results we'll talk to you about our guidance for 2020. As I indicated in my comments, the optimization work is going well. We are hitting our targets, and that means that for Q4, we feel good about delivering the 20% margin number that we've talked about as a target. And as I did mention, based on the success we're having and the fact we're getting some of those benefits slightly earlier than we would have expect -- had on the calendar to get to in 2020, it gives us a good feel for relative to 22.5% that we've laid out for Q4 of '20.So I think from a cost optimization standpoint, we're right on track. As I indicated on the revenue side, the businesses -- certainly, there are opportunities for us to look through the various elements of the business and do the portfolio management work that we've talked about and look at M&A opportunities that can impact 2020. So all that work is still to be done. When we come out and are able to complete our 2020 plan and kind of share the highlights of that with you guys in form of guidance as we do our Q4 call, I think that will be the next time we're able to talk to you about that. But as I sit today, I feel pretty good about where we stand. -- Okay. And then one follow-up question. As you get to Phase 2 or 3 of getting to those margin targets. I think there has been some discussion of investment in tools that will help facilitate the process. And I'm wondering, are those significant. Will they run through non-GAAP metrics and will those weigh on you to some extent next year? -- For the most part, next year would be primarily focused on implementation of those tools. For the most part that implementation work will go through on the restructuring line. So it won't impact our adjusted earnings. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Sure.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I guess, summarizing, a lot of what you've said today, it seems to us as you go through this portfolio rationalization, as you move toward the 2020 margin targets, I guess how do you think about the balance of what should be contributed from some of these potential exits, and if there are further exits of products or further wind down of some of this low-margin, particularly services revenue, could we be viewing upside potentially to that 4Q target? I guess what would drive the upside to that 4Q target if we were to see one, 4Q '20? -- Yeah, that's once again talking in advance of on 4Q '20 other than expressing my comfort with the 22.5%. I would just remind -- restate that our focus is on the cost optimization to get to that 22.5%. So it depends on what the adjustments to revenue could change that number, could impact that number. The AH in Q4 could be a 30 basis point positive to it, but that's not -- I'm not really taking that into consideration when I'm looking at my numbers, right. I'm looking at the cost optimization to drive to those margin targets.So today, Michael, it's just too early for me to go tell you. hey, there's upside, that there is downside. I'm focused on the 22.5% and focused on the cost drivers that I need to get to that number. So I think that, at this point, that's kind of all I can tell you. And hopefully, when we get to Q4 and can share our 2020 plan, guidance level, we'll be able to give you a little bit more specifics. -- And just let me say, on the revenue cycle area from a portfolio management perspective, as John said, the primary lens we have there is a significant whitespace opportunity in our client base and how we take advantage of a real growth opportunity for the business. So that's our line-of-sight focus. Then how do we think about the total solution offering in terms of technologies and services required to go deliver that. And as the best way to do that through a organic build, a partner, or divest in partner strategy. So I think that's the decision tree and the calculus and the process that we're working through. But I think there is a big, big growth opportunity for us in the revenue cycle space. There is a lot for us to like about what's playing out there, it's got significant trend. -- And Michael, I'd say, when you look at -- clearly, at least in my mind, AH is from a revenue divestiture standpoint is the largest by far. So you're not going to see similar levels of businesses that we will be looking to get out of. Most of the others are going to be -- they will be smaller than that and probably significantly smaller. So relative to kind of your question, am I going to see a major change. That business alone is changing slightly, but others will be smaller than that. -- Thanks. And then just one quick clarification, if I can. On the backlog adjustment, you mentioned how some of that came from the change in the Adventist contract. It's, obviously, meaningfully higher in terms of -- versus where the adjustments have been over the last few quarters. Is that -- should we think about that as the only adjustment that drives it meaningfully higher in terms of the backlog adjustment versus where it's been the last few quarters or are there other kind of one-time items in there that drove some of the changes to the backlog? -- That'd be the major driver. -- Okay, awesome. Thanks. -- Yeah.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe two quick ones. Marc, the bookings commentary for Q4, I think you said, hey, we're not going to have as many long-term oriented deals, de-emphasizing some of that stuff, but you also called out Adventist and like extensions of that RevWorks' contract. I guess my questions around that are, is that something that happened every year or are you really just calling that out because there was a big impact in Q4 of last year? And then is there any way to think about the size of that if it was every year? -- Sure. This is Marc. The rhythm with them was we renewed and one added one more year to the deal every year. And that one more deal would have been, given the revenue number we've talked about, would have been a little bit higher than the revenue number based on other elements of it. So if you're thinking $200 million of bookings that would have been on our radar when we started the year that are not going to be in Q4 this year and would have been in Q4 last year as a direct apples-to-apples comparison. That's the key difference there. And it's just because it was every Q4 that that number hit the bookings. -- Okay. And then maybe just one more quick one on pro services. I think you called out just implementation activity as a driver of the strength there during the quarter. Should we think about that as primarily centered around the government? I think John called out four DoD sites going live in September and is it DoD at this point that we should be more focused on as the driver, if it is government, or is there already some VA starting to kick in at a healthy level? -- Yeah, I'll answer it in general terms that obviously the DoD and the VA drive services through our model. But we also saw a very strong services in our optimization components. We have the get current, stay current component going on as we push our clients and with our clients to make sure they're not only on the most current releases but are aligned with our model solutions that we know that if you get aligned, you have a much better experience. All of those are components and drivers of our services business and they're services that drive value to our clients. So while the federal government, obviously, consumes services, it's not the only thing where we're seeing growth and upside. -- And clearly the federal is helpful. The VA of waves are going to start kicking off in the spring. And there is work that's done prior to those getting kicked off. We've had a lot of interaction with the VA on our campus recently, and I think that's getting all the training and things done. So those would be [Indecipherable]. As John said, the broad support and professional services business was heartening because it does show that the overall business is growing and that the government is contributing additional growth for that.Hey, given the time, why don't we go ahead and stop the questions at this point? I thank everybody for their time. I know you've got other things to get onto. So we look forward to talking to you soon.

Unfortunately, the U.S. healthcare system is not designed to provide these patients with the continual care that they need. This forces many of them to manage their condition on their own with limited guidance.  says it's on a mission \"to empower people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives.\" The company created a platform that uses\u00a0data science and technology to provide\u00a0personalized coaching to patients in real-time. Livongo calls these interactions \"health nudges,\" and it has the data to prove that they lead patients to make smarter health choices that drive behavior changes, improve clinical outcomes, and lower healthcare costs.Image source: Livongo Health.The company's revenues are growing at a , and it's starting to attract the attention of . I was recently afforded the opportunity to interview Livongo's CEO Zane Burke to learn more about the company and the opportunity ahead. Below is a transcript from our conversation (which has been lightly edited for clarity).I think I have a pretty good understanding of the company's founding. Your founder is named Glen Tullman and his son was diagnosed with diabetes years ago. Tullman was a very successful businessman who created Livongo to make it easier for people with chronic conditions to live a healthier life. Is that the gist?\u00a0The whole idea is, how do you help people live their healthiest life? How do we keep people out of the system? How do we create a platform that provides a great experience and helps our members stay healthy? And how do we create a great return on investment for our clients overall?\u00a0Can you talk a little bit about your business model, your go-to market strategy. Are you guys focused on employers, payers, or do you go direct to consumers?CEO Zane Burke. Image source: Livongo Health.Our go-to market strategy is focused on Fortune 500 companies, large organizations that are self-funded and take on all of the risks without any regard to quality, what the experience is going to be like, or return on investment. That's really where we started. We have a number of very large clients already, over 20% of the Fortune 500 today. That has allowed us to move into the health plan market. Four of the seven largest health plans are resellers of our solutions. The two largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) in the country are resellers of our solutions. And then we also sell to labor unions, governments, and health systems. That's the lineage of how we started. Today, we're exclusively in the U.S. Is your sales force focused on the employers, the payers, or the PBMs? And once they sign, how do you go get members on board?\u00a0 We sell to the client first, so whoever has the risk, and then we come back and enroll the members. Our clients only pay for members who we enroll and [who] stay engaged. So we are absolutely aligned with whoever has that financial risk, whether it's the employers or the health plan. We benefit when we get people enrolled and keep them engaged. And we do that by using data science at the core to enroll people in a personalized manner so we can learn about who they are and we can tailor our messages to them. We're pretty unique in our core solution of diabetes, where we get 34% enrollment across our book of business today. And that number continues to grow over time. And we only get paid on a per-participant/per-month model as we keep them engaged. It sounds like there is no financial risk for clients to sign up since they only pay if their members enroll. And then you have the data to prove that your model leads to better health and cost savings -- is that right?That's right. We're seeing in excess of 3x return on investment in our core diabetes solution in year one. And we've been able to validate that in multiple medical journals and third-party groups. You can really tell that the model is working because we're getting into the self-insured business. So, we've sold to big, self-insured employers. Now, the health plans are seeing the great clinical outcomes and the financial ROI, and they're putting it into their core product. That's really a huge win for us because my cost of sales goes down and my sales team could not effectively market to those members, but the health plans can.Can you just walk me through the consumer experience? When a new member says \"yes,\" do they just download an app? Do you guys send them a free blood glucose meter? Are there any fees?\u00a0We are very consumer-focused, starting with enrollment. We personalize the enrollment experience to encourage people to sign up and then once they sign up we send them a two-way cellular glucometer [and] strips for them to take their glucose readings. When they open the box, it's pre-configured; when they put the strip in, the machine automatically turns on, it already knows who they are, and they can immediately begin to utilize the solution. The consumer has no costs on their side from a device perspective or from a strip perspective, nor do they have those on an ongoing basis. Oftentimes, one of the big elements is that persons with diabetes have to pay for the strips that are necessary to manage their condition. We send the strips for free because we know when they're using the strips electronically through the two-way cellular connection. They can reorder directly off of the device. It creates a great consumer experience.There's a lot of thought that's gone into the design of all the pieces. We know that people will stick their finger and then wipe their blood on the neoprene. That may not be sound important, but it is super-important as it relates to a person with diabetes. Then we can help them make sure they have those strips with no co-pays. And in those moments when a member is outside the bounds, either too high or too low, we coach them every single time electronically. So every time they interact with us, we're using our data science to say \"try this\" to help nudge them electronically. At those moments when they need somebody on the other end, we have certified diabetes coaches monitoring what's going on.And for the first time in healthcare, there's somebody that's there when the consumer wants them to be there. That's what is so cool about our model. When that member has decided to prick their finger, or step on a weight scale, or put the blood pressure cuff on, at the moment of that health signal when the member is actually taking their health into their own hands, there's a real live human on the other end. They're electronically coached every time. And that's just totally different than the rest of healthcare, and that's what makes us really unique from a consumer-experience [standpoint]. I like to say, we meet the member in their life flow. The members also choose if it's a call or a text from a health coach. They get to choose and opt into that. It also depends on whatever their reading is, whether it's in the high range or low range. So with all the members, it's all in their hands. If they choose, they can use our app, cause sometimes people prefer that. But there is communication directly on the meter itself? The \"health nudge\" comes up on their glucometer screen? : Yes, it's a two-way cellular [connection]. So they're getting the nudge in that moment when they're waiting for the reading to go to the cloud and get trended data. We've found that people are the most susceptible to coaching when they want to be coached. We use those two or three seconds while they are waiting for the reading to give them a little piece of advice, a little bit of knowledge. I worked for  for 10 years as a field rep, so I know all about certified diabetes educators (CDEs) and I have a huge respect for them. I've also dealt with plenty of patients who have had co-pay problems with strips,\u00a0so this model is intriguing. So you're saying that if I had diabetes and had a copay on my strips, if I become a Livongo member then my copay disappears because it's built into the per-member/per-month cost?\u00a0Yes. It disappears. So that's an easy sell. It's a huge satisfier right out of the gate for members. And then we automatically ship the strips to the member because we know how many they've used because we're connected to the cloud. And those are free to them. It creates a better experience overall. \u00a0That makes total sense. Do you have tie-in with doctors and healthcare providers to allow them to access that data?  We do. We have relationships with the big electronic medical record providers if that's what the member wants to happen. They control it for themselves. The member can send it to their endocrinologist, or they could send a fax, or use the app.  Got it. Making that process as simple as possible for providers is a big deal. What's fascinating is that we have a handful of clients where the experience and the outcomes are so good that they're paying for the insulin if the member uses Livongo. Wow.  Because again, the clinical outcomes are so strong and the return is so good and people just love it. So we were actually seeing a number of clients who are going that route, and we're seeing the same thing on hypertension. Hypertension is really about medicine compliance. We have companies that say if the members are doing the test, if they'll take their blood pressure reading three times a month, then the company will cover the co-pay on their hypertension medications.  And there's no cheating!That's right. There's no cheating. We know how they're doing. It's been really fun to just think about how this problem in a different way. Our return on investment comes from fewer emergency room visits and fewer outpatient visits. Over time, it turns into the really big ROI from fewer surgeries and fewer complications. But there's also an immediate return on investment.  Can you explain your relationship with the Food and Drug Administration?\u00a0We do have a relationship with the FDA. The devices are all certified and HIPAA compliant. We do have a responsibility from an FDA perspective to abide by their rules and regulations, and we do that. \u00a0But as long as your CDEs are practicing within the guideline, that's alright? They're providing advice within their licensure. What I'm not doing is changing the medication or medication orders. We do hot referrals to providers in those instances. We have relationships with the two largest PBMs in the country -- one of those is . If a member comes into a CVS pharmacy, we're so integrated at CVS that if that person is eligible, but hasn't yet received a kit, they can automatically receive a kit. We can also do a hot transfer to the\u00a0pharmacist as part of our solution set. And that's kind of what we're doing with telehealth too. We made an announcement around behavioral health where we are actually integrating with partners at the behavioral health level. So from our electronic coaching piece, we're able to hand off those patients to a telehealth visit with a doctor.\u00a0For outside investors, what are the metrics that we should pay attention to the most? We're a subscription model, so growth in our members is a really important metric. We just announced our revenues were up 148% year over year, and we're over 207,000 members, which was up 118% year over year. And our number of clients is up 121%. I'm really pleased with the short-term results. But more important is the long-term progress we're making. It's really about becoming a true platform for chronic condition management. That's the long-term piece for investors to watch. Our strategic march into other marketplaces such as government, and other conditions like hypertension and weight management. Those are just a handful of things that I think are really important future growth drivers for us. \u00a0Your net loss was just $0.05 per share, or about $3 million, so peanuts in the grand scheme of things. \u00a0Peanuts. Yup. We've been on a march to profitability. We've made a huge leap if you go from last year to this year. Our EBITDA margins were negative 40% last year and our guidance would take you to kind of the negative high teens this year. Even if you just even rounded to 20%, you're talking about a 20 [percentage] point increase in our march to profitability. I feel really good about that.  I'm a fan of fast revenue growth and high margins, and you guys have both. Me too! That's what I love about healthcare.\u00a0You can really root for companies, because if they're successful, they're usually doing something great. Can you talk briefly about the international opportunity? It doesn't exist right now, but is it on the horizon? \u00a0Chronic conditions are not just a U.S.-specific challenge. We do not have any announced or definitive plans on going outside the U.S., but we'll continue to evaluate the timing for that. We're certainly not opportunity constrained. If you look at the rest of the executive team, it's a really deep team, kind of beyond the size of our company at this point. And that's on purpose since it will allow us to be more aggressive as we tackle additional conditions and additional geographies. That's something we're actively thinking about. Nothing to formally announce at this point in time. We are big believers in looking at corporate cultures since we believe that great places to work attract great employees. What makes you guys special? I'll tell you what makes us special: It's the mission. It's about our members. Almost every corporate interaction that we have is with one of our members. It reminds us why we're doing what we do. We're also reflective of the rest of the U.S. population, where one out of two adults has a chronic condition. Our associate base is very much a mirror of our membership. Two-thirds of our associate base will identify that they either personally have a chronic condition or that they have a loved one who has one of those conditions. It is really about that mission and vision.On the recruiting side, people will talk about how hard it is to recruit in Silicon Valley and other places, and yet we have not used any external hiring agencies. None. So we've grown over 50% on headcount, and we use zero outside agencies. And the reason for that is because the mission and the culture are so strong, and its a very accountable and self-policing culture. So people don't hire other people who are not going to be dedicated to the mission. It's incredibly diverse and inclusive. And I'll just say that I've never been associated with or known a company that's been like this. I'd love to say this was all made by me, but it's not. The culture was here before I got here. I certainly applaud it and love it. It just allows people to be who they are and bring their best self to work every day. It creates a really fun and energetic environment.\u00a0Well, you guys get good ratings on Glassdoor.com, so it seems to be working. It's funny, I read negative reviews on Glassdoor because there's a kernel of truth in all those. I actually do read the comment box.I personally never invest in a company without checking out Glassdoor.com. I realize that it's not a perfect metric by any means and that it's a biased sample size, but it's usually directionally accurate.  I agree. You've got to look at the good and the bad. Just like when you're checking out something on . You throw away the good, you throw away the bad, you kind of take the average. \u00a0Is continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) a threat to you guys? I know that  and  are just crushing it right now. We love CGM because we love the data. What we do differently is we aggregate that data and use it to coach. And in fact, we have a relationship with Abbott, which makes the Freestyle Libre, and then informally, we take that data. We're big believers in the value of that data. Our president is a person with type 1 diabetes. She actually wears both devices. So she's a self-described nerdy doc who loves data. She would tell you that it's the coaching, it's the data science, and the fact that sometimes the darn thing falls off, or she just has an issue if she wants to wear a dress that night and she doesn't want something sticking out. She'll take a night off. She can use her glucometer instead. And when she's not using her Libre, she's using the Livongo app and still getting the coaching. So we love CGM. We think it's great. It's probably going to continue to be used by just a portion of people with diabetes who are able to utilize that technology. So even though they're doing really well and we want them to do better, the vast majority of people with diabetes will never be CGM users. 87% of people with diabetes are type 2 and 13% type 1. Can you comment on your customer concentration? Two of your partners accounted for 51% of revenue in Q2 2019.I talked about how we've co-opted the rest of the health ecosystem to become a force multiplier for Livongo. These partners and health plans that are resellers of our solutions have helped us grow in the marketplace significantly. We create relationships with each one of those clients, but it's not as if we're subject to being exclusive through any one channel. And what's really important is that even with that 51% with those two very large partners, there are multiple ways we could go to market if we had to, because we have relationships with almost all of the employee benefit planning consultants and many of the health plans as well.So there are multiple ways we can go to market if we had to, and we have a very good direct sales force. The two biggest partners we have are with the pharmacy benefit managers like CVS Health, where we are expanding our relationship. So if I look at it as the breadth of what we're doing, we're more and more of a strategic partner for them all the time. If you listen to their conference calls, they talked a lot about chronic condition management, and we're at the core of what they're doing in that space today. So I feel really good about the strategic value of that. But we do think about the case of having multiple entry points to a client such that we're not beholden to any one partner.Do you guys have any direct competition? Is there anybody that's doing what you're doing?  Well, the biggest competitor we have today is inertia. When you think about it from a competitive standpoint, it's not as if hypertension or diabetes management or behavioral health are new challenges. But the problem is that disease management programs just haven't been effective enough. What we do is really bridge a gap between the healthcare system and the me-as-a-person programs. Today I have not seen anybody that has taken a whole-person approach to the problem. What we do have are a number of niche players in each market space, but on a platform basis, we don't have a direct competitor.\u00a0One of the things that attracted me to you guys is that your ROI for new clients is very strong. You're also unique in the space with the idea of the real-time intervention. I know that diabetes is the main focus, but can you talk a little bit about hypertension, behavioral health, and...what's the third one? Weight management and prediabetes. If you think about it, diabetes is at the core, because if you have type 2 diabetes, you're 70% likely to have hypertension. You're also highly likely to have weight management challenges. If you have more than one of those conditions, the percentage odds that you actually have behavioral health [issues], anxiety, or depression goes up dramatically. Strategically, we're continuing to build our condition set for the whole person, but really starting with that diabetes at the core. You can almost pick the next couple of things that we'll go do because there are places where persons with diabetes have higher preponderance rates to those chronic conditions.The cool part is that it's architected to be at the person level, so we don't think about it as disease states. We were very purposeful about that in our language. If you hear me say the term \"diabetic,\" it is a slip of my tongue. Because it's a person with diabetes, a person with hypertension, a person who has weight management challenges, or behavioral health challenges. We don't want to identify people as their disease. That is dehumanizing. And so we really do fundamentally believe in that whole-person strategy. So we're continuing to build out.We've had great success. We built hypertension from the ground up because there wasn't anything else that made sense. We built that into our platform stack. We do Amazon Alexa integration. So we're using the whole ecosystem to engage patients. We said in our recent investor call that 20% of our bookings in the third quarter of 2019 came from solutions outside of diabetes management. That was 500% growth year over year. So we've really built up a lot of trust from our existing clients because we've delivered great results. We're going to continue to build out those on a single platform that we call \"AI AI\" -- we call it our artificial intelligence engine. And that helps clients who want to buy. The marketplace doesn't want to have all these contracts that manage sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression. I mean, behavioral health alone is in the teens and twenties of conditions, let alone diabetes management and hypertension and weight management. So our clients want one place to go. We want to offer that and our members want a single experience. And that's really the strategy and logic that we're using as we move forward. But we're seeing really good success, especially for the age of those solutions.\u00a0I saw that your average prediabetes and weight management user sheds 7% of their body weight in the first year. That's impressive. It's pretty cool. I'm having so much fun. I was previously the president at , the big EMR (electronic medical record) company, and I had gotten to know Livongo early in the company's history. In 2014, I brought Livongo into Cerner so we could resell it to our clients and use it for our own associate population, mostly because I could just see this was the right mousetrap if you will. It's where I always thought the healthcare system would go, but it never did. I couldn't be having any more fun in terms of thinking about how to make this a very large-scale business with a huge addressable market. So we're talking billions upon billions of dollars market for our solution set.\u00a0Makes complete sense. This has been incredibly informative. You have a very interesting business here.

Shares of the healthcare technology company are handily beating the broader market indexes. Cerner has met or beat Wall Street earnings expectations in recent quarters as well.The company announced its third-quarter results after the market closed on Thursday. And Cerner kept its streak going, meeting or beating analysts' estimates once again. Here are the highlights from Cerner's Q3 update.Image source: Getty Images.Cerner reported Q3 revenue of $1.43 billion, up 7% from the prior-year period. This figure matched the consensus revenue estimate for Wall Street analysts.The company announced net income of $81.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, based on generally accepted accounting principles (). This reflected a steep decline from 2018 Q3 GAAP net earnings of $169.4 million, or $0.51 per diluted share.Cerner's adjusted non-GAAP earnings for the third quarter came in at $211.7 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. In the prior-year period, the company reported adjusted earnings of $209.4 million, or $0.63 per diluted share. The average analysts' estimate for Cerner's 2019 Q3 earnings was $0.63 per share. Cerner, however, stated that its adjusted earnings per share were \"in line with the company's expectations.\"The company also reported that its third-quarter bookings totaled $1.65 billion, at the upper end of its expectations. Cerner's backlog at the end of Q3 stood at $13.3 billion.Cerner Chairman and CEO Brent Shafer said that he was \"pleased with our execution in the third quarter as we again delivered against the expectations we set while also continuing to advance Cerner's broader transformation.\" How did the company manage to deliver a solid performance yet again? By increasing revenue across the board.Nearly every area of business for Cerner enjoyed higher revenue in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior-year period. The lone exception was support and maintenance revenue, but it only slipped a little from $277.8 million in 2018 Q3 to $277.3 million in the recent quarter.Most importantly, Cerner's professional services revenue jumped 11% year over year to $507.5 million. Professional services is the company's biggest moneymaker.But what about that big GAAP earnings decline? It stemmed primarily from a significant organizational restructuring expense of $117.4 million.Cerner anticipates Q4 revenue of $1.41 billion to $1.46 billion. The high end of that range, though, is a little less than the consensus Wall Street Q4 revenue estimate of $1.47 billion. Cerner also expects adjusted diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of between $0.73 and $0.75, in line with analysts' estimates.Shafer said, \"I believe the balanced focus of near-term operational improvements combined with our innovation and growth strategies position Cerner to deliver sustainable and profitable growth.\" He's probably right with that assessment. Although Cerner might not be able to provide investors with the sizzling growth that some  can, solid double-digit total returns in the future seem attainable.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

They've gained 400% over the last five-year stretch, and owning them has been one of the best ways to play the pharmaceuticals and biotech industry. \u00a0Even after an epic run, Veeva continues to put up solid double-digit sales growth and even faster profitability expansion, and the cloud-based software firm also reached a revenue milestone well ahead of schedule. On the heels of a recent software stock pullback and with digital transformation taking center stage, now looks like a good time to buy in or add to positions. There will be plenty of ways for Veeva Systems to grow even more in the next five years.Veeva provides various  like data management, regulatory compliance tools, and customer relationship management for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Biotech is fraught with unique challenges that make the , and Veeva has been a comparatively stable way to invest in the space.Sales are growing fast, and as they do, gross profit margin on services sold is improving as well -- indicating Veeva has yet to reach optimal scale. Revenue has even accelerated slightly so far during the 2020 fiscal year, up 26% compared with 25% during the 2019 fiscal year. Operating expenses are of course also growing, but at a slower pace. \u00a0Data source: Veeva Systems. YOY = year over year. Pp = percentage points. \u00a0It all adds up to a technology platform that is maturing, and as it does so, sales are getting converted into big bottom-line gains. In terms of free cash flow (basic profits, measured by subtracting cash operating expenses and capital expenditures from revenue), the above chart equates to huge gains for the shareholders.Data by .Granted, the increased cash flow means Veeva trades at premium pricing -- trailing 12-month price to free cash flow is at 58.1 as of this writing -- as the market is anticipating this well-above-average pace of growth will continue for the foreseeable future. Is that an unrealistic expectation? Global spending on digital transformation is expected to grow well into the double digits for the foreseeable future, and pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device companies aren't exempt from the transition. During the summer of 2019, Veeva reported that its product suite Vault -- a comprehensive collection of apps and data management tools -- surpassed 50% of total revenue. This milestone was a \u00a0according to management, and has years of growth ahead of it as life science businesses continue to look for ways to update their business models for the 21st century. CEO Peter Gassner had this to say about his company's marquee product:\u00a0Vault now has nearly 650 customers and as of Q2 represents more than 50% of total revenue. This is an exciting milestone. When we started Vault a number of years ago, the potential was clear to me. And as I look ahead it's also clear that we are in the early days of Vault. This quarter, a newly independent top-20 medical device company standardized on Vault across the organization, including clinical, quality, regulatory, and commercial. With the ability to start from a clean slate they chose Vault because it's the only solution to provide best-in-class application suites on a single modern cloud platform. Within the range of available Vault customizable suites, Gassner added that Vault CTMS -- geared toward companies managing clinical trials and process management for new treatment development -- is gearing up to be an industry-leading software solution as regulatory demands increase for biotechs over time. Other highlights include Veeva's customer relationship management (CRM), which has also been getting put to use by global pharmaceutical distributors. In this department specifically, Veeva battles with  and its own selection of digital tools for life sciences. But Veeva's laser focus on the life sciences industry and solutions that round out CRM has helped it win expanded relationships with customers in spite of competition from the likes of Salesforce,  , and others. It has built out arguably the most comprehensive suite of software tools to help life science companies bridge the gap between old legacy operations and the digitally driven operations of the future. In five years' time, it's safe to say Veeva will have quite a few more customers than it does today, and its high profit margins mean new sales should continue to convert to an even higher bottom-line increase over time. Owning Veeva remains one of the best ways to bet on the world of healthcare and biotechnology, in spite of the high price tag.

Cerner has ambitions to significantly grow its businesses besides electronic records and believes that its strong position in health records gives it an easier time cross-selling additional services that providers need. Factoring in these different businesses, the company has guided investors to expect-long term revenue growth of 6% to 9%.While many investors choose to focus on the revenue growth story, Cerner's bottom-line story is equally exciting. The company's  peaked in 2013 at around 23% and has since declined into the mid-to-low teens as the company has invested in various businesses to spark growth. However, Cerner has signaled that its margins have bottomed and that it expects to bring operating margin back above 20% in the coming years. data by One reason Cerner is more focused on becoming more profitable is that activist investor Starboard Value has taken a stake in the company and reached an agreement to take on four board seats. Upon signing the agreement with Starboard, Cerner announced that it would retain turnaround consultant AlixPartners to help identify cost savings. The company also announced it would begin paying a dividend and buyback $1.5 billion of stock.Given how far margins have declined, there are most likely ample opportunities to bring margins back up. Cerner has guided investors to expect operating margins to reach 22.5% by the end of 2020. If the company can execute, that would imply significant earnings growth.Cerner can be thought of as a tech platform focused on healthcare. In regards to valuation, Cerner's  is in the mid-20s, which is similar to where large tech platforms in other industries trade. However, industry peer \u00a0trades for just 15 times price to earnings, a significant discount to Cerner. Perhaps Allscripts is undervalued, although , so the discount to other tech companies may be justified. data by Given that Cerner is a strong player within the healthcare IT industry and has attractive top-line and bottom-line characteristics, a valuation in line with that of other major tech companies is reasonable.Cerner is an interesting long-term play on technology becoming a growing partner to the . Diving in a bit deeper on Cerner's underlying businesses and its expectations for long-term revenue growth and margin expansion further paint a position picture. The company's valuation isn't particularly cheap, but it also isn't unreasonable. Putting the pieces together support Cerner as a buy for patient healthcare investors.Looking ahead, investors should continue monitoring the company's execution against its desire to grow in new business areas outside of electronic health records and its ability to show margin expansion. If the company makes good on its goals and promises, expect to see the stock price move higher.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

An employee sizes you up and asks you if there\u2019s anything in particular you\u2019re looking for. After learning that you\u2019re a size \u201clarge\u201d and that you\u2019d like some new dress shirts, the employee takes you to a table covered with them. All of the shirts are the same size. All XL, extra-large.\u201cStrange,\u201d you think, and go to another table covered with shirts. All the shirts are the same size. All XL.\u201cStranger,\u201d you think, and go to another table covered with shirts. Once again, all the shirts are the same size. All XL.Sensing your confusion, the employee explains the store\u2019s \u201cone size fits all\u201d policy. The owners know people come in many shapes and sizes, but XL is the only size of clothes they can get from their suppliers.You walk out of the \u201cone size fits all\u201d store, thinking it\u2019s one of the most ridiculous things you\u2019ve ever seen.Lacking the resources to treat us as individuals \u2014 with different genetic makeups, different diets, and living in different environments \u2014 doctors frequently resort to treating patients with \u201cone size fits all\u201d procedures and medicines. And since most doctors rush patients in and out of the office to boost profits, the pressure to use sub-par, \u201cone size fits all\u201d treatments is massive.Don\u2019t get me wrong: Our approach to health and medicine is light years ahead of where it was in the 1800s. Bloodletting is no longer a \u201cgo to\u201d move for doctors.However, many of the decisions made by today\u2019s healthcare professionals will look medieval when compared to the treatments of the near future. They simply don\u2019t take into account that every case is different \u2014 that we are all unique. Take the drug commercials you see on television \u2026 which go on to list lots of horrible side effects of popular drugs (which don\u2019t work for everyone who takes them).Soon, we\u2019ll say goodbye to those types of treatments. That\u2019s because the age of customized, \u201cprecision\u201d healthcare is getting started. The result will be a massively improved healthcare system \u2026 and some of the .In today\u2019s essay, I\u2019ll describe the three key innovations that will take us into the age of precision medicine.\u00a0. In America, we spend $3.5 trillion \u2014 about 18% of GDP \u2014 on healthcare. When something big happens in healthcare, it creates giant ripple effects in the economy that enrich those who know what\u2019s happening.Every cell in your body has a set of genetic instructions that dictate what you look like, what your athletic abilities are, what your mental abilities are, what diseases you\u2019re likely to get, and dozens of other key things that make you YOU.This set of instructions is called your genome. Determining exactly what your genome says is a process called genome sequencing.In 2003, an international research organization called The Human Genome Project sequenced a human genome for the first time. The project\u2019s price tag was an enormous $3 billion.Thanks to incredible advances in computing power, that same sequencing can be performed today for less than $1,000. And in a few years the price will be as low as a dinner for two.Genome sequencing is a critical part of precision medicine because it allows medical professionals to get an incredibly detailed analysis of who you are. As a result of this information, doctors can recommend treatments that are right for you.Sixteen years ago, getting this kind of detailed information was prohibitively expensive. But now that costs are down more than 99% and poised to go down even more, genome sequencing is about to go mainstream.Genetic testing will become part of regular medical care \u2026 just like taking your pulse and your blood pressure. It\u2019s going to usher in an era of much more effective healthcare. In large part to innovation #2 \u2026It\u2019s one thing to have lots of information. It\u2019s an entirely different \u2014 and more valuable \u2014 thing to be able to analyze that information and use it to make quality decisions.This is where digital patient records come in.Genome sequencing will produce vast amounts of information that will need to be stored and analyzed. Just as the processing power of our computers has increased by leaps and bounds since 2003, our ability to collect and store information has increased as well. This continued growth is a key part of precision medicine. That\u2019s because genome sequencing is going to generate a\u00a0\u00a0amount of information.It is predicted that the amount of storage capacity for all human genome data will increase to 40 exabytes by 2025. To put that into perspective, experts believe all videos on YouTube will require 1-2 exabytes of storage and Twitter will require .001 to .017 exabytes.As for analyzing all that data, we come to Innovation #3 \u2026As you can guess, we\u2019re not going to sift through some of the world\u2019s largest data sets with a pen and paper in hand.We\u2019re going to use artificial intelligence (AI) to perform advanced data analysis. AI programs will sift through data to identify treatments that work for patients with specific genetic conditions.These programs will be able to do more \u201cthinking\u201d in one minute than millions of doctors could do in a decade. It\u2019s going to revolutionize healthcare.In fact, I believe that within the next 30 years, AI will know how various combinations of molecules will affect patients on the individual level. We\u2019ll have giant databases of patients and their genetic makeups \u2026 and we\u2019ll be able to test new drugs with computer simulations. The time it takes to devise, test, and produce new life-saving drugs will be massively condensed. Plus, the cost of doing it all will plummet.We\u2019ll have vast databases of human genomes and the ability to create and test new customized treatments in seconds. It could easily become the most valuable technology on the planet. Again, this is many years away, but I believe it\u2019s going to happen.One size fits allThanks to the technological limitations of the past, our healthcare system is based on treatments that are not tailored to your genetic makeup. We\u2019re using \u201cshotgun\u201d approaches instead of targeted approaches.However, thanks to cheap and widespread genome sequencing, digital record keeping, and artificial intelligence, we\u2019re about to enter an amazing era of precision, personalized medicine.Over the next 20 years, the healthcare system we know and don\u2019t love will change dramatically. We\u2019ll look back at some of today\u2019s treatments as medieval.Remember: In America, we spend $3.5 trillion \u2014 about 18% of GDP \u2014 on healthcare. When something big happens in the industry, it creates giant ripple effects. That\u2019s why the precision medicine revolution is .The opportunities are not in the old school big pharma names like Johnson & Johnson. They are in precision medicine and the technologies that will enable it.Everything from digital records company Cerner (NASDAQ:) to gene testing pioneer Illumina (NASDAQ:) to contract research services firm IQVIA Holdings (NYSE:) will take the lead in the future of precision medicine.And keep an eye on the IPO market here as well.

Administrative expenses account for as much as 25% of total U.S. hospital spending, which is more than anywhere else in the world. Technology can help make healthcare more efficient by streamlining records and helping administrators better manage their systems.Enter  , one of the leading healthcare IT companies. Hospitals aren't exactly early adopters when it comes to technology, but Cerner already has a large install base and is helping its clients further adopt software that can help hospitals upgrade their capabilities. Because Cerner is tackling such a large and important problem, it has strong growth prospects for the coming years.Image Source: Getty Images.Cerner is a behemoth in the  IT space. Founded in 1980, the company was a pioneer in the electronic health records industry. Today, Cerner is still a leading electronic health records player, but it has expanded into adjacent software offerings, including revenue cycle management, IT consulting, and data analytics.The company's core business is its electronic health records product, which accounts for roughly 75% of revenue. Electronic health records software is a foundational piece of hospital IT infrastructure and is considered mission critical because it houses much of the patient data. The records system connects to other applications within a hospital's system and touches everything from billing to prescription management.Because Cerner has a strong position in the market for electronic health records software, it has a strong ability to cross-sell other related software. The company's second-largest product is its revenue cycle management software, which accounts for roughly 13% of sales. Revenue cycle software manages billing, insurance claims, and collections. As one could imagine, managing revenue is extremely complicated in the healthcare industry because of various billing schemes and different types of health insurance coverage.Cerner has a couple of smaller businesses that it hopes to grow over time. The company has a healthcare IT consulting operation that helps manage IT systems for hospitals and provides business process outsourcing services. Healthcare IT consulting accounts for roughly 7% of the company's revenue. Finally, Cerner has a nascent business called population health management, which is a data analytics software program. The population health software aims to provide predictive analytics that can help inform areas of need for health systems or health insurance plans.Putting the pieces together, Cerner's business is anchored by its electronic health records platform, but it has a few offshoots that provide more specialized applications.Cerner's growth strategy has been to get a healthcare provider onto its electronic health records platform and then cross-sell additional services. Cerner is tied for the No. 1 market share position in electronic health records with its archrival Epic Systems. The two companies together account for about half of the market for electronic health records, with several smaller players holding smaller pieces of the pie. Cerner has an opportunity to take share from its competitors and is somewhat competitively advantaged to do so because it has a strong brand name and a strong platform with additional capabilities beyond health records management.Cerner is expanding into other aspects of healthcare IT because the electronic records business is fairly mature; the market is only expected to grow about 6% per year over the next 5 to 10 years. The table below, from a recent investor presentation, highlights where the company sees growth in the healthcare IT industry.Image Source: Cerner investor presentation.Cerner isn't particularly strong in revenue cycle management, which is why it acquired Siemens' revenue cycle software business in 2014 for $1.3 billion. Cerner's population health management business could see strong growth, since the industry for that product is expected to grow by 18% per year. Population health management is tangential to healthcare analytics and AI predictive analytics, which is also expected to grow at a rapid rate. Cerner doesn't have a solution for the telehealth market at this time.The company has guided investors to expect annual revenue growth in the range of 6% to 9% over the next five years. This is a solid pace for top-line growth for a large-cap company.Cerner is an innovative technology company tackling the massive problem of inefficiency in the healthcare system. The company's software products are mission critical for healthcare providers and the company stands to benefit from healthcare spending growing faster than the overall economy.Although the electronic health records business is maturing, Cerner has a few promising avenues of growth from tangential healthcare IT businesses.

Here are the highlights from Cerner's latest quarterly update.Image source: Getty Images.Data source: Cerner.\u00a0Cerner expected\u00a0second-quarter revenue between $1.41 billion and $1.46 billion. Once again, the company's actual result was squarely within its guidance range.\u00a0Professional services continued to be Cerner's biggest moneymaker, with revenue in the second quarter of $485.3 million. That figure reflected a year-over-year increase of 8.5%. Managed services also remained key to the company's financial performance, with revenue rising 4.2% to $297.7 million.Cerner posted growth in other areas as well. Licensed software revenue jumped 14.3% year over year to $197.1 million. Subscription revenue rose 8.2% to $89.8 million.However, the company also saw revenue fall on a few fronts. Support and maintenance revenue slipped less than 1% from the prior-year period total to $276.4 million. Technology resale revenue dropped 19.3% to $60.7 million. And reimbursed travel revenue declined by 4.9% year over year to $24.1 million.Cerner's net income on a generally accepted accounting principles () basis plunged despite its revenue gains due to significantly higher operating expenses. The company announced big spending increases in the second quarter in sales and client service, software development, and general and administrative functions.\u00a0Its adjusted non-GAAP adjusted EPS comparisons didn't look bad, though, for several reasons. The non-GAAP EPS figure was adjusted to add amounts that Cerner spent on organizational restructuring, a charge related to a client dispute, and a settlement with a vendor. In addition, Cerner's share buybacks reduced its number of outstanding shares, boosting its adjusted EPS. These factors enabled the company to beat its previous adjusted EPS guidance for the second quarter of $0.63 to $0.65.Cerner chairman and CEO Brent Shafer said, \"I am pleased with our financial results, which were in line with our expectations.\"He added:In addition to delivering solid quarterly operating results, we made good progress on the early stages of our transformation and positioning Cerner for long-term profitable growth. Cerner has played a key role in digitizing healthcare, and we believe our next era of growth will be driven by the tremendous opportunity related to helping our clients drive a higher order of benefits from this digitization.Cerner projects that its third-quarter revenue will be between $1.405 billion and $1.455 billion. The company also reaffirmed its full-year 2019 revenue guidance range of $5.65 billion to $5.85 billion. Cerner expects adjusted EPS in the third quarter between $0.65 and $0.67 and full-year adjusted EPS between $2.64 and $2.72, which is consistent with its outlook provided in the previous quarter.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brent Shafer, Chairman and CEO of Cerner Corporation. -- Thank you, Daniel. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to the call. I'll spend the first few minutes providing some thoughts and commentary on the business, then ask our CFO, Marc Naughton, to take you through the financial results. When Marc concludes, Chief Client Officer, John Peterzalek, will provide some marketplace commentary. And finally, I've asked Don Trigg, our EVP of Strategic Growth, to talk about Cerner's growth strategies in adjacent markets.Today, I'd like to share some thoughts on the early stages of Cerner's transformation. Internally, we're referring to it as Cerner.Next, a term that signifies to our associates that the future is now. We've spent the past four decades inventing, building, implementing and operating EHRs for our clients around the world. Over that time, Cerner has helped digitize nearly 50% of healthcare in the United States, and in the near term secured the two largest contracts in the history of healthcare IT.The next chapter for Cerner involves helping our clients drive a higher order of benefits from the digitized platforms that have been created. Our clients are focused on rising healthcare costs, industry consolidation, payment reform pushing toward risk, the heightened impact of consumerism and the emerging role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Cerner is in the enviable position of being able to address all of these issues with evolving, knowledge-driven platforms that can impact the moment of decision for clinicians through financial and clinical analytics driven by high quality, curated data. This position is hard to replicate, and we recognize our strategies and actions must leverage this foundational market position.Going forward, we will be recalibrating the Company around our new operating model, a series of transformative actions to drive efficiencies, and strategies that we believe will drive long-term growth and profitability. Since introducing our new operating model earlier this year, we've made considerable progress in realigning the company in a more client-centric manner. Additionally, we've identified and will be implementing cost optimization and business simplification initiatives that we expect to drive greater business efficiencies. Marc will provide an update on these initiatives in his remarks, but we expect these process improvements to deliver the operating margin targets we established for Q4 '19 and Q4 '20.As we embrace the macro trends affecting healthcare and our market position, we've refined our strategic framework around three key areas that will guide our direction over the next several years. First, Cerner expects to deliver The Software-as-a-Service platform for healthcare. A modernized millennium platform utilizing SaaS approach should drive speedier adoption of advanced features and innovations for our clients and significantly greater user satisfaction. This platform can fuel an even higher level of digital disruption and enhance the ability to drive collaboration with third-parties.Second, we plan on being the premier strategic healthcare partner as Cerner pursues adjacent markets outside of the traditional hospital environment. We all recognize that healthcare is changing in profound ways. The convergence of political, economic, demographic and technological factors are leading to new venues and models of care. As pressure mounts to deliver value-based care, providers are increasingly building network strategies to enhance contracting power, improve patient retention, and manage risks more predictably. These require robust, next-generation intelligence and analytical capabilities that Cerner is well positioned to provide.Third, we expect to be the acknowledged and reliant source for curated health data. We have a rich history of aggregating, normalizing and disseminating patient data. As the acknowledged data source, we plan to develop a monetizable distribution model that provides access to legacy client segments and adjacent market prospects such as biopharma, payers, and actuaries to name a few. This big data strategy could be the key for new drug discoveries and the foundation for other use cases outside of the traditional healthcare space. We believe Cerner's approach to curated data will provide significant value to clients. Don will speak more on this topic, including sharing news of a new senior leader dedicated to this strategy.These strategies coupled with our work to streamline the business underpin our long-term growth and profitability. We believe these strategies are well aligned with the needs of our clients and will increase our ability to create value for them. I'd also like to commend our Cerner associates. We have an incredible talent pool and I believe the right culture to drive the transformation process and deliver the next chapter of Cerner's growth.As it relates to the financial results, I'm pleased with our second quarter results and now ask Marc to provide a more comprehensive commentary on the numbers. Marc? -- Thanks, Brent. Good afternoon everyone. I am going to cover our Q2 results and future guidance. This quarter we delivered solid bookings, revenue and earnings. I'll start with bookings, which were $1.432 billion in Q2 and near the high end of our guidance range. This is down from Q2 '18 bookings of $1.775 billion, primarily due to a decline in long-term bookings, which we previewed last quarter. In addition, Q2 of '18 included the initial VA task orders, making it a tough comparable. We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $14.98 billion, which is up 1% over a year ago.Recall that our backlog calculation under the new revenue standard excludes revenue from contracts with termination clauses, even though such clauses are rarely exercised. When you combine the expected revenue from our backlog and the additional revenue expected from contracts not included in backlog, our revenue visibility remains at approximately 85% over the next 12 months. Revenue in the quarter was $1.431 billion, up 5% over Q2 of '18 and in line with our expectations.I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q2 of '18. Licensed Software revenue in Q2 was $197 million, up 14% over Q2 of '18 driven by strong bookings, and good growth in both SaaS offerings and traditional software. Tech Resale of $61 million decreased 19% compared to Q2 of '18, which was the strongest quarter of last year, and up 9% sequentially over Q1. Subscriptions revenue grew 8% to $90 million. Professional Services revenue grew 8% to $485 million, primarily driven by solid growth in implementation services. Managed Services increased 4% to $298 million. Support & Maintenance was basically flat, which is in-line with our expectations.And finally, Reimbursed Travel was down 5% from Q2 of '18, and essentially flat sequentially at $24 million.Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue was up 5% from the year-ago quarter at $1.266 billion, and international revenue of $165 million was flat year-over-year. Note that, similar to last quarter, our non-US revenue growth was impacted by foreign currency rates and would have been mid single-digit on a constant currency basis.Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 81.2%, down from 81.8% in Q1 of '19 and 82.5% year-over-year driven by higher third-party services. Now I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted, or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation and permanent tax differences, acquisition-related adjustments, VSP and other organizational restructuring expenses, and other adjustments that I'll discuss in a moment and are also detailed and reconciled for GAAP in our earnings release.Looking at operating spending, our second quarter GAAP operating expenses of $1.031 billion were up 12% compared to $921 million in the year-ago period. In addition to the previously mentioned items, our GAAP expenses included a $7 million settlement with a former vendor and a $20 million charge related to a client dispute that have been excluded from our adjusted results. Note that we also had a $16 million non-operating gain related to the sale of our equity investment in the former vendor that was also excluded from our adjusted results. Our adjusted operating expenses were up 4% compared to Q2 of '18. Looking at the line items for Q2, Sales & Client Service expense increased 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to our services businesses.Software development expense increased 9% over Q2 of '18, driven by a 5% increase in gross R&D, a 7% increase in amortization, and flat capitalized software. G&A expense was down 8%, driven in part by lower personnel expense. Amortization of acquisition-related Intangibles decreased slightly year-over-year.Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 9.2% compared to 15.2% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18%, down from 18.7% in Q2 of '18, but up from 17.5% last quarter and in-line with our expectations. Our guidance for Q3 reflects flat margins compared to Q2 due to normal seasonality of revenue mix in Q3 and the fact that most of our initial cost optimization efforts won't have a meaningful impact until Q4. We believe we remain on track to deliver our targeted 20% adjusted operating margin in Q4, as our forecasted revenue mix is better, and we expect to benefit from the initial impact of our operational improvement efforts. Further, our ongoing work with AlixPartners continues to support our targeted Q4 2020 targeted adjusted operating margin of 22.5%.Now I'll provide an update on our business optimization efforts. Since our last call, we have created a detailed list of opportunities and kicked off projects to achieve our targeted cost optimization and process improvements. In total, there are 165 initiatives focused on cost optimization, portfolio and product management, and business simplification. The benefits from these initiatives are expected over three waves, with initial benefits expected in Q4 of '19, followed by a second wave of benefits by the middle of 2020, with a third wave expected to drive benefits in the second half of 2020 and beyond. We expect these initiatives to result in controlled and/or reduced expenses across all of our operating expense lines and to positively impact the profitability of all business models.The current expected phasing aligns with both our Q4 '19 and Q4 '20 adjusted operating margin targets, and our expectation is that these benefits and related margin expansion opportunities will extend beyond 2020, as longer-term benefits of the business simplification initiatives should have an impact into 2021 and beyond.Finally, I'd like to share how we are approaching this from a governance standpoint. We have created a Transformation Management Office that is led by Cerner COO, Mike Nill, our Chief of Staff, Kimberly Gerard, and two leaders from AlixPartners. The Transformation Management Office will oversee the execution of the 165 initiatives and be responsible for change management and resolving issues that arise. This includes weekly and bi-weekly reporting and tracking across all initiatives. Our Executive Committee and the Finance and Strategy Committee of our Board are updated regularly on the progress.As I indicated on our last call, this will be hard work, but I am pleased by the rigor with which the executive team is embracing the effort. We believe the enhanced efficiency, better processes and improved focus, we are delivering ongoing profitable growth while also accelerating value creation for our clients.Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $127 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, which is down from $0.51 in Q2 of '18. Adjusted net earnings in Q2 were $215 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.66, compared to $0.62 in Q2 of '18. Our GAAP tax rate was 17.6% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19%, which is 2% lower than last quarter and contributed to our EPS upside this quarter.Moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $954 million of cash and short-term investments, which is up from $904 million last quarter. Our total debt increased by $600 million from last quarter to $1.039 billion as we took on debt to repurchase 8.7 million shares in the second quarter for $600 million, at an average price of $68.91. Following the Q2 repurchases, we have $883 million of remaining authorization under the current program. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.229 billion, up from $1.159 billion in Q1 of '19. Our Q2 DSO was 78 days, which is up from 76 days in Q1 of '19 and 77 days in the year-ago period.Operating cash flow for the quarter was $207 million and was impacted by the VSP and other organizational restructuring expenses I mentioned earlier. Q2 capital expenditures were $159 million, and capitalized software was $70 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was negative $22 million for the quarter, driven by a combination of lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending, as previewed on our last quarter call. While we continue to expect cash flow to be impacted by organizational restructuring costs and elevated capital spending, we do expect improved operating and free cash flow for the rest of the year. We also expect operating cash flow growth and a decline in capital expenditures to lead to good free cash flow growth in 2020.Moving to capital allocation. As I indicated, we repurchased $600 million of stock during Q2, leaving $883 million on our current authorization. We still expect to execute the majority of the repurchase authorization by the end of Q1 of next year, subject to market conditions and other factors. We intend to continue funding this with a combination of cash from operations and debt, with the amount of debt depending on the timing of our repurchases and whether we use cash for other purposes, such as M&A. Regarding our dividend program, we officially declared our first quarterly dividend during the quarter, with a payment date of July 26. The Board approved the quarterly dividend at $0.18, which is up from our initial estimate of $0.15 that we provided when we first announced our intent to initiate a dividend. Our initiation of a dividend combined with our increased share repurchase activity reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders and our belief in Cerner's long-term potential.Now I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q3 to be between $1.405 billion and $1.455 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 7% over Q3 of '18. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue between $5.65 billion and $5.85 billion, with the $5.75 billion midpoint reflecting 7% growth over 2018. We expect Q3 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.65 to $0.67 per share. The midpoint of this range is 5% higher than Q3 of '18. For the full-year, we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $2.64 and $2.72, which reflects 9% growth at the midpoint.Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 1% increase compared to the third quarter of 2018, which had increased 43% over the prior third quarter. In summary, we are pleased with our solid results in the second quarter, and we remain focused on delivering improved operating performance and creating shareholder value as we position Cerner for long-term profitable growth.With that, I will turn the call over to John. -- Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon everyone. Today, I'm going to cover our bookings and provide a quick update on our Federal business, then turn it over to Don to discuss strategic growth. I'll start with our bookings, which were at the high-end of our guidance, with solid contributions from all key areas of our business. As we projected, we had a lower level of long-term bookings compared to last year, with the percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts in the quarter at 22% compared to 35% in Q2 of last year. As we discussed last quarter, the lower level of long-term bookings is in part driven by our decision to be more selective as we consider certain low margin, long-term contract opportunities. This does not mean we are not pursuing revenue cycle and IT services contracts just that we are being more disciplined about the role we play and how we structure the contracts. We believe this discipline will allow us to focus on high-quality business that aligns with our emphasis on profitable growth.Moving to new business mix, we had a solid quarter with 33% of bookings coming from outside our core Cerner Millennium installed base, including a contract with a large investor-owned health system to replace their existing EHR and revenue cycle systems at seven hospitals, 25 clinics, and 12 free-standing emergency departments. In the Federal space, our projects with the DoD and VA are both progressing as planned. For DoD, we are continuing our work on the first wave of sites beyond the initial operating capability sites, with go lives on track for this fall. Similarly, our work with the VA has continued as planned and we remain on track to ramp our work on the project as we go through the remainder of this year and into next year, with the initial sites still expected to go live in 2020.With that, I'll turn the call back over to Don. -- Thanks, John. Good afternoon everyone. Brent spoke at the outset about the strategic push by health systems to build out provider networks and win the zip codes in which they operate. It's a core multi-year growth strategy, solid progress was made in the second quarter to advance it. While the macro health network trend is part of the overall shift to value, we are seeing near term traction in areas such as out-of-network referrals that are revenue generating today and preparatory for risk contracting over time. We're also are seeing buying activity around foundational network capabilities ranging from enterprise security to quality and regulatory compliance.Enterprise security was a particular bright spot in the first half of the year. Bookings exceeded $50 million and our pipeline supports a strong second half that would reflect 30% growth year-over-year. From tap and go access with a persistent connected desktop to multi-factor authentication for med's management, we have a clear value proposition in an area with significant trend. Post-acute sales, which include behavioral health, home health, long-term care and rehab, was another component of the health network with solid first half performance. The team delivered 25 discrete contracts driving over 30% bookings growth, with 70% of the signed business occurring outside our Millennium client base.Post-acute sales trends position us well on several fronts including our naviHealth partnership focused on the BPCI advanced. Brent also discussed our strategic ambitions to grow our curated data services assets. Our global market share, clinical research practice and overall platform leverage provide natural points of differentiation in a segment with a significant $60 billion plus addressable market. As part of our push into data services space, Art Glasgow has joined Cerner within the Strategic Growth organization. Art not only is the former CIO of Duke University Health System, he also served as the Chief Product Officer at Optum. The early returns have been positive. We have made progress in the pharma and life sciences space leveraging our HealtheIntent DataLabs asset and our collaboration with the Duke Clinical Research Institute.There also is good traction in our HealtheHistory business, which provides record retrieval for life insurance, legal and other administrative use cases. Our health network businesses and our investment in the data space, both are part of an overall portfolio management model seeking to maximize our return on invested capital. Another area of progress related to the portfolio management review process that Brent initiated, relates to product areas where we've targeted an alternative go-to-market strategy. A near term example of this is the agreement we recently signed with GetWellNetwork. As part of the relationship, we'll migrate Cerner clients off our inpatient, patient engagement solution, myStation. We also will be adding GetWell Loop to our larger consumer framework as we push to accelerate our consumer revenue beyond the patient portal space.We're constantly striving to embody the same entrepreneurial spirit that we used to build the Company. Our team is always impatient to go faster. I believe we made reasonable progress in the second quarter on accelerating our health network businesses, laying the foundation for a meaningful data business and advancing our efforts at Company-level portfolio management.With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brent. -- Thanks, Don. As you heard from Marc, John and Don, we are making good progress on several fronts. We have established a rigor around our cost optimization and process improvement efforts that I believe will not only help us deliver our near-term targeted financial results but also position us for high-quality growth going forward. We have demonstrated good execution in our core markets, including solid bookings results from our core clients and ongoing execution on our federal business, which includes the largest healthcare IT projects in the history of our industry. And we are making good progress at creating growth from emerging market opportunities that will be important to Cerner's long-term growth. I am pleased with the team's execution during a time with significant change occurring both inside and outside of Cerner.Now I'll turn the call back over to our operator, and we'll open up for questions. Thank you.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is now open. -- Yes. Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys. Wanted to talk about your efforts in moving the data sciences -- sorry, data services area. And, maybe you can give us a sense on timelines where that we can look at in terms of milestones and guideposts for, when you think we will start to monetize this product more, I guess, significantly, and just maybe a couple more color on there? -- Yes. So this is Don. So, I think as long-term followers of the stock now, this is a space that we've always had an interest in. If you go back to some of the original design strategies around Millennium when we talk about the opportunity to structure, store and study the data and then push those insights back into the care process. So this is an area of longtime interest and focus. Secondly, I think we feel like there's a near-term opportunity for us to really build on those strategies in the life sciences and pharma space, starting with the work we did with Duke and also in the medical retrieval space, again, leveraging strategies around the identified data and consent based use cases.And then I think finally we're very excited about Art Glasgow join the organization. He brings particular competency in this space, including competency as it relates to the provider network and how we think about activation research enablement of our client base. So, I think, as I said in the script, we're cautiously optimistic about the progress we've made. And we see that a much larger potential that we're going to continue to work on that effort in the back half of the year. -- And just a follow-up. You're sitting already on the data itself. You mentioned earlier about the HealtheIntent lab, and obviously a lot of capabilities. Is this something where we should expect it really internal development or is just something where you would look externally maybe to make an acquisition to increase your capabilities in this area? Thank you. -- Well, I think it's a great question. I think a comprehensive strategy at the magnitude, we'd want to see to really enable this strategy, probably as a combination of build, buy and partner. And that's certainly part of the analysis that we continue to do in the back half of the year. But, I'd certainly won't be an exclusive build strategy and partnership has already been a pretty significant feature of the strategy and the approach. And one of things that we really like here is, we think there is a win for not only for patients is, as Brent described, but a real opportunity for us to bring together life sciences and pharma and our provider organizations in a way that allows particularly community hospitals, the opportunity to participate in research economics, in a way that hasn't historically been the case. So, there's a lot of positives here and we've got a strong leader with some early traction and trend. -- Okay. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon and thanks for all the details so far. Marc, I want to dive into the comments about some of the process efficiency enhancements that you're focused on. I think you said 155 different initiatives that you're looking at. I guess, how do you think about attacking them and lining them up and prioritizing them at a point where you're also going to make sure that you're not doing anything to start off the business and meaningfully impact the growth rate on the top line going forward as well? -- Yes, Michael, fairly one of the reasons we have 165 is we want each of these cases to be a very discreet targeted area for which we can determine what the impact on the business is going to be both positive and if there are any potential negative impacts. So that's why we have that level of targets. The majority of these things are focused around things we've talked about, including, spans and layers, portfolio management, facilities, non-personnel costs, process improvements, all of the things you normally go after in these spaces. And I think we definitely have a view relative to the business and a promise among ourselves, that we're not going to screw up what we think is a really good business, and the opportunities we have in front of us.So we're going to deliver for our clients, we're going to deliver for the VA, the DoD, all of our clients that we have commitments with, we're going to deliver for those. And relative to portfolio management, we're going to make decisions, so that we actually choose the things we're going to really work on and deliver, ideally, things that deliver value for our clients, including the data business, and we're not going to invest in the things that don't.So I think it's going to be a well reasoned, that's -- there's probably a little bit of angst as to so when am I going to start seeing the benefits flowing from this. And as we've talked about, kind of Q4 is when you start seeing the benefits, and that's because we are trying to take a reasoned approach we're executing in Q3 to get these things go to really start driving the benefits with the goal by the time we get Q4 we get the first phase benefits under way, and we're driving them into the P&L. -- I just add to that, Marc, this is Brent. I think the approach we're taking, it is very rigorous and very deep and it is really intended to be very thoughtful, so that we're not doing damage, as opposed to sort of a peanut butter spread, across a line item, across the Company, which could be -- could have the opposite effect. So it's -- it is a detailed laborious approach, but I think it's going to yield very good results for us. -- Great, thanks.Thank you. And our next question comes from Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good evening and thanks for taking my question. I guess -- and I think maybe it was in Brent's comments. And there was a comment about, moving to more of a SaaS platform. And I know you guys, you have the community works model. And then you also have a number of tools that are already web based, like HealtheIntent. Should we read into that, that maybe there's going to be a more aggressive push to migrate Millennium broadly, outside of the community works model to SaaS over the next few years? Just any color on that would be great. -- Sure. This is Marc. Yes, we didn't -- don't mean to indicate that we're converting to a SaaS business model any time in the near future. I think we see SaaS approach as a way to keep our clients current and deliver the value for what they paid for, by giving them on the most recent release. Our CommunityWorks example is probably the best example we have of that, but we host 80% of our clients. So, to a great extent, they're used to the benefits of SaaS, and that they're not having to run the technology or worry about those elements. But what they're not getting is the currency and being on a current version.So, I think you will see us kind of be more of a CommunityWorks style model of fewer releases, on a more current basis and getting our clients to that. Given our hosted model, the economics will evolve over time, there won't be as quick cut off, or a quick move. In fact, many of the benefits of SaaS, the currency elements, we can do today, even running the Millennium in our data centers as we do. So it'll be an evolution, picking the better parts of the SaaS model until we really evolve over to basically a pure SaaS model, but it's not going to be something that's going to happen in the near term from an economic standpoint. -- Okay, thank you. And then maybe one quick one, Marc, the booking number, the guidance for Q3? It's a nice step up sequentially. Should we -- and if you commented, I apologize if I missed it, but should we read into that, that maybe the long term deal flow does bounce back somewhat? I know John said, you guys weren't totally walking away from those businesses. Was there anything else like TA that we should think about as notably kind of contributing to that number? -- Yes, there isn't anything large from the government's perspective that's impacting Q3. I think it's -- John talked, we've got a very strong pipeline, we continue to see a lot of business. And I think the -- Q3 while the seasonality tends to impact you a little bit, the opportunities are there and that's why you're seeing us with the numbers we talk about. Once again, we still do our rigorous forecast, we've been -- this year, we've been pretty successful in having our results align with that forecast. So, we're basically forecasting what we see on the horizon, what we see in our ability to deliver, so that's the basis for the number.I think you're still going to see some of the little bit lower level of long term. We are being selective. We are looking at those deals and making sure they meet our margin targets. And that will result in some business that we don't do. In fact, in Q2 you could look at the number that we delivered at the top end of our guidance. There were opportunities that we had designed business that didn't meet our targets and we did not pursue that business. So that number could have been a higher long term percentage and over the top end of our guidance, but we understood that we weren't going to do some of those, and that's why we ended up in our guidance range albeit at the top end. -- Thank you. -- Sure.Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thank you. So when you talk about being a little more selective on your long term contracts, can you give us a sense of what you mean? Are you looking at it from a just a financial perspective? Are you looking at it from a strategic perspective, a client specific perspective? What are the criteria that you're applying now? -- This is, John. And we look at all those aspects that you'd mentioned. So we look at it from a client perspective to make sure that we are providing a service, that it is highly valued to the client, which in essence can drive higher margins for us. If we look at it from a capability component, and acquisition of either talent from the client and those types of things to not only margin targets, but to meet strategic targets, as it may relate to work force and those type of things. And then absolutely a lens we look at is truly the margin target. And if we can't kind of -- if we don't provide a high value to the client, a return to Cerner within the margin renders we like and it has some strategic benefits for actually Cerner and our clients, then we question whether we want to go forward on that. And for the ones that we do, when you get all three of those aligned, it works for everybody. It works for our clients, and it works for Cerner. -- So without, of course naming names, I mean, could you give us a sense of the kind of or profile of a opportunity that you would say no to now that you would have said yes to prior? -- I would say that if we look at some of our acquired workforce space, that bringing on clients workforce just add a low margin to us is something that we would only do in the context of a very strategic relationship, not as -- not as looking at it from a revenue perspective, but truly from a revenue end margin perspective. And we think of different ways to accomplish the same thing for our client without having to bring on a component that may be low margin for us, maybe one example. Our ability to leverage our varying degrees of work set, our varying locations or workforce, whether it's US, domestic or some of our capabilities we have outside of the US, those type of things will play into what we look at, create both more margin and more value for our clients. -- All right, that's helpful. Thank you very much.Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Halper with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. -- Hi. I don't know if you're willing to disclose this number, but when you're all said and done on the -- your cost efficiency process, how much do you plan on taking out in terms of total cost? What do you think is possible? Or is it just ongoing? -- Yes, Steve, this is Marc. I said we're somewhat in specific relative to the total, because obviously we're right in the process of finalizing and announcing and getting our associates' pace up to speed and understanding what the impacts are going to be. But clearly, I think if you at the numbers, you can figure that it's in excess of $200 million. And I think that's pretty clear if you just look at the economics and the -- what's necessary to get to our targets, our operating margin targets. But I think it is a matter of picking those initiatives that aren't onetime.There have to be things that have continuing benefit, because once I get that savings, that savings need to continue forever. And that's the focus we're having right now.But I think -- so we'll provide more updates as we get further along. But I think, in general, that over $200 million at least is -- gets a ballpark, that's consistent with what our guidance is. And once again, as I said in my comments, we don't expect the benefits to stop at the end of 2020. We expect them to continue to be able to harvest some of the benefits that we're going to get, especially from our process improvements into 2021 and beyond. -- Sure. And one other follow up, just on the new debt that you put on the balance sheet to facilitate share repurchase. What's the interest rate on that debt? -- It is a variable debt, that we rate swaps, 3.06%. -- That's what you're paying right now? -- Yes. And that's what we will pay over the life of the debt because of the swap. -- Yes, with the swaps. Great. That's attractive capital. Thanks. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. A process question for you. You mentioned that Wave 1 this year versus Wave 2 and Wave 3 next year. can you give us a little bit of a feel for what activities will be targeted as you progress through those Waves and your thoughts on how you take on SG&A relative to R&D over time? -- Sure. This is, Marc. I think the reasoning for some of the waves will certainly be based on how quickly we can get to the benefits. Right. Certain things such as third-party supplier, such as TNE [Phonetic], those types of things we get to, we can get to really quickly. I think the things that require process improvements, the things require investment and tools, those types of things -- those are the things that tend to be more in the wave 2 and 3. So I think that's -- they're all kind of targeted based on the ability to put in place whatever needs to happen in order to drive those benefits.I think you'll see us certainly work very hard to look at accelerating anything that's in wave 2 or to wave 3 look at waves that we can pull maybe a portion of those benefits forward because we certainly are aware of the dollar saved today are definitely have more value than waiting to for a year and a half or whatever it is to save it.So that's generally there is a difference between the wave 2 to wave 3 is the investment or the actions that have to be in place before we can go execute on those initiatives. -- And when you think about what Alix is doing with you internally, how do you think about what capabilities you want to build? And it sounds like the group with Mike and Kim is to internalize some of those responsibilities. How are you thinking about how the organization needs to change? -- Yeah, I mean, absolute Transformation Management Office is key. We don't expect or want AlixPartners to be here forever. We want them to help us through using their expertise on these initiatives, on what they've learned over their history. But we want to set up the ability to manage change. We want to set up the lean capabilities, all of those elements that will help our business as we as we go forward.I don't know that the Transformation Management Office necessarily has an end date. I mean, I think that there's always going to be areas that we can benefit from those types of services and we're creating an internal capability that can do those types of things that we really didn't have before. But we're doing that in a context and working with Alix but once their work is done, we'll still have that capability and will be a lever that going forward. -- Sounds healthy. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Gillmor with Baird. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks for the question. Maybe asking about the client base. You talked about getting clients on a current version of Millennium and some of the strategies. Can you give us some sort of sense for what portion you would classify as being on for newer software versions, and then what are the things you can do to encourage clients to migrate? -- Yeah, this is John. So as we're working through this year and going into the early part of next year, we have some regulatory components that are actually driving the need to upgrade and be current. So, with our most recent release, we should be have the vast majority of our client base on a current release by mid next year. So, using the opportunity of the certified release structure that we have, that we have to follow right now with US regulations. It's a great opportunity to help our clients remain -- to have a motivation to be current, remain current and stay current. So by the end of mid next year, the vast majority of our clients should be on the most current release. -- Got it. And then one follow up probably for Marc, the Managed Service revenue line, that looks like it ticked down a little sequentially in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. I guess, I normally think of that line as being flat to up. Was there anything that call out either that was in this quarter or last quarter that caused that sequential decline? -- There wasn't anything material during that period. That business can have some impact based on new signings that occurred depending on various elements. So in essence, it was pretty flat down to a few million dollars, but nothing that was consequential or creating a trend, we'd expect it to get back on a slight increase year-over-years -- quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year as we go. -- Got it. Fair enough. Thank you. -- Sure, This is where, I mean, prior to going to the next question, I just want to circle back on the question around capabilities and where we are with our processes. As Marc was addressing this around the transformation. So just want to point out, we did announce since we talked last a new CHRO Tracy Platt joining us from Medtronic. Part of her charter is to really help us work through our strategic workforce planning and ensure that the capabilities in our workforce and leadership are in-line with our strategy and direction and where we're going. So it's -- I thought it was just important to tie that back to that part of the work we are doing now. She's just been on-board a week and we're glad to have her joining the team. -- Yeah, this is Marc, I think, we'll look for an opportunity to introduce Tracy to our investors, because I think she's a -- we certainly appreciate everything, Julie Wilson did for the Company in her role as leader of HR. Tracy brings a lot of skills, a lot of experience in the transformation efforts we're undergoing, including lean and all those other things that we're going to focus on. So, I think bringing her in -- she's also got a very business focused as well. So, she wants to be a partner with the business and help us drive and help us understand the business. And I'm sure she is listening to the call today. So, Tracy, welcome to Cerner. Next question.Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Garro with William Blair. Your line is now open. -- Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to ask about the strategic growth areas that Brent discussed. It seems like there's a bit of a mix of both near and long term opportunities there, so I was hoping you could provide a little more detail setting expectations for specific opportunities on timing of when those areas will contribute to growth? -- I'm going to ask Don to address that, it's kind of his area. -- Yeah we have to do. We spent some time and energy walking through a high-level view of some of the projections on a five-year basis at HIMSS really kind of laying out the Core Pop Health business and what it would look like to have sustained 25% growth rates in that space as we work our way toward 2023. And then coupled with that as we think about what high-single-digit to a double-digit growth looks like. The need for us to think about a combination of organic, inorganic and partner-based revenue to over-attain against those targets. So, we haven't deviated from that kind of broad view that we've put forth in Q1. As I said in my section of the script, I think we've made some good progress in several areas and we're keen to see all of the market segments that we've identified for growth consistently begin to deliver in excess of 25% CAGRs and that's what I'm spending time and energy with the team working on. -- Great, that helps. Maybe as a follow up to that. Thinking high-level revenue mix and those strategic areas and other growth initiatives, maybe a little bit more targeted toward higher margin areas. So, wanted to get thoughts on the evolution of the revenue mix over time and how that can impact gross margins? -- Yeah. This is Marc. I mean, clearly as we move forward, I think especially as we focus on selectively pursuing certain service opportunities that's going to help us from a mix standpoint with higher margin services revenue compared to what we might have in the business today. Certainly many of the things in the strategic growth area are dependent on HealtheIntent platform, which is a Software-as-a-Service. So it has strong margins that are -- and integral part in what that that business is going to rely on. So, part of our focus is kind of replacing over time some of the traditional software with some of that SaaS based software, especially when it's the HealtheIntent platform, because once again that's not big Millennium converting to a SaaS approach and then eventually converting to a SaaS business model. HealtheIntent is SaaS business model in many respects today and supports a lot of these businesses that we're talking about. So from a margin perspective, all of those elements should have a positive impact on overall margins. And given that most of the costs related to driving the top-line that go into the cost-of-goods-sold or service from third-party related that can be a positive impact on gross margins. But certainly a positive impact on operating margins. -- And just to amplify on that from my perspective, if you look at several of the businesses in that space which represent interesting cum non-provider adjacencies for us, such as the work we're doing in state Medicaid space specific to MMIS or the work we're doing in the employer services space. Again, to Marc's good point, using HealtheIntent as the enabling technology strategy for both of those go-to-market efforts, with not only a growth trajectory, but we also think a margin profile that's attractive. -- Great. Thanks for taking the questions. -- Sure.Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just two generally around margins, I guess one in the quarter, you know, you guys saw some nice strength in the license software area. You know, I'm wondering how much of that came from the seven-hospital win that you mentioned in the prepared remarks? And then just obviously related to that, margins ticked up sequentially, but not that much given what seemed like pretty strong growth in that area?And then, Marc, I guess just as it relates to the expectation for kind of sequential flat margins into 3Q and then a pretty healthy step up into 4Q. I know there's a lot of areas behind that. Just wondering if you could maybe just highlight some of the specific areas, you know, line-of-sight as we think about that, what seems to be probably around a 200 basis point step up from 3Q to 4Q? Thanks. -- Sure. Yeah, I think from a mix elements, certainly the software in Q3 was a strong point. It was strong across various areas, including SaaS and traditional software. So it did not -- the single transaction you indicated contributed, but not in a significant manner. I think we're starting to see some of the seasonality that we used to see in the business. So you see Q2 having some strength, you see Q4 having some strength, with Q3 little a bit lighter on the software revenue. So I think that's a little bit of what you're seeing relative to why margins look a little bit flattish as you go into Q3.Clearly, as we've talked, we're not going to start seeing the real benefits from the operating -- from the expense side and some of the optimization efforts really till Q4. And therefore, that Q3, given that you're not really moving the meter on the revenue mix significantly, that's going to basically be relatively flat. When it comes to Q4, we start to see in our in our forecast, in our pipeline, once again, some strength in the software side. We see benefits from the cost optimization. So those are the things that give us some confidence in looking at the ability to ramp up to that 20% in Q4. And I think that, you know, as we go look at that that's all within the expectation we have. Obviously, the full-year numbers we've talked about are still intact, still in place, but the ramp up is going to be stronger in Q4. But because of the seasonality and the other elements of the business, it's actually pretty logical to me that that's the quarter we're going to go hit that. -- Okay, great. Thanks so much. -- Sure.Thank you. And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Thanks. Marc, going back to your comments about conflict to long-term benefit that you'd have an impact in 2021 for margins? Do you mean that we should take an effective 4Q '20 run rate and extrapolated to 2021 or you're guiding to another margin step up from 4Q '20 level into 2021 period? -- Yeah, I am doing anything but guiding to anything 2021 at this point. But the logic is that if I'm increasing and end up with a higher margin in Q4 2020 than I did in the other quarters, with the way I'm approaching it, that should be a sustainable element and there will be things that are driven in 2020 that don't have a full-year benefit.And so as I capture that full-year benefit in 2021, it's logical that I should be able to have full-year margins and increment up from what I have for a full-year 2020 relative to Q4 2020 versus full-year 2021. We'll, have to get closer to that, for me to be able to give you a better view of that. But certainly as we roll forward, we do expect full-year benefits that are going to be fully hit in 2020 to fully hit 2021.So without putting any solid numbers around that -- so for a year, yes, I think 2021, a full-year operating margin will be higher than 2020. -- Okay. And then you highlighted in the press release and on the call that the voluntary separation plan had an impact on the cash flows. Can you quantify for us what it is as a percent of the total workforce? -- From a percent of total workforce, it is a pretty small amount. I think that the total impact from that item is probably $40 million someplace in that from salary perspective. And that's a $650 million personnel number. So, once again, it was voluntary, it was people who were qualified to be in it, which meant you had to have a certain level of tenure with the Company. So it was very successful. But, I think it's certainly -- we're pleased to have gotten through that. We're pleased to start getting the benefits of that. But we're certainly as we were more excited about the benefits we'll get from our additional optimization work. -- Thank you. -- Sure.Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. -- Great, thanks for the question. Just maybe the, drill down on Jamie's question from earlier on the Software-as-a-Service and possible transition there. I'm thinking about it from the data center aspect. Is there the opportunity to move stuff to AWS or Azure going forward? Just curious your thoughts on that potential and how big of an impact would that be for you? -- Yeah, this is Marc, certainly as we go and look at our capital structure, return on invested capital. That's one of the things that we'll look at. I think that, you know, as we move to a model that's more community works release or a very limited number of releases that are being used by our clients, it would fit well with a third-party hosting. But clearly, that's something that we still have to decide and still have to move forward on. But, the good news for our clients is, it's basically nothing that there -- something that wouldn't really impact them significantly. They already have it hosted in an offsite data center. And I think that's for them, it's not going to impact the service that they get from us or the value that they get from it. But for us, certainly, we're doing analysis based on the cost to determine what the best approach for us as we move forward on this new SaaS approach to the business, not necessarily the business model, but the overall approach that SaaS represents and looking at all our options. -- Okay. And then I was interested in GetWellNetwork commentary and that being one of the 165 opportunities that you see. If you look at the 165 how large is the opportunity, I guess with maybe moving people off certain of your products or capabilities to other partners? -- This is Marc, just clarify, that the partnering strategy is not one of the 165 initiatives to a great extent. Those are targeted on an optimization basis, that's additional top-line growth alternatives, potentially part of portfolio management. But I'd be happy, Don, if you want comment a little bit on the benefits GetWell, and kind of our-- -- Maybe just that bridging comment if you can. So this is Brent and this is back to our discussions last quarter about an active portfolio management process and really looking at where it make sense to build versus partner and buy and as John referred to that as an example of as we looked at it, there's a desirable solution as well accepted in the model. It's a win. It's makes sense. And Don you want to maybe describe. -- No, I think I think GetWell was one of a set of partnerships that I alluded to or cited specifically in my section of the script. So GetWell would fit that -- the work we're doing with Salesforce from a CRM perspective, I mentioned naviHealth in the bundled payments space. Certainly the work we're dealing with Lumeris as it relates to provider-sponsored plan in MA. So we have some very strategic partnerships that we've entered into that we expect to make meaningful contributions to revenue as we work into 2020.And as part of that, we want to think about, when does it make sense in this case to move away from myStation solution, engage in a partnership strategy that is highly penetrated today in our client base and also create some opportunities for us around their loop asset to begin to really build out our consumer framework and drive some net new revenue growth relative to that piece of our business.So I think it's emblematic of something that's been part of a multi-quarter trend. And I think we'll continue to update you guys on what that partnership contribution looks like for those Tier-1 one relationships as we move into the back-half of the year and the first-half of 2020. -- Thank you. -- Thank you. -- Why don't we take one more question.Thank you. And our final question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. This is Suzie on for Ross. Thank you for the question. My questions around margins have all been answered. So thank you for all the detail. I guess I'll ask with the organization's initiatives that's driving cost cuts for margin expansion fully in motion now. Is there any color you can provide on feedback you've been receiving from your clients? Or maybe have you gotten any sense that your competition may be transforming its strategy or maybe becoming more aggressive with this strategy in the face of the organizational changes? -- Yeah, this is John. From a client perspective, we hit this a little bit last-the last call that had is that that's one of our key premises as we work through are our efficiency efforts is that we do not impact our clients, we do not impact the commitments to them or strategically, where they're going and all of the initiatives we're looking at, we're looking at through that lens. The majority of our clients that I've talked to and that we've talked to, feel very comfortable from the fact that, the things that we can do around efficiency, the things that we can do around portfolio management is a benefit to them. It gets new innovations to the market quicker, that allows them to plan for things a little better because they are much more aware of when things will to the market and those type of things. So in general, that long as we don't -- that we continue to fulfill our commitments that we currently have and that we come -- that we are more focused on what we're doing in the future. We should be fine with our clients and I think they understand that and they are looking forward to the benefits as opposed to worrying about what are some of that negative impacts. -- This is Brent. I would just add that, of course, in healthcare delivery, the large providers, almost every one of them has some sort of initiative like this going themselves. So, in the Executive suite, it's very familiar and they understand it and they know it's part of doing business in healthcare. So it is familiar. -- Got it. Thank you for squeezing me in. -- Yeah, you bet. Thank you. -- Thank you, everyone, for being on the call. We look forward to talking to you soon. Take care. Thank you all.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

It goes without saying that they probably have a much better idea of what is happening in the company than most analysts. They certainly know more about it than I do. I especially like to see what they are doing after their company stock has fallen dramatically.I am not implying that there is anything illicit or illegal going on. When an insider wants to buy or sell their company\u2019s stock they can as long as they follow very strict procedures. They have to file their intent to buy or sell with the SEC, and they are subject to \u201cblackout periods\u201d. These are times in which they cannot trade the stock. For example, insiders may be prohibited from buying or selling the stock in the thirty days before or after the earnings release is due to be reported.There are many reasons why an officer or a director of a company may decide to sell their stock. They could need to raise money for things such as tuitions, mortgages, weddings or divorce settlements.But they only buy it for one reason: They believe that the stock is undervalued and eventually it will trade at a higher price where they can make a profit.These five stocks came up on my radar screen as potential buys due to the significant insider buying that has recently occurred.\u00a0(NYSE:) develops and acquires natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian and Midcontinent regions.Mark Succhi is the Chief Financial Officer and a Senior Vice President.

Today's date is April 25, 2019 and this call is being recorded.The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statement, including without limitation those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating and capital expenses, bookings, new solution services and offering development, capital allocation plans, and future business outlook including new market or prospects for the company's solutions and services. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements.Please see Cerner's earnings release which was furnished to the SEC today and posted on the Investors section of cerner.com and other filings with the SEC for information on the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Additionally, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this  can also be found in the company's earnings release available on cerner.com. Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brett Schaefer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cerner Corporation. -- Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the call. I'll spend the first few minutes providing some context on the quarter and then I'll ask our CFO, Marc Naughton, to walk through the results; and then our Chief Client Officer, John Peterzalek, to provide additional highlights and marketplace observations.Since our last , you've likely seen that Starboard acquired a position in Cerner and we announced a cooperation agreement with them. From the outset we approached the conversation with Starboard in an open-minded fashion just like we do any shareholder. Starboard's focus on operational improvements and board refreshment was consistent with our objectives and plans, and we had existing efforts under way in both areas. The cooperation agreement builds on and accelerates the work we've been doing and formalizes our commitment to improve operating performance, including specific targets that are aggressive but attainable.In addition, we added four outstanding new Board members which we believe strengthens our governance. We strongly believe these operational and governance improvements are in the best interest of Cerner's clients, plans, associates and shareholders.Since assuming the role of CEO in 2018, the entire Cerner leadership team and I have been reviewing all facets of our operations to improve financial performance and unlock the company's significant potential. As we discussed in our last  at HIMSS, we rolled out a new operating model to streamline operations, become more client-centric, and to enable improved focus on growth. We believe this work is foundational to our operational improvement commitments. As the next step toward driving improvements in Cerner's operations and cost structure we engaged AlixPartners, a leading outside consulting firm.Our goal is to uncover efficiencies without impacting important growth investments and commitments to Cerner clients. Key areas we expressed that we expect to address include: to assess top management spend and layers; to continue the portfolio management work that we started in 2018; rationalize company facilities review non-personnel expenses, and drive additional process improvements. The work is off to a good start, and I have direct experience working with AlixPartners and I'm confident in their ability to help us become more efficient while we become more focused and better position ourselves for profitable growth. Marc will discuss our targets in more detail but I want to make it clear they have balanced -- they have been balanced against Cerner's growth investments and client commitments.One of the other elements we evaluated last year was Cerner's capital allocation strategy. Based on the strength of our balance sheet, we wanted to enhance the return of capital to shareholders which led to our announced quarterly dividend program and commitment to continue share repurchases. Given our expectation that we will create value as we deliver on our operational initiatives, we increased our share buyback authorization as part of our agreement with Starboard resulting in a $1.5 billion currently available for repurchase.With respect to governance we welcome John Gresh, Melinda Mount, George Riddell, Causy Wise (ph) to Cerner's Board. These new members along with our existing directors bring invaluable counsel and insight. Our Board supports management view that the actions we are taking can create shareholder value without putting the business at risk. To monitor the operational improvement efforts a Finance & Strategy Committee has been established that will work closely with management to ensure execution against our operating targets. Cerner operates in a highly competitive space and we will be measured in our approach with respect to client commitments, investments and considerations for our associate base. We believe the actions outlined will help us become a much stronger and more focused company, well positioned for long-term profitable growth.Now I'll turn it over to Marc. -- Thanks, Brent. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover our Q1 results and future guidance. I'll start with bookings which were $1.242 billion in Q1, this is $42 million above the midpoint of our guidance range and as anticipated down from Q1 2018 bookings of $1.398 billion which included much higher-than-normal levels of large long-term bookings. As John will discuss, bookings excluding long-term contracts grew slightly over the year-ago period.We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $14.87 billion which is up 2% over a year ago. Recall that our backlog calculation under the new revenue standard excludes revenue from contracts with termination clauses even though such clauses are rarely exercised. When you combine the expected revenue from our backlog and the additional revenue expected from contracts not included in backlog, our revenue visibility remains at approximately 85% over the next 12 months. Revenue in the quarter was $1.390 billion, up 8% over Q1 of 2018, and at the midpoint of our guidance range.I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q1 of 2018. License software revenue in Q1 was $154 million, up 15% over Q1 of 2018 with good growth in both, traditional software and SaaS offerings. The growth in traditional software benefited from a low comparable level in Q1 2018 which was the lowest software quarter of the year. Technology resell decreased 12% in Q1 to $56 million but was up sequentially as we expected. Subscriptions revenue grew 10% to $84 million in Q1, in line with our expectations as the subscription business model would return to solid growth after being impacted in 2018 by the adoption of Topic 606. Professional services revenue in Q1 grew 11% to $490 million driven by solid growth in both, implementation services and our works businesses.Managed services increased 13% to $304 million in Q1, primarily driven by robust bookings in 2018. The core maintenance was down 3% compared to Q1 of 2018 with solid growth in Cerner Millennium support not quite offsetting declines in legacy support and hardware maintenance. Note that support maintenance was flat sequentially and has easier comparable periods going forward, but we expect year-over-year growth to be flat to low single-digit for the remainder of the year. And finally, reimbursed travel in the first quarter was flat to both Q1 of 2018 and last quarter at $24 million.Looking at revenue by geographic segment; domestic revenue was up 8% from the year ago quarter at $1.231 billion, and international revenue of $159 million was up $1 million from the year ago quarter. Note that our non-U.S. revenue growth was impacted by foreign currency rates and would have been mid-single-digit on a constant currency basis. Moving to gross margin; our gross margin for Q1 was 81.8%, down from 82.6% in Q4 of 2018 and 82.1% year-over-year due to slightly higher mix of third-party services.Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, acquisition-related adjustments, organizational restructuring expenses and other adjustments; all is detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.Looking at operating spending; our first quarter GAAP operating expenses of $939 million were up 8% compared to $866 million in the year ago quarter. Our adjusted operating expenses were up 9% compared to Q1 of 2018. Looking at the line items for Q1, sales in client service expense increased 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to our services businesses. Software development expense increased 12% over Q1 of 2018 driven by a 7% increase in gross R&D, a 12% increase in amortization and flat capitalized software. G&A expense was up 5% and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased slightly year-over-year.Moving to operating margins; our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 14.2% compared to 15.1% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 17.5%, down from 18.8% in Q1 of 2018 and 18.7% last quarter. As Brent discussed, we are taking steps to improve our operating performance with a focus on cost optimization, process improvement and portfolio management. We expect these efforts to begin positively impacting our results in the second half of the year. We are working with AlixPartners to refine our list of optimization and process improvement opportunities and build a more detailed timeline. We expect to be done with this work by the time we report our second quarter, but based on our preliminary work we remain confident in our ability to meet previously announced targets for Q4 of 2019 and Q4 for 2020 adjusted operating margins of 20% and 22.5% respectively. This will be hard work, particularly with the backdrop of a challenging core market environment but it is necessary to make these changes to enhance efficiency and focus as we position ourselves for ongoing profitable growth.I want to be clear that we still believe we have good long-term growth opportunities driven by our federal businesses, opportunities within our large health system base, and our strategic growth initiatives that address adjacent markets. As we work through our operational improvement efforts, we'll look to protect the investments necessary to drive this growth. The changes we expect to make revolve around focus. We are doing too many things, and we believe we can do better if we target our attention on areas that represent the largest and most profitable growth opportunities and drive client satisfaction and retention.Moving to net earnings and EPS; our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $166 million or $0.51 per diluted share which is up 6% compared to GAAP EPS in Q1 of 2018. Adjusted net earnings in Q1 were $199 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.61 compared to $0.58 in Q1 of 2018. Our GAAP tax rate was 19.5% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21%. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be closer to 22% for the remainder of 2019.Moving to our balance sheet; we ended Q1 with $904 million of cash and short-term investments which is up from $775 million in Q4 of 2018. Our total debt was down $5 million from last quarter to $439 million. Total receivables that in the quarter were $1.159 billion, down from $1.183 billion in Q4 of 2018. Our Q1 DSO was 76 days which is down from 79 days in Q4 2018, and up from 73 days in the year-ago period.Operating cash flow for the quarter was $317 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $119 million and capitalized software was $75 million. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs was $123 million for the quarter. For 2019, we continue to expect our operating cash flow to be impacted by hard (ph) cash outflows for taxes, our voluntary separation plan payouts and other expenses related to our organizational restructuring. On the capital side, we expect an increase in capital expenditures primarily driven by work on a phase of construction at our Innovations Campus which should be completed in the first half of 2020. Due to a combination of these two factors, we expect free cash flow to decline in 2019. In 2020, we expect to return to normal operating cash flow growth and meaningful decline in capital expenditures to lead to strong free cash flows. In addition, note that our capital spending is included in our operational review and we expect to identify opportunities to reduce capital spending going forward.Moving to capital allocation; as we recently announced we increased our share buyback authorization to $1.5 billion. We expect to execute the majority of the repurchase authorization in the next 12 months subject to market conditions and other factors. We intend to fund this with cash from operations and debt with the amount of debt depending on the timing of our repurchases and whether we use cash for other purposes such as M&A. Regarding the dividend program we announced in February, we still expect to initiate a $0.15 per share quarterly cash dividend with the first payment expected early in the third quarter. We expect the Board to efficiently declare the dividend at our May shareholder meeting. Our expected initiation of the dividend combined with our significantly increased share repurchase authorization reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders and our belief in Cerner's long-term potential.Now I'll go through the guidance. We expect revenue in Q2 to be between $1.410 billion and $1.460 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 5% over Q2 of 2018. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue between $5.65 billion and $5.85 billion with a $5.75 billion midpoint reflecting 7% growth over 2018; we expect Q2 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.63 to $0.65 per share; the midpoint of this range is 3% higher than Q2 of 2018. For full year adjusted diluted earnings per share, we expect to benefit from the recently announced operational improvement initiatives and expanded share repurchase program. The amount of the benefit will depend on the timing of operational improvements and share buybacks but based on preliminary estimates, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $2.64 and $2.72 which reflects 9% growth at the midpoint and is above our previous guidance range of $2.57 to $2.67.Moving to bookings guidance; we expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 24% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2018 which included the initial test quarter for the VA. As John will discuss, the primary reason for the projected year-over-year decline as we expect lower levels of long-term bookings.In summary, we are pleased with our solid results in the first quarter and we remain focused on delivering improved operating performance and creating shareholder value as we position Cerner for long-term profitable growth.With that, I'll turn the call over to John. -- Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll cover our top line results and discuss the marketplace.I'll start with our bookings which are in line with our projections with growth in non-long-term bookings being offset by a decline in long-term bookings which we previewed last quarter. The percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts in the quarter was 30% compared to 40% in Q1 of last year. When you exclude the long-term component, bookings grew 3% compared to the year ago quarter. As Marc mentioned, the dynamic is expected to continue in Q2 with another expected decline in long-term bookings and the impact is amplified by the fact that Q2 of last year represents a tough comparable as it was near an all-time high and included our initial VA bookings.The lower level of long-term bookings in our forecast is in part driven by our decision to be more selective as we consider certain low-margin long-term contract opportunities given the current operational review and our focus on higher margin growth, this is not expected to have a material impact on near-term revenue or earnings but we do expect the mix of long-term bookings to be lower for the year. Our pipeline remains strong and we are well positioned to deliver good long-term growth but willing to make sure we pursue high quality business that aligns with our focus on profitable growth.Moving to new business mix; we had a solid quarter with 32% of bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base. In the Federal space, our projects with DoD and VA are both progressing as planned. For DoD, we are continuing our work on the second wave of sites with go-lives on-track for this fall. Similarly, our work with the VA has continued as planned and we remain on-track to steadily ramp our work on the projects as we go through the year and into next year with the initial sites still expected to go-live in 2020.Q1 was also a solid quarter for other key growth areas such as revenue cycle and population health. We also see material growth opportunities beyond the hospital as we shift -- as the shift continues toward at-risk value-based pay arrangements, providers will need better data and analytics to improve their economics. Cerner expects to help provide our clients increase their top line revenue and win their ZIP code by providing the Big Data and predicted tools to support better healthcare experiences and outcomes.A few weeks ago we announced an expanded partnership with naviHealth, a pioneer in post-acute patient management. We have worked with naviHealth for the past five years to streamline workflows for the post-acute discharge. We are expanding the relationship to create a new HER agnostic offering that drives improved clinical outcomes and financial results with a focus on addressing the latest bundled payments model for the CMS known as the bundled payments for care improvement advance. -- As we build our healthcare network strategy, we will selectively add at-risk capabilities with key partners. naviHealth, for example, will leverage Cerner's HealtheIntent platform and allows us to drive higher-dollar, higher-margin economics around the provider-health network because health systems leverage our portfolio of value-based risk models, the naviHealth relationship is highly complementary to our work with Lumeris, an important strategy for advancing our post-acute line of business.Now, I'll provide brief observations on the marketplace. While our core EHR market is mature, opportunities remain to replace legacy suppliers and cross-sell additional solutions such as revenue cycle and ambulatory into our existing client base. We believe we are well positioned to act as a partner to our clients because we have the capabilities beyond EHR that align with their imperatives which generally include optimizing revenue in both, fee-for-service and value-based models, improve the health of population, enhancing quality and outcomes, and creating operational efficiencies.In summary, we believe we are aligned with our clients' needs and well positioned to enable them to pursue their growth strategies and deliver against their imperatives.With that I'll turn the call back to over to Brent for closing comments. -- Thanks, John. Well, as you've heard from us today we're undergoing a lot of change. We have embraced the core operational agreement as an opportunity to build on the work we've done over the past year and move at a fast pace to make the needed improvements in our operating performance. We are very committed to delivering against the targets we have established and we're confident in our ability to execute.One thing that will not change is our commitment to clients and innovation. We're focused on supporting our clients by aligning around the following priorities: intelligent innovation which means delivering on our commitment to leverage the power of data to create contextual intelligent experiences, new evidence-based insights and workflow interventions, better experiences and outcomes which includes intelligent health networks and relentlessly advancing client successes, open and connected healthcare which reflects our commitment to investing in rapid technology advancements to deliver tangible value to every patient clinician, technologist and administrator. We believe open platforms that allow clients, partners and developers to innovate with us will allow us to solve healthcare's most complex challenges.In summary, we believe we are making Cerner a stronger, more-focused company positioned to have a positive impact on healthcare.I'll now turn the call back to the moderator and open up for questions.Questions And Answers(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. -- Brent, you shared several areas that you highlighted as being evaluated to help you guys reach the operating margin targets shared in the cooperation agreement. But I was hoping maybe you could just give us a little bit more of a sense of order of magnitude, and I'm thinking if you take a step back -- R&D versus more of the traditional operating expenses because I know you've highlighted things that are kind of on both sides of the fence there. And then within that, if you could just share that kind of line of sight you feel like you have today into those cost savings as we think about getting the operating profit level from what we saw in 1Q to that 20% exit rate that you guys had shared? -- Good question. Well, it's early days, right? So we're a couple of weeks into the engagement with Alix, so we're in the data-sharing process and starting to really build out where to look. The analogy I've been using is from a healthcare perspective is, we're doing a full-body CT scan out of everything, all aspects of the organization to look for opportunities and it's a little early to identify exactly where we go. But we do -- we -- certainly we see opportunities as I mentioned it around how it's fundamentally structured around management expanded (ph) layers, and we feel like we did some really good work last year on the portfolio, it established a good baseline of understanding for us, quantified where the opportunities are and where some of the best opportunities are. So it's kind of -- in many cases going to the next step here of seeing that through, making strong decisions around those that maximize our growth opportunity and help us find efficiencies.And we know just -- as we discussed last year, based on our scale and size that the operating model was intended to help setup some fundamental alignment about accountability and clarity throughout the organization but we know there is opportunity for process improvement that comes with that. And given that in Q1 we just rolled out the model, kind of the next obvious step is to then really look for clear processes to work those for efficiencies through the whole organization. So, I hope that at least gives you some directional sense of where we'll go and there will be more as we get into it for sure. -- No, Brent, that helps. I guess just a quick follow-up; I thought it was interesting comments on the bookings guidance, it seems more conscious that you're not pursuing certain -- as you described lower-margin long-term contracts. Is it safe to assume that that's on the work side of things? And if that's true maybe just an update on where you stand on the billing center; I know that was a big focus, a big buildout last year. -- This is Marc. I think certainly every transaction and agreement we look at is going to be reviewed in light of our focus. But relative to bookings, keep in mind, the long-term bookings which is the primary difference we're seeing in Q1 and Q2 relative to the year ago quarters, those tend to be lumpy. And actually coming into the year we indicated when we talked to you about Q1 and as we're doing in Q2; the funnel for those types of transactions just wasn't as big as it was a year ago. And that -- the funnel varies or opportunities in front of us that are fairly large that can certainly bring us back to a more normalized number relative to that. But I think that for us the point we're making is, we're certainly going to look at all of our businesses and decide which ones we want to focus our attention on, and those are the ones that are going to be that we think help our clients, retain our clients, and drive profitable growth.So right now it's a little early to decide exactly what that's going to entail but when you think about bookings, I think probably the more meaningful impact in the first half of this year is just a little lower pipeline.Our next question will come from Rivka Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. -- When we think about 2019 and kind of over the top line growth, what percent of revenue do you expect to come from the Federal contracts where you're not changing your spend versus customer areas where you are planning on spending less on? And then second, a follow-up question on that is; if you had a chance to speak with them of your hospital customers after your announcement and what feedback are you hearing back from them? Thank you. -- Yes. John you want to take the feedback question? -- I'll go first with the feedback and the client. This is John. I had the opportunity obviously to speak with many clients post announcements, and almost without exception, it's viewed as a positive catalyst for us as we look at our new Board members and the focus on both technology and operational improvements that's very positive from our clients' perspective. We're accelerating some of the things that we are already doing around our operating model to become more efficient. Our efficiencies -- it reflects well with our clients as well, it's easier for them to do business with us, we get solutions to market quicker; all those types of things. So pretty much without exception it was viewed as a good catalyst for us to move forward and accelerate our plans that we already have. -- This is Marc. On your question kind of relative to revenue that has costs or doesn't have costs or -- obviously, we're early in determining where the opportunities are here but I think a key element when you're thinking about revenue and the impact of our efforts on revenue is that as we went into the year and we continue to see based on the 12-month view out of backlog and those contracts that are not in backlog but are going to roll out in the next 12 months; that 85% of our revenue is still visible to us, so that is going to be rolling through. Most of the activities from our services which a lot of the VA revenue comes from, those people are generating revenue and clearly you're not going to go cut costs for people that are generating revenue.So I think from a revenue perspective, the efforts we're taking from a efficiency standpoint aren't going to make the material dent relative to 2019.And our next question will come from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. -- I just wanted to follow-up on the cadence of the margin improvement. Marc, if I look at -- I know you don't give specific margin guidance but if I look at the implied margin for the second quarter it looks like it will be down again year-over-year. So can you maybe just talk about how quickly this will ramp to get to that? As Brent said, aggressive but attainable target of 20% by the fourth quarter; is it -- because that mean that all of these efficiencies will really come in the third quarter and fourth quarter? -- Lisa, this is Marc. I mean clearly the efforts we are undertaking are fairly recent, we've got a lot of analysis to do and then we have to go take the steps that are going to start driving those. So, I think it's certainly in our view -- in our -- and the plan we have is a material amount of that happens in Q4 for this year because it's going to take us time to get those projects under way and start realizing the benefits. So your synopsis that is most of that is going to be happening certainly in the last of the year, and much of it in Q4 I think is a realistic one. I think certainly all the work we're going to be doing in 2019 is then going to set us up well as we roll into 2020 and put us on a good path for the 22.5% we expect to see in Q4 of that year. But certainly from a exiting Q4, you will see a pretty steep ramp from a quarterly operating margin percentage as more and more of these initiatives start hitting the P&L as we get toward the end of the year. -- And then just so I understand in the updated guidance around the share repurchase; how much specifically do you have in the updated guidance for share repo? -- We haven't given any specific number. It clearly depends on the timing of the repurchases which will be subject to market conditions etcetera. So we haven't really defined when we plan to do all of those repurchases, we've just indicated that over -- certainly over the next 12 months we expect to do the majority of that authorization. We're serious about bringing those shares and getting that repurchase done but we haven't set a timing as far as when that's going to occur, and therefore relative to how it will impact EPS over that time.And our next question will come from Jeff Garrow with William Blair & Company. -- I want to ask more about bookings and the idea that you guys are getting more selective in some of these long-term opportunities. Maybe the way to ask it might be what types of long-term opportunities are you still really interested in pursuing? Is it with some of the market leaders or with some of your tightest partnerships or is it more strictly based on margin potential? -- This is John. We're going to continue to look at all of our opportunities. It's just going to be a path of which ones we believe are going to benefit the client the most and get them -- move them forward as well as with our (inaudible) are making sure that the margins are right long-term for us as you expect to come to the big mix; but it doesn't mean we're only going to focus on the largest ones, it will be throughout our client base where we'll have great opportunities to align both where we deliver tremendous value for the client and provide higher margins for Cerner. So it's not one specific area, that we'll be looking at all of them with sort of just a revised look at them but it should be brought throughout our entire client base. -- Got it, that helps. And then as a follow-up; thinking about the 4% year-over-year bookings growth in the near-term bookings category and I want to ask what do you see the pipeline supporting for the rest of the year given the bit of change in philosophy of those longer -- around those longer opportunities? Can you set some level of expectation around how near-term bookings are going to unfold for the rest of the year? -- This is Marc. This -- once again, bookings is a number that we'd like to have -- we've gone throughout our rigorous forecast process and have a view on before we share a lot of color around that. So at this point I think it's a little premature, it give a guidance as far as what we see the non-long-term versus the long-term? And the second half of the year certainly will be able to share more of that as we get to our next call but at this point consistent with what we've always done, we're not going to provide a whole lot of more color based on those breakdowns. -- I think it's fair to say that the pipeline is robust? -- Yes, as we look at the market, the market is strong. -- I would add to that and I mentioned that in my comments as well. There is no material change in our pipeline at all. We still have a very strong pipeline, top to bottom, both in solution, services and other things. So I am highly optimistic about the pipeline itself, it continues to grow and it can continue to be very broad through our solution mix and services mix. -- And this is Marc. Just a reminder that when you look at the bookings you've got to -- do have to keep in mind a little bit -- a bit of context. In '17 we grew 16% and in the last year we grew pretty significantly in bookings as well. The prior year actually we grew zero, so I think there is some lumpiness to this but the reality is based on our backlog that's grown significantly from those two years of strong bookings, the revenue line is in pretty good shape relative to visibility. And the good news is that the pipeline is strong in a market that is seeming-deemed mature, we have a lot of opportunities within both our existing client base and new clients to go after market share; so we will continue to do that.Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. -- Bremt, can you speak to your hope for how the Board is financing strategy? Committee will interact with management and Alix goes a little bit of the functional -- how that will function? -- Yes. One, I think if you look at the bio's of the four new Board members we're adding, they are all operators with a lot of diverse experience, who have been through multiple business cycles, different stages in business. So I think having their insights and as part of this will be a real benefit to it -- to us to have these new folks. And then combined with folks from our traditional board who -- especially a couple who have very deep insights to the market and operations that we're in, I feel good about that. So, I think it's mostly a question of perspective and experience, interacting with management as we work through these changes and helping us to avoid pitfalls and mistakes as we work our way through. It's a lot, it's -- as you know, this is kind of work as a heavy lift and we need to make sure we do it well and keep our priorities straight. So I expect it to be very helpful for us as we move forward. -- And it sounds like do you see them working with the management team broadly more than just advising during the Board? -- Well, no. I mean, they are the Board members, so I expect them to advice, absolutely, it is an advising role does Board members but the breadth of experience that they bring I think is a benefit as we work through this. So -- yes, but it's an advisory role.Thank you. And our next question will come from Ross (ph) with Evercore ISI. -- Hi, this is Elizabeth Anderson on for Ross. Can you discuss your openness to improve efficiencies in your R&D organizations? So, for example, how do you arrive at the proper level of investment or measure given the lack of revenue acceleration in certain of your end-markets? -- For me -- let me see and then maybe you can add some, Marc as we go. But I think the steps we started last year around just a disciplined approach to portfolio review was really fundamental. As Marc mentioned, I think we've mentioned this a couple of times we felt like we were trained to do too many things simultaneously. So the first piece is having a robust process around setting priorities, in that I feel like we've got a good start there, there is a lot more work that we can do but I think this is a very good start. And then within the R&D and how assets are deployed and how we work through a cycle, I think the business model we put in place should help us because we found that we were developing some great new functionality and then really never getting it to market and scaling it through our client base because there was developed, we weren't seeing it all the way through. So there is opportunity there.And then I think when you come back to the topic now about really the process improvement, I think that's kind of new ground for us. We've got the model in place, we've got a portfolio process in place, so now we're really looking for how can we find efficiencies throughout that development processes is work ahead for us. So, I think all of those are ongoing opportunities for us at this point. So hopefully that gives you a little color on it. Is there anything you want to add Marc? -- No, I think that's exactly alike. Certainly, every -- there is nothing off-the-table as we go through to do this work. Certainly it focuses delivering to our clients and innovating. So, R&D has been a key part of that strategy (ph) that certainly everything we do as a company is going to be reviewed to make sure that the process is right and the local resource is appropriate and the focus of those resources is appropriate. -- My final question is, how are you going to message to your clients your intent regarding margins? And how do you counteract how competition is likely to position that? -- We know that there is going to be some competitive messaging around this whether it's accurate or inaccurate on the competitive side. But our clients look at our margin in my opinion is more how efficient we are, and I've said it before, I think that our clients need us to be more efficient because we need to bring our solutions to market more quickly and efficiency drives to that. So they will welcome the fact that we'll be more focused and not spend as much time around the periphery of some things. And they'll welcome the fact that some of the great ideas and innovations we have will make it all the way through being deeply embedded in our clients. So I think messaging the realities to our clients will be very positive and they will see some very positive things come out of it in terms of how effectively we work with them.And we'll just have to deal with the competitive messaging, we'll be proactive about it but communication is the best thing we can do with our clients, so let them know what we're doing, what to expect. And Brent has been clear and we all have been very clear, this process will not impact our client. The commitments we have to our clients will not impact the innovation they expect from us and will not impact what we deliver. -- I think I'll just add to that John. I appreciate the points. I think in the clients that we serve, these are generally very long-term partnerships. And so they depend on us to be a strong partner, a healthy partner, and to continue to innovate and help them move forward. And so a strong Cerner is something that they want, all right? They want to know how we're positioned well for the future and can continue to deliver on our commitments. And so I think that's -- there is a pretty good understanding that is out in our client base. But thanks for the question, I appreciate it.Thank you. And our next question will come from David Larsen with Leerink. -- Hi, can you talk a little bit about your revenue works efforts? I think you brought on about 600 rev cycle FTEs in 2018. That obviously had to put some pressure on the margin there but now what I'm hearing is the level of large service engagement wins has kind of slowed. Just any thoughts on your RevWorks efforts Marc? I think at one point you mentioned you wanted to make sure that Adventist was up and running and perfect before bringing on large new ones; is that still your thought process? -- Sure. I think yes, they basically opened up our billing center in Kansas City and that is fully staffed. It is beginning to take over roles that are opening now from attrition from some of our signed clients; so it is actually operating as it was intend to operate at this point. And I think that we still are -- look at that business and want to make sure that we are really good at it before we take it a whole lot broader; that's one of -- more of the activities we're doing relative to this to the work we're doing around efficiencies and profitability. But certainly, I think the creative (inaudible) that business office in Kansas City has turned out as we expected. We're getting the leverage from it and I think we're going to have to continue to be able to leverage that office for new opportunities as they come up.Once again, those are probably even lumpier in the case of opportunities from a long-term bookings perspective. But currently, right now, that business is operating out of that service center and meeting our expectations. -- And then just one more quick one for me. In terms of like the VA and sort of the rolling on the VA; can you remind me how many waves are there? I thought there were like more than 40 waves and I think Waves 1 and 2 are scheduled to go-live in like 2020. So my impression is that a lot of the VA revenue and bookings are still ahead of Cerner, is that correct or not? -- Yes. A little more color would be that absolutely correct. -- You're exactly right. There are a bunch of ways and once we get further into the projects there will be multiple ways progressing at the same time. Right now they are (inaudible) to be kind of single waves as you get to proof-of-concept and those other elements. But as we roll forward and particularly as you start looking at kind of the bookings -- future view for bookings you do have to keep in mind that really kind of VA, we had some initial bookings from them, this year we'll have some additional bookings. But the real increase in VA bookings comes when they really start rolling out multiple ways they start contracting for those projects. And our statement has been we expect that revenue stream to grow kind of in $250 million increments until we get to around $1 billion a year.To get to a $1 billion year you got to have a significant amount of bookings come through to be able to support the revenue level. So you will see the revenue continuing to grow from VA, and therefore the bookings growth from VA as we move forward kind of on that full year timeline we discussed.And our next question comes from Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity. -- So on this profitable growth commentary it sounds like you're deemphasizing some products or services, maybe RevWorks is one of those. Does that change your long-term thoughts on revenue growth by maybe deemphasizing some of these things? And then if not, what are the areas that you see the most growth potential in over maybe the next five years? -- This is Marc. I think at HIMSS we kind of laid out some of the opportunities for growth that we were looking at. Certainly, the government growth area is a huge area for us to grow. We talked about naviHealth today, there are opportunities in the pothouse (ph) space that we continue to look at opportunities to grow from the top line perspective. The reality -- the focus on profitable growth, that can be across almost any business. I mean, some of the work that Brent referenced from a portfolio management perspective is that we're spending a bunch of money on something that's never going to grow to be a sizable contributor to revenue but it's taking cycles of intention, it's taking people. So if there is a lot of those types of things that are not just in categories but are individual areas that we need to go adjust and either decide we're not going to do those anymore, spin that off, do whatever the approach is going to be. But I think from an overall standpoint, we have elements of growth that are out there, that will continue to be able to provide avenues.So, today if you look at RevWorks that was kind of your focused question; that might be couple of hundred million dollars of revenue to us today. So that -- well that's sizable, there hasn't been a huge growth in that from a bookings perspective or more recently from a revenue perspective. So I think while that's an avenue potential growth, we have lots of other avenues of potential growth that this process will help us define which of those we actively pursue and invest in, and which of those we decide not to. -- And I think we're jumping to specific business lines which I wouldn't do right now. And I would not use the word deemphasize, I would use what we said in our comments which is selective. That some of these long-term growth areas are still very important to us, we're just going to make sure that they add to the -- that we're very selective in terms of the profitable growth, the comments we made before. There are lots of opportunities out there, we can make sure they align both with our clients' needs, the value we drive and the profitable growth for Cerner. So I would be hesitant to use the word deemphasize and I would continue that we're going to be selective in where we go. -- Yes. Keep in mind, one of the key elements of the RevWorks business is to more tightly align the client to Cerner, and that tight alignment brings with it a lot more software sales, a lot more high-level services sales. So that is the overall contribution from those efforts is what we're looking at, we are not going to go pigeonhole just a piece of that business and say 'this doesn't make sense.' It's got to be an overall profitability relative to a client, and that's always been the focus we've had but we want to be selective in which ones of those we pursue making sure it does deliver on that promise.And our next question will come from the line of Stephanie Demko with Citi. -- First one, just what drove your view of a non-linear margin impact at the recent Analyst Day? Or I guess put it another way, how much of that was a conscious decision to avoid any impact on top line or bookings growth versus something else? -- Yes. I mean -- I don't think there was any intent to avoid an impact on the top line. We at our HIMSS meeting said, our goal was to be over 20% plus. We clearly -- as Brent said, it's been a lot of time working on structures and we're not getting to a point where we were prepared to start doing the deeper work to go drive those efficiencies. Clearly, our agreement with Starboard accelerates that process, we're now adding detail of doing it at a faster pace; so I don't know that it's consistent with what we're talking about relative to getting over 20% margins. The good news is 22.5% is over 20% and we're getting there probably more quickly than many people would have expected us to get there and that's absolutely ourselves and Starboard which is actually aligned with many of our investors and shareholders. We're all in alignment on that goal. -- Understood. So with that in mind are there any near-term margin opportunities that you are looking at that is being offset by mix over the next quarter or two? Or you're more staying on the sidelines until the consulting analyst finishes? Just to take a more from an approach there. -- We are -- once again, we've been doing work on this space for a while. We certainly love the work we're doing with AlixPartners, the collaboration, and it's actually been very -- they've been very well received within our organization; so that's going very well. But there are things that we already had in process and thinking through that we are going to be able to start (inaudible). Depending on what those are it may have a near-term impact but many of these are going to be something that even if you're getting something kicked off immediately, the real impact is going to be toward the last part of the year and that's the reality of the situation at this point.And our next question will come from the line of Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird. -- I just had one last one. On the buyback program and just if you could update us on your sort of future outlook there. And I guess the perspective would be that once you complete this repurchase authorization do you intend to keep repurchasing stock at a similar pace or should we think of the $1.5 billion more as a one-time large repurchase and then you go back to the prior cadence? And I know, M&A if you execute there that would obviously been influenced but just trying to understand the philosophy at this point. -- Sure, this is Marc. I mean our capital allocation approach is something that we review all the time. I think that working here will certainly work through this authorization by the Board and get that done. We've always had the position that we are going to -- at minimum do repurchases that are offsetting dilution. And for the most -- a lot of the view on stock repurchase is how attractive are market conditions and what the share price look like relative to what we think the value is. So I think you'll see us complete this large purchase. And keep in mind, we've bought a lot of stock back over the last five or six years, so this isn't inconsistent with that, it's a little larger than our prior authorizations but we'll certainly look at it once we get this done and determine based on our capital allocation at that time if we do another sizable one, just continue doing offset dilution, do we have other investments.So little early for us to tell that this is going to be a planned attack. I think it's -- I think capital allocation is something you've got to do on -- kind of a more of a temporal nature than a long-term planned nature.And our next question will come from the line of Michael Cherny of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- The thing about the cost cuts in the investment cycle from a little bit of a different angle. I think you've outlined at least the beginning pieces of what you plan to attack in terms of margin expansion. How do you think about positioning the company? And when you think about not just protecting revenue but also looking to expand revenue in a world where hiring talent in the tech land becomes so much more challenging, so much more competitive. How do you think about the culture that you want to bring to the organization against the backdrop of driving through some of these cost cuts to make sure that you're staying at the forefront given your competition, not just the dynamics of what's in the competition in terms of selling against you but what's the competition in terms of the developing new products and new platforms against you? -- Maybe a couple commentary. You're asking me about culture and I think that's a great one to emphasize because I think there is an amazing -- it's a relative new comer to Cerner, there is an amazing culture here and a real emphasis and a real desire to innovate and contribute in improved healthcare. And I think as/far as attracting global talent to be part of that, I think that is a very strong asset for us and something we need to continue to build and reinforce, and we want to do that. And if you look at some of the facilities that we have in place, our innovation centers, I don't if you've had a chance to tour but it is world-class, it is a world-class environment for innovation and to attract talent.So I understand the nature of your question is, do we scare (inaudible). I think honestly we want to reinforce this is a great place to be and a great culture to be in, and we're here to contribute to improvement in healthcare and what better mission is there than that? So, we'll be careful about balancing the need for efficiency while attracting talent and driving that culture that we want to maintain. -- This is Marc. I think in some cases there are areas in the company that because of how we've grown up and some of the silos we've created before we changed the operating model, it was harder to get things done inside Cerner. So I think the culture will evolve to one where it is easier to get things done and I think that's important. I think clearly, one of the pillars of our organization is strategic growth. So we are focusing on an entire organization just on finding new areas to grow the company. So I think rather than that being dispersed throughout the organization having a single focus of that group on it makes it more likely that we are going to be successful in innovating. And this is one final comment I would point out that the Innovation Campus that Brent referenced as being world-class is being completely paid for by tax incentives from the State of Missouri and the City of Kansas City.Our last question will come from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. -- Good afternoon, everybody. And also, let me just say congrats on reaching the Starboard agreement, it's definitely a positive, no matter how you slice it. I think the additional good news really is that the majority of the investment community believes that the opportunity to get to the 22.5% margins by the end of 2020 definitely exists within the company, and nobody is really doubting that. But I think similar to an earlier question, now I think some of the answers are still really just trying to process the evolution of Cerner targeting 30 to 60 bips of margin expansion, not that long ago. And then, just kind of backing off that a little bit but now we're obviously targeting a much larger 400 basis points in a pretty short time period. And I mean this in a good way but in some ways the 22.5% margin target is really almost higher than it needs to be to satisfy investors. I think investors really just looking for more color on how you arrive at that 22.5% as the right margin target for 4Q 2020 during this whole process? -- Sure, this is Marc. I mean we spent time early on with AlixPartners actually to go through at a high level before they start doing their deep dives give us a view of what they thought the opportunities were from an efficiency perspective. And we incorporated that into our thinking, we incorporated the thinking that we have relative to the business and opportunities. And yes, we think 22.5% is a strong stretched target but we have a high level of confidence in our ability to deliver on that target. I think the efficiencies are available, I think we'll be a healthy organization. And we keep in mind, when you look at the -- really, the percent of costs that represents from as a percent of your total revenue, it's not that high of a percentage; so relative to the size of the company we're not doing anything that we expect to be draconian here. So I think we're -- folks certainly in the space of that 22.5% on cost reduction, things we can control; we're not expecting revenue growth to somehow add some basis points to our operating margin.So I think all in that context we did the work to say 'This feels strong, this is what we believe we can do, and this is what we're willing to commit to.' And I think it's a good target. I think it's something that the investors should hold us to and focus on but I don't -- perhaps a smaller target would've been something that people will be OK with. But I think this sends a message to both, investors and our associates that we need to increase the health financially of this company. And so we're very comfortable with the 22.5% target and I think that is our target and we will continue to be marching toward that. We'd love the start we have on it and I think we'll continue to do the work that we need to get there. It's not something that the business can handle, we just have to be doing business more efficiently and better. -- And I would add; as we've taken a number of steps to set ourselves up for this work from the work that was the last year and rolled out in first quarter. So the timing is good, we know we had more to do and it's an ambitious but achievable set of goals. And I think the team is ready to take on and go after it, and that's what we intend to do. -- Okay, I appreciate the extra color. Thanks. -- With that, we thank you all for attending. And we hope you have a good afternoon. Take care. -- Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Take healthcare for example. Two technology outfits in particular have made solving the unique challenges inherent to health sciences a priority:  and . Both have made great headway growing their digital platforms as healthcare, pharmaceutical, and life science companies make more use of each companies' respective services.Though there are similarities between Veeva and Cerner, the two tech businesses have been on different paths the last few years. The future looks bright for both of them, but the reasons for considering each stock are very different.Veeva Systems focuses its attention on pharmaceutical and biotech companies, providing a suite of software and services from clinical data management to safety and quality control. Cloud-based software like what Veeva specializes in has been growing gangbusters the last few years, and there is no exception here. During the 2019 fiscal year (the 12 months ended January 31, 2019), revenue increased 25%, and adjusted earnings per share grew an impressive 70% -- including a massive 88% surge during the . Veeva is still adding lots of new customers, but one of the more impressive metrics is the revenue retention rate. At 122%, the figure shows that Veeva isn't just holding on to customers, but those customers are expanding their use of Veeva's growing lineup of software as time goes on. It's a powerful business model, one that helped gross profit margin on subscription services increase to a whopping 83.2% last year. As impressive as Veeva's results have been, a high rate of growth means the tech company can only be had at a steep price. Trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 93.3, and 12-month forward P/E is 71.4. Those figures are implying another year of double-digit profit growth, but the stock is by no means a bargain. At current prices, the only justification is if an investor believes Veeva has years of robust bottom-line expansion ahead of it. Image source: Getty Images.Cerner is also a provider of health company technology, assisting clinicians with care decisions as well as offering clinical and financial systems for managing day-to-day operations. In 2018, Cerner's revenue and adjusted earnings increased 4% and 3%, respectively. In the first quarter of 2019, revenue and adjusted earnings results improved 8% and 5%, respectively. That pales in comparison to the growth rates Veeva is putting up -- especially on the bottom line -- but Cerner is a much larger business with 2018 revenues totaling $5.37 billion to Veeva's $862 million. However, Cerner has similar profit potential. Gross margin was 82.5% in 2018, and the company recently agreed to  to boost the bottom line in the years ahead. Paired with the optimism surrounding its recent quarterly reports, the agreement has led to a 23% rebound in share price so far in 2019 as of this writing -- a welcome situation after a 22% drop during the 2018 calendar year. However, after it's recent rally, Cerner isn't exactly a bargain either. Its 12-month trailing P/E is 34.4, and forward P/E is currently 24.4. Like Veeva, that implies the next year will deliver a double-digit rise in profits. Cerner's bottom line has been sluggish at best in the recent past, but there's renewed optimism that the health tech company will get things back on track. Veeva is a more profitable business model and is growing at a much faster pace (Veeva's operating margin is 26% to Cerner's 14%). Thus, it trades at a steep premium. Cerner is growing at a much more modest clip, but is the relative value play when compared to Veeva. It also initiated a 1% annual dividend in 2019, and Cerner has agreed to increase its share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion at Starboard Value's suggestion. With a market cap of $20 billion, that's a significant return of capital to shareholders in the next couple of years. Which is the better buy? These two companies are at different stages of their existence, but both stand to benefit as the digital economy continues to expand in the years ahead. However, neither are cheap (when factoring for growth at Veeva and a potential rebound at Cerner). Thus, for investors wanting to bet on tech adoption by the life sciences, I'd preach buying both a little bit at a time in set increments (like monthly or quarterly) and sitting on them for the long haul -- but go in slow and keep those initial buys small.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, the healthcare-technology provider gave investors reasons to smile, including near-record bookings and the initiation of a dividend program. The company also hinted at incremental improvement expected in the first quarter of 2019.Investors were able to find out just how well Cerner performed in the first quarter when the company announced earnings results after the market closed on Thursday. Here are the highlights from Cerner's first-quarter update.Image source: Getty Images.Data Source: Cerner.Three months ago, Cerner predicted that its\u00a0first-quarter revenue would come in between $1.365 billion and $1.415 billion. The company squarely hit the midpoint of that range.\u00a0Cerner's professional-services revenue climbed 11.1% year over year, to $490.4 million. Managed-services revenue growth was even better, jumping 13.5% over the prior-year period, to $304.4 million. Licensed software sales rose 14.6%, to $154.5 million. Subscriptions revenue also increased by 10% year over year, to $84.3 million.However, there were a couple of weak spots in the first quarter. Support and maintenance revenue fell 2.7%, to nearly $277 million. Technology resale revenue also dropped by 12.4%, to $55.5 million.Cerner reported strong operating cash flow in the first quarter of $317.3 million, with  of $123.5 million. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents totaling $503.2 million.Cerner CEO Brent Shafer stated:I am pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we rolled out a refined operating model, which is designed to improve our operating efficiency and speed value creation for our clients. These refinements are foundational to significant improvements in profitably we expect to deliver as part of recently announced operational improvement initiatives.He added, \"Collectively, our operational improvement initiatives, recently announced dividend program, and expanded share repurchase program underscore our commitment to creating value for clients and shareholders.\"Cerner expects second-quarter revenue between $1.41 billion and $1.46 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter are expected to come in between $0.63 and $0.65. The midpoint of that range reflects year-over-year growth of 3.2%.\u00a0The company also reiterated its full-year 2019 revenue guidance of $5.65 billion to $5.85 billion. Cerner upped its 2019 adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $2.64 to $2.72, compared to its previous guidance of adjusted EPS between $2.57 and $2.67.This improved guidance stems, in part, from expected benefits from Cerner's operational-improvement initiatives. The company's expanded share-repurchase program will also help boost its adjusted EPS.One of the best barometers of how Cerner is likely to perform in the near-to-mid term is its level of bookings.

(Symbol: CERN) is the #175 most shorted of the S&P 500 components, based on 4.52 \"days to cover.\"  There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the \"days to cover\" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.  The number of shares short is then divided by the average daily volume, to express the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.  \n\n\n\nIn the case of Cerner Corp. (Symbol: CERN), the total short interest at the 04/15/2019 settlement date was 15,544,168 shares, which compares to the average daily trading volume of just 3,440,444 shares, for a \"days to cover\" ratio of 4.52.  \n\n\nWhen short sellers eventually cover their positions, by definition there must be buying activity because a share that is currently sold short must be purchased to be covered.  At the present levels of short interest, if from this point forward every single CERN share traded represented a short position being closed, then at the average daily volume of 3,440,444 shares it would only be during the 5th trading day that every short position would be closed.  \n\n\nSo it would stand to reason that should some unexpectedly good news come out, and short sellers did not have 5 days of patience but instead wanted to cover their short positions very suddenly, that situation could result in sending the stock higher until the higher price produces enough sellers to generate the necessary volume to close out those positions quickly.\n\n\nCerner Corp. (Symbol: CERN) has something relatively rare for a stock with this much short interest, that being insiders taking the other side of the trade.  Looking back over the trailing six month period, CERN has seen 2 different instances of insider buying, as summarized by the table below:\n\n\n\t\tBelow is a chart showing the \"days to cover\" for CERN over time:\n\n\n   \nAnd looking at the chart below, CERN's low point in its 52 week range is $48.78 per share, with $69.34 as the 52 week high point \u2014 that compares with a last trade of $68.70.\n\n\n   \nIn recent trading, shares of Cerner Corp.

Yet even amid the gloom, some stocks celebrated good news.  (NASDAQ: HA) ,  (NASDAQ: CERN) , and  (NASDAQ: FARO) were among the top performers. Here's why they did so well.Shares of Hawaiian Holdings gained 6.5% after the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines reported key business metrics for the month of March. Passenger counts were down from March 2018's numbers, and load factor sagged slightly. Yet Hawaiian said that it was able to cut its estimates for its operating costs for the first quarter because its freighter operations to Hawaii's neighbor islands have been more efficient than expected.

Cerner said that it had agreed with Starboard Value to allow four of Starboard's chosen representatives join the board of directors, and it said it would devote an additional $1.2 billion toward buying back its stock.

And why not? They should.\u00a0Yeah. I mean, this a Virginia company.\u00a0That's true.\u00a0 People don't know that.\u00a0And let's face it -- when it comes to majors college sports, you're probably going to have a better shot at winning a national title with your law school than your undergraduate alma mater.\u00a0Time will tell! [laughs]\u00a0 [laughs]\u00a0I guess we'll see. We're going to dip into the Fool mailbag. We've got news from the healthcare industry, the packaged foods industry.\u00a0Let's start with this. Get the popcorn ready because on Wednesday, the CEOs of the biggest banks in America are heading to Capitol Hill to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. The rundown is: Jamie Dimon from , Michael Corbat from , David Solomon from , Jim Gorman from , Brian Moynihan from Bank of America; we'll get to \u00a0in a second. Coincidentally -- or maybe not coincidentally -- Bank of America announcing today that the company is raising the minimum wage at the company to $20 an hour. If nothing else, the timing of that announcement makes Wednesday probably a little less painful for Brian Moynihan testifying on Capitol Hill.Yeah, I think so. I don't think there's much coincidence about it. We'll see. It seems like a smart political play at the moment, getting the headlines that they want and positioning. They'll expound on that a bit in front of the camera. I think that it takes some of the wind out of the sails of those that are going to attack at least Bank of America. And I think every everybody is going to be under pressure to respond.\u00a0 In terms of Wells Fargo, at the moment, if someone from Wells Fargo is on the list to testify, I haven't seen it yet. Doesn't mean it's not going to happen. We've still got time before the hearing. But I'm reminded of a conversation I had a couple of years back with Paul Lienert, who's covered the automotive industry for 30-plus years. We have him on  pretty much every year around the North American International Auto Show in January. Talking to Paul about the ripple effect of Automaker X having some sort of large failure, and failure to disclose the failure of whatever the technology is -- whether it's and the emission standards -- and just the ripple effect. If you're any of the other automakers, you're like, [groans]. Because they all pay for it in some small way.\u00a0By the same token, Wells Fargo just continuing to screw up in terms of their own culture; the fake accounts scandal; Tim Sloan, who was there when the scandal happened, not being the right person to try and clean up the mess, and then he is shown the door.\u00a0If you're any of these other CEOs,\u00a0I have to believe in the back of their mind, at some point tomorrow, they want to say, \"Hey, at least we're not Wells Fargo.\" It's one of those things where, yes, it's a Wells Fargo problem, but it really does spread to the other banks.\u00a0Yeah. I think, to the extent they can, they'll probably redirect the questioning toward, \"Oh, well, Wells Fargo. You probably would have enjoyed having them here to kick around.\"\u00a0I was looking up some of the data on what's been paid so far, post-2008, 2009. About $250 billion in fines against the banks. Not all that's cash. Some of that has been settled by loan forgiveness and some other credits. But in terms of, there was a bailout of the banks, true enough. They paid back the money that they were in some cases forced to borrow from the federal government. That was paid back. They have paid fines. And I don't know that that it is a strong thing to say, \"Hey, look, we've already paid a quarter of a trillion combined in fines. Don't act like we haven't already been punished.\" That's not going to get them anywhere.\u00a0But they can talk obliquely, I guess, about having made amends at times.\u00a0 One difference between now and five years ago, eight years ago, that sort of thing, is you can make a pretty strong case that big banks are no longer No. 1 on Capitol Hill's enemy list in terms of the business world. I think big tech has probably supplanted them. So, for any CEO who wants to trot out their, \"Hey, at least we're not Wells Fargo,\" they could just as easily say, \"By the way, we're also not .\"\u00a0\u00a0I don't know that's going to go anywhere, either. They've got to accentuate the positive part of the story. This $20 minimum pay, which Moynihan has said, \"Look, anybody who works here is going to be making at least $41,000 a year,\" that sounds pretty good if you're thinking in terms of a minimum wage job, of which there are essentially none in a bank, right? You've got bank tellers. To the degree that that's a major part of the employment of banks, I don't know how much that's the case. But you don't have a lot of employees at any of these banks who are thinking of, \"What are the other minimum wage jobs that I would be comparing this against?\"But I think it is a positive. They're pointing to it in part as something that they are doing. They're connecting the dots between the tax cut and passing on some of the profits that they're sitting on from the massive tax cut. That will get them some of the way. Maybe one half of the aisle, one side of the aisle, will allow them to talk about that. The other half, probably less so.\u00a0Like I said, get the popcorn ready.\u00a0Let's move on to Cerner Corp., which is a healthcare technology firm. Cerner has reached an agreement with Starboard Value, well known activist investors, to add four members to the board of directors. Cerner is also buying back $1.2 billion worth of stock.\u00a0Which of these two things is pushing shares of Cerner up 10% today? Based on the fact that shares of Cerner have treaded water over the last five years or so, I'm assuming it's the board seats.\u00a0I think, yeah. Swimming along in the line that Starboard is recommending, it's remarkable, Starboard really doesn't have that much of Cerner. I read about 1% of Cerner's stock.

Whether that gets follow-through or not, we'll see. But, I think the board seats. It's all part of the equation. I don't know how you can separate a 12% move when it opened, and now it's maybe 8% or 9%, what part of that is ascribed to what part of this whole package.I'm not looking to knock Starboard Value. But I am curious about something that you just said, which is that Starboard Value only has a 1% of Cerner's stock? How are they getting four seats on the board if they only have 1% of the stock?

But if they have plenty of people on their Rolodex and know where to push the buttons and organize the votes at proxy time, then that's a different story.\u00a0Yeah, I was going to say -- if, in fact, it's only 1%, that opens up a whole world of opportunity for activist investors, potentially.Our email address is . Question from Deng, who's writing from China. Deng writes, \"I've been listening to since I started investing in stocks in 2014.\u00a0Lately I've been looking at some large-cap stocks which may not grow that fast.\" He cites his examples: , General Motors and some airline stocks. He goes on to write, \"I'm considering their P/E values, which are below 10, making them cheaper than the market average. Are they a bargain? Or are they potential traps?\"Oh, the age-old question, Deng: value play or value trap? That is always the thing that sucks in... I was going to say value investors, but really, a lot of investors. There are growth investors who see a stock get knocked down 20% in one day and immediately start thinking, \"It's on sale 20%. Maybe I should be jumping in here.\"How do you help people think about solving this question? We're talking about more than one stock here. We're not going to go through all of these. But, what do you look for, once you've made that initial calculation of, \"OK, here's a large-cap. It's not going away.\" Sometimes we're looking at large companies that are paying a dividend, so there's some reason to buy them. Maybe the businesses isn't setting the world on fire, but you've done the math, and you say, \"Look, from a P/E standpoint, this is significantly cheaper than the overall market. Why shouldn't I buy a few shares?\"Yeah, it's a good question. I'm looking at data that right now, in comparison to its forward earnings. GE, for instance, is at 5.8 times forward earnings. And boy, that sounds cheap. That is cheap.\u00a0Over the last five years, the average is 6.2.\u00a0 For the market? For GE. So, it's maybe 5% cheaper than its five-year average, in comparison to the forward earnings expectations. Why is it so cheap? One, the forward earnings tend to be overly optimistic, not only for GE, but for everybody at this time of the year. You've only got one quarter, not even yet reported. So there is the typical enthusiasm about the year ahead. As the year goes down, and companies report, they say, \"Well, we're not going to earn quite as much as we thought we would, or you thought we would.\"Additionally, just it's a highly cyclical industry, autos. Auto sales have begun to level in decline. That is the way cycles work. You're looking at pretty good rear view earnings for GE. It's just that highly cyclical stocks don't carry big multiples. When they have good earnings, it seems really cheap. I can go back to 2016 and find that the company was trading at 4X earnings. Then, after last year, had a little bit of a decline. Is this GE, or General Motors? General Motors. OK. Wow! Have I been saying GE this whole time? Yes, you've been saying GE this whole time. Well, that's pretty cyclical too... [laughs]\u00a0No, no! General Motors, GM.\u00a0I was like, \"How is GE... \"\u00a0Dan, can we just filter all that out? Is there some sort of AI programming that can solve all of my misstatements? [laughs]\u00a0If there was an AI program, believe me, the AI program would be sitting in that chair right now. We'll put a little note in the in the description of the podcast, and hopefully people will read that. That makes a lot more sense to me, that you've been talking about General Motors this whole time. It makes sense that I would be misstating things for minutes.\u00a0Yeah. Kroger is fairly similar. The\u00a0major grocers, they're not growing very much. In fact, they're under some increased pressure from / Whole Foods. So they're not really expected to compound earnings, particularly. People aren't going to be eating more next year than they are this year. You're really looking at sort of population growth as the driver of what they can do, other than acquiring other grocery chains, and that doesn't look like the greatest use of capital at the moment, either.\u00a0Kroger is trading at 0.16 times sales. Of course, there's very, very, very low margins\u00a0for grocers. And that's quite a bit less than the five-year average of 0.26. On a valuation basis, I'm a little bit more attracted by that. But I'm not really so attracted at what the next five years look like for Kroger.\u00a0Well, I think it's a great point that -- again, the question is, \"I'm looking at these stocks and their PE relative to the market.\" I think the point you made at the beginning, before you started confusing GE and GM, was, \"Don't just look at that! It's a good point of comparison, but you also want to look at, what is the PE of this stock or relative to what it has been?\" Compare the valuation to itself. As you said, in the case of General Motors, yes, it's cheap relative to the market, but relative to what it has been over the last couple of years, it's not like it's trading at some amazing discount to what it has been.\u00a0Yeah, you want to compare it to its own history and\u00a0to its sector, to its closest competitors. In that case, you normally learn fairly quickly whether there's something company-specific or whether it's a broader application to the industry.  right now is trading at 7 times earnings. A little bit more expensive, but not meaningfully so. Speaking of large caps, there's a story from last week that we did not get to\u00a0about . Kellogg is getting out of the cookie business so it can focus on breakfast cereal and snacks. Kellogg is selling its Keebler cookie brands and Famous Amos to Ferrero for $1.3 billion. Ferrero, the parent company of Nutella and Tic-Tacs, two tasty things that don't necessarily taste great together.\u00a0This seems like a good move for Kellogg. You look at the cookie brands that they had, they were doing less than $1 billion in sales and driving not a lot of money in terms of operating profit. It seems like, even though the breakfast cereal industry has its challenges, I think if I'm a Kellogg shareholder, I'm generally happy about this move.I mean, I don't know how much it was distracting them from focusing on cereals. If it was, then it's a good move to get rid of it. I mean, Keebler cookies, it kind of runs on its own. You get some synergies from just taking up more shelf space in the grocery store. That allows you some economies of scale. But maybe it wasn't in this case. Maybe the logistics of getting the cookies into the same place that the breakfast cereals were going was not achieving any economies of scale. I don't know. I think consumers won't notice any difference, ultimately. No, they definitely won't. Look, Kellogg's been trying to sell these for at least since the end of last year. This was something that they were able to execute. Maybe they didn't get the price that they wanted, but they were clearly looking to streamline. Good for them. Like you said, consumers aren't going to be able to tell the difference. I'm sure, for all of the jokes I make at the expense of , they're really crushing it in the cookie business. I'm sure part of the thesis for Kellogg was, \"Look, we don't need to keep doing this.\"\"We can't compete with 70 flavors of Oreos.\" \"We can't, and we're not going to anymore. We're going to let that be someone else's problem. Now, we'd like to introduce you to 70 flavors of Pop Tarts. Let's talk about that!\" And that's working for Kellogg.\u00a0Yeah. There are quite a few flavors of Pop-Tarts popping up, but it's not quite as trendy as the Oreos. They don't have the flavor of the day kind of thing that Oreo seems to. They don't. The thing about Oreos that has not broken through for Pop Tarts is the brand marketing\u00a0alliances that you see. The most recent one for Oreos is the  inspired Oreo cookies, with the final season of  getting ready to start. I guarantee you, the HBO marketing people were not going to Kellogg saying, \"Look, we have an idea. It's a  breakfast cereal and  Pop Tarts.\" No. That's an easy one. That's a layup.\u00a0Who would not want dragon-flavored Oreos?\u00a0 What does that taste like? I think they're just going with straight-up chocolate.\u00a0 What's that got to do with ?\u00a0\u200b I don't know!It's like they haven't been watching the show at all.\u00a0I don't think these are dragon-flavored.\u00a0 Well, that's just a missed opportunity. You would have thought Oreos would have been on top of that one.\u00a0Well, there's a  fan at my house, so I think I'm going to have to pick up a box of one of these things. For all of my railing against Mondelez... You're going to fall for it, huh?\u00a0I mean, if I can momentarily buy one of my kids' love for a few bucks? Yeah, sure! I'll do that! I have no problem doing that! Don't tell me you haven't done that before! Most parents have done that.\u00a0 Oh, yeah!\u00a0\"Here's a little thing. I'll spend a couple of bucks. My kid will be happy. That'll be that.\"\u00a0It's just Oreos.\u00a0 Right. It's not wasted money. Right. They're going to get eaten, might as well benefit from it.\u00a0You can read more from Bill Barker and his colleagues -- maybe in the next issue of , their free monthly newsletter at MFAM Funds, maybe they're going to write about GE.

Welcome to  , the show that dives into a different sector of the stock market every single day. Today is Wednesday, April 3. I'm your host, Shannon Jones. I am joined via Skype by healthcare tech guru Brian Feroldi. Brian, so excited to have you back on  , especially for today's topic. Yeah, I think we have a great one today. It's awesome to be here! Thanks, Shannon! Let's dive right in! Today's show is all about healthcare tech. We decided to do a crossover episode talking about some of the top healthcare tech stocks out there. Brian's got an awesome list of five stocks that we want to dive into.Let's kick things off, Brian! The first is a SaaS company really designed to be an end-to-end service provider for the life sciences industry, all the way from clinical development to commercialization. That company is Veeva Systems, ticker VEEV. Brian, what can you tell us about this company specifically? Veeva Systems is a CRM company -- that stands for customer relationship management -- that was actually founded by a former employee of  , which is the original software-as-a-service company. The founder realized that the off-the-shelf CRM tools didn't really fit the life sciences industry that well because of all the unique needs of the industry -- specifically regards to the clinical development process and the regulatory approval process. That means that life sciences companies like biopharmas, biotechs, and medical devices have a different set of needs. So he founded Veeva to take advantage of that specific market niche.Now, the company offers a few products. Its two most popular are called Commercial Cloud, which is first and foremost a CRM system that helps pharma and biotechs with things like marketing and sales management. Their second product is called Veeva Vault, which helps them with documentation, data storage, clinical trial management, and data capture. Those two products have just been enormous hits within the life sciences industry. These two products are just used by dozens of the world's top biopharma companies. They now have hundreds of customers. Veeva Systems is one of those companies where they've had such a targeted, narrow focus on serving the life sciences industry that it's really worked out very well for them. But Veeva Systems isn't necessarily stopping with life sciences companies, either. Is that right, Brian? Yeah, that's correct. They've basically saturated their core market, so their management said a few years ago: \"How can we take our areas of expertise and apply them to other companies? What other industries could benefit from our unique focus?\" What came to mind for them was chemical makers, consumer packaged goods companies, and cosmetics companies. That makes sense because these are all regulated industries that already have to deal with the FDA on their own. Since that was Veeva's area of expertise, they created a product called Vault QualityOne, which is designed to help industries outside of the life sciences with many of the things that Veeva specializes in. While it's still early days, we've seen them already land a number of big-name clients, and they're already having success. From a valuation perspective, this is a stock that not honestly looks a little pricey. Probably not too surprising, though, for any sort of tech company. But you're talking about 87X trailing earnings, 57X forward earnings. What does Veeva look like from a fundamental perspective, Brian? I think the key thing that you just said was earnings. This is a SaaS company that is already profitable. They are cash flow positive, they have over $1 billion in cash, no debt, and they have just grown like crazy over the last five years that they've really captured more and more of their core market. But they're now at the point where they are producing profits on the bottom line and operating leverage is kicking in, so those profits are even growing faster than earnings. So this is an expensive company, there's no doubt about it. They do trade at a premium. However, so far, investors who have bought in even with the high valuation have been very rewarded because their growth has been so phenomenal. This is a high-price stock, but it's so high quality that it just might be worth it. A lot to like there. Lots of growth opportunities, especially as they branch out. Let's dive into our second stock. The next one on the list is one designed to help individuals pay for healthcare expenses both now and in the future. That company is HealthEquity, ticker HQY.Brian, probably no surprise that this is another Fool favorite. You even had the chance to interview the CEO at one point. What makes HealthEquity so special, and why does it stand out among the crowd? HealthEquity is a hybrid tech/financial/ health company all mixed in one. What they do is, they are a provider of health savings accounts, which are triple tax advantaged accounts that are only available to people with very high deductible healthcare plans. I'm sure listeners are painfully aware that in the United States, health insurance premiums have just been skyrocketing for decades. Employers are desperate to find any way that they can to help fight back. One option that's available to them is to offer a high-deductible health plan which has a thousand- or multi-thousand-dollar deductible that kicks in that must be paid for by the individual before their insurance will start to cover anything. People that sign up for high-deductible health plans then get access to a health savings account, which is just the best retirement account that I've ever heard of. Money goes in pre-tax, it grows tax free, and as long as it's used on qualified medical expenses, there's no tax to pay it out. They're just a no-brainer choice for anybody that has a high deductible health plan.HealthEquity is a company that administers the accounts. They take in the assets, they can help talk with patients on ways to save money, to shop around. They have just been growing like crazy, given the huge surge in the demand for high-deductible health plans and health savings accounts. I think investing your HSA is a pretty remarkable concept in and of itself. On the platform for HealthEquity, you can basically have your own self-directed account to invest in mutual funds, even in real estate. They've got a high-yield REIT equity that you can actually add to your account there. Your own investments, or you can even allow HealthEquity to make these investments on your behalf. But I love the fact that you have the opportunity to not only save, but actually invest that money. Obviously, for HealthEquity, this means a recurring stream of revenue for them on the fees related to what's being held in those accounts. But that's not the only revenue stream, right? They've got multiple revenue streams. Yeah, that's one of the things that really attracts me to this company. This company actually has four sources of recurring revenue. When an employer offers their services to their employees, HealthEquity takes a monthly subscription fee. When an employee puts funds into a HealthEquity account, they get a monthly custodial fee. And whenever a payment is made from that account, HealthEquity gets an interchange fee. Those are the three primary ones right now, but they are just now starting to get into the investment business, where you can take your HSA assets and invest them in the market. They have partnerships in place with companies like  to help them do that. That is a fourth stool of recurring revenue that this company is pulling in. When you combine all those together with the general demand, the huge increases in membership, this company's financial statements are just sparkling. I mean, they've been putting up 20%-plus revenue growth for years. They've already achieved profitability. They're pumping out cash flow. Because of that, they have an amazing balance sheet: $360 million in cash, zero debt. Wall Street believes that this company will still be growing its revenue and profits at a double-digit rate for the next five years. HSAs were actually a little bit slow to take on when they were enacted into law back in 2003, but they're really starting to increase in popularity. I think you've got a very long-term growth opportunity here for a lot of patients that are looking for ways to set aside money for healthcare expenses. Not only that, they've got 4 million members, assets over $8 billion, and they're still growing! A lot to like about this company! One I'm actually digging into a little bit more myself personally.But let's keep it going. Let's talk about the next stock on Brian's list, a stock that's probably the most easily recognizable for many of our listeners and for many Fools out there. That's Teladoc, ticker TDOC. Brian, give us a brief overview for maybe some of our listeners who don't know what Teladoc does. Tell us what they do. Teladoc is a leading provider of telemedicine. What's that? Telemedicine is when you have a video conference that connects a consumer with a medical professional. What kind of specialties can they use over the phone? Well, you can talk with a dermatologist, a behavioral health specialist, you can get a lot of primary care needs done directly over the phone by a simple video conference.These guys are the leader in the industry. They have the biggest network of both doctors and patients. They partner with insurers to get their services covered. The real win here for using telemedicine is that, not only is it super convenient for the patient because they can do it in their own home, they don't have to drive somewhere, they don't have to wait in line, they just put \"conference me in\" and get a doctor live on their phone -- it's also a huge cost savings to the industry. The charge rate for a telemedicine visit is far less than an actual office visit. It's a win for the patient and it's a win for the healthcare industry in general.Teladoc has become a leader because it was a first mover, but also because it's been very acquisitive. This company regularly makes acquisitions to grow and be the top dog. They just acquired a company in France, the leading provider of telemedicine in France, a couple of weeks ago. The reason that they're doing that is because they know that this is a natural winner-take-most market. Patients want to be on the platform that has the most doctors, the most specialties available at any given time; and insurers want to provide it with the biggest network as well. It's a double-sided network effect that naturally benefits the leading provider, and right now, that's Teladoc. Around 40% of the largest companies in the world actually use Teladoc to provide this virtual healthcare service to employees. Over 35 of the biggest health plans in the U.S. have partnered with Teladoc, and more than 290 hospitals and health systems have teamed up with this virtual healthcare provider as well.But this stock has had quite a bumpy ride, to say the least, Brian, particularly in the last quarter of 2018. Teladoc was basically the aim of a short-seller attack. What can you tell us about that? Has that changed your investing thesis at all of this company? That's not surprising to me at all. This is a company that is growing extremely fast. Last quarter, they grew sales by 59%. They're very acquisitive, so that can muck up their financial statements. And, they're not yet making money. They're not profitable on the bottom line yet. When you combine those things together, this is a stock that will naturally attract short-sellers. I think it's actually over a third of the shares outstanding have been sold short. That makes this company a great target for shor  s. Whenever those come out, investors should read through them and see if they are thesis-changing in any way. But more often than not, there's more smoke than there is fire and I think that's what happened to Teladoc in the fourth quarter. OK, so it hasn't changed your mind at all about Teladoc. I think that's fair, I totally agree. In terms of valuation, right now trading at about 9.5X sales. What are your thoughts about that? Yeah, this company is expensive. There's no doubt about it. But when they are a leader in a rapidly growing industry, that premium valuation makes sense, especially in today's market, where almost everything is expensive. This is one of the more risky stocks that we have on our list because it is not yet profitable and it's growing so rapidly, but there is an argument to be made that they are the top dog and their growth runway is just so enormous. Over time, you could easily see them adding on more specialties, more doctors, having more services being able to be done through telemedicine, as well as more patients warming up to the concept, given the cost savings and the conveniences. If you buy those things, and you think the telemedicine industry is poised for huge growth, then buying today even at a very rich multiple could still result in multibagger returns. Totally agree. Patients love it for the convenience, payers love it for the lower cost and are looking for ways to integrate telehealth more into their plans. I think it's really a win-win for all here with Teladoc.Alright, next stock is Medidata Solutions, ticker MDSO. Brian, I've got a soft spot in my heart for any company that can make the clinical trial process more efficient, both from a time and a cost perspective, especially for a lot of the smaller biotech companies that we follow and talk about. This company in particular grabbed my attention. Brian, how exactly is Medidata Solutions making this process easier for companies like that? Medidata is a provider of cloud-based software that basically handles anything to do with the clinical trial process. Their software can help review things like trial design, planning, execution, management of the trial, as well as the reporting. Their software really helps companies to get the trial design right the first time, to minimize the chance of changes being made down the road. Now, that is hugely valuable to pharma and medical device companies. Changes to the trial design not only can be hugely expensive, but they can also add a lot of time on to the trial down the road. So, getting the trial right the first time, and making the clinical process as efficient as possible, is hugely valuable. Because of that, Medidata Solutions have become very popular. They're used by basically all the big-name companies out there. This company says that 13 of the top 15 drugs sold worldwide in 2017 were developed using Medidata's technology. You mentioned all the big names. You're talking about  ,  ,  ,  , just to name a few of the larger biopharma players. But they've got more than 1,000 customers. I had a chance to actually check out a demo of their product. What was so fascinating to me is, this is really an out-of-the-box solution, which comes in extremely handy for a lot of these smaller biotech that really need to be able to organize and really store all of this data in one place. You want to store it, you want to analyze it, you want to be able to access it. But even in terms of just running a trial, patients can literally go on to their platform. It's a cloud-based platform. They can learn about this study, they can sign informed consent, they can fill out their medical history, demographic information, they can even update throughout their trial how they're feeling. A lot of those more subjective things that a lot of these clinical trials track can all be housed here. If you're a trial administrator, you're also able to see all that patient data right at your fingertips. It can sort patients based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, even randomize patients into their respective trial arms, all at your fingertips. This can all happen with an iPad, with a laptop, all in one place. Pretty remarkable, what they've been able to do.What does that translate into with top and bottom line growth for Medidata? As you just espoused on the benefits of using Medidata, you can understand why the appeal of using their software is so high for so many pharma companies out there. In turn, since they're selling their software through the cloud, the company's financial statements are spectacular. Talking about double-digit revenue growth. The company is big enough to start producing both net income and free cash flow. Their balance sheet is cash-heavy. Overall, it's a very solid, very sticky business.Having said that, of course, when you have all those traits in one, like many of the companies we're talking about, this is a pricey stock. It trades at 90X trailing earnings, and about 36X forward earnings. One of the things to note with this company is that they don't seem to have an encore opportunity just yet. They are still basically focused squarely on the clinical trial. They are actually a competitor with Veeva Systems. Their growth rates going forward might be much slower than they have been historically. But overall, I think this is a very solid business. Great! Let's go into our last stock. That is one that we've probably all encountered or interacted with in one way or another without ever actually knowing that you did. That company is Cerner, ticker CERN. This caters predominantly to hospitals and healthcare providers. Brian, what exactly does this company do? Cerner is the largest provider of IT solutions to the healthcare industry in the U.S., period. What they're best known for is their electronic health record platform, which makes it easy for hospitals and providers to pull down patient data, record information, and share it with other hospitals and providers that are also on Cerner's system. That's a Trojan horse, if you will, that the company then uses to upsell them to other services. They also offer things like operational improvements, they can also handle billing. Cerner is a huge IT tech provider that provides a range of services. EHR, electronic health records, adoption of them has grown very quickly over the last decade. We all know that when you go to a doctor's office, filling out a paper chart is horrendously inefficient. Getting that information on to electronics so that it can be easily shared is a no-brainer, but the industry was very reluctant to make the change given the pain involved with that. But Cerner is helping them to do that. And well-positioned for that pain point, not just going to the doctor and having to fill out all this information; but then, when you get referred to a specialist and you have to fill out the same exact information, knowing that this is data that could have easily been just sent over, integrated into their system as well. Cerner, definitely on the leading edge of that.The other thing I like about this company is, it sounds like a relatively steady business in and of itself, but I think with electronic health records, one opportunity that really hasn't been exploited as much is the opportunity in improving overall health outcomes and reducing cost. Obviously, these records contain massive amounts of data. Now's the time to actually start using that data to really inform treatment decisions, give doctors the tools to make the best treatment decision for that patient. I think that's something that we really just haven't seen just yet. But with all the data that they do have, I could easily see AI being incorporated into the system to exploit some of those opportunities and move it away from just being seen as a data warehouse, and really driving treatment paradigms, as well.You mentioned, of course, the upselling opportunities. You're looking at things like operational efficiency for a lot of these major healthcare systems. Even for billing, too, which is its own cumbersome process as well. Basically 70 of the world's largest healthcare systems are using their technology. It's the main provider for about 25% of acute care hospitals in the U.S., and boasts the largest international exposure compared to a lot of its competitors. Again, a lot to like with this company. How is it looking in terms of financials, though? Cerner makes the most of its money through software support and maintenance contracts. That makes its top line very predictable, especially given their huge industry presence. The company is profitable. It is cash flow positive. It does have a net cash on its balance sheet. Unlike many of the companies that we talked about today, this trades at a much more modest valuation because it is such a mature business that its growth rate is much slower. It's trading at about 30X trailing earnings, 20X forward earnings. That's roughly a market multiple. On the sales and earnings growth side, this is a slower-growing business. The market just expects single-digit sales growth going forward. But offsetting that is its much lower valuation and dominant industry position. Those two factors, I think when you combine, could make this a good choice for investors with a lower risk tolerance. And, they just initiated a quarterly dividend, about $0.015, expected to start in Q3 of this year. At its current stock price right now, you're looking at about 1% annual dividend yield on that. Not bad, especially when you're talking about healthcare and tech, to have that dividend tacked on as well.Brian, we've gone through five stocks. Of those five, though, what would you say would be your top picks? My two favorites from the list we talked about today are probably Veeva Systems and HealthEquity. I like that both of these companies are still in the rapid growth phase. I like that they're both profitable and that their revenue is recurring. I like the culture of the business. I like that their founders are still involved. Those two are probably my favorites.I also think there's an argument for Teladoc. Telemedicine, I believe, is going to be a much bigger industry in time. Although it is more speculative, more risky than the other ones we talked about, I think there's an argument for Teladoc.For me, I think Medidata is a great business, but it's just growing a little bit too slowly to justify its valuation. And Cerner is a steady-eddy giant, but I'm a growth-focused investor personally, so it doesn't wet my whistle. But I could easily see it being an attractive stock for more value-conscious investors. Have to agree with you there, especially HealthEquity. Even really liking Teladoc. To your point, it has a large growth runway ahead of it. I think telehealth is really going to be the treatment option of choice for most people, especially managing chronic conditions.But all in all, these are five great companies. Whether you're an aggressive investor looking for growth or even more conservative, I think we've run the gamut and given everyone some options today to think about adding to your portfolio.With that, Brian, thank you so much for stopping by and hanging out with me today on today's show!

That's right -- they\u00a0think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0to learn about these picks!\u00a0Welcome to , the show that dives into a different sector of the stock market every single day. Today is Wednesday, April 3. I'm your host, Shannon Jones. I am joined via Skype by healthcare tech guru Brian Feroldi. Brian, so excited to have you back on , especially for today's topic.\u00a0Yeah, I think we have a great one today. It's awesome to be here! Thanks, Shannon! Let's dive right in! Today's show is all about healthcare tech. We decided to do a crossover episode talking about some of the top healthcare tech stocks out there. Brian's got an awesome list of five stocks that we want to dive into.Let's kick things off, Brian! The first is a SaaS company really designed to be an end-to-end service provider for the life sciences industry, all the way from clinical development to commercialization. That company is Veeva Systems, ticker VEEV. Brian, what can you tell us about this company specifically?\u00a0Veeva Systems is a CRM company -- that stands for customer relationship management -- that was actually founded by a former employee of , which is the original software-as-a-service company. The founder realized that the off-the-shelf CRM tools didn't really fit the life sciences industry that well because of all the unique needs of the industry -- specifically regards to the clinical development process and the regulatory approval process. That means that life sciences companies like biopharmas, biotechs, and\u00a0medical devices have a different set of needs. So he founded Veeva to take advantage of that specific market niche.\u00a0Now, the company offers a few products. Its two most popular are called Commercial Cloud, which is first and foremost a CRM system that helps pharma and biotechs with things like marketing and sales management. Their second product is called Veeva Vault, which helps them with documentation, data storage, clinical trial management, and data capture. Those two products have just been enormous hits within the life sciences industry. These two products are just used by dozens of the world's top biopharma companies. They now have hundreds of customers.\u00a0Veeva Systems is one of those companies where they've had such a targeted, narrow focus on serving the life sciences industry that it's really worked out very well for them. But Veeva Systems isn't necessarily stopping with life sciences companies, either. Is that right, Brian?\u00a0Yeah, that's correct. They've basically saturated their core market, so their management said a few years ago: \"How can we take our areas of expertise and apply them to other companies? What other industries could benefit from our unique focus?\" What came to mind for them was chemical makers, consumer packaged goods companies, and cosmetics companies. That makes sense because these are all regulated industries that already have to deal with the FDA on their own. Since that was Veeva's area of expertise, they created a product called Vault QualityOne, which is designed to help industries outside of the life sciences with many of the things that Veeva specializes in. While it's still early days, we've seen them already land a number of big-name clients, and they're already having success.\u00a0From a valuation perspective, this is a stock that not honestly looks a little pricey. Probably not too surprising, though, for any sort of tech company. But you're talking about 87X trailing earnings, 57X forward earnings. What does Veeva look like from a fundamental perspective, Brian?I think the key thing that you just said was earnings. This is a SaaS company that is already profitable. They are cash flow positive, they have over $1 billion in cash, no debt, and they have just grown like crazy over the last five years that they've really captured more and more of their core market. But they're now at the point where they are producing profits on the bottom line and operating leverage is kicking in, so those profits are even growing faster than earnings. So this is an expensive company, there's no doubt about it. They do trade at a premium. However, so far, investors who have bought in even with the high valuation have been very rewarded because their growth has been so phenomenal. This is a high-price stock, but it's so high quality that it just might be worth it.\u00a0A lot to like there. Lots of growth opportunities, especially as they branch out. Let's dive into our second stock. The next one on the list is one designed to help individuals pay for healthcare expenses both now and in the future. That company is HealthEquity, ticker HQY.\u00a0Brian, probably no surprise that this is another Fool favorite. You even had the chance to interview the CEO at one point. What makes HealthEquity so special, and why does it stand out among the crowd?\u00a0 HealthEquity is a hybrid tech/financial/ health company all mixed in one. What they do is, they are a provider of health savings accounts, which are triple tax advantaged accounts that are only available to people with very high deductible healthcare plans. I'm sure listeners are painfully aware that in the United States, health insurance premiums have just been skyrocketing for decades. Employers are desperate to find any way that they can to help fight back. One option that's available to them is to offer a high-deductible health plan which has a thousand- or multi-thousand-dollar deductible that kicks in that must be paid for by the individual before their insurance will start to cover anything. People that sign up for high-deductible health plans then get access to a health savings account, which is just the best retirement account that I've ever heard of. Money goes in pre-tax, it grows tax free, and as long as it's used on qualified medical expenses, there's no tax to pay it out. They're just a no-brainer choice for anybody that has a high deductible health plan.\u00a0HealthEquity is a company that administers the accounts. They take in the assets, they can help talk with patients on ways to save money, to shop around. They have just been growing like crazy, given the huge surge in the demand for high-deductible health plans and health savings accounts.\u00a0I think investing your HSA is a pretty remarkable concept in and of itself. On the platform for HealthEquity, you can basically have your own self-directed account to invest in mutual funds, even in real estate. They've got a high-yield REIT equity that you can actually add to your account there.\u00a0Your own investments, or you can even allow HealthEquity to make these investments on your behalf. But I love the fact that you have the opportunity to not only save, but actually invest that money. Obviously, for HealthEquity, this means a recurring stream of revenue for them on the fees related to what's being held in those accounts. But that's not the only revenue stream, right? They've got multiple revenue streams.\u00a0Yeah, that's one of the things that really attracts me to this company. This company actually has four sources of recurring revenue. When an employer offers their services to their employees, HealthEquity takes a monthly subscription fee. When an employee puts funds into a HealthEquity account, they get a monthly custodial fee. And whenever a payment is made from that account, HealthEquity gets an interchange fee. Those are the three primary ones right now, but they are just now starting to get into the investment business, where you can take your HSA assets and invest\u00a0them in the market. They have partnerships in place with companies like to help them do that. That is a fourth stool of recurring revenue that this company is pulling in. When you combine all those together with the general demand, the huge increases in membership, this company's financial statements are just sparkling. I mean, they've been putting up 20%-plus revenue growth for years. They've already achieved profitability. They're pumping out cash flow. Because of that, they have an amazing balance sheet: $360 million in cash, zero debt. Wall Street believes that this company will still be growing its revenue and profits at a double-digit rate for the next five years.\u00a0 HSAs were actually a little bit slow to take on when they were enacted into law back in 2003, but they're really starting to increase in popularity. I think you've got a very long-term growth opportunity here for a lot of patients that are looking for ways to set aside money for healthcare expenses. Not only that, they've got\u00a04 million members, assets over $8 billion, and they're still growing! A lot to like about this company! One I'm actually digging into a little bit more myself personally.But let's keep it going. Let's talk about the next stock on Brian's list, a stock that's probably the most easily recognizable for many of our listeners and for many Fools out there. That's Teladoc, ticker TDOC. Brian, give us a brief overview for maybe some of our listeners who don't know what Teladoc does. Tell us what they do.Teladoc is a leading provider of telemedicine. What's that? Telemedicine is when you have a video conference that connects a consumer with a medical professional. What kind of specialties can they use over the phone? Well, you can talk with a dermatologist, a behavioral health specialist, you can get a lot of primary care needs done directly over the phone by a simple video conference.\u00a0These guys are the leader in the industry. They have the biggest network of both doctors and patients. They partner with insurers to get their services covered. The real win here for using telemedicine is that, not only is it super convenient for the patient because they can do it in their own home, they don't have to drive somewhere, they don't have to wait in line, they just put \"conference me in\" and get a doctor live on their phone -- it's also a huge cost savings to the industry. The charge rate for a telemedicine visit is far less than an actual office visit. It's a win for the patient and it's a win for the healthcare industry in general.\u00a0Teladoc has become a leader because it was a first mover, but also because it's been very acquisitive. This company regularly makes acquisitions to grow and be the top dog. They just acquired a company in France, the leading provider of telemedicine in France, a couple of weeks ago. The reason that they're doing that is because they know that this is a natural winner-take-most market. Patients want to be on the platform that has the most doctors, the most specialties available at any given time; and insurers want to provide it with the biggest network as well. It's a double-sided network effect that naturally benefits the leading provider, and right now, that's Teladoc. Around 40% of the largest companies in the world actually use Teladoc to provide this virtual healthcare service to employees. Over 35 of the biggest health plans in the U.S. have partnered with Teladoc, and more than 290 hospitals and health systems have teamed up with this virtual healthcare provider as well.\u00a0But this stock has had quite a bumpy ride, to say the least, Brian, particularly in the last quarter of 2018. Teladoc was basically the aim of a short-seller attack. What can you tell us about that? Has that changed your investing thesis at all of this company?\u00a0 That's not surprising to me at all. This is a company that is growing extremely fast. Last quarter, they grew sales by 59%. They're very acquisitive, so that can muck up their financial statements. And, they're not yet making money. They're not profitable on the bottom line yet. When you combine those things together, this is a stock that will naturally attract short-sellers. I think it's actually over a third of the shares outstanding have been sold short. That makes this company a great target for short reports. Whenever those come out, investors should read through them and see if they are thesis-changing in any way. But more often than not, there's more smoke than there is fire and I think that's what happened to Teladoc in the fourth quarter.\u00a0 OK, so it hasn't changed your mind at all about Teladoc. I think that's fair, I totally agree. In terms of valuation, right now trading at about 9.5X sales. What are your thoughts about that?\u00a0 Yeah, this company is expensive. There's no doubt about it. But when they are a leader in a rapidly growing industry, that premium valuation makes sense, especially in today's market, where almost everything is expensive. This is one of the more risky stocks that we have on our list because it is not yet profitable and it's growing so rapidly, but there is an argument to be made that they are the top dog and their growth runway is just so enormous. Over time, you could easily see them adding on more specialties, more doctors, having more services being able to be done through telemedicine, as well as more patients warming up to the concept, given the cost savings and the conveniences. If you buy those things, and you think the telemedicine industry is poised for huge growth, then buying today even at a very rich multiple could still result in multibagger returns.\u00a0Totally agree. Patients love it for the convenience, payers love it for the lower cost and are looking for ways to integrate telehealth more into their plans. I think it's really a win-win for all here with Teladoc.\u00a0Alright, next stock is Medidata Solutions, ticker MDSO. Brian, I've got a soft spot in my heart for any company that can make the clinical trial process more efficient, both from a time and a cost perspective, especially for a lot of the smaller biotech companies that we follow and talk about. This company in particular grabbed my attention. Brian, how exactly is Medidata Solutions making this process easier for companies like that?Medidata is a provider of cloud-based software that basically handles anything to do with the clinical trial process. Their software can help review things like trial design, planning, execution, management of the trial, as well as the reporting. Their software really helps companies to get the trial design right the first time, to minimize the chance of changes being made down the road. Now, that is hugely valuable to pharma and medical device companies. Changes to the trial design not only can be hugely expensive, but they can also add a lot of time on to the trial down the road. So, getting the trial right the first time, and making the clinical process as efficient as possible, is hugely valuable. Because of that, Medidata Solutions have become very popular. They're used by basically all the big-name companies out there. This company says that 13 of the top 15 drugs sold worldwide in 2017 were developed using Medidata's technology. You mentioned all the big names. You're talking about , , , , just to name a few of the larger biopharma players. But they've got more than 1,000 customers. I had a chance to actually check out a demo of their product. What was so fascinating to me is, this is really an out-of-the-box solution, which comes in extremely handy for a lot of these smaller biotech that really need to be able to organize and really store all of this data in one place. You want to store it, you want to analyze it, you want to be able to access it. But even in terms of just running a trial, patients can literally go on to their platform. It's a cloud-based platform. They can learn about this study, they can sign informed consent, they can fill out their medical history, demographic information, they can even update throughout their trial how they're feeling. A lot of those more subjective things that a lot of these clinical trials track can all be housed here.\u00a0If you're a trial administrator, you're also able to see all that patient data right at your fingertips. It can sort patients based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, even randomize patients into their respective trial arms, all at your fingertips. This can all happen with an iPad, with a laptop, all in one place. Pretty remarkable, what they've been able to\u00a0do.\u00a0What does that translate into with top and bottom line growth for Medidata?As you just espoused on the benefits of using Medidata, you can understand why the appeal of using their software is so high for so many pharma companies out there. In turn, since they're selling their software through the cloud, the company's financial statements are spectacular. Talking about double-digit revenue growth. The company is big enough to start producing both net income and free cash flow. Their balance sheet is cash-heavy. Overall, it's a very solid, very sticky business.Having said that, of course, when you have all those traits in one, like many of the companies we're talking about, this is a pricey stock. It trades at 90X trailing earnings, and about 36X forward earnings. One of the things to note with this company is that they don't seem to have an encore opportunity just yet. They are still basically focused squarely on the clinical trial. They are actually a competitor with Veeva Systems. Their growth rates going forward might be much slower than they have been historically. But overall, I think this is a very solid business.\u00a0Great! Let's go into our last stock. That is one that we've probably all encountered or interacted with in one way or another without ever actually knowing that you did. That company is Cerner, ticker CERN. This caters predominantly to hospitals and healthcare providers. Brian, what exactly does this company do?\u00a0 Cerner is the largest provider of IT solutions to the healthcare industry in the U.S., period. What they're best known for is their electronic health record platform, which makes it easy for hospitals and providers to pull down patient data, record information, and share it with other hospitals and providers that are also on Cerner's system. That's a Trojan horse, if you will, that the company then uses to upsell them to other services. They also offer things like operational improvements, they can also handle billing. Cerner is a huge IT tech provider that provides a range of services. EHR, electronic health records, adoption of them has grown very quickly over the last decade. We all know that when you go to a doctor's office, filling out a paper chart is horrendously inefficient. Getting that information on to electronics so that it can be easily shared is a no-brainer, but the industry was very reluctant to make the change given the\u00a0pain involved with that. But Cerner is helping them to do that.\u00a0\u00a0And well-positioned for that pain point, not just going to the doctor and having to fill out all this information; but then, when you get referred to a specialist and you have to fill out the same exact information, knowing that this is data that could have easily been just sent over, integrated into their system as well. Cerner, definitely on the leading edge of that.\u00a0The other thing I like about this company is, it sounds like a relatively steady business in and of itself, but I think with electronic health records, one opportunity that really hasn't been exploited as much is the opportunity in improving overall health outcomes and reducing cost. Obviously, these records contain massive amounts of data. Now's the time to actually start using that data to really inform treatment decisions, give doctors the tools to make the best treatment decision for that patient. I think that's something that we really just haven't seen just yet. But with all the data that they do have, I could easily see AI being incorporated into the system to exploit some of those opportunities and move it away from just being seen as a data warehouse, and really driving treatment paradigms, as well.\u00a0You mentioned, of course, the upselling opportunities. You're looking at things like operational efficiency for a lot of these major healthcare systems. Even for billing, too, which is its own cumbersome process as well. Basically 70 of the world's largest healthcare systems are using their technology. It's the main provider for about 25% of acute care hospitals in the U.S., and boasts the largest international exposure compared to a lot of its competitors. Again, a lot to like with this company. How is it looking in terms of financials, though?\u00a0Cerner makes the most of its money through software support and maintenance contracts. That makes its top line very predictable, especially given their huge industry presence. The company is profitable. It is cash flow positive. It does have a net cash on its balance sheet. Unlike many of the companies that we talked about today, this trades at a much more modest valuation because it is such a mature business that its growth rate is much slower. It's trading at about 30X trailing earnings, 20X forward earnings. That's roughly a market multiple. On the sales and earnings growth side, this is a slower-growing business. The market just expects single-digit sales growth going forward. But offsetting that is its much lower valuation and dominant industry position. Those two factors, I think when you combine, could make this a good choice for investors with a lower risk tolerance. And, they just initiated a quarterly dividend, about $0.015, expected to start in Q3 of this year. At its current stock price right now, you're looking at about 1% annual dividend yield on that. Not bad, especially when you're talking about\u00a0healthcare and tech, to have that dividend tacked on as well.\u00a0Brian, we've gone through five stocks. Of those five, though, what would you say would be your top picks? My two favorites from the list we talked about today are probably Veeva Systems and HealthEquity. I like that both of these companies are still in the rapid growth phase. I like that they're both profitable and that their revenue is recurring. I like the culture of the business. I like that their founders are still involved. Those two are probably my favorites.\u00a0I also think there's an argument for Teladoc. Telemedicine, I believe, is going to be a much bigger industry in time. Although it is more speculative, more risky than the other ones we talked about, I think there's an argument for Teladoc.\u00a0For me, I think Medidata is a great business, but it's just growing a little bit too slowly to justify its valuation. And Cerner is a steady-eddy giant, but I'm a growth-focused investor personally, so it doesn't wet my whistle. But I could easily see it being an attractive stock for more value-conscious investors.\u00a0Have to agree with you there, especially HealthEquity. Even really liking Teladoc. To your point, it has a large growth runway ahead of it. I think telehealth is really going to be the treatment option of choice for most people, especially managing chronic conditions.\u00a0But all in all, these are five great companies. Whether you're an aggressive investor looking for growth or even more conservative, I think we've run the gamut and given everyone some options today to think about adding to your portfolio.\u00a0With that, Brian, thank you so much for stopping by and hanging out with me today on today's show!Always great to be here!

As a growth investor at heart, I'm convinced that  (NYSE: VEEV) is the better choice for new money. Here's why.Image source: Getty Images.Veeva is a  (SaaS) provider that primarily focuses on the needs of the life sciences industry. The company offers two main product lines:Both of these products have been  hits with customers and have  since they were launched. Veeva also chooses to spend lavishly on research and development in an effort to add new functionality to these product lines. That helps the company to pull in more revenue from its existing customers while simultaneously raising switching costs. That's a double win for investors, and it helps to create a strong  .Veeva has been hugely successful in penetrating the life sciences industry, but management has bigger ambitions. It firmly believes that Veeva's product lines can find uses in other industries as well.Veeva created a new business segment called  that is designed to attract companies outside its core market. The company is placing an initial emphasis on industries that are highly regulated and also have health and safety concerns. This means that chemical makers, consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies, and cosmetics companies are a natural hunting ground.It is still the early days for Vault QualityOne, but the company has already had some success. Veeva has already signed deals with a  in the CPG and cosmetics space.How big could the market be for Veeva's latest venture? Management put the number at  , but that estimate could prove extremely conservative. Even if it is accurate, that's still a decent number for a company that is expected to produce about $850 million in total revenue for the year ahead.The beauty of the SaaS business model for investors is that  starts to kick in after a company has reached enough scale. That can lead to outsized growth in the bottom line.A look back at Veeva's revenue and net income growth over the last few years clearly shows that operating leverage has  . data by Veeva's balance sheet is also in top shape.

Wall Street is predicting that the bottom line will expand by 25% annually over the next five years. That's a number that I think will be conservative if Vault QualityOne is a smashing success.The only knock that I have against Veeva is that Wall Street is pricing this business for substantial growth.

Shares have lost about 1.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Cerner due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recen  in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Cerner reported fourth-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 63 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line increased from the prior-year quarter's figure by 8.6%.Revenues totaled $1.37 billion, which improved 3.9% year over year but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39 billion.Per management, U.S. revenues grossed $1.21 billion, up 4% year over year.Non-U.S. revenues surged by $1 million from the year-ago quarter figure to $161 million. The uptick was mainly driven by strong results in the United Kingdom and Sweden.In the reported quarter, Cerner's bookings totaled $1.96 billion, down from $2.33 billion in the same quarter last year.However, this is the second-highest bookings quarter in Cerner's history.Per management, Cerner registered bookings from long-term contracts (including 6 contracts that were more than $75 million) and multiple transactions.Licensed software revenues fell 1.8% to $166.5 million. Per management, the small scale of the EHR replacement market reduces Cerner's opportunity in the traditional software sector. However, the company expects SaaS to continue growing.Technology resale revenues came in at $46.1 million, down 42% on a year-over-year basis. The metric also came below management's expectations.Revenues from Subscriptions grossed $87 million, down 24.1% year over year.Professional services revenues totaled $466.2 million, up 13.9% from the prior-year quarter number. Per management, this upside was mainly driven by Cerner's Works business.Revenues at the Managed services unit summed $299.1 million, up 14.1% from the prior-year quarter. Per management, the improvement was driven by solid year-to-date bookings.Support and maintenance revenues came in at $276.8 million, up 5.8% year over year.Reimbursed travel revenues amounted to $24.1 million, mirroring a 14.5% decline year over year.In the quarter under review, gross profit summed $1.13 billion, up 4.1% year over year. Gross margin was 82.6%, flat on a year-over-year basis.General and administrative expenses rose 7.4% to $98.9 million. Further, Software development expenses increased 11.7% to $181.5 million.Adjusted operating margin contracted 180 basis points (bps) to 18.7% during the quarter.For the first quarter of 2019, Cerner expects revenues between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be 60-62 cents. Business bookings are expected in the range of $1.10-$1.30 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 14% decrease year over year.For 2019, revenues are expected between $5.65 billion and $5.85 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected between $2.57 and $2.67.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.At this time, Cerner has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Cerner has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Growth in its professional-services and managed-services businesses made the difference for the healthcare technology provider.The company predicted in October that its fourth-quarter results would show stronger revenue growth. Cerner announced those results after the market closed on Tuesday. Did its prediction come true? Here are the highlights from Cerner's quarterly update.Image source: Getty Images.Data source: Cerner.Cerner's previous guidance called for fourth-quarter revenue between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. The company again squeaked by to meet the lower end of its projected range. Professional services and managed services yet again came to the rescue.The company's biggest moneymaker in the fourth quarter was professional services, with revenue climbing 17% year over year to $466.2 million. Managed services came in second, with revenue of $299.1 million, up 14% over the prior-year period. Cerner also posted respectable revenue growth generated by support and maintenance, with revenue up 5.8% to $276.8 million.However, it was a different story on several other fronts. Cerner's licensed software revenue slipped 1.7% below the prior-year period to $166.5 million. Subscriptions revenue fell 24.1% year over year to $87 million. Technology resale revenue plunged 42% from the fourth quarter of 2017 to $46.1 million.Cerner's  net income nosedived from the prior-year period, but it wasn't really as bad as it might seem. The company's bottom line took a hit from a $45.3 million pre-tax charge for an allowance against accounts receivable related to a dispute that's been going on since 2008. The year-over-year comparison also was affected by a big tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a tax expense in the recent quarter.The company's non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share provide a better picture of Cerner's progress. Adjusted EPS increased year over year thanks to higher revenue and lower expenses for share-based compensation and related taxes.One significant positive from Cerner's fourth-quarter results was its $1.96 billion in bookings -- unrecognized revenue from contracts that have been signed. This was the second highest quarterly bookings figure in Cerner's history. The company also reported a total backlog of $15.25 billion, up from $14.7 billion in the third quarter.Cerner Chairman and CEO Brent Shafer stated:Shafer's comments mentioned probably the biggest news of all with Cerner's fourth-quarter update: The company is initiating a dividend. Cerner plans to start out with a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, which translates to a dividend yield of around 1%.The company also provided guidance for the first quarter and full year 2019. Cerner expects first-quarter revenue between $1.365 billion and $1.415 billion, with adjusted diluted EPS between $0.60 and $0.62. New business bookings in the first quarter are projected to be between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion. For the full year, the company anticipates revenue between $5.65 billion and $5.85 billion, with adjusted diluted EPS between $2.57 and $2.67.Cerner's expected growth probably won't excite investors. However, the company continues to reward shareholders in other ways, including its buyback program and its new dividend program, which, combined with its modest growth, could deliver solid total returns.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Computer Programs and Systems and Cerner are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CPSI likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than CERN has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.CPSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.82, while CERN has a forward P/E of 20.93. We also note that CPSI has a PEG ratio of 1.14. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CERN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.52.Another notable valuation metric for CPSI is its P/B ratio of 2.43. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CERN has a P/B of 3.76.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CPSI's Value grade of A and CERN's Value grade of C.CPSI stands above CERN thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that CPSI is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(NASDAQ: CERN)Q4 2017 February 5, 2019, Welcome to Cerner Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Today's date is February 5, 2019 and this call is being recorded.The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating and capital expenses, bookings, new solution, services and new offering development, capital allocation plans, and future business outlook, including new markets or prospects for the company's solutions and services.Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brent Shafer, Chairman and CEO of Cerner Corporation.Thank you, Carmen. Good afternoon to everyone and welcome to the call. Today I'm going to provide reflections on my first year at Cerner and discuss steps we are taking to position ourselves for long-term profitable growth. I will then have our Chief Financial Officer Marc Naughton cover the numbers and John Peterzalek, our Chief Client Officer marketplace observations.I'd like to begin with some observations from my first year. This past Friday marked my one year anniversary at Cerner. It's been an eventful and important 12 months. I spent a great deal of time learning the business, talking to clients, partners, the financial community, and of course Cerner associates. A clear take away from these conversations is the optimism around Cerner's role in having a positive impact on healthcare. Clients have been eager to give feedback on how Cerner solutions are advancing their businesses along with urging us to go faster because of our importance to them. Partners are pleased working with our platforms and the culture around associate base, our Cerner associate base, is linked to relentless innovation. These assessments have bolstered my confidence that Cerner is well-positioned to deliver profitable growth. I fully expect Cerner to continue its legacy as a growth company and innovator in healthcare.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cerner wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.As an overall leadership team, we have also focused on assessing market opportunities, listening to clients, reviewing our internal processes and evaluating our profitability in capital allocation strategy. You heard me on the las  call talk about four commitments that define our framework for delivering value. To reiterate, 1.) We must relentlessly advance our clients' success 2.) Imagine, design, and implement intelligent health networks 3.) Focus on better healthcare experiences and outcomes 4.) Become the partner of choice for healthcare innovation. In order to deliver on these commitments, I've worked with the team to create a better structure in improved processes.This work has led to a refined operating model that we will discuss next week at HIMMS. It's my belief that we can reduce complexity for our clients and make it easier to do business with Cerner. I also believe we can innovate faster and more efficiently so clients can quickly adopt new solutions. By aligning resources around client focus and efficient delivery of innovation, I expect the business to operate more cost-effectively and have more predictable results and improved profitability. I want to highlight today's announcement that we plan to initiate a dividend. This decision is a significant milestone in Cerner's journey and illustrates our confidence in delivering strong operating performance in free cash flow generation. Marc will get the specifics but this decision underscores our commitment to delivering shareholder value.We had a solid fourth quarter with all key metrics within our guidance ranges except for revenue which was slightly below guidance, primarily due to lower than expected technology resale. Given the lower margin profile of technology resale, the quarterly revenue shortfall had very little impact on earnings which were in line with expectations. For all of 2018, our revenue and EPS were both in the full-year guidance ranges we provided in our Q1  and we delivered solid bookings (00:05:14). But we did deliver our full-year guidance ranges. I'm aware that our results included a decline in operating earnings. This is not something we expect to continue, and I believe the structure and process changes we are making will help make Cerner more focused and efficient which should allow us to increase our predictability and profitability over time.In summary, while we still have a lot to do, I am pleased with the progress we made as a leadership team in the past year. I believe we have the right mix of people, processes, and strategies to drive long-term financial success. I look forward to seeing many of you next week at HIMMS, now altering the call to Marc.Thanks, Brent. Good morning everyone. I am going to cover our results and guidance. I will start with bookings, which were $1.96 billion in Q4. This is above the midpoint of our guidance range and is the second highest bookings quarter in our history behind $2.329 billion in Q4 2017, which included several uniquely large contracts and has grown 62% over the prior 4th quarter. Full-year bookings were $6.721 billion, which is up 6% over $6.325 billion in 2017. We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $15.25 billion, which is up from $14.70 billion in Q3. As we've indicated, our backlog calculation under the new revenue standard excludes revenue potentially impacted by contract termination clauses. In our experience, clients rarely exercise this option, so this doesn't change our total long-term revenue opportunity, it just reduces the calculation of backlog. You'll see in our 10-K filing that we've supplemented our backlog disclosure by adding the amount of revenue we expect from contracts that are not included in the backlog calculation. For 2019, when you combine the 29% of our backlog, we expect to recognize with an additional $525 million expected from contracts not included in backlog, the total is approximately 85% of the midpoint of our revenue guidance.Revenue in the quarter was $1.366 billion, up 4% over Q4 2017 and, as I mentioned, just below our guidance range of $1.37 to $1.42 billion. The shortfall in Q4 was primarily due to lower than expected levels of technology resale, which was down 42% compared to Q4 2017. Total revenue for the year was $5.366 billion, reflecting growth of 4% over 2017.I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q4 2017 and full-year 2017. Licensed Software revenue in Q4 was $166 million, down 2%, against a solid Q4 2017. Full-year Licensed Software revenue of $614 million was $2 million higher than 2017, or basically flat, with growth in SaaS offsetting declines in traditional software. As we've discussed, the smaller nature of the remaining EHR replacement market reduces our traditional software opportunity, but we do expect SaaS to continue growing and eventually become the majority of software revenue, which should reduce volatility over time.Technology resale decreased 42% in Q4 to $46 million and was well below our forecast. Full-year technology resale revenue was $245 million, down 10% year-over-year. The weakness relative to our forecast in Q4 was largely due to transactions pushing. We are also beginning to see more of our third-party suppliers' transition to subscription and SaaS models, which did impact the sublicensed software portion of technology resale revenue in 2018.Subscriptions revenue was $87 million in Q4, down from $115 million in Q4 2017. As we have discussed throughout the year, subscriptions were impacted by our adoption of the new revenue standard, reducing subscription backlog and classifying a portion of subscription revenue as support. Full-year subscriptions revenue was $326 million, down from $469 million in 2017. With a full-year of the transition to the new revenue standard behind us, we expect the subscription business model to return to solid growth in 2019.Professional services grew in Q4 17% to $466 million, driven largely by growth in our Works businesses. Full-year professional services revenue grew 14% to $1.811 billion. Managed services increased 14% to $299 million in Q4, driven by strong bookings throughout the year. Full-year managed services revenue was $1.155 billion, an increase of 10% over 2017. Support and maintenance was up 6% to $277 million in Q4, and full-year revenue grew 7% to $1.118 billion, both reflecting our expected low-single-digit growth plus the previously discussed impact of the new revenue standard.And finally, reimbursed travel inQ4 was $24 million, down $4 million from the year-ago quarter. Full-year reimbursed travel revenue was $97 million, down 4% year-over-year. Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue was up 4% from the year-ago quarter at $1.205 billion, and non-U.S. revenue of $161 million was up $1 million from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 3% and non-U.S. revenue grew 12%. Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 82.6%, down slightly from 82.8% in Q3 2018 and flat year-over-year. Full-year gross margin of 82.5% is down from 83.4% in 2017, driven by higher 3rd party services costs.Now I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted, or Non-GAAP, results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, acquisition-related adjustments, an allowance on a non-current asset, impact of U.S. tax reform, and other adjustments, all as detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. Looking at operating spending, our fourth quarter GAAP operating expenses of $965 million were up 11% compared to $866 million in the year-ago period. Full-year GAAP operating expenses were $3.654 billion, up 10% from $3.328 billion in 2017.Note that in Q4, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $45 million to provide an allowance against a non-current receivable with Fujitsu Services Limited that is in other assets on our balance sheet. As some of you will recall, Fujitsu's contract as the prime contractor in the National Health Service initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in the Southern region of England was terminated in the second quarter of 2008 by the NHS. This led to our subcontract being terminated. We continue to be in dispute regarding the amounts due as a result of such termination, but we determined in the fourth quarter that our chances of a favorable resolution have been reduced based on the outcome of the alternative dispute resolution procedures provided for in our subcontract. Note that after our subcontract with Fujitsu was terminated, Cerner went on to successfully deliver in the Southern region, as well as the London region, with another prime contractor, and the U.K. remains a strong and active market for us today.Turning to adjusted operating expenses, they were up 7% compared to Q4 2017, and 9% for the full year. Looking at the line items for Q4, sales & client Service expense increased 6% over Q4 2017, primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to our services businesses. Software development expense increased 12% over Q4 2017, driven by a 7% increase in gross R&D, a 17% increase in amortization, and flat capitalized software. G&A expense was up 5%, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased $1 million year over year.Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 12% compared to 16.7% in the year-ago period, largely due to the $45 million allowance I discussed. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18.7%, down from 20.5% in Q4 2017, consistent with our guidance for the quarter. Our GAAP operating margin for the full-year 2018 was 14.4% compared to 18.7% in 2017. Our full-year adjusted operating margin was 18.8%, which is down from 22.4% last year. As we have discussed, 2018 was impacted by lower-than-anticipated licensed software revenue, higher growth of non-cash expenses, investments in our Works businesses and an increased mix of Works revenue. We continue to believe that many of these factors are temporary in nature, and our 2019 guidance reflects our expectation that our operating margins stabilize at approximately 19%. This could vary based on revenue mix, but we do not expect margin compression like we have experienced the past few years. Longer term, we believe adjustments we are making to our operating model and a focus on profitable growth will position us for additional margin expansion.Now I'd like to preview an expense we expect to incur in Q2. As we discussed throughout 2018, we have been working to identify opportunities to operate more efficiently and innovate at scale. One outcome of that analysis was a recent announcement of a Voluntary Separation Plan, or VSP. Generally, the VSP is available to U.S. associates who meet a minimum level of combined age and tenure, with certain critical roles excluded for business continuity purposes. Associates who elect to participate in the VSP will receive financial benefits commensurate with their tenure and position, along with vacation payout and medical benefits. At this point, we do not have a firm estimate for the charge because the acceptance period ends later this month, but we anticipate less than 3% of our total associates will separate as part of this program. While a portion of these positions will be backfilled, we believe we will be able to fill many of the positions with existing associates, which should create efficiencies in the future while also creating career growth opportunities for our associates.Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $131 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $1.00 in Q4 2017. For the full year, GAAP net earnings were $630 million, or $1.89 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings in Q4 were $208 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.63, compared to $0.58 in Q4 2017. For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $819 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.45, up 3% from 2017. Our GAAP tax rate was 24% for the quarter and 21% for the year. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21%, for the quarter and year. For 2019, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be closer to 22%.Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $775 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $814 million in Q3 2018, with our free cash flow being offset by $298 million of share repurchases. For the year, we repurchased 11.2 million of shares for $644 million, at an average price of $57.65. We currently have $283 million of remaining authorization under our repurchase program. Moving to debt, our total debt was up $3 million from last quarter to $444 million. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.183 billion, down from $1.211 billion in Q3 2018. Our Q4 DSO was 79 days, which is down from 82 days in Q3 2018 and up from 72 days in the year-ago period.Operating cash flow for the quarter was $407 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $141 million, and capitalized software was $65 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $201 million for the quarter. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.454 billion, capital expenditures were $447 million, and capitalized software was $274 million. Full-year free cash flow was $733 million, which is $62 million higher than 2017. For 2019, we expect limited growth in our operating cash flow because we benefited in 2018 from a tax refund that offset most of our cash tax payments. This year, we expect to have more cash outflows for tax, and our cash flow will also be impacted by our VSP payouts.On the capital side, we expect an increase in capital expenditures of more than $75 million in 2019, primarily to support our facilities requirements, including the peak year of spend on a phase at our Innovations Campus. Due to a combination of these two factors, we expect free cash flow to decline in 2019, but we still expect it to be solid. In 2020, we expect a return to normal operating cash flow growth and a meaningful decline in capital expenditures to lead to strong free cash flow.Now I'd like to discuss capital allocation. As noted in our press release, subject to declaration by our Board, we plan to initiate a $0.15 cent per share quarterly cash dividend, with the first payment expected sometime in the third quarter. On an annualized basis, this represents a yield of just over 1% based on our current stock price and a payout ratio of 24% of 2018 adjusted net earnings. As you know, investing in innovation to fuel growth has been Cerner's core strategy since its inception. This will not change, and we are confident that meaningful growth opportunities exist and that we are making the right investments to deliver good long-term growth.We are now at a point where we believe we can invest in this growth while also enhancing shareholder value with a dividend and continued share repurchases. We have several objectives we are looking to accomplish with our broader capital allocation strategy. First, we want to provide current income to existing shareholders while also increasing the attractiveness of Cerner to a wider investor base. Second, we expect to continue using free cash flow for share repurchases to offset dilution from equity compensation and do additional repurchases as deemed appropriate. Third, we want to have flexibility to make other investments in growth, including relationships like Lumeris or strategic acquisitions that complement our organic growth investments.Given our very strong balance sheet and expected strong cash flow, we believe we are in a comfortable position to do all these things with free cash flow, while still maintaining flexibility to use debt for larger strategic opportunities. We also believe adding a dividend to our capital allocation approach will create discipline and focus on free cash flow generation, which is something we also plan to incorporate into our variable compensation plans as part of broader changes that we believe will increase alignment with shareholders. In summary, we have put a lot of thought into our capital allocation approach and listened to feedback from many of you, and we believe this approach is in the best interest of our shareholders.Now I'll go through the guidance. We expect revenue in Q1 to be between $1.365 and $1.415 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 8% over Q1 2018. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.650 and $5.850 billion, with the $5.750 billion midpoint reflecting 7% growth over 2018. We expect Q1 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.60 to $0.62 per share. The midpoint of this range is 5% higher than Q1 2018. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.57 to $2.67, with the $2.62 midpoint reflecting 7% growth over 2018. The midpoint of this range is $0.06 below consensus. We suspect about half of this is that consensus had a tax rate closer to our 2018 tax rate of 21%, and we expect a rate around 22%, with the rest likely being a slight difference in margins.Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 14% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2018. Note that the first quarter of 2018 had a much higher than normal level of large, long-term bookings and we expect a much lower level in Q1 of this year. The combination of these two factors is the driver of the expected year-over-year decline in bookings, as the midpoint of our guidance range would reflect growth in bookings if you exclude the long-term portion. There are several large longer-term deals forecasted throughout the year and we expect the mix to normalize as the year progresses.Before I wrap up, I'd like to remind you about our annual Investment Community Meeting at HIMSS next Wednesday, February 13th . If you plan to attend and have not registered, please do so through the link at the top of the investor section of Cerner.com. If you are unable to attend in person, there will also be a webcast available at the same location both live and archived. With that, I will turn the call over to John.Thanks Marc. Good afternoon everyone. Today, I'll cover Q4 and full-year results and discuss the marketplace. I'll start with our bookings results. As Marc mentioned, Q4 bookings did decline compared to the all-time high in Q4 2017, but they were still our second highest level ever. Multiple large transactions contributed to the strength of our bookings, including six contracts that were greater than $75 million. These large contracts included significant solution and services expansions with existing clients and new Cerner Millennium footprints in both U.S. and non-U.S. marketplace.In addition to the contributions from larger hospitals, our CommunityWorks and ambulatory businesses both had record full-year bookings. Looking at the mix of new business, 30% of bookings in Q4 came from outside our core Cerner Millennium installed base. The percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts in the quarter was 38% and included the addition of a Cerner ITWorks client and a RevWorks expansion. As Marc discussed, we are expecting a lower level of long-term deals in Q1, but we have a solid forecast for the year and the overall market remains attractive. This activity is reflected in our strong pipeline, which is at near-record levels. 2018 was also a strong year for our key growth areas, with Revenue Cycle, HealtheIntent Population Health solutions, and Cerner ITWorks all growing revenue more than 20%.In Population Health, we are continuing to make early progress in our launch of our EHR-agnostic offering with Lumeris called Maestro Advantage. Maestro Advantage is designed to help health systems set up and manage provider sponsored Medicare Advantage Plans and enable population health service organizations to manage a portfolio of value-based reimbursement arrangements. We've continued to have strong interest in the offering. In addition, we had a joint client go live at the beginning of this year that is a longtime HealtheIntent client that chose Lumeris because of our plans to operate as an integrated offering. This client launched a Medicare Advantage plan in 2019 with first year enrollment exceeding client target expectations. For their initial launch, they are using the Lumeris platform for their new MA plan benefits administration and leveraging HealtheIntent for their population health management and provider performance technology platform, with complete migration to HealtheIntent for the combined Maestro Advantage platform when it is available. Further, we expect to sign a client outside of our EHR installed base for Maestro Advantage in the first half of this year.Next, I'd like to provide an update on our federal business. Starting with the Department of Defense MHS Genesis project, we are continuing our work on the second wave of sites, and the projects are going as planned. Similarly, our work with the Department of Veterans Affairs has continued as planned since signing the initial contract in Q2 and additional task orders in Q3. We remain on track to steadily ramp our work on the project as we go through the year. The first major project milestone will be in 2020 when initial sites are scheduled to go live. As a related note, the Government shutdown didn't have a material impact on our DoD or VA projects.Moving to our business outside of the U.S., our revenue for the quarter was flat versus a tough comparable in Q4 2017, but up 12% for the full year. From a booking's standpoint, the highlight of the fourth quarter was winning our second major region in Sweden after signing our first region in Q1 2018. Both of these were competitive wins against our primary competitor.Now I'd like to discuss the marketplace and our approach to aligning with the shifts that are occurring. There are several macro drivers that are shaping the way we align with our clients and think about our long-term growth. First, provider consolidation continues to increase, with transacted deal revenue doubling on a year-over-year basis and primary and specialty practices owned by health systems nearing 50% for key service lines. This consolidation, focused within discrete metropolitan areas, has driven high levels of technology variance, with some health systems having 10+ disparate EMRs across its owned and affiliated assets. As the size and scale of these health networks grows, consolidators are looking for technology and services to increase near term fee-for-service revenue and enable emerging fee-for-value opportunities to include Episode Management and Provider-Sponsored Plans.To better align with these trends, we made some adjustments in 2018 in how we align with the marketplace. This included creating a separate group focused on large clients that are driving much of the industry consolidation. Our focus is making sure these clients have the best of Cerner and to enable them to pursue their growth strategies. In some cases, this means we help them rapidly deploy Cerner's EHR across acquired sites that are using another EHR. For others, a strategy of using HealtheIntent as a single source of truth across a system with multiple EHRs may make more sense. We are also making more changes this year as part of the adjustments to our operating model Brent discussed. The changes primarily revolve around streamlining how we sell to different solution categories and client types to make it easier for existing clients to work with us and create more focus on opportunities outside of Cerner's core EHR installed base.Before turning the call over to questions, I wanted to highlight an industry milestone that Cerner played a role in through our membership in CommonWell Health Alliance. Recall that CommonWell is an open, not-for-profit industry consortium that we co-founded with other healthcare IT firms to enable secure nationwide interoperability. In November of 2018, CommonWell announced general availability of its connection to CareQuality, another national interoperability framework. This connection allows CommonWell and CareQuality enabled healthcare providers to connect and bilaterally exchange health data to improve care coordination and delivery.This is a significant milestone on the path to achieving true nationwide interoperability and making health data available to individuals and providers regardless of where care occurs. We are proud to have played a role in this accomplishment, and we plan to remain a leading advocate for interoperability because it is very important to healthcare. With that, I will turn the call over to the moderator for questions.Thank you, and ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time just press *1 of your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to be removed from the queue, press #. Please place your light on mute what your question has been stated. And our first question is from Sean Dodge with Jeffries, your line is now open.Hi, good afternoon, thanks. Maybe, Brent, your comments the very beginning of the call around to focus on more efficient cost-effective innovation, certainly spends a lot of money on R&D, I'm curious to hear any updated thoughts you have around the longer-term trajectory of spending there. The mention of an emphasis on efficiency, is that something where you think you can hold spending flat and drive some operating leverage out of it in the future or is there even a possibility to reduce some of that spending with efficiencies and innovation to deliver maybe some of those savings to margins?Thanks for your comment. Really, the focus is on efficiencies in our approach and getting more from the total spend that we have through better processes, better management, you know looking for ways to ensure we're not duplicating work etc. So, there's a couple of key components to this. One is around concentrating operations so that they're effective, things get scaled into market as quickly as possible with two areas we're really focusing on growth by concentrating resources in those. One around kind of an incubator concept where we get early stage ideas ready to scale, scale them through operations, etc., take them to market faster. The other areas around really focusing some resources on the strategic growth areas that are outside the core EMR or EHR market. So, the answer is doing more with the resources we have, making them more productive.Okay, that's helpful thanks. And then on VA and margins, Marc, before you mentioned some of the VA task orders can include bigger chunks of software and that of course those being nice tailwinds to margin. Can you characterize for us, I guess I'm not asking you to quantify the VA revenue you expect in 2019, but rather frame for us if there's a lot of these kind of bigger software chunks from VA relative to maybe what you'd expect in subsequent years? Is this a big VA software year or not?Yeah, this is Marc. If you recall, the VA as prime, we are on a percent of completion contract method of recognizing the revenue from the VA. So, you basically put all of the revenue from the VA, software, services, third-party, all into a bucket and you recognize that bucket basically as you perform services. So that really in the VA, Sean, is not one  you don't have the lumpiness or the chunks of revenue that come from a stand-alone software deal that you would get in our normal business. So, it will all be part of that overall profitability, so it goes into as calculating kind of a projected margin from that business including third-parties of 20 to 25% based on kind of the 50-50 split of work being done by us and work being done by third parties. So, there won't be a lumpiness to it relative to the software, it will be based on when the activity occurs relative to working down that contract.Okay, sounds good, thank you.Thank you, our next question comes from Michael Turney with Bank of America, your line is now open.Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Tying back a little bit into the original question on R&D, but thinking about comprehensively, Brent, as you've taken your first year in the business, especially coming from a much larger organization, could you point out some of the things that as a company or what you've seen from Cerner that you think is really prudent investing areas where you have seen some specific returns, whether it some of that R&D incubation? And then especially going forward, and I apologize if I'm getting ahead of next week, but with a more moderate growth rate for the industry, how you think about that sales and client service business line item within the model?Well, as you know we have a rich history of innovation and there's a lot of great work is been going on. I think one of the things that came out of talking with associates and clients and just kinda looking at where we are, is we've gone to a scale where efficient deployment of resources and so on and we started to get in our own way, I think, as we've gotten big. So, fundamentally what we've tried to do is look at standard ways of operating, finding efficiencies, eliminating duplication in organizational structures so that we can get early stage ideas to a point that they can be scaled to the whole market quickly. So, that's the focus and we'll continue to invest in innovation. I think there's a strong pipeline of things that we can bring to market but getting them to scale quickly and getting them to revenue quickly for us is the emphasis with these moves. And we'll go into more detail of the approach next week.And then just one follow-up question, maybe for John, you talked about a very, very strong pipeline yet at the same time also talking about the replacement market slowing down. What constitutes that pipeline qualitatively? What are people looking to buy?Well, the pipeline that we have is pretty consistent with what we've had in approach there in the past so, you'll see expansion into what we'll call the peripheral of the core, whether it's clinician communication, whether it's population health management and other things that make a health system more efficient in our core client base. And you'll see the mix very similar to what we had before. In terms of the replacement market, you're seeing the same phenomenon that we've also had for the last few years which is that the total number of opportunities are declining, they are off to the market as each one signs, but the number we work on every year has been really consistent. So, we remain very active in the replacement market and we see that being consistent in the near future as well. But the number we work on every year will remain constant while the total number of opportunities become fewer.Great, thanks.Thank you, our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBank, please go ahead.Great, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I think you all mentioned, talked about an ITWorks deal, he said it been an area of high-growth and it felt like it sort of hit a wall maybe about a year ago and growth there stopped, and it seems like it's starting to pick up there. Can you talk about the marketplace where ITWorks is large IT, we're seeing arrangement and how we should think about that over the next year or so? How much of that is in your pipeline?Yeah, this is John again. We actually have considerable opportunities in ITWorks. If you look at some of the pressures that are provider clients are facing in terms of having to do more with less, having those efficiency gains is we actually have a tremendous value proposition about doing more and being able to bring all that Cerner has to bear which is broader than just software and those types of things. So, the interest remains strong. I would say that some of the lumpiness you'd see is primarily because these are large transactions and very complex from both the client side and the Cerner side. So, I think part of it is just timing. While we've done a really good job, I think of predicting when these things will close, the complexities make them less predictable than some of our other solutions and offerings, but the demand out there is still very strong.How many ITWorks contracts you have currently?We are north of 30, I think Brett 32 right now.Okay, and then maybe one last question. You're kind of on this theme of outsourcing around the revenue cycle, I think over the past year you guys have highlighted some investments you've made in shared services infrastructure, I think with Advantis and maybe some others in Kansas City that kind of scale out a revenue cycle outsourcing capability. Where are you with that and again how do we think about that? That's also been an area where I think there was a lot of growth, it sort of slowed, how do we think about that going forward in the pipeline?Yeah, to address that, the specific on the Kansas City service center you talked about, it's primarily as we transition the Advantis workforce and that's going on schedule as planned. In terms of the pipeline, the opportunities are out there, I think are pretty broad as well as again, as are provider clients are looking at ways to focus on their core business. They are looking at ways to outsource or take some of the burden of some of the process oriented things off their plate. And we have lots of opportunities out there to go get and we've been putting them in our service center as well so we get a big leverage out of what we're doing in Kansas City as well as doing some on-site staff that can leverage the same processes. So, I'm very optimistic that you continue to see that growth. They have some of the complexities that I mentioned with ITWorks because they tend to be larger opportunities in those type of things that kind of make them less predictable, but the opportunities are there.Yeah, Don, this is Marc. We have over 600 people that we've hired in Kansas City and keep in mind that was an investment we made during the year and one of the reasons that we readjusted our targets as we got into the end of Q1 and those will take over some of the responsibilities from some of our existing clients, but we are 2018 and part of 2019 is really the transition where we move that work into our billing center. It does allow us to pursue additional back office activities and keep in mind that back office versus a pure outsourcing is a higher margin outsourcing business for us. So, that's one of the reasons we wanted to create that center in Kansas City.Okay great, I'll see you all next week.Thank you, our next question is from Eric Percher with Nephron Research, your line is now open.Thank you. The dividend, I think you call it a milestone, represents a pretty material change relative to the board's historic approach. I'd love to hear your view on what the key determinant was or is and how does the targeted, or how is the payout today, how does it compare to what you think the target may be over time? Is this what you would like to target or is indicative of a greater payout targeted over time?Yeah, this is Marc. On relatively the dividend in our capital allocation review, I think certainly you go out with the dividend your expectation is you're gonna increase the dollar of that amount of that dividend on an annual basis. And certainly, is a growth company, that would be our expectation. We talked a lot of investors, a lot of shareholders as to what  as we looked at our capital allocation strategies, I think that while people were appreciative of the stock repurchases, we heard the opportunity to lay in the dividend, especially when you look at the S&P 500 that has similar qualities to our company; about 80% of them are paying a dividend. It does open up another shareholder base that traditionally hasn't been able to buy our stock. And we think it enhances the shareholder returned that our shareholders can get. Given our strong free cash flow, the ability to do that plus pulling in, being able to do targeted repurchases and still fund the opportunities that we think from a strategic growth perspective, it just seemed like a good time in the lifecycle of the company to lay in that program.That's great to hear and did you say that there is an element that you will bring into compensation and as you're doing that, have you thought it all about bringing a measure of bookings or revenue like some of the technology peers in your proxy comparison group do in their compensation plans?Yes, right now we are looking at adjusting what currently the senior management team here focus primarily on EPS instead of compensation basis at least for the current and the cash. I think as we roll into 2019, you'll see us looking at adding revenue and free cash flow as part of the triumvirate of three metrics that we'll look to and set people on. So, it's kind of broad in the view. We have a lot of metrics that go deeper into the organization, there are a lot of cash collection targets. There are a lot of things that within the organization support each one of those, but traditionally we kinda let EPS stand in for the overall shareholder view of the company and what we're setting senior leadership on. I think you'll see us split that among two or three factors to take into account just exactly what you said.Well, it's great to see, thank you.Thank you, our next question is from Jeff Garro with William Blair.Yeah, good afternoon guys and thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about the international opportunity and recognizing that the full-year growth was faster than the corporate average and you had some really nice wins throughout the year. So, I wanted to get your comments on the international pipeline, positioning abroad, and expectations to grow that piece of the business faster than the corporate average going forward.Yeah, this is John. The international or outside the U.S. pipeline look strong and the great thing about outside the U.S., Is they tend to come in big chunks. They'll be purchasing either at a state level, a province level, region level as opposed to an individual health system level. So, they come with large pieces of business and broader than just the HR. They generally will cover some sort of social aspect to it as well as a population health or population health management aspect of it as well. So, you'll see us do very similar to I think what we did in Sweden which is we'll want to establish a core in a region or a state and then use that leverage to expand beyond that and there are several opportunities to do that. Not only countries where we are, but potential new countries coming in as well.Great, and then just as a follow-up, you mentioned potential new countries, any particular regions that you could call out?Probably not right now as some of them are in pre-RFP stages, but we've got a pretty good bead on what's likely to come out over the next one, two, and three years.All right, thanks for taking the questions.Thank you, our next question is from Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer, please go ahead.Thanks for taking my questions. Marc, two questions. First on the subscription revenue as your anniversary the new revenue standard, what kind of growth should we see? I think right now it's hard to see the true growth because of the comps.Yes, you kinda see a decline in the number as we went into 2018 with the impact of 606. I think once we get and have the 2018 numbers landed, which we do, then you'll start to see more normalized comparables going forward. So, I think is you kind of look to 2019, one of the reasons we feel good about looking at a guidance that gives us kind of a midpoint of a 7% top line growth after year in which we grew 4% is that we expect subscriptions to grow over their current level and probably certainly at least double digit growth compared to where they're at.We're getting a lot uptake on some of our transaction activity that goes into subscriptions and we actually had good subscription bookings in 2018 which going to the backlog and then we'll see the revenue as we roll forward. I think a key element as we talk about 2019, and I just want to stress, is that we have 85% visibility into that revenue number as we come out of the year when you look at our backlog and our contracted revenue which isn't included in backlog and that's the highest, we've seen. So, I think that's, in our mind as we look at the numbers, supports why you can be a 4% growth last year and go to a 7% at the midpoint in 2019.Thanks a lot, Marc, I think you touched on the backlog recoveries, that was going to be my second question. So, with 85%, I mean it's better than what you had last year at this time at 82%, but it looks like actually it's much better than 85% compared to then because you don't have these new contractor revenues in the backlog. Is that fair?Well, I think if you do the math, and the 10-K will give you the data to do that, and I think we gave you the data today, that if you take the backlog number times what we expect to rollout in 12 months and then you add the non-contracted backlog which I think is about $525 million for next year, some of those two things add up to about 85% of whatever revenue is for 2019. So, it does include the contracted revenue and reflects all of those elements.Okay, thanks a lot, Marc.Thank you, good afternoon. So, Marc, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the various factors leading to a flat margin assumption for next year. Can you just quickly review those? I don't know if I caught them all and perhaps outline the relative orders of magnitude in terms of impact year-over-year and I assume to be a contract is a year-over-year margin and help. In terms of the Works business though, is net portfolio can yield better margins year-over-year in 2019?Yeah, I think that the key when you're looking at is during 2018, we had a lot of services margin and a lot of that was related to really strong Works bookings that we had in 2018 and at the end of 2017. A lot of that is in the ITWorks and the RevWorks side of the business which in the initial phase of those contracts are very low margin, they are single digit. And so, when a significant chunk of new revenues coming in at that level and obviously 2019 will be even larger as more of those kick in for a full year, that's gonna have an impact that makes growing margins more difficult. I think certainly we look to get a little bit of an uptake in license software, but a component of that, and an ever-growing component of that is SaaS software and that's not 90% margins, that's more like 50% margins because of the need to host a lot of that.So, a lot of the margin view depends on what the mixes can be. So, while we don't expect expansion into 2019, we also don't expect to decline which would reverse the trend that we've seen in the last few years. I think on the spend side, you're still getting hit although not quite as much in 2018, but in 2019 you're still getting hit with an amortization and depreciation impact from a non-cash expense that's gonna be an increase that you have to do and as Brent indicated, we want to be more efficient on how we deliver our R&D, but that's not a number that's gonna go down because we are in an industry that has a lot of opportunity. We're still going to invest organically even with the strategic growth views that we're having.So, I think next year you probably are good to see, certainly this year, the R&D was growing faster than revenue and I think that may continue next year as well. So, certainly, we'll talk to you more about it at HIMMS relative to kind of some of the views we have relative to growing margins. But I think the focus for us is to grow revenue, we are a growth company, we're paying a dividend, but we are a growth company, but we need to grow earnings at a faster rate and we're growing revenue. And in 2019 we are probably gonna be relatively similar with a goal that going forward we are able to grow earnings at a faster level. Obviously, meaning that we're going to have some level of margin expansion.And I'm sorry if you mentioned this, does the amortization and depreciation and start rolling off in 2020?It starts equalizing so that you don't the year-over-year increases that we've been seeing in the last two years or so.Got it, OK great, thank you very much.Thank you, our next question is from Steve Hopper with Cantor Fitzgerald, please go ahead.Hi, in previous commentary, you talked about the VA getting to $1 billion of revenue over the next four years. Is that still a safe assumption?Yeah, I think that depends on when the task orders come through in the pace the project, but basically that's kind of the trajectory that the project plan is on.Right, and recognizing that you recognize revenues on a percentage of completion, how are costs, are those being expensed as incurred?No, under percent of completion you're taking all of the dollars that are going to get brought in from revenue, all the costs get laid up in that and then when you recognize the dollar of revenue, you recognize the percent of expense. So, basically, Steve, assuming that you're getting 20 to 25% overall margins from that, that revenue dollar, that's pretty consistent margin that you see coming into the P&L when that revenue comes in.Okay, I just wanted to make sure if there was some element of VA costs in that 2019 number. Is there an assumption that VA contributes revenue in 2019 or not?Yes, certainly VA contributes some revenue in 2018 and that revenue goes up in 2019.Okay, great, thanks.Thank you, our next is from Sandy Draper with SunTrust, your line is open.Thanks very much, just a couple of quick ones. Marc, I know you saw the share repurchase, did you mention is there any share repurchase explicitly in the guidance or does the guidance exclude the share repurchase is?I think for the most part, it'll be consistent with our prior activities which tends to be that we repurchase in an amount that offsets dilution. So, if you're looking at outstanding shares to model, it would be basically relatively flat.Okay, great, that's helpful. And then I'm not sure if I quite caught it or understood it, I think it was John's comments about the first quarter bookings, it sounds like you expect traditional bookings to be up year-over-year, but all the decline to be driven by long-term bookings? Is that correct? I'm just trying to make sure I've got that. And then thinking about how that sort of flows through the rest of the year, but it sounds like with a couple of big deals you expect long-term bookings may actually grow even though there gonna be down materially in the first quarter.Yeah, the long-term bookings aren't forecasted in Q1 as we said in the pipeline for the remainder of 2019 in terms of long-term bookings looks very positive.Yeah Sandy, I think when we look at it if you factor, kinda take long-term out of the equation, then non-long-term looks to be growing in Q1.Okay, great, thanks so much.Thank you, our next question is from Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo, please go ahead.Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick follow-up to Steve's on the VA kind of revenue assumption. I think that to get to that billion that he referenced four years out, you guys have kind of talked about maybe 250 this year, 500 next year, 750, and then a billion. I know that it's probably impossible to predict with that level of accuracy given that you're dealing with the government here, but is that generally the cadence that people should still be thinking about?Yeah, Jamie, as you said, it's hard to exactly model what it looks like. I think what we've kinda said is that if it's a four-year growth to a billion without being too precise, if you just model it, it won't go in a straight line at that ramp rate, but if that's what you model it, I think you're not could be that far off.Okay, that's it, think you.Thank you, our next question is from Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird, please go ahead.Hey, thanks for the question. I just had one follow-up on the capital allocation. You talked about the dividend. I thought the commentary around the acquisition was maybe new as well. So, I just wanted to confirm that you are perhaps more open to M&A and if we heard that right, sort of what of the areas of particular focus?Yeah, this is Marc, one of the topics when Brent came aboard that he wanted us to focus on was let's look at capital allocation, you guys have a really strong balance sheet, it seems like we need to be applying that into the business. So, I think it is a little bit of a change. We've gone certainly in the past had much more of a mantra of we're going to build it ourselves and I think that's been very effective for us. But as we get in more of the HealtheIntent platform as an agnostic platform, it opens our ability to do some targeted niche acquisitions that can be quickly brought in to that architecture and therefore deliver to our clients on a pretty efficient cloud-based manner.So, it definitely was a little bit of a change in what our approach is going to be. It's a little hard to target exactly what that's going to be. We are still kind of at the doing a process where we are reviewing a lot of different opportunities. I think it's safe to say that the majority will be focused either on things that can supplement our HealtheIntent platform or be implemented through use of that or some type of an opportunity that helps us in our government business or others that help us in some other new opportunities that we think, that we see the chance to grow such as networks. The Lumeris investment was very much focused on being able to grow networks and be able to assist our clients in doing that and I think that Lumeris is a great opportunity there, but I think there are other tangential opportunities that might be well suited to some type of an M&A or certainly, we're gonna also look at partnerships because that may be a more effective vehicle made in many cases.I was just can add to that. One of the things we have gone through in the last recent months is really putting a portfolio review in place and looking at, one, how do we become more efficient with the organic growth, getting solutions to market quickly etc. on the spend, in what situations does it make sense to partner? There's just so much to go after. What are the criteria for partnership? How do you set effectively or build on the legacy partnerships we have? And then the third would be selective M&A as Marc described that are a niche and adjacency that fits well with our overall strategy that is just logical to make that move rather than to build it ourselves.Got it, thanks very much.Thank you, our next question is from Steve Valiquette with Barclays, please go ahead.Great, thanks. Good afternoon everyone, thanks for taking the question. I guess for me I also have yet another question here in the 2019 revenue guidance. This kinda relates a little bit more to the alternative breakdown of your revenues when you categorize it by the ITWorks, Rev Cycle, Pop Health. Global when core EHR; and I know you gave those 2018 numbers at HIMMS, but really just within the new revenue guidance, I'm just curious should we still may be expecting let's call it double-digit revenue growth for the for faster growth categories within this alternative revenue breakdown to offset what like you to be more flattish revenue trends in core EHR to hit the 2019 revenue growth guidance. And maybe the only quick follow-up on this would be when you were just talking about maybe adding another $250 million of VA revs in 2019, with most of that fall into the core EHR category or would be spread across all these categories? Thanks.Yeah, I think traditionally in the way we presented core through last HIMMS update, core would include federal and I think certainly federal is one place where we expect to see some significant growth. So, I wouldn't  if your question relates to hey, as a lot of the growth can be Works businesses at a low margin, I don't think that's necessarily the case. I think we're gonna get some growth from our core business which includes federal and just as a  give a spoiler alert, but I think the core is going to include that. We may want to give you a view of what federal looks like in a longer term view as well. But I think the  when you look at 2019 revenue growth, you really see kind of a contribution from almost all of the elements of the business because you're going to see when you look at the 7% midpoint growth, I think you're going to see tech resale is get a rebound so there's gonna be a bump up there, that's not real high margin. There will be some license bump from basically a flat growth period.And so, they'll be a little bit of margin expansion there. Subscriptions will be up, services will grow and probably more of the value-added services as opposed to the Works businesses services. And probably growth in hosting as well which is, as you know, pretty high margin stuff. So, I think there are opportunities that don't  for broad growth across the business, but at the end of the day you've also got some growth in expenses and so you're going to end up basically with relatively flat margins. But I think yeah, the growth isn't just coming from one piece of the business. As John said, there's pretty good demand in the marketplace. We have a good pipeline and we are going to, I believe, see contributions from kind of every element on the income statement.Okay, that's helpful and I look forward to hearing more next week.Sounds good, and when we take one last question.Thank you, and our last question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen, please go ahead.Yeah, hey thanks for squeezing me in here. Marc, I just wanted to clarify just a couple of points as it relates to the guidance here. I get the revenue piece. So, when we think about the EPS range and just to bring together a few people's questions before, we should be sort of assuming a share count relatively flat to this year because we're only assuming the share buybacks related to dilution? And then if we assume a 22% tax rate, in terms of other interest income, should we be thinking about similar to this past year or now that we're paying the dividend maybe something a little bit less? And then when I put all those things together, it sounds like earlier you're saying that relatively we should be looking at a flat out margin year-over-year, is that correct? Or when we think about the range here, could it be more little bit down a little bit? I just wanted to piece all those things together. Thanks.Yeah, that's probably a lot to go over, but I think relative to out margins, I think our indication is hey, because of some of the non-cash headwinds that are guidance would say kind of relatively flat, I think that's pretty fair. I think from a share count perspective, just assuming that we are going to offset dilution is probably the best assumption. Relative to interest income, I think our commentary relative to free cash flow is something you'd want to consider that free cash flow will be $100 million less in 2019. So, that will impact interest income. That probably won't be a material difference, but I think that's, if you're doing modeling, those are the things that we said that I would factor into those elements.Obviously, we put in the dividend now and I think people look at that favorably, but you still generate still a lot of cash on top of that and it sounds like the message here is we want to be, I don't want to use aggressive, but more expansive in terms of and how we think about the coin capital. Do things like larger share buybacks factor into that? And thanks a lot for the questions.Sure, as we went through our capital allocation analysis, we felt that from a dividend perspective starting a recurring dividend that we continue to work to grow as earnings grow, I think made the most sense. I think I would much rather leverage my balance sheet in my excess cash on investing back in the business and so I think that's what you'll see us do with the excess cash. We have strong cash flow, but we want to invest in this business and take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us. So, with that, I turn it over to Brent for final comments.Thanks, Marc. Thank you all for your time today. I just want to restate, I've really enjoyed my first year at Cerner getting to know our associates, our capabilities, our clients. I believe we've positioned ourselves well for a good year in 2019 and as we mentioned, we're moving to an operating structure that I believe will allow us to innovate more efficiently, serve clients better, and pursue growth opportunities more effectively and I look forward to seeing you at HIMMS.

The bottom line increased from the prior-year quarter's figure by 8.6%.Revenues totaled $1.37 billion, which improved 3.9% year over year but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39 billion.The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).In 2018, adjusted earnings came in at $2.45 per share, up 2.9% year over year. However, the metric missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46.Revenues amounted to $5.37 billion, which increased 4% year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.39 billion.The Licensed software segment contributed 11.4% to full-year revenues.Meanwhile, the Technology resale segment had 4.6% contribution in the top line.Contribution from Subscriptions was 6.1%.Professional services contributed 33.8% to revenues in 2018.Managed services had a contribution of 21.5%.Support and maintenance, and Reimbursed travel contributed 20.8% and 1.8%, respectively, to 2018 revenues. | Per management, U.S. revenues grossed $1.21 billion, up 4% year over year.Non-U.S. revenues surged by $1 million from the year-ago quarter figure to $161 million. The uptick was mainly driven by strong results in the United Kingdom and Sweden.In the reported quarter, Cerner's bookings totaled $1.96 billion, down from $2.33 billion in the same quarter last year.However, this is the second-highest bookings quarter in Cerner's history.Per management, Cerner registered bookings from long-term contracts (including 6 contracts that were more than $75 million) and multiple transactions.Licensed software revenues fell 1.8% to $166.5 million. Per management, the small scale of the EHR replacement market reduces Cerner's opportunity in the traditional software sector. However, the company expects SaaS to continue growing.Technology resale revenues came in at $46.1 million, down 42% on a year-over-year basis. The metric also came below management's expectations.Revenues from Subscriptions grossed $87 million, down 24.1% year over year.Professional services revenues totaled $466.2 million, up 13.9% from the prior-year quarter number. Per management, this upside was mainly driven by Cerner's Works business.Revenues at the Managed services unit summed $299.1 million, up 14.1% from the prior-year quarter. Per management, the improvement was driven by solid year-to-date bookings.Support and maintenance revenues came in at $276.8 million, up 5.8% year over year.Reimbursed travel revenues amounted to $24.1 million, mirroring a 14.5% decline year over year.In the quarter under review, gross profit summed $1.13 billion, up 4.1% year over year. Gross margin was 82.6%, flat on a year-over-year basis.General and administrative expenses rose 7.4% to $98.9 million. Further, Software development expenses increased 11.7% to $181.5 million.Adjusted operating margin contracted 180 basis points (bps) to 18.7% during the quarter.For the first quarter of 2019, Cerner expects revenues between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. The midpoint of this range is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be 60-62 cents. The range is significantly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents. Business bookings are expected in the range of $1.10-$1.30 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 14% decrease year over year.For 2019, revenues are expected between $5.65 billion and $5.85 billion. The midpoint of this range is $5.75 billion, which misses the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.80 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected between $2.57 and $2.67. The range is significantly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.70.Cerner exited the fourth quarter on a mixed note. While earnings met the consensus mark, revenues lagged the same. However, Cerner continues to witness strong contributions from key areas like, Population Health, Revenue Cycle and IT Works. Strong international performance in the quarter is an added positive. Also, gains in Professional and Managed Services units buoy optimism.Cerner is likely to benefit from its electronic health record (EHR), electronic patient record (EPR) or electronic medical record (EMR) platforms that provide patient care in both acute inpatient and outpatient settings.On the flip side, Cerner's Licensed Software and Subscriptions revenues saw a year-over-year decline in the quarter under review. In fact, management expects low software bookings to negatively impact total bookings in the first quarter as well. Contraction in operating margins too adds to the woes. Furthermore, high long-term debt and competition in the global MedTech space are worrisome.Some better-ranked MedTech stocks that delivered solid performance in their respective quarters are Varian Medical Systems  , AngioDynamics  and CONMED Corporation  .Varian reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.06, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues totaled $741 million, which outpaced the consensus mark of $717.9 million. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).AngioDynamics' fiscal second-quarter adjusted EPS of 22 cents exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Revenues amounted to $91.5 million, which surpassed the consensus estimate by 2.9%. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see CONMED delivered fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of 73 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues of $242.4 million outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $229.2 million.

New ways of managing business with digital systems are leading to more profitable operations and better outcomes for patients and customers.At the heart of the movement, are  (NYSE: VEEV) and  (NASDAQ: CERN) , which provide cloud-based software and information technology solutions.Image Source: Getty ImagesAs technology for healthcare management grows in importance, the companies that provide it have attracted investors' attention. Take  (NASDAQ: ATHN) , which is being bought up by Veritas Capital for $5.7 billion after its sales raced 35% higher over the last trailing three-year stretch. Veeva and Cerner have been growing too, as demonstrated by the below chart, but the two stocks are buys for two very different types of investors.\n  \nTTM = NINE MONTHS ENDING SEPT. 29, 2018 FOR CERNER, AND OCT. 31, 2018 FOR VEEVA SYSTEMS. YOY = YEAR OVER YEAR. DATA SOURCES: CERNER AND VEEVA SYSTEMS.Veeva Systems provides cloud-based software services for the life sciences industry, which includes businesses like healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies.In  , subscription services were up 24% and professional services 30%, which contributed to a 64% gain in adjusted earnings.Veeva has enjoyed double-digit top-line growth for years. It isn't just winning new clients either: Its vast number of software offerings have helped Veeva grow its existing relationships as customers utilize more of Veeva's services over time. This' land and expand' strategy shows little sign of slowing. For the fourth quarter, management expects revenue to increase another 22% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings to grow 74%.However, this fas  expansion comes at a cost. The stock's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is currently 67.1, compared to 15.7 for the S&P 500 index. Paying for decades' worth of expected profits only makes sense if Veeva continues to grow at a breakneck speed, which should happen based on management's forecast, but it also makes this high-flying stock a volatile one.Cerner provides a myriad of services for healthcare providers, from data management systems to compliance reviews and financial management solutions.The company reports its sales in two basic categories: software and subscription services, and professional and managed solutions. During the  , the latter notched strong double digit growth, while lagging software offset those gains. The result has been meager gains for both top and bottom lines -- just 4% during 2018.Nevertheless, Cerner sees improvement coming during the fourth quarter. Revenue and adjusted earnings are expected to increase 5% and 9%, respectively, at the midpoint of guidance. Driving that increase is further strength in professional services and reductions in operating expenses in the quarters ahead.As a result, Cerner's stock is priced lower than Veeva's. Its trailing 12-month price-to-free cash flow ratio (money left over after basic expenses and capital expenditures) is 26.5, and 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is even lower at 20.1 That implies expectations that the bottom line will improve in the next year.Though Veeva and Cerner have similar models, the two stocks are for two very different investors. After a 22% decline in the last year, Cerner might be a value if it can post a rebound and positive guidance when i  s on its fourth quarter. As a larger and slower moving entity, the stock should also be less volatile over time as well -- although the lack of a dividend payment may make it unattractive for investors seeking income.Veeva, on the other hand, is up 81% over the last year, supported by big increases in earnings. However, share prices can move wildly up and down depending on quarterly \"misses\" and \"beats\" relative to investor expectations. While I think Veeva is the better buy here with more robust sales growth and fast-expanding profit margins, potential volatility means it isn't for the faint of heart.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

When those healthcare companies focus on  (SaaS), it's been even more lucrative. This lean business model is capital-light and builds a  around itself via high switching costs and network effects.Case in point: the two companies we're investigating today --the pharmaceutical industry's preferred cloud provider  (NYSE: VEEV) , and  (NASDAQ: CERN) , which specializes in electronic health records and IT. Both handily thumped the market since going public, but which is the better stock to buy today?Image source: Getty Images.When I examine financial fortitude, I have one thing in mind: How will the company be affected by doom, whether it be a broader financial downturn or a problem specific to the company? Fragile organizations with loads of debt become weaker as management is faced with decisions about limiting scope, cutting costs, and exhausting every available resource to stay afloat.But bad times can mean that companies with sizable cash piles grow even stronger -- plucking up competitors at cheap valuations, buying back their own stock at a discount, or simply grabbing market share by lowering prices.Keeping in mind Cerner is about 17% bigger than Veeva by market cap, here's how the two companies stack up:\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Cash includes long- and short-term investments. Free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis.Let's make one thing clear: Both of these companies have very solid balance sheets. But Veeva has an edge. Yes, Cerner has stronger free cash flow, but it also has a debt load that  limit its ability to benefit from a downturn. There's nothing inherently wrong with that debt, which came from acquiring  Health Services a few years back.Veeva looks better suited to benefit from a downturn in the long run, with no debt, a growing cash pile, and free cash flow that could easily accelerate if the company wanted to take its foot off the R&D spending pedal.Next, we can look at each company's valuation. This is part art, part science, and I consult several different metrics to build a holistic picture of how relatively \"cheap\" or \"expensive\" these stocks are:\n  \nData sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E = price to earnings; P/FCF = price to free cash flow; P/S = price to sales; PEG = price/earnings to growth. P/E is based on non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings when applicable.The winner here is clear: Cerner is either as cheap as, or cheaper than, Veeva on virtually every metric. This makes sense because Veeva has been growing much faster than Cerner and investors have driven the price of shares up.But with that excellent performance comes higher expectations, and investors buying into Veeva today will pay a higher price because of those expectations. That makes Cerner appear to be the cheaper stock right now.Finally, we have what I consider to be the most important aspect to evaluate: the durability of a company's competitive advantages, referred to as a company's \"moat.\"Veeva benefits from two huge moats, the strongest of which is high switching costs. Veeva has two broad product lines: the commercial cloud, and Veeva Vault. The former helps drug companies track their sales and use its customer relationship management (CRM) data. The latter is the real driver of growth.Veeva Vault has a  that run the gamut from development to commercialization. Its services help drug companies bring a drug from the idea stage, through clinical trials, gain approval by the Food and Drug Administration, and enter the market. Once a company starts storing all of this data on Veeva's servers, it faces enormous switching costs -- including financial setbacks, lost data, and having to retrain staff on a new interface. This keeps customers locked into Veeva's ecosystem for the long haul, resulting in a revenue retention rate of over 120% for the last three years. In other words, existing customers not only stick with Veeva, but they also add more solutions over time.Importantly, Veeva also benefits from the network effect: Each additional customer makes the service as a whole stronger because Veeva collects data on the more than 400 life-sciences companies on its roster. It can use that data to offer new solutions that aim to solve problems its customers face -- solutions the competition couldn't dream up without similar data.Cerner, on the other hand, also benefits from high switching costs. Once hospitals and healthcare centers start tracking patients' health records on its Millennium platform, they are loath to switch -- for many of the same reasons as above.Two key problems give Veeva the edge here. First and foremost, Cerner has the largest market share of electronic health records systems, at 17.3% -- but there are huge rivals on its heels. Cerner is facing new competition from Epic Systems,  , and  . Veeva's competition in its niche is nowhere near as fierce.Lastly, Cerner doesn't provide a breakout of revenue retention, which is a key metric for determining the company's moat. I'm giving my nod to Veeva here.So there you have it: In a very close contest in terms of financial fortitude and competitive advantages, Veeva comes out ahead. The company does have an expensive stock price, but its moat and money position helped it win this battle.I ran these companies through the gauntlet  . The results since 2017: Veeva has more than doubled, while Cerner's stock is unchanged. I can't promise similar results moving forward, but my own skin is in the game, as Veeva accounts for almost 6% of my family's real-life holdings.If you're looking for a healthcare SaaS stock to invest in today, I suggest starting by doing your own due diligence on Veeva.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Veeva Systems wasn't one of them!

The company is likely to see a soft quarter due to decline in bookings revenues. However, an upbeat guidance for the to-be-reported quarter instils optimism.In the las  ed quarter, Cerner's adjusted earnings came in at 63 cents per share in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The metric also improved from the prior-year quarter's figure by 2 cents.Meanwhile, revenues rose 5% on a year-over-year basis to $1.34 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 63 cents, reflecting growth 8.6% year over year. The same for revenues is pinned at $1.39 billion, mirroring year-over-year growth of 6.1%.Let's delve deeper. | Management at Cerner expects bookings revenues between $1.85 billion and $2.05 billion in the fourth quarter. The midpoint of this range reflects a 16% decrease compared to the company's record high bookings of $2.33 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter bookings is pegged at $2.07 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 11%. Notably, softness in bookings might mar the company's revenue growth.However, strong contributions from large hospitals, community hospitals, and ambulatory venues are likely to aid bookings. For 2018, bookings are expected to be around $6.71 billion, up 6% year over year. Not to forget, Cerner's bookings totaled $1.59 billion, up 42.9% year over year in the third quarter.For the fourth quarter of 2018, Cerner expects revenues between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects 6% year-over-year growth. Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the band of 62-64 cents. The midpoint of this range is 9% higher than the year-ago quarter.Cerner's Reimbursed Travel is likely to be a key catalyst behind the company's top-line growth in the quarter to be reported.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Reimbursed Travel stands at $28.6 million, up 1.5% year over year.Our proven model clearly indicates that a stock needs to have both - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - to deliver a positive earnings surprise.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 5. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This health care information technology company is expected to pos  of $0.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.6%.Revenues are expected to be $1.39 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Cerner, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cerner will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cerner would pos  of $0.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.63, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cerner doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The reason behind such a move is to receive fair tariff concessions from China as well as to stabilize stock markets.However, the report stated that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer opposed the proposal, stating that such a move would make the United States appear weak before China. Despite opposition from Lighthizer, trade sensitive stocks skyrocketed and boosted the overall markets.For the record, a Treasury spokesman later stated that neither Mnuchin nor Lighthizer had made any suggestions \"with respect to tariffs or other parts of the negotiation with China.\"Shares of Morgan Stanley  dipped 4.4% after reporting dismal earnings in the fourth quarter 2018.

We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Computer Programs and Systems has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Cerner has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. This means that CPSI's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CPSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.46, while CERN has a forward P/E of 22.33. We also note that CPSI has a PEG ratio of 1.11. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. CERN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.62.Another notable valuation metric for CPSI is its P/B ratio of 2.47. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

Strong growth for its professional-services business made a key contribution to the healthcare-technology provider's success. But after a weaker first quarter, the big question for the company was whether or not it could keep the momentum going.That question was answered on Thursday. Cerner announced its third-quarter results after the market closed. This time around, the company didn't beat expectations but didn't fall short of them, either. Here are the highlights from Cerner's third-quarter update.Image source: Getty Images.Data Source: Cerner.Cerner's sales for the third quarter were close to the low end of its guidance range of $1.335 billion to $1.385 billion. The company continued to experience solid growth with its professional-services and managed-services businesses. Professional-services revenue increased 13.9% year over year, to $456.7 million, while managed-services revenue jumped 14.8%, to $302 million.However, Cerner also had a couple of glaring weak spots in the third quarter. Licensed-software revenue fell 3.2% year over year, to $139.9 million. Subscriptions revenue plunged 35.4% from the prior-year period, to $79.1 million.In addition, the company posted a drop in  net income from the third quarter of 2017. The decline would have been worse, but Cerner's third-quarter 2018 income taxes were significantly lower than the prior-year period. The reason for the lower GAAP net income is simple: Cerner's spending grew faster than its revenue did.Cerner's expenses increased across the board. The biggest percentage jump came from general and administrative expenses, which were 22% higher than the prior-year period. However, the largest dollar increase in spending came from sales and client service -- $41.3 million greater than the same quarter of 2017.The company still managed to eek out a slight year-over-year boost in adjusted earnings per share (EPS), though. This small increase stemmed primarily from adjusting out higher share-based compensation expense than Cerner reported in the prior-year period.Cerner also reported third-quarter bookings of $1.588 billion, a strong 43% jump from the same quarter last year. The company's total backlog stood at $14.7 billion, slightly below the $14.79 billion backlog at the end of the second quarter of 2018.Cerner Chief Client Officer John Peterzalek stated:Perhaps the best news from Cerner's third-quarter update was that the company expects fourth-quarter revenue between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. The midpoint of the range reflects a 6% year-over-year increase. Achieving this midpoint also would enable the company to beat the midpoint of the full-year 2018 guidance range that it provided earlier this year.Cerner also anticipates fourth-quarter adjusted EPS between $0.62 and $0.64. This reflects a 9% increase at the midpoint from the prior-year period. Hitting this mark would bring Cerner's full-year adjusted EPS to $2.46, within the company's full-year guidance range.One important thing to watch in the days ahead is Cerner's decision on who will replace Zane Burke as president of the company. Cerner announced in September that Burke would step down effective Nov. 2, 2018. Burke joined Cerner in 1996 and served as president since 2013.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ: CERN)Q3 2018 Oct. 25, 2018 , Welcome to Cerner Corporation's Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Today's date is October 25, 2018 and this call is being recorded. The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements including without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating and capital expenses, bookings, solution, services and new offering development and future business outlook, including new markets or prospects for the company's solutions and services.Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements may be found under Item 1A in Cerner's Form 10-K, together with the company's other filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this  can be found in the company's earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC today and posted on the Investors section of Cerner.com. Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation. -- Thank you. Carmen. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to the call. I'll start with a review of our numbers, John Peterzalek, our Chief Client Officer, will follow me with results, highlights and marketplace observations, and then Brent Shafer, our Chairman and CEO, will provide closing comments.Turning to our results, we had a solid Q3 with all key metrics within our guidance ranges. Revenue is at the low end of our guidance range primarily due to lower than expected software and technology resale, which was largely offset by reduced expenses. The Q3 lower level of software is expected, it also impact Q4, even our earnings outlook for Q4 below consensus estimates. I would note that our full year outlook remains within our previously provided full-year guidance range.Our bookings in Q3 were $1.588 billion, which reflects a 43% increase over $1.111 billion in Q3 of '17. Q3 of last year was our lowest bookings quarter, so its an easy comparable, but our year-to-date bookings growth of 19% is also strong. We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $14.7 billion, which is down from $14.79 billion in Q2. Recall the beginning in 2018, our backlog calculations under the new revenue standard excludes revenue potentially impacted by contract termination clauses.Most government contracts have standard termination clauses and as I mentioned before some of our long-term contracts also have them. In our experience, clients rarely exercise its option, so this doesn't change our total long-term revenue opportunity, it just reduces the calculation of backlog.Moving to revenue, which was $1.34 billion in Q3. This is up 5% over Q3 of '17 and as I mentioned at the lower end of our guidance range due to a lower-than-anticipated level of licensed software and technology resale. I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q3 of '17. Licensed software revenue was $140 million, down 3% primarily due to lower than forecasted licensed software bookings in the quarter. This is in part due to the lower level of predictability related to fewer regulatory deadlines as we have discussed in the past.Technology resale increased 6% to $60 million, but was below our forecast. Subscriptions revenue was $79 million in Q3 of '18 down from $123 million in Q3 of '17. As we have discussed subscriptions were impacted by our adoption of the new revenue standard, which reduced subscription backlog and led to us classifying a portion of subscription revenue as support.Professional services revenue grew 14% to $257 million, driven largely by growth in our Works businesses. Managed services increased 15% to $302 million, driven by strong year-to-date bookings. Support and Maintenance was up 5% to $278 million, reflecting on our expected low single-digit growth plus the previously discussed impact of the new revenue standard. And finally, Reimbursed Travel was $24 million, which is flat year-over-year. Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue was up 5% from the year ago quarter, a $1.188 billion, a non-U.S. revenue of $152 million increased 7% from the year ago quarter.Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 82.8%, which is up from 82.5% in Q2 of 2018 and down from 84.1% a year ago. Now, I'll discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or Non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, acquisition related adjustments and other adjustments, all as detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.Looking at operating spending, our third quarter GAAP operating expenses of $903 million were up 9% compared to $825 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were up 9% compared to Q3 of 2017. Looking at the line items, sales and client service expense increased 9% over Q3 of '17. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense, related to our Services business.Sales and client service was down 4% compared to Q2 of 2018. This was driven largely by lower variable compensation, related to the lower software in Q3 and are slightly lowered outlook for the year. Software development expense increased 12%, driven by 5% increase in gross R&D, a 20% increase in amortization and slightly lower capitalized software. G&A expense was up 10% in amortization of acquisition related intangibles, decreased 53% year-over-year.Moving to operating margins, our GAAP operating margin was 15.5% compared to 19.4% in the year ago period. And our adjusted operating margin was 19.2% down from 23.1%. The year-over-year decline in operating margin is consistent with our guidance, which reflects items we have discussed including the higher growth of non-cash expenses, investments in our Works businesses and our increased mix of Works revenue.We continue to believe that many of these factors are temporary in nature. We're also continuing Work related to our profitable growth imperative that includes, looking for ways to operate more efficiently. As we finish this work and finalize the 2019 and long-term plan, we expect to provide an updated view of our margin expansion opportunities.Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $169 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared to $0.52 in Q3 of '17. Adjusted net earnings in Q3 were $209 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.63 compared to $0.61 in Q3 of 2017. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was also 21%, similar to our year-to-date tax rate. Note that for Q4 '18 and next year, we expect our tax rate to be closer to 22%.Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $814 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $886 million in Q2 of '18 with our free cash flow being offset by our $266 million investment in Lumeris' parent company and $58 million of share repurchases. We currently have $582 million of remaining authorization under our repurchase program. Moving to debt, our total debt including capital lease obligations was unchanged from last quarter at $441 million. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.211 billion up from $1.152 billion in Q2 of '18.Our Q3 DSO was 82 days, which is up from 77 days in Q2 of '18, 73 days in the year ago period. The increase in DSO was mostly related to the timing of collecting a small number of large receivable balances. We expect DSO to return to the '70s in Q4. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $338 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $117 million and capitalized software was $66 million. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs was a $155 million for the quarter. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $532 million, which is up 9% compared to last year.We continue to expect growth in operating cash flow for the year to more than offset the increase in capital expenditures, leading to another year of strong free cash flow. Now, I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q4 to be between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 6% over Q4 of 2017 and would bring full year 2018 revenue to $5.396 billion which reflects 5% growth over 2017 and it's about the midpoint of our previously provided full-year guidance range.We expect Q4 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.62 to $0.64 per share. The midpoint of this range is 9% higher than Q4 of '17 and would bring full year 2018 EPS to $2.46, which reflects 3% growth over 2017. We understand while this puts us in our guidance range for the year is below consensus expectations for the quarter which were aligned with the midpoint of our previously provided full-year guidance. The main reason, our Q4 guidance is slightly lower, is that the lower software bookings in Q3 also impact future quarters and the expense benefits that we had in Q3 that offset the lower software are not expected in Q4.Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion, the midpoint of this range reflects a 16% decrease compared to our record high bookings of $2.329 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. With that, it would bring full year 2018 bookings to $6.711 billion which reflects growth of 6% over 2017. Moving to 2019, historically, we've provided a preliminary outlook for the next year on our third quarter call. This outlook is always been based on a high level plan, since our detailed plan is never finalized until after we have ended the year and completed a bottoms-up plan that includes backlog from our Q4 results and our most current sales forecast. For the past two years we finalized our plan and provided guidance on our fourth quarter call. You've had to adjust our outlook. This is not something we like doing given our focus on delivering against expectations, we set.In addition, the process we are undergoing to create our plan is more involved this year. As you know, Brent, has kicked off a series of Work streams, focused on client experience, innovation and profitable growth, all of which are informing our planning process. Brent is also very focused on us delivering against expectations. I believe the result will be a solid strategically focused plan, but we are not at a point to provide a useful preliminary outlook for 2019.We will as usual, provide 2019 guidance on our Q4 . Please don't take this change, we will provide a preliminary view of our -- on our Q3 call as a sign that we expect our outlook to be poor. While there are some challenges in the near-term environment that we've discussed, we still believe we can deliver solid revenue and earnings growth next year.We just want our guidance to be based on more -- on a more complete plan. As we mentioned, we're also working on a three-year strategic plan. We expect to use this combined with our 2019 plan as a basis for a more detailed discussion on our investor meeting during HIMSS which we plan to have on the morning of February 13th. At that time, we will share more detail on our views and expectations for long-term growth, margin expansion, cash flow and capital allocation.With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane. -- Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll provide comments on my new role and then I'll cover Q3 results in the current marketplace environment. As you know, Zane Burke will be stepping down effective November 2nd. I'd like to thank Zane for his 22 years of contributions to our clients, the industry in Cerner. With this transition I am privileged to assume his responsibilities as Chief Client Officer, which is a new role and a title the reflects our increased emphasis on the success of our clients. As a 15 year Cerner associate with 30 plus years in the industry. I've spent most of my career working with clients and sales, delivery and the ongoing relationships in healthcare around the world.As a leadership team, we will continue to reinforce our client first philosophy at Cerner. This means we will double down on our efforts to put our clients' success at the center of everything we do and ensure that we consistently deliver value. This is a critical component of maintaining Cerner's growth and success and I believe this focus will allow us to continue playing a key role into transformation of healthcare.With that, I'll turn to discuss on Q3 results.Our results for the quarter were solid with the exception of the lower technology resale and software and its impact on revenue in the quarter and our Q4 earnings outlook. As Marc indicated we grew our bookings 43% in Q3 and our year-to-date bookings growth is 19%. In Q3, the percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts was in a normal range at 34% including the addition of an IT Works client. We also had a good quarter from a new business standpoint with 30% of bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base.Bookings included broad contributions from large hospitals, community hospitals and ambulatory venues. In addition, we continue to have good contributions from our key growth areas with population health, revenue cycle and IT works all having solid quarters. Regarding population health, I wanted to provide an update on the relationship with Lumeris', which we announced last quarter, as you recall, we are launching an EHR agnostic offering with Lumeris' called Maestro Advantage that will be designed to help health systems set up and manage Medicare Advantage Plans and provided-sponsored health plans.Additionally Lumeris' is adopting HealtheIntent as the platform for its clinical methodology and advanced analytics. Since we announced our collaboration in July, we have been focused on mobilizing our joint Cerner and Lumeris' teams, launching our joint development efforts in kicking off our roadshow activity across the targeted list of prospective clients. We have visited with over a dozen prospective clients that are either evaluating to launch of a Medicare Advantage contract or beginning with an intermediate step to optimizing multi-payer arrangements.We also touch many of our clients during our Cerner health conference. The feedback we received has been very positive. I'd like to share a few observations from these initial interactions. Our clients are all at different stages, that experience with value-based payments, many have had modest success with subside only agreements, such as an accountable care organization or Medicare shared savings programs. They are now considering expansions in the contracts, were they can capture a more significant portion of the premium dollar for value they provide through care delivery.Next, Medicare Advantage has emerged as an attractive opportunity for leading health systems to expand their value based care programs. Our rapidly growing senior population, lower churn and the higher premiums are all contributing to -- contributing forces that make MA a desirable options. Finally, our clients have also acknowledge the importance of change in management and hiring experienced partners. We believe the combination of technology-enabled services and strong operational expertise that Maestro Advantage brings makes for a compelling solution. While we're still early in our journey. We are pleased with our clients that responded and look forward to continue to update you on our progress.Next, I'd like to provide an update on our federal business. Starting with the Department of Defense MHS Genesis project, we recently kicked off our broader deployment by beginning implementations at four additional sites. We believe these sites will benefit from the optimization efforts that followed our initial go lives. Also it is worth noting that one of our initial sites has already achieved HIMSS Level 6, which is further evidence of the progress made since we went live last year.Moving to the Department of Veterans Affairs after signing the contract in Q2, activity continued as expected with three more task orders signing in Q3. These task orders along with the work that began after the first set of task orders kept us on track to steadily ramp our work on the project as we finished 2018 and moving to 2019. The first major project milestones will be in 2020 with initial sites are scheduled to go live. Moving to our business outside the U.S., we had another solid quarter with 7% revenue growth. This was driven by good results in the UK, Sweden, the Middle East and Canada.Before turning the call over to Brent. I'd like to provide some comments about the marketplace and how we're looking at our growth potential. As we've discussed we operate in an environment where providers are financially challenged and don't always have a high sense of urgency to make purchase decision due to fewer regulatory deadlines incentives.However, there is a counterforce in that, and that value-driven solutions do carry a sense of urgency and our solutions and services line with many of the challenges faced by providers to create value. As a result, we believe we have several sources of growth that position us to deliver solid results in this environment. Our federal business is clearly an important foundation to this growth with the DoD beginning to ramp, and the VA now getting started, we have visibility to solid growth contributions for several years. Execution on these projects will be key, given the importance not only to Cerner but also to our active and retired service members.In the EHR marketplace replacement opportunities remain and we continue to do well competitive for new business. Although many of the opportunities are smaller with less software. Beyond new footprint opportunities, our large existing footprints represent meaningful whitespace for us to cross-sell our solutions and services. We continue to believe that revenue cycle, ITWorks and population health can contribute significantly to our growth, while population health is still in an early stage and this ramps slower than we initially projected, we remain confident, we will become a large contributor to growth in coming years.We believe that HealtheIntent is unmatched in depth and breadth and that our path to adding meaningful services contributions to our population in health revenue is now defined with our Lumeris' collaboration. Finally, our non-U.S. business continues to grow and it represents an earlier stage EHR market opportunity than the U.S. As well as an opportunity for nearly all of the other solutions and services I discussed.In summary, I believe Cerner is well positioned to deliver solid results in the coming years, as we have solutions and tech-enabled services that align with the needs of our end markets. Healthcare is still in the initial stages of getting value out of the digitization that has occurred over the past decade, and we believe we're in a great position to play a significant role in helping healthcare stakeholders move toward a more efficient and higher quality system of care.With that, I'll turn it over to Brent. -- Thanks a lot John. Good afternoon, everyone. John, I think -- did a very good job describing the significance of his new role and the marketplace dynamics that we're experiencing. John's perspective has been an instrumental in our leadership teams analysis of the complex healthcare environment we are in, and the development of strategies for more closely aligning with our clients and increasing our responsiveness to their needs.As a result, operational and client-facing teams are becoming joined at the hip. This feels good internally and we believe this is a difference our clients will notice as we move into 2019. I also want to -- take a moment and thank John and congratulate him on this well deserved recognition for the new role he is been playing. I'd also like to echo John's, thank you to Zane for his distinguished service to Cerner over the years.Now, I'd like to share more detail on our client-centric focus. As you know, we recently hosted thousands of clients at our annual Cerner Health Conference. During my presentation, I made several commitments to our clients which define our framework for delivering value in this era. These commitments are an expression of the strategic planning work, I've referenced in prior calls, and I'd like to touch on them briefly today. The first commitment is that we will relentlessly advance our clients' success. This commitment is the frame for every other decision we made. There's a real focus on disciplined execution. If we have excessively focused on making our clients successful, we can't go wrong.Our next commitment is to imagine design and implement intelligent health networks. Health care delivery organizations are facing tremendous challenges in their environment. From primary care shortages to demographic driven differences to shifts in policy and payment methods. The provision of care is increasingly moving out of high acuity settings and into the community. Lower acuity prevention and intervention strategies are becoming critically important to payers and consumers and for our clients, it's all about the network they can build within their zip codes to reach people where they are, and deliver meaningful care and prevention strategies.We see a big strategic opportunity and helping our clients build networks that can be activated to improve care across the full continuum, and we believe our HealtheIntent platform and our Lumeris collaboration will be key enablers of this strategy and commitment. The third commitment is to make better healthcare experiences and outcomes our duty. We see an opportunity, that focused on improving healthcare experiences and outcomes, both for the patients and consumers seeking a healthier life, and for the providers who are overwhelmed by new world of evidence based compliance.The fourth and final commitment is that we will become the partner of choice for healthcare innovation. Our experience over multiple decades in building intelligent digital platforms makes Cerner, a natural home for powerful innovation and partnerships. We love to build things and we're not going to stop. But the open era ahead is also full of opportunities to partner with clients and companies to create even more value by working together.Ultimately, as we execute on these commitments and deliver value for our clients. I expect it to fuel the transformation for Cerner. We are creating an operating model that's designed to support innovation that scale which we believe will lead to ongoing value creation for our clients and we'll be central to us delivering profitable growth and creating shareholder value.Now, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for Q&A.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. -- Thanks, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just quickly, so you're not providing any guidance today between '19, we all know that now obviously, but you did previously talk about a focus on margin expansion for 2019 and that, that is still part of a -- a meaningful part of the investment thesis for some investors for next year. So I guess, I'm just curious to see if you're able to at least confirm that margin expansion is still part of your focus for the company in 2019. Thanks. -- Yeah, this is Marc. I mean, clearly, we've talked about margin expansion as part of our focus for beyond 2019 as well. I think as we look at the kind of the numbers that are out there, particularly the consensus number that's out there, I think, if you apply, an operating margin to get to that, that model, you're probably looking at, well over 100 basis points of margin expansion, which is way beyond the 30 basis points to 60 basis points that we think is kind of what is in our preview for an annual growth level.Once again I want to be careful about talking about '19, until we get a much better view, but we clearly expect to continue expanding margins. I talked about us being able to grow revenue and grow earnings next year and that we -- we see solid growth for the company, but I think it's -- it's certainly as part of our plan. We've got a lot of strategic growth in front of us. We want to be able to fund that growth, we'd like to take existing spend and go fund that new option -- new opportunities and I think that's going to be a part of our focus as we land 2019.Certainly, 2019 continues to have the headwind of significant increase in non-cash expenses and so those are, while they're not increasing as much as they did in '18, they still are going to grow up in '19. So I think that's something that we're going to factor into our plan as well, but once again the 30 basis points, 60 basis points we've talked about is certainly our overall goal and is where we can fit into that range as we look into 2019, we will be able to share with you once we land our plan. -- Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. -- Yeah, hi good afternoon. Just going back to see your prepared remarks, will you talk about the replacement opportunity where you see some smaller opportunities. Can you talk a little bit about what has changed this year that impact your views on the replacement market. Also, if you can just give us some more color on the bookings this quarter what came from kind of like new clients and new opportunities versus expansion of long term contract. Thank you. -- Ricky, thanks for the question. This is John. I will talk about the replacement market in general and Marc can share, if you want to churn on the booking side. But I'm not sure anything's changed on the replacement market and, we're seeing that the replacement market is an active market, my comment about smaller deals, I would view more to new business opportunities, we have -- we haven't necessarily made a selection or are making a selection or transition to a new platform.So the replacement market is still active and strong, and as I had mentioned in my comments, the new business market remains strong as well. The only difference is, the new business -- they tend to be smaller entities, which come with smaller bookings and smaller software, which we discussed. But I feel very, very good about both the replacement market and the new business market in the U.S. -- Hi Rick, this is Marc. I think our percent from new, was with similar to what we have seen, it is around 30% which is kind of consistent with what we see, and I would echo John's comments that really the market continues to be the market we've seen coming into the year. It's an active market, some of the opportunities are smaller, but it's in our market that our pipeline would indicate, is going to continue into 2019. -- And some of your competitors are struggling this year, are you seeing more RFPs activities as a result of that? -- I would say that to -- I see a very consistent level of RFPs and in the spaces where the RFP has come out, which we've crossed a little over in that conversation into outside of the U.S., where the procurement is largely RFP brace, but all procurement's generally have some component RFP, but I don't see a change in the volume and we are working every day, very diligently respond RFPs. We don't have a lack of volume there. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. -- Hey, guys. So maybe -- what in your mind, would it take for there to be a return to sort of growth in the licensed software line, sort of above the corporate average, which would obviously help in terms of your margin expansion goals, because it seems like a lot of the revenue growth, this year is coming from some of your lower margin segments and so that's obviously hard to offset on the expense lines. So just give us the picture of that transition, of what gets that growth rate back, if we're not seeing a big change in sort of the replacement market. -- Yeah, I think, this is Marc. We continue to see opportunities on that replacement market side, but from a license perspective, clearly we've kind of indicated that the government opportunities we have as those task orders get signed, some of those task orders will include chunks of software, so that certainly is a prop -- maybe something that not everybody is fully considering as far as an opportunity in a market that is beyond the replacement market. It's kind of a brand new market, if you will, so the software opportunities on the federal side and the government side are pretty significant when you combine that with the replacement market side, we see and selling back into our base of new innovations we create, we think that gives us a pretty good runway to get us to where our HealtheIntent platform is starting to kick-off more of the SaaS business and more of our licenses recurring business that hits the top line, with the higher margin.So I think, probably when you asked the question, I think the government business, maybe, the one that is not getting the full view as far as the impact they can have relative to software. -- And maybe two other quick things. One Marc, can you just give us what 605 revenue growth is for the year or what we've seen so far just so we know apples-to-apples? And then secondarily on the the balance sheet, the free cash flow obviously is coming in a bit, you don't have a lot of leverage, I guess, how are you thinking after Lumeris just about capital allocation into kind of next year and prioritizing repurchases versus tuck-in M&A. -- Yeah, I mean, relative to 605. I don't know that I have that number right off, the top of my head to tell you what that impact is for the year. I think, it will be -- we disclose that on a quarterly basis in the Q. I would also kind of indicate that when you look at the disclosures that are in the queue relative to 605 versus 606, this is the new revenue standard, you have to take into account, that basically takes whatever new contracts get signed. Looks at the specific language in those contracts and then applies the old rules and the new rules.In this 606 era, our contracts are different. There is flexibility in that era that we're taking advantage of that our clients appreciate, that doesn't change the revenue recognition that is appropriate and so we apply those contract terms. 605, one of the issues with 605 was you could have a $0.01 in the contract that could result in making the revenue defer for an indefinite amount of time. So when you see a comparison between 605 and 606, we could have continued contract in under our old methodology and our old terms and there wouldn't be any difference in new contracts between 605 and 606, or there would be a very little -- small difference.So, I think trying to focus on 605 to 606, at least as far as the disclosures that are required, isn't a very valuable exercise, it's a little bit like trying to look at the current backlog that we have under 606 versus 605. There's a lot of contracts as we mentioned in my prepared comments, that have, has cancellation clauses in them, don't ever get -- don't get triggered, but they're in there and since they're in there, they don't get included in backlog and that's hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue in the next 12 months that's not sitting in our backlog today. So once again, trying to look at the backlog number and get a good sense of what's going to have as the company is difficult.Overall, we're still going to drive out in the 12-month period over 80% of our revenue out of backlog, trying to figure that out from looking at the 606 backlog number, will be a little bit challenging. I think from a capital allocation standpoint, we will visit this more more deeply when we do our HIMSS presentation, but I think it's pretty consistent with what you've seen us recently talk about is, we continue to want to do share buybacks, certainly to the offset dilution and potentially at a slightly higher level than that, I think our Lumeris is a great example of us leveraging the balance sheet for an opportunity to make an investment that we think, gets us to a future growth opportunity more quickly than we'd be able to do it on our own. I think that's going to be something you'll see us incorporate as part of our going-forward capital allocations strategy, but more to come on that when we start to you guys in February. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with RBC. -- Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the call. I guess, Marc, kind on the Q3 bleeding into Q4 software weakness. I guess how long should we expect that to drag on, and give it under the new accounting standards, like how long does the short, I guess just the weakness in the short term software bookings and software revenue recognition, how long -- what is the duration of that weakness that we should expect to see in the income statement. -- Well, I think you've got -- to the extent that some of that license gets deferred, it's obviously doesn't hit the current quarter, but it will hit future quarters. So, it actually will -- at some point benefit a future period, more than it would, if the revenue coming sooner. For Q3, some of the issue was just lower software sales. So that doesn't -- that doesn't get made up in -- from an accounting standpoint or from a rollout standpoint that gets made up by going and taking those transactions that are still in the pipeline and getting them to get across the line and driving that software -- software sale and therefore the software revenue from it.So the key point we were making relative to Q4 and lower Q3 bookings is under 606, there is a bigger percentage of the revenue that is not recognized currently in the quarter, more of that gets pushed out to later quarters and to the some -- so if that number is lower in Q3, the amount that gets pushed out to Q4 is also lower and impacts us, and then obviously on the spend side, there was benefits in Q3 that we got because of our -- from the incentive comp side adjusting for the lower, full year outlook that won't be repeated in Q4. -- Okay, that's helpful. And maybe a quick kind of follow-up for John. I guess, how do we think about, there is the couple of pending rules with the government right now and interoperability in data blocking. I guess, if they go through, it is particularly the data blocking one, how do we think about which kind of sub-segments get advantaged or disadvantaged by these regulatory changes, and I think about things like the interface business that I know has historically been like a lucrative small sub-market for Cerner, I guess, maybe just talk about the -- maybe the interface segment of the business is that -- is that something that you see is at risk given proposed regulatory changes, and just whatever has happened in there? -- My first reaction would be not really at risk because, interoperability and interfacing are kind of two different things and we've been on record many times, is saying that we view the interoperability as a right that data block that are not been interoperable is -- cannot be -- have to be interoperable and sharing data between the entities and we'll continue to do that. So, to answer your first part of your question, I think we're really strong if those -- if those reputations come -- and they will, there will be more interoperability regulations coming whether it's now or later.I think we're really well positioned and that frankly have been leaders around interoperability, but I think what we do on interfaces is different and there'll always be a need for -- interfaces between systems and technical systems and those type of things. So I don't see that as a huge threat. -- Okay, I appreciate the color. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird. -- Hey, thanks for the question. I wanted to come back to the software bookings for the quarter and, you'd mention that as one of the main drivers to the lower margins for the back half. Can you tell us what solution categories were softer or where there specific deals that slipped -- that'll come back or do you think it was just more of the lack of regulatory pressure that's making a less predictable? -- This is Marc. Clearly from a regulatory guide -- timeline perspective, yeah, there isn't anything that's forcing clients to go -- to go get deals done and I think that Q3 traditionally has been at a lower software quarter and I think we saw that more of this -- this quarter than we might have had in prior years. So, I think that's the impact. There is still -- as John said, the market is still active, there is still software out there to go get, we just didn't get a much of it in Q3, certainly we would expect to get some more software on Q4, which is -- and usually our indication -- what our history to do that, but it's not going to offset some of the Q3 shortfall. -- Okay and then maybe asking about the VA contribution to revenue and how that -- based on the task orders it seems like there is maybe even 500 million in bookings so far from the first task orders. Can you give us any sense for how that flows into revenue. Is that a multiyear saying or will we see the bulk of it in 2018 and 2019? -- Yeah, the way the revenue flows in from those contracts, it varies a lot of -- primarily it's percent of completion, for the most part, a lot of that is services-oriented, so that flows in basically as the work gets done. So some of those task orders can be longer term, some of them are relatively shorter term. So, it will vary with the task order -- I mean, our practice is -- we're not going to refer to a specific client and provide revenue numbers to come from that specific client.So to the extent that you've got a sense of what the bookings are, and kind of what the, total opportunity is, that will probably throw flow out, it could be anywhere from 12 months to 24 months depending on what the specific task order is looking at. The government yearly contracts and -- while the overall opportunity is 10 billion, the task order is usually contracted for in shorter period of chunks that can be somewhere in that time period, but it will vary by task order so by trying to broadly apply a certain timeframe to a certain bookings number is going to be a little problematic to pick a quarter of what the revenue contribution is.We've kind of talked about -- over time that -- we expect somewhere in the 2022 time frame that continue being successful in that area that we could have task orders that would drive $1 billion of annual revenue, but to path up there is not going to necessarily be linear. So it'll -- they'll be especially at the start, when you do a lot of preliminary work at some of your initial sites that is a good work, but it's -- it's limited to a few sites and therefore not spread across many sites which would drive us a higher level of revenue.So that's -- hopefully that gives you a little bit of color, but we're not going to give you a precise numbers to any of our clients contribution to our revenue. -- Got it. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. -- Hi. Can you talk a little bit more about the population health management and your deal with Lumeris. When can you increase your PMPM rate? And when can you store providing deeper services because it seems to me like, that's really the future of where Healthcare IT is moving. Thanks. -- Sure, David. This is Marc. I'll just take it take a short. At the, Lumeris certainly we absolutely believe it is an area of population health, kind of combines value based care and all the elements that are hitting healthcare today that we think is a huge opportunity for us, and as we said last quarter, the actual financial impact on us is going to be fairly limited early on because most of the work that's going to be done is initial work with clients, maybe doing some surveys and doing some initial consulting work, as they look to see if they are ready to set up plans and by the time a client or provider decides that they're going to set up a plan, you probably year and half, two years down the road, they're going to set up the plan, they're going to have an initial group of members that membership will then grow.So it's -- as we said it's probably a three year, four year time frame before you're going to see anything meaningful being contributed financially by that business, but during that time we're spending a lot of time talking to our clients, prospecting making sure they understand where we're going to have available, and then working with Lumeris, unleveraging the HealtheIntent platform to be the platform that basically empowers our MA efforts. So, all in part -- as part of our plan, but it's not a quick impact on the financial statements. This an investment in the future that we think will pay off handsomely once it gets to provision. -- Okay. And then in three year or four years, what could your PMPM collectively be $15, $20. Any sense for that? -- Yeah. David we talked a little bit about the fact that just selling tools is probably $3 to $4 type PMPM, but if we can add in a set of services from a technology care, management other areas that we think are things that we could provide from a service that leverages the technology. Once again, we don't like to get into service business that doesn't leverage technology, that the potential to get to somewhere around $15 plus PMPM, it's certainly very reasonable and that's that given your other $3 to $4 PMPM, being able to deliver something that's four to five times that -- from that same membership base, is very attractive. -- Thanks very much. -- Sure.Thank you. And our next question comes from Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. -- Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, maybe just on the software revenue during the quarter in bookings. Can you give us any more color on the type of software that maybe you saw little softness in, I mean, was it clinical, you've made a couple of comments about, they're aren't necessarily regulatory drivers right now, or was it on the revenue cycle side, maybe were they're not mega deals in the quarter, this quarter maybe like you saw last quarter, just any color there would be great? -- Yeah, this is John and I think if you look at our software mix itself -- there -- isn't one thing, I think it was purely a volume thing that, we still sell across all of our software components whether their clinical or outside of the clinical or those type of things, anything they carry software. There wasn't a particular weakness in any area and it was just a issue of, and not as many larger things coming through. -- Yeah, Jamie, once again -- this is pretty -- it's an era where things are going to be lumpy, and Q3 is traditionally for the lumpiness usually hits and getting deals done is more challenging and there isn't usually the incentive from a fiscal year's perspective on the client that get something to accomplished. So I think as much as anything, as I look at the -- the tea leaves at the end, that's kind of what it is. There wasn't any lack of desire on any of this solutions we offer, and I think our pipeline, definitely shows the activity in it that would indicate there is a lot of interest and people coming to market, and looking to go by software. -- And if you look at our software pipeline, the software pipeline is broad there's -- and so currently I'm optimistic about that -- whether to keep -- to keep working on the software side. We have a lot of innovations available. We create new innovations, we do every day and our pipeline shows there is a demand for it. -- Okay, that's great. Just maybe one other question on the bookings outlook for Q4. I know it's down year-over-year, we had a very difficult comp. It's still a very, very high number on an absolute basis. I think last quarter you guys said that you had a number of IT Works deals that were in the pipeline. Is that -- maybe a decent building block for the confidence in the bookings number that you've got it for in Q4. -- I think the confidence number in Q4 comes from there. We have a series of a relatively large items that we've been working on for quite a while that have come to land in Q4, so it's a little bit of the services side, it's a little bit of some larger things that have worked their way through the process that will land in the quarter. So, I think it's just a good strong quarter as we have a lot of times in Q4 as things build up through the year, but nothing in particularly other than some, some larger items that are coming to rest. -- Yeah, Jamie. I think as you indicate, it's down year-over-year. It will be -- if we deliver the second highest quarter in the history of the company as you intimated, and I think -- I think the mix will probably be very similar to what you normally see in a strong quarter. So I don't think there's going to be anything that's driving that number higher or changing the mix and ratio of kind of long-term and not long-term. -- Okay, thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Garro with William Blair. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about the long-term margin outlook and maybe more specifically progress on IT Works and RevWorks on the cost side, whether you have any insight into the -- if the profitability of those businesses has grown through -- or grown through this year or been way down a little bit by investments and how we should think about the longer-term margin expansion potential of those businesses with growth and scale. -- Yeah, this is Marc. We talked earlier in the year about certainly making investment in our revenue cycle at RevWorks outsourcing that we are hiring people in Kansas City to basically kind of jump-start our local billing office there, and I think we're up to almost 500 people in that effort at this point. So that's going along well, I think we're, so that acts -- that's clearly was a drag on that businesses earnings. That business margin basically expands as we are able to get those clients to fully utilize both from the clinician side as well as the billing side, the Cerner software that allows them to basically -- to clinically drive that billing.And I think that's -- that is a clear element that's going to, over the long term, allow us to grow the margins of that business. So, I said we don't like to be in services business that isn't going to have a technology impact, but we can drive better margins. And I think you're going to, you'll see that in that business. That business is pretty young, clearly, just rebadgeds all the people in our largest client, and really made a big addition to that workforce in this year. So it is early, it's an investment phase for that.From an ITWorks standpoint, the services component of that is still in the single-digit margins, but when you combine all of the elements of an ITWorks client, which is, as you know, additional software, they get sold into, then the support, all of the other elements that occur, those clients are 40% margin clients, so they're already contributing significantly. Our goal there is to continue to grow above the 30 plus, we already have today and to be able to centralize those functions and gain that leverage by having a single source of support for a lot of these systems that those clients are running.So it's early on, I mean when we talk about margin expansion in long term, for the opportunity and how you continue -- how do you keep growing margins, driving 30 basis points, 60 basis points on the annual basis. Those things right now are more anchors and against that, then they are contributing toward it. Ideally in next couple of years we'll see that start moving or we'll start incrementing up those margins and allowing them to be incrementing up to our total margins, but right now those are investment phases, both on to some extent and they eventually will be drivers of our margin growth but certainly in the out years. -- Great, that's very helpful. Then one more question if I could, I want to ask about HealtheIntent and specifically your progress, selling HealtheIntent outside of the Millennium base and to non-health system provide our clients and just kind of where those efforts fit in your priorities? -- This is John. Actually, it's a large priority to get outside of the volume base as we'd mentioned multiple times that one of the -- not only is HealtheIntent, obviously strong within our current client base, but by design, it's EHR agnostic, it can work in many different environments. And I think we've had a reasonable success in going outside of a core Millennium client and it is a high priority. Since its expansion into an area that's new, Greenfield for us and not only on the provider side, but maybe in, and what we'd have is non-traditional clients on the payer side and those types of things. So, I think it's very powerful platform to get outside of our current client base and have some opportunities out there.And we see this key, and certainly in states as well, because I think, that's probably, that one of the, certainly in the Medicaid area where HealtheIntent can be of a valuable tool for states as they look to manage those fairly diverse populations. -- Great. Thanks for taking the questions. -- Sure.Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephanie Demko with Citi. -- Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. Just to continue on that thought of expanding outside of your current client base, and given your large data stores. Have you ever look at some initiatives on data monetization and how that can maybe impact the margin model? -- Yeah, this is Marc. Certainly data is like the magical lecture that everyone thinks has huge independent value and there is -- certainly is some truth to that, but I think it's how you're going to use that data and in medical world, you have to have the right to use that data. So, we spent a lot of time with our clients preparing them and making them capable to use that data to better manage the health of that patient to better manage them when they are, in an episodic condition within the hospital, that's the key debuts, and we certainly have some business relative to de-identify data and using that in a broader context, but it's still early, we still think there is an opportunity to use that data and create more of a business, but there is a lot of regulatory limitations as to what you can do with medical data today.And so I think anybody that's talking about medical data and is not paying attention to what those limitations are, can be overstating what somebody -- at least near term opportunities are. I think the opportunity to get past some of those limitations, to get universal consents. That is something that eventually is going to make that data valuable, but today near term, that's not a focus, that I can see. -- Understood. I wanted to follow-up on the DoD blast (ph) from the past there, but what are your counterparts on that mentioned this morning that the Genesis ramp was seeing some elongation this year. Could you talk, if you're seeing into similar cadence or if this is kind of a one-off in this specific issue? -- Was the question that you're seeing some delay on the Genesis side, I mean, I didn't get the whole question clearly. -- No, I was saying that they're seeing some elongation there. So I just like take similar or that isn't a one-off. -- This is Marc. From our standpoint, we've implemented the first four, we've actually been authorized to go the next four. So in our view that project is moving along well, and is on track. So, it may be another supplier specific issue, but for us, the DoD is a great client and they want move forward quickly and we are moving along.Our four live sites are going as planned. They're in the optimization note as planned and the authorization perform more, we're often running and should see Go lives there and in early 2020, the go live date is. So we believe then, we did back in on that, that we're making -- we're on target what we've been asked to do and what we committed to do. -- All right, awesome to hear. Thank you, guys. -- Thanks.Thank you. And our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. -- Oh, yeah, hey thanks for taking the question. Hey just wanted to maybe clarify something around the VA as well -- as well as DoD, if I recall correctly with DoD all the software related bookings went to you and then the rest are sort of divvied up with Leidos being sort of the prime contractor. I know the VA, its a little bit more flipped here, but I know you mentioned earlier that, well you can think about license software in the future coming from the government side, are any of those revenues shared with sort of your partners going forward on the VA side or is that all still coming back to Cerner. -- Yeah, no that all comes back to Cerner from both -- from the VA, the DoD whereas sub, Leidos is the prime. So all the dollars go to Leidos, and then they contract with us and we received the value for the license and other components that we are asked to provide their. For the VA all the revenue flows through us, we then payout our third party partners but that means all of the software license stays with us as well. -- Okay. And have you -- and I can't recall do you have given sort of the split in terms of what you -- we should expect for you guys to keep in terms of the -- on the VA side, I think you've given some kind of basic parameters but wondered if you, if you you share anything more there? -- At this point, it's still early to tell on the -- for the long term exactly how much of the work we will perform and how much our partners will perform. I mean, we threw out a 50-50 split at some point just to try to do math, but I think, -- I think that's still to be determined. We're pretty early in that process and with the task orders given a lot of them are initial, a lot of that work is, work we're doing, but some of our partners are doing part of it as well, but once it But once it really cranks up, we're still a little early on deciding exactly what share that work -- that we'll perform and what share our partners will perform. -- Okay. And just one follow up, you talked about 2022, we could be looking at about $1 billion a year in terms of work. If we were trying to model that out a little bit, should we think of it more as a linear ramp or would you say it's still kind of small next year and even maybe 2020 and then ramps kind of quickly into 2022? Thanks. -- Yeah. I think, its the ramp-up of VA, as we said, is not necessarily going to be linear. It could be a little bit lumpy depending on what work is being done, kind of slower start, and then once it gets up to scale, there's a lot to go do. So you'll have multiple projects going on, so that ramp can be probably more back-end loaded than just front-end loaded. -- Okay. Thanks you. -- Why don't we take one more call. Thanks, Charles.Thank you. And our last question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. -- Great, thanks for sneaking me in. Most of the stuff on the quarter has been asked and answered. I guess, just if I think back to CHC, Brent, I know you made some comments around, reprioritizing some of the R&D initiatives. Longer term, and talking about -- wanting to focus in on making bigger R&D bets.So just wanted to follow up there and see if maybe you'd be willing to share a little bit more on what areas, in particular, you are excited about funding. And then just more for clarity, should we think about the reprioritization of R&D over time as an overall lower spend, or is this just kind of a reallocation of where dollars are actually spent in R&D? And thanks so much. -- Yeah. Thanks for your question, Bob. We are kind of right in the thick of it as we speak and in fact, just had a two-day session with kind of our top 50 leaders today and we've got about eight weeks -- eight to nine weeks of grinding through the details in front of us. But there's kind of two pieces. One is the efficiency of the spend and making clear choices to get maximum return, because given the breadth of our portfolio and the variety of things we touch, one of the concerns is, if you put just a little bit on everything, do you really maximize your returns?And so, it's really looking at making good choices on the areas that have best return, and in many cases, best return in the next couple of years in line with the strategic direction we're starting to outline here. So, we'll certainly share more detail with you as we get through that, but we're in the thick of it right now. But hopefully, gives you real -- -- Yeah. I would just indicate that relative to total R&D, it's not our expectation to reduce our R&D spend. We have a lot of opportunities. This is a sector and we're in a position where we have -- the issue we have is trying to pick which opportunities we think are going to be the big bets. So, our expectation is continued spending on R&D, but as Brent said, we want to be very thoughtful. If things aren't going to become $100 million businesses then let's refocus what we're spending in that space and put it in things where we think it can go to that size.So with that, I thank everybody for the questions and I turn it over to Brent for closing. -- Yeah. Maybe just a couple comments. One, I think is significant given that what we announced at CHC, but we saw bipartisan legislation passed today on opioids which is amazing in and of itself to see bipartisan legislation, but it was signed today, and for those of you that follow CHC, we announced an opioid toolkit. And that is really about improved state database access and predictive analytics for high-risk patients and advanced clinical decision support for opioid prescribing. So -- and we know how deep and broad this crisis is and how much it's impacting the country. So, we really think that's a great example of how technology can be leveraged to help providers with a real need in our country.So, And I appreciate your time today, and I want just to reinforce that we're very focused on setting attainable expectations and then delivering on them and we remain absolutely focused on significant long-term opportunities that are in front of us. I mentioned I had the opportunity to spend two full days with our, basically top 50 leaders in the business, and coming out of that really looking at some of our opportunities is just really encouraging about where we're positioned and the opportunities ahead, and we think we have a real significant opportunity to play a meaningful role in the transformation of healthcare.And I think, for us at Cerner, recognizing that as we look at our portfolio and our investment plans, just some transformation of our own that we need to do to make sure we're positioned well for the opportunities in front of us -- and that's what we've been referring to. And I mentioned it briefly, but part of that work is creating an operating model that is really designed to support innovation at scale, as we are at scale now and want to continue to scale. So having a consistent approach to that as we continue to grow is real important. And that's all about delivering ongoing value creation to our clients and will be very central to us, delivering profitable growth and creating shareholder value.So thanks very much for joining us and have a great evening.And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may all disconnect.

Moreover, absence of any positive news either on the trade war front or in the form of economic data made investors skeptical about investing in risky assets like equities. All three major stock indexes closed fell sharply.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 23,592.98, plunging 2.1% or 507.53 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also shed 2.1% to close at 2,545.94. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,753.73, declining 2.3% or 156.93 points. A total of 9.44 billion shares were traded on Monday, higher than the last 20-session average of 8.01 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 5.55-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 4.31-to-1 ratio. The CBOE VIX increased 13.4% to close at 24.52, its highest close in seven weeks.The Dow ended in negative territory for the second straight day. Monday's session witnessed the blue-chip index's lowest close since Mar 23. All 30 components of the index closed in the red. Notably, in the previous two trading sessions, the Dow lost more than 1,000 points.The S&P 500 also closed in negative territory for the third successive day, marking its lowest close since October 2017.

Revenues in the segment came in at $279 million, up 7.5% year over year.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $906 million, showing a year-over-year decline of 2.4%.Thus, softness in the segment might mar the company's revenue growth in the third quarter.In the quarter to be reported, Cerner's two business units, System Sales and Reimbursement and Travel, are likely to disappoint.In the last reported quarter, Reimbursement and Travel contributed a mere 0.02% to net sales, while revenues in System Sales were not reported.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Reimbursement and Travel stands at $24.1 million, reflecting a marginal fall from the year-ago quarter's $24.2 million.

(Symbol: CERN) saw new options become available this week, for the June 2019 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CERN options chain for the new June 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $57.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.35. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $57.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $55.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CERN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $63.53/share today.Because the $57.50 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 75%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.09% return on the cash commitment, or 6.22% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., and highlighting in green where the $57.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.80. If an investor was to purchase shares of CERN stock at the current price level of $63.53/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.87% if the stock gets called away at the June 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CERN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CERN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.56% boost of extra return to the investor, or 11.49% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 28%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 26%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $63.53) to be 24%.

Professional services helped the most, with revenue jumping nearly 13% year over year, to $447.3 million.Cerner also reported solid increases for managed services, with revenue of $285.6 million, up 9% from the prior-year period. Support and maintenance revenue grew by 7.5% year over year, to nearly $279 million. Licensed software sales also jumped by a healthy amount, rising 10.6%, to $172.4 million. One negative for Cerner in the second quarter came from its subscriptions revenue, which dropped 32%, to $82.9 million.What about the decline in  net income? The biggest culprit was a significant increase in spending on sales and client service to the tune of $71.7 million. Cerner also spent $25.4 million more on software development than it did in the prior-year period.However, the company beat the upper end of the range of its second-quarter earnings projection by $0.01. This better-than-expected performance stemmed primarily from adjusting for higher share-based compensation expense and a lower impact from pre-tax adjustments.Cerner also reported a total backlog of $14.79 billion. The company's backlog at the end of the first quarter was $14.6 billion. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 30, 2017 totaled $885.6 million. Cerner's cash stockpile at the end of the first quarter was $921.4 million.Cerner president Zane Burke stated:Cerner expects third-quarter revenue will be between $1.335 billion and $1.385 billion, with adjusted diluted EPS between $0.62 and $0.64. The company maintained its full-year 2018 guidance of revenue between $5.325 billion and $5.45 billion, with adjusted diluted EPS between $2.45 and $2.55.One other thing for investors to look forward to that could impact Cerner is a potential acquisition of one of its smaller rivals,  .

Read on to see why  (NASDAQ: CERN)  (NASDAQ: BIIB) , and  (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) slumped today.Image source: Getty Images.Shares of Cerner fell 4.6% after Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken downgraded the health IT solutions and services company from \"in line\" to underperform. The firm also reduced its per-share price target on Cerner stock by $2 to $55, for a 13.7% discount from yesterday's close.To justify his bearishness, Muken argued that Cerner's growth could be muted by the rise of cloud-based and software-as-a-service business models. He also warned that larger tech companies and \"emerging venture backed vendors in population health and other analytical adjacencies\" could present a \"potential incremental competitive threat.\"As high-tech competitors work to chip away at Cerner's core business, long-term shareholders would do well to watch these trends closely.Biogen stock fell 2.6% in the wake of Baird analyst Brian Skorney downgrading it to neutral from outperform.The timing of the call is no coincidence. Late last week Biogen shares  to positive top-line results from a phase 2 clinical study of BAN2401, an experimental Alzheimer's disease drug. Today, however, Skorney noted that the data surrounding those results is \"pretty ambiguous,\" and doesn't necessarily support Biogen stock's pronounced pop.Skorney simultaneously maintained his $323-per-share price target on the biotech leader -- a modest discount from yesterday's closing price of $354 per share -- stating he's content to watch its progress from the sidelines for now.Finally, Class A shares of Google parent Alphabet edged  into negative territory at the end of the day, giving up earlier gains following a  (subscription required) that the internet search giant will likely face a multibillion-euro antitrust fine from the European Commission (EC) for abusing the market leadership of its Android mobile operating system.According to \"people familiar with the matter,\" the EC is expected to find that Alphabet \"thwarted potential competitors to safeguard its mobile-advertising business,\" the strength of which Google has  as a primary driver of its top-line growth. The EC will also order changes to Alphabet's Android business practices to stem the alleged abuse.If that weren't enough,  says this fine could dwarf the $2.7 billion penalty that Alphabet  -- then subsequently appealed -- for allegedly favoring its own comparison-shopping service over those of competitors in Google Search results.With net income of more than $9 billion last quarter alone, that's not to say Alphabet can't afford another fine, and it will almost certainly contest the EC's findings if they're unfavorable.

Leading tech stocks tend to dominate 90% of the market, the second-place company gets 9%, and everyone else scraps for the remaining 1%.If you're an investor, the rule is simpler: Go with the winner.This is where we get the word \"WinTel\" from. WinTel described the virtual PC monopoly held by the Microsoft (  ) Windows operating system, running on Intel (  ) hardware, 20 years ago. You could have owned Apple (  ) in 1994, or Advanced Micro Devices (  ), but in terms of the market as it was at the time, you would have been wrong.You go with a winner until it's no longer winning, notes Rich Winer, a wealth adviser with Steel Peak Wealth Management LLC in Woodland Hills, California. \"People assume that just because a company has had a strong run, that the run has to end,\" he says.The end of the run isn't based on valuation, but technology. Winners become losers only when their niches are destroyed, as Nokia (  ) flip phones were destroyed by the Apple iPhone, or as Canon film cameras were by digital cameras.The following 9 tech stocks are today's modern-day corporate kings. For now, you want to own them - not based on any sort of relative valuation, but on the continued strength of their niches. As long as they have \"runway,\" or growth potential, stay in them.Market value: $493.0 billionChina e-commerce giant Alibaba (  , $192.27) is just about as dominant as Amazon.com (  ) is in China, only it's even more profitable.Alibaba was not, until recently, much of a direct merchant, which involves warehouses and the expense of inventory. It was an intermediary, between small goods producers and retailers. Only in the past few years has it begun building out its physical infrastructure.This has impacted Alibaba's profitability; it earned about $1 billion in its most recent quarter, on revenue of about $3.6 billion. That's just more than half the net income of a year earlier, on 45% more revenue.But the pros still love Alibaba.For one, 46 of 47 analysts currently covering BABA shares consider them an \"Overweight\" or \"Buy.\" Allyson Berry, an account coordinator at BackBay Communications in Boston, goes one step further, calling Alibaba \"the perfect stock.\"\"Its fundamentals are super strong, and institutions are buying it with both hands,\" she says. \"I have been doing the same and have more than doubled my money since I began doing so in November 2016.\"That's because Alibaba also is becoming the dominant cloud player in its home market, expanding around the world. Meanwhile, it continues to expand its e-commerce services across fast-growing markets in South and Southeast Asia, including payment services. It has a clear runway to keep growing.Market value: $806.7 billionAlphabet (  , $1,155.08) division Google has been the leader in Internet search for so long that the names of its onetime competitors -- such as Excite, Ask Jeeves and Altavista -- are now nearly forgotten. When you search for something online, you \"Google\" it.Google defined the space by focusing all its attention on the service, not on monetizing it, and by offering a clean, simple interface. Its purchases of DoubleClick and YouTube in the mid-2000s sent revenues and profits into overdrive. In 2017 its gross profit came to $65 billion, which came on $110 billion in revenue. Even after building new cloud data centers, entering numerous consumer markets and relaunching YouTube Red as a paid media distribution channel, Alphabet still had net income of more than $12 billion.Expansion in new directions naturally carries new risks. Josh Blechman, director of capital markets at exchange-traded fund provider Exponential ETFs, doesn't worry about those risks, saying the company is still well-positioned \"as media consumption continues to move away from the television.\"There is now \"a generation of kids growing up with the notion of a household without a cable box,\" he says, allowing the company to redefine the entertainment as well as information-gathering experience. The company's strong cash flow has also let it invest in \"moonshots\" such as self-driving cars, Google Fiber and Nest intelligent devices that will define its future.Despite a market cap of almost $800 billion, and despite shares selling at roughly 50 times last year's earnings and nearly seven times sales, 39 of 44 analysts give the stock a buy-equivalent rating.Market value: $839.3 billionAmazon.com (  , $1,710.63) isn't just the dominant player in e-commerce, with about half the U.S. market.It is the dominant player in cloud computing.Amazon has become king of the cloud by doing just what it did with its online store: It rented it. Hundreds of thousands of merchants operate on Amazon's website. Some have their orders shipped by Amazon, others only use sales services. All Amazon did, in 2006, was apply this model to its cloud data centers. Amazon Web Services was born.AWS had $5.4 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2018, up 49% from a year earlier. Among its big customers are Netflix (  ), which recently became worth more than any other entertainment company -- more than Walt Disney (  ), even more than Comcast (  ).Amazon's stock is laughable in so many ways. It trades for more than $1,700 per share, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 217 times trailing profits, and 85 times next year's. It trades at 5 times sales. And yet ... 45 of 47 analysts think the stock is buy-worthy, and the other two think it's at least worth holding on to if you've already got it.Levi Sanchez, co-founder of Millennial Wealth in Seattle, agrees. \"They make all their decisions based on data, and they're not afraid to operate at a loss to gain market share,\" he says.Amazon's cloud cash flow \"allows them to fund their ambitions across retail, entertainment and devices,\" adds Mark Stoeckle, CEO and Portfolio Manager at Adams Funds in Baltimore.Market value: $100.3 billionRemember Priceline? Well, the \"name your price\" hotel site which had  actor William Shatner as its spokesman for years, has grown up.Since buying European site Booking.Com in 2005, Booking Holdings (  , $2,086.93) has acquired a host of other travel sites, including Kayak and OpenTable, and created a virtual \"duopoly\" in the U.S. hotel booking industry with rival Expedia (  ). (Priceline holds the larger market share.)The company shuns stock splits, so there are only 48 million shares. But each one now costs roughly $2,100, which is nearly twice the price of just three years ago. The company posted earnings of $77.03 per share in the previous fiscal year, and shares trade at more than 40 times earnings. But the company's financial results have been precise stairsteps, with sales and profits both doubling over the past five years.Two-thirds of analysts covering the stock have it on their \"buy\" lists, and on the whole, expect earnings of more than $100 per share by fiscal 2019.Travel isn't just about hotels, by the way. Priceline sells air tickets, rents cars and even leads the better-known AirBnB in longer-term vacation rentals of homes and apartments. The company is investing heavily in chatbots, too, to reduce the cost of telephone operators. The company says its AI-driven bots can answer half of all post-booking questions from travelers.Market value: $21.0 billionFew technology companies have been industry leaders for as long as Cerner (  , $62.96), the kings of hospital record keeping.The company has warded off challenges from mainstream technology companies such as Microsoft, Oracle (  ) and Alphabet over the past decade, and has about 17% of its target market.Cerner was founded in 1979 by Arthur Andersen accountants, taking its current name in 1984, then going public in 1986. The company's value has risen sixfold since the current recovery began, buoyed by a series of acquisitions and winning the $4.3 billion contract to manage electronic health records (EHRs) for the Department of Defense. It also won the Veterans Affairs business, finalizing a 10-year contract in May.Net income has been growing 20% annually for years, and the company has nearly as much ready cash ($413 million) as long-term debt ($439 million). Operating cash flow has grown at roughly 17% annually, reaching $438 million in 2017.More than half of analysts covering the stock think it's a buy, with the remainder suggesting holding on at the very least.Market value: $62.7 billionMemory chip maker Micron (  , $53.23) is among the least-loved tech stocks on the market right now, at least based on its valuation.Micron lives in a sector of the market that has seen regular boom-and-bust cycles. As a result, you still can buy it for about 5 times last year's earnings of about 7 times last year's earnings.This boom may be different. Memory chips are finally cheap enough to replace disk memory in many applications. Your phone runs on chip memory, and so do most laptops today. Chip memory is even replacing disk memory in many clouds because it's faster and more reliable.So far, the boom in memory shows no signs of ending. After delivering revenue of $20.3 billion in fiscal 2017, Micron had revenue of $6.8 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2018, then $7.3 billion in its next quarter. The company then reported $7.8 billion in the quarter reported in June. That puts the company on track to reach more than $29 billion in revenue for the year -- a nearly 50% growth rate.The company's profits are also accelerating, hitting $5.9 billion in the second quarter alone, then another $3.8 billion in its most recent quarter -- topping analyst estimates.You'd think analysts would be screaming \"buy,\" and most are -- 26 of 34 like it, though seven have it as a \"hold\" and one even rates it a \"sell.\" A few analysts still are trying to tease out when the current tech boom might end.Even when that happens, however, Micron should still be cheap as chips.Market value: $150.6 billionNvidia (  , $247.33) originally was known as a \"graphics chip\" company, with a niche in helping video game players see more realism with less latency.That hasn't changed -- Nvidia dominates this market. But the same hardware techniques used to make Lara Croft smile are also at the heart of self-driving cars, solving cryptographic puzzles and delivering artificial intelligence from clouds. This has sent the shares of Nvidia up 370% in the past two years.Has it come too far too fast? Not so, says Ron Weiner, managing partner and director of RDM Financial Group at HighTower in Westport, Connecticut. \"Just think about how many chips will be needed to power an autonomous vehicle in the future, with artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and data centers,\" he says.The autonomous vehicle market -- just one of Nvidia's niches -- is expected to be worth $60 billion by 2035, the company says. As artificial intelligence continues to make our lives easier, Nvidia will be at the heart of it, Weiner says.Allyson Berry of Backbay Communications in Boston agrees, saying Nvidia's results fit squarely in their 15-stock momentum growth strategy index -- one whose approach is based on that of Investor's Business Daily founder William O'Neil.Despite Nvidia's rapid rise, other analysts are quickly lining up with this position. Assuming it can meet its current earnings estimate of $7.25 per share this year -- and it has regularly been powering past quarterly estimates by 50 cents per share and more - it would have a P/E of 34. That's a bargain for this company's future growth prospects.Market value: $104.8 billionAs good as it is to be a dominant cloud player, sometimes it's better to be a major cloud user. Salesforce.com (  , $141.40) illustrates this point.Salesforce has led the move of business applications to the cloud, which has been a key to industrial transformation this decade. Salesforce grew into its $100 billion market cap by putting database applications in the cloud and selling them through a monthly subscription.This began with customer relationship management (hence the CRM ticker), but it now boasts cloud offerings covering sales, service and applications, as well as marketing. The company is expected to grow sales at more than 20% annually in each of the next two years. Revenues of $3 billion for the quarter ended in April resulted in $344 million (11%) in net income.Steve Koenig, Managing Director for Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, says it can still outperform. He has a $150 price target on shares that were selling for $139 in mid-June, believing its recent acquisition of MuleSoft provides \"the capability to unlock data trapped in isolated systems and accelerate customers' digital transformations.\" He sees the valuation as attractive, and thinks CRM has a \"long runway for growth.\"Market value: $4.1 billionThe smallest company, and the smallest niche, among these kingly tech stocks is Teladoc (  , $63.35), which has a market cap of just more than $4 billion but a solid lead in the business of connecting doctors with patients remotely. If you live in a big city, you may have never heard of Teladoc. If you're in the wilds of Alaska, they may be essential.The company has been on a buying spree, most recently acquiring Advance Medical for $352 million in June. Advance adds episodic and complex care to the Teladoc portfolio and offers it the chance to scale globally.While most health care companies have their fates tied to the U.S. market, Teladoc is increasingly international, with one-third of the 42 million employees currently covered based outside the U.S. Teladoc's virtual system also lets it tap niches such as mental health service for young males who are otherwise tough to reach.You will pay for this potential. Teladoc sells for just less than 15 times revenues, and it has yet to show a profit. But when your sales are doubling every year, investors tend to give you a pass. The company is due to report earnings on July 31, with a loss of about 37 cents per share expected on revenue of $92.5 million. That's more than twice the $44.6 million in sales for the same quarter a year ago.That's why 13 of the 16 analysts following Teladoc have a buy rating on the stock. Most of those issuing new reports are upgrading their ratings or raising their price targets.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n early trading on Friday, shares of Take-Two Interactive Software (  ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 10.9%.

Per management, the growth was primarily driven by strong licensed software bookings in the reported quarter.Technology resale revenues came in at $75.3 million, up 2.9% on a year-over-year basis.Sales from Subscriptions grossed $83 million, down 30.2% year over year.Professional services revenues totaled $447.3 million, up 12.9% from the prior-year quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pinned at $2.50, within the range.For the third quarter of 2018, revenues are expected between $1.34 billion and $1.39 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.35 billion, within the projected range.Earnings per share for the third quarter are anticipated between 62 cents and 64 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pinned at 65 cents, higher than the guided range.Third-quarter bookings are expected between $1.45 billion and $1.65 billion.Our TakeCerner exited the second quarter on a solid note. The company saw consistent growth in its EHR platform and revenue cycle management solutions. Legacy systems like Cerner Millennium and Cerner ITWorks continue to drive results. Growth in Licensed Software and Professional services is noteworthy. Solid year-over-year bookings growth is another positive. The second quarter saw crucial transactions which drove bookings. Cerner also gained from its ambulatory business. Its CommunityWorks organization also continues to perform well in the small hospital market space. Solid international growth also paints a bright picture. Management is optimistic about solid bookings contributions from Australia, Canada, the Middle East and Europe in the second half of 2018. A positive guidance for 2018 is encouraging.On the flip side, decline in subscription and Reimbursed travel revenues is a negative. Significant decline in operating income and margin is likely to mar Cerner's prospects. High long-term debt is a negative. Competition in the niche space adds to the woes.Q2 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season, are Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Earnings improved 15% year over year and also exceeded the high end of the company's guidance.With majority of bigwigs yet to report results, the upcoming week will be crucial in deciding whether this quarter will turn out to be a game changer for the sector.Strong R&D focus is likely to be the key driver of the Medical Product space, which is part of the broader Medical sector.Medical Products sector has been hogging the limelight on the back of encouraging demographics, changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) & big-data applications, an upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments.Additionally, a bipartisan two-year suspension of a 2.3% excise tax on Medical Product and Medical Device manufacturers at the beginning of 2018 has been a temporary relief. It will be put into effect on Jan 1, 2020. The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector, which is likely to drive the quarterly results.However, at the onset of the earnings season, a series of geo-political tensions rattled the U.S. economy, the Medical Products space being no exception. While ties between the United States and North Korea have strengthened, the ongoing trade war with China is a concern.Although it is too early for these issues to dampen second-quarter results, analysts believe that these might have minor effect on the earnings of Medical Product companies.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

These companies offer software and hardware solutions that provide healthcare providers with secure access to clinical, administrative and financial data in a time efficient manner.Growing prominence of innovative technologies like big data (the cloud-based electronic health records [EHR] model being the most popular), 3D printing, blockchain and Artificial Intelligence have shaped the MedTech space of late.Escalating administrative costs, need for instant and complete access to a patient's medical records to avoid errors and the growing requirement for healthcare organizations to prevent data hacking and phishing while maintaining confidentiality of patient's health information are fueling adoption of these technologies.However, many analysts are of the opinion that controlled spending by smaller hospitals might impede the adoption of these technologies. Moreover, the reimbursement mix has dented endowments income, affecting hospital spending capabilities further.Further, there are certain regulatory and legal headwinds confronting the players in the medical information systems industry. Per an article on HIT Consultant, the repeal of net neutrality rules may give rise to a plethora of issues for the industry.The repeal will increase the bargaining power of telecom players who will decide on the distribution and pricing for acquiring and delivering data and information. This may bump up costs for gathering EHR data for Medical Info Systems industry companies.The  industry, within the broader  , has underperformed the S&P 500 and its own sector in the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 11.8%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Medical Sector have rallied 14.3% and 19.2%, respectively.The underperformance can be attributed to escalating operational expenses, traditional software revenue growth challenges due to the maturing EHR market and a shift to more Software as a Service (SaaS) based models.The industry's valuation is quite cheap right now, thanks to the underperformance over the past year.Valuation is a tricky business for Medical Info Systems companies. Not to forget, these companies spend a lot on unplanned R&D and hence it is difficult to account for such high expenses. Notably, one might gain a fair idea of the industry's relative valuation from its Price/Book ratio.The industry currently has a Price/Book TTM ratio of 3.74, which is a little away from the high end of the past year as well as the last five years. When compared to the high of 3.96 and the median level of 3.67 over the past year, we believe investors should wait for a dip to enter the market.The space also looks quite discounted when compared with the market at large as the Price/Book TTM ratio for the S&P 500 is 4 and the median level is 3.76.Another regulatory hurdle that might hit the Medical Info System industry players is the European General Data Protection Regulation which was enforced on May 25, 2018. Per an article on HIT Consultant, this legislation has made significant changes to how the personal digitalized information of EU citizens is assembled and distributed. Notably, the legislation will also be applicable for companies which are not operating in EU countries.One reliable metric that can give investors an idea of the industry's future price performance is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, showing the earnings revision trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for it and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Please note that the 64 cents EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Medical Info Systems industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the earnings per share of the industry for 2018 but how this estimate has been moving recently.This becomes clear by focusing on the aggregate EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.As you can see, the 64 cents EPS estimate for 2018 has remained steady since June, declining from 82 cents at July 2017-end. Looking at the earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings potential. This could possibly be due to the regulatory hurdles in the Medical Info Systems industry.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates underperformance in the near term.The Zacks categorized Medical Info Systems industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #177, which places it at the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The long-term prospects for the industry indicate steady growth. When compared with the broader Zacks S&P 500 composite, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Medical Info Systems industry of 14.1% appears promising. The corresponding figure for the Zacks S&P 500 composite is 9.8%.Though the group's mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has sharply declined from the high of 14.7% achieved in July 2017, it has been steady ever since and is above the low of 13.9% over the past year.In fact, the basis of this long-term EPS growth could be a steady increase in top line that the Medical Info Systems industry has seen since the end of 2016.Although the short-term picture looks dull, the industry is beaming with prospects for investors who are ready to wait it out.The ongoing digital transition is accelerating demand for IT service solutions in healthcare. Robust adoption of technologies, which eases the billing management, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication and referrals, and many other related tasks, can be major growth drivers.The latest trend of EHRs, electronic medical records, predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space has been gaining prominence.Of these, the cloud-based EHR model is the most common application of big data in healthcare. According to Transparency Market Research, the global EHR market is expected to see a CAGR of 5.7% from 2017 to 2025, to reach an estimated value of $38.29 billion.Reports suggest that MedTech companies with strong exposure to big data automated EHRs will excel in terms of operations and margins.Further, systems for recording and managing medical data are slow, centralized and often extremely vulnerable. This in turn leads to a chain of issues that are adversely impacting overall healthcare services and increasing the demand for the portfolio of hardware and software solutions offered by the Medical Info Systems industry.A fresh report by Research and Markets shows that big data in healthcare raked in $11.45 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow double-digits in the 2017-2025 period.Thus, keeping the long-term expectations in mind, investors could advantage from the cheap valuation and bet on a few Medical Info Systems stocks that have a strong earnings outlook.Here we pick one stock from the Medical Info Systems industry with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which has seen positive earnings estimate revision. (CPSI): The stock of this Mobile, AL-based healthcare information technology solutions and services provider in the United States and the Caribbean nation has gained 6.6% over the past year.

We refer to this as a quantamental investment process.Cerner (  ) originated from our \"high-quality\" model. I mention this because it is important to understand why an investment manager picks an investment, what they are looking for, and their time horizon for realizing their thesis. We have invested in Cerner because we believe it is an extremely high-quality company with a strong moat and attractive long-term earnings growth prospects. We have a long-term time horizon and hope to be invested in Cerner for many years.Cerner is a leading healthcare IT business, primarily selling electronic health records software and revenue cycle management software to hospitals. The company's software is critical infrastructure for hospitals and serves as the basic foundation for a hospital's IT ecosystem. Cerner is deeply integrated with its customers, creating a very sticky client base with a 99% retention rate. The company is benefitting from tailwinds that will enable revenue to grow at a high-single-digit rate for the next 10 years. Furthermore, Cerner is executing a plan to increase operating margins by 30 to 60 basis points per year. The combination of tailwinds and margin enhancement will enable the company to compound its earnings growth at a double-digit rate for the foreseeable future. Investors today can purchase Cerner at a valuation multiple of roughly 18x cash flow. This valuation is a slight premium to the average market multiple but we believe we are getting a bargain because Cerner is a high-quality business with very strong earnings growth prospects.Cerner was founded in 1980 by Neal Patterson, Clifford Illig (current vice-Chairman), and Paul Gorup to build a laboratory information system. The company's first product helped laboratories and blood banks move away from paper-based record systems. By the 1990's Cerner built a more comprehensive health record system that became widely adopted by hospitals.Today, Cerner primarily sells software to hospitals and its key product lines include: electronic health records software (60% revenue), revenue cycle management software (13% revenue), population health management software (5% revenue), healthcare IT consulting and outsourcing (9% revenue), and international (13% revenue).Electronic health records (\"EMR\") software is Cerner's largest business line and is the kernel from which most of its other software applications sprout from. EMR is the most critical piece of a hospital's IT system, it stores patient records and keeps track of medication and treatments. If an EMR system fails, patients can die. Furthermore, because an EMR software houses much of the patent data, it serves as a basic building block which connects to and manages other software applications such as billing, prescription order management, and more.Revenue cycle management (\"RCM\") software manages billing, insurance claims, and collections. RCM is extremely complex due to the existence of copious billing schemes for procedures and varying forms of insurance coverage. RCM is only getting more complicated as billing & claims are increasingly being tied to healthcare outcomes and efficiency. Cerner was weak in RCM until it acquired Siemen's acclaimed RCM software business in 2015.Cerner's Healthcare IT consulting and outsourcing business helps manage the IT system for hospitals and some non-healthcare organizations as well. Outsourcing select functions or entire departments is a trend within the healthcare industry and Cerner could stand to benefit.Population health management is a cloud software application which provides data analysis and predictive analytics for health care providers, insurers, and corporate health plans. This is a nascent business for Cerner but is expected to be a major source of growth for the company in the future as the healthcare industry continues to search for solutions to lower costs. Looking at Cerner's historical financials, the company has grown (mostly organically) at a healthy high-single-digit to low double-digit rate. Operating margins have been robust in the mid 20% range. FCF conversion has been high due to software economics (low capital requirements, favorable working capital adjustments). Return on Invested Capital (\"ROIC\") has been attractive as well. However, in recent years, growth has slowed and margins have stagnated, causing the stock price to stagnate as well. Revenue growth has slowed as many healthcare companies have delayed investments in response to uncertainty over changes in healthcare regulations due to President Trump taking office. Margins have suffered because the company has pulled forward investments in software development (R&D) and marketing (SG&A). These investments have enhanced the company's competitive position in existing products and have expanded the product suite with the population health management software. As will be covered in the next section, growth is expected to re-accelerate and margins are expected to lift over the next several years.There is a significant opportunity for Cerner to grow its earnings over the next 10 years and beyond. We believe Cerner can compound its revenue growth at a high-single-digit rate and grow its bottom line at a double-digit annual rate for the foreseeable future.Healthcare providers are faced with the challenge of both lowering the cost of care and improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, due to aging demographics, the healthcare system is seeing utilization rise which is straining resources. Technology is increasingly being leveraged to help manage these challenges which sets the stage for strong secular growth opportunities for companies such as Cerner.As a result of regulatory initiatives over the past 10 years, electronic health records penetration is mature in the US with over 95% of hospitals using digitized records. International penetration for EMR is much lower and represents an attractive growth opportunity.Cerner is the #2 US provider of EMR with 25% market share behind competitor EPIC with 26% market share. Although the EMR market in the US is mature, Cerner has a major opportunity to take share in the coming years. Of the 49% of the EMR market that is not served by Cerner or Epic, approximately 60% use software that is no longer actively supported by a vendor. The remaining 40% use software provided by sub-scale companies. Cerner and Epic are expected to continue gobbling up market share as contracts come up for bid.Another trend driving higher market share for Cerner is the consolidation of healthcare systems. Hospital systems are merging and doctor's offices are being acquired at an unprecedented rate in response to increased regulatory burdens and lower reimbursement rates for treatments (driving the need to lower costs). When a hospital is acquired, it typically consolidates its IT system with the acquirer. Cerner has an outsized market share in larger healthcare systems and is thus a net beneficiary.In addition to taking market share in EMR, Cerner is cross-selling its other services to existing EMR customers. For example, while most healthcare providers use an outsourced revenue cycle management software, less than half of Cerner's EMR customers use Cerner's RCM. Because a health records system is more heavily integrated than other software, it is easier to switch out the other software and there are synergies to using multiple products from the same vendor.Cerner provided the below estimates for long-term revenue growth by product line in its 2018 analyst day presentation. Note that ITWorks refers to Cerner's IT consulting & outsourcing business.In addition to high single-digit organic revenue growth, Cerner is guiding for 30 to 60 basis points of annual margin expansion over the next several years. Cerner has pulled forward much investment in R&D and SG&A in order to develop its next-generation products and position itself for growth. However, Cerner has signaled that it has reached peak R&A and SG&A spend; therefore, incremental revenue will largely fall to the bottom line. In addition, Cerner is transitioning its products to the cloud which will raise its gross margins over time. The below table also from Cerner's 2018 analyst day presentation illustrates the expected rise in operating margin. The net result of the strong organic growth and margin expansion will be double-digit bottom line growth for the next 5 to 10 years.Cerner is in a unique position to earn outsized returns in the healthcare IT space due to some key competitive advantages including a strong brand, leading intellectual property, a platform advantage, and a sticky customer base.Cerner was an early player in electronic health records and over the years has accumulated brand equity through its long-tenured success and industry thought leadership. For example, Cerner is a founding member of the CommonWell Health Alliance, an open, not-for-profit industry consortium which sets the standards for electronic health records. Cerner's strong brand has manifested in an outsized market share among the largest healthcare systems. Cerner counts 120 of the top 200 US healthcare systems as clients, as well as the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Cerner's strong brand carries weight internationally where it is either the #1 or #2 share leader in 10 of 11 global regions, see the below graphic.Source: Cerner 2018 Analyst Day Presentation.Cerner also has a significant intellectual property advantage over its competitors due to both the amount of resources the company invests in R&D on an annual basis and the number of years the company has been developing its solutions. Cerner's annual R&D budget is $700 million (~14% of revenue), this is greater than all the R&D budgets of Cerner's publicly traded competitors combined and is estimated to be greater than EPIC's R&D budget as well. Cerner has 6,600 research associates and over 400 patents with several hundred patents pending.Cerner has a platform advantage because it controls electronic health records which is a foundational piece of IT infrastructure for a healthcare provider. Most ancillary software that a hospital operates such as revenue cycle must connect with a core EMR platform and is often housed within an EMR ecosystem. In a sense, the electronic health records software is the operating system for the care giver's applications. Controlling this platform allows Cerner to tilt customers towards using more of its services and away from competitors.Cerner's customers are extremely sticky with a 99% retention rate. Contracts can range from 5 to 10 years in duration and are usually renewed. Because EMR systems are mission critical, hospitals are very risk adverse and unlikely to change platforms once they have one installed. In addition, the installation and training process is extremely onerous. It takes somewhere between 18 and 24 months to fully install a new EMR system and adequately train staff. Once installed, most hospitals customize the EMR software to their particular needs or local regulations. Cerner provides a significant amount of support to its customers with consultants both on and off-site when needed. Conversations with industry professionals indicate that Cerner does a much better job in supporting its customers because it is able to leverage its IT outsourcing team's resources and expertise. EPIC, on the other hand, contracts with third-party IT consultants for EMR system installation and support.Cerner currently trades for 18x forward EV / EBIT and 12x forward EV / EBITDA. This compares to the S&P 500 index which trades for 15x forward EV / EBIT and 11x forward EV / EBITDA (according to Capital IQ).Many investors would see the premium multiple relative to the broader market and balk. However, Cerner is not a cyclical stock (hospitals won't stop paying for essential software in a recession) and is expected to grow earnings at 2x the rate of the market. Therefore, a more constructive way to think about valuation is to extrapolate Cerner's future earnings growth and apply a reasonable multiple.Our base case for next 5 years compound earnings growth is 11% (based on the earlier table). At this rate, Cerner's EBIT will be approximately $1,800 million by 2023. Conservatively applying a forward EBIT multiple of 15x implies that Cerner's EV will be ~$27 billion by 2022 or ~40% higher than today. Most of Cerner's earnings convert to free cash flow. Conservatively assuming ~80% free cash flow conversion implies that Cerner will have ~$3 billion of net cash. Assuming a share count of 335 million which bakes in annual dilution, we arrive at a 2022 share price of roughly $90 which is 47% above the current price. If Cerner's valuation multiple does not contract, the implied share price would be $106 which is 73% above the current price. We have arbitrarily picked a point 5 years out for illustrative purposes. The point is that the company's value will grow over time in-line with earnings. This should result in a compounded return for shareholders in the range of 10% to 15% per year over the long run (taking in to account earnings growth, cash generation, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation).1. Regulatory change negatively impacts CernerRegulatory uncertainty has already impacted Cerner because healthcare systems have delayed investments in IT until they got a sense for any budget changes resulting from President Trump's ACA reforms. However, Cerner itself is not tied to any Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement schedules or drug pricing growth. Regulatory change is unlikely to change the key megatrends driving greater technology utilization by health care providers, namely cost containment and aging demographics.2. Healthcare IT is disrupted or becomes more competitiveThe IT landscape for healthcare providers is the most entrenched and protected technology vertical I have encountered. Health systems are technology late adopters because they are extremely risk adverse and slow moving, creating little opportunity for upstarts to win contracts. Second, there are several unique logistical and legal issues unique to healthcare IT and health records. Finally, the incumbents have significant competitive advantages including brand power, technological superiority, and platform advantages that would make it extremely difficult to compete against and win.3. An economic recession negatively impacts demand for Cerner's productsCerner is not very cyclical. Hospitals will continue to utilize Cerner's products during economic downturns and are under long-term contract to do so. Cerner did not see sales, operating earnings, or margins decline at any point during the last 2 recessions.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ere are 5 stocks added to the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) List today: is a provider of banking and financial products.

The company is likely to see a soft quarter owing to decline in the core Support, Maintenance and Services segment. However, growth in the company's EHR (Electronic Health Record) platform is encouraging.In the last reported quarter, Cerner reported adjusted earnings per share of 58 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, earnings inched down 1.7% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $1.29 billion rose 2.6% year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34 billion.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 60 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 1.6%. The same for revenues is pinned at $1.33 billion, showing year-over-year growth of 2.7%. | Investors must not forget that in the last reported quarter, Cerner reported under six segments instead of three. The segments are Licensed software, Subscriptions, Professional services, Managed services, Support and Maintenance and Reimbursed Travel.Let's delve deeper.In the last reported quarter, this segment accounted for 22.1% of the company's net sales. Revenues in the segment totaled $284.6 million, up 8.6% year over year. However, management stated that the segment witnessed low single-digit growth in the quarter.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $881 million, showing a year-over-year fall of 3.9%.Thus, softness in the segment might offset the company's revenue growth in the second quarter.In the quarter to be reported, Cerner's two business units, System Sales and Reimbursement and Travel, are likely to disappoint.In the last reported quarter, Reimbursement and Travel contributed a mere 1.9% to net sales, while revenues in System Sales were not reported.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Reimbursement and Travel stands at $25.5 million, down 4.7% from the prior-year quarter. The same for System Sales is pegged at $309 million, down 11.2% from the year-ago quarter.Cerner expects 2018 revenues in the range of $5.33-$5.45 billion, down from the previous range of $5.45 billion to $5.65 billion.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings is pegged at $2.50 cents, within the projected range.Hence, possible declines in the core segments are likely to mar the company's financials.For the second quarter of 2018, Cerner expects revenues in the range of $1.31-$1.36 billion.

But there are also less visible aspects of healthcare that are very important -- and that present solid investment opportunities. The systems and technology used by biopharmaceutical companies to develop prescription drugs and that hospitals use to track patients' medical data are great examples. (NYSE: VEEV) and  (NASDAQ: CERN) stand out as two of the top providers of these healthcare systems. Veeva has definitely been the bigger winner lately, with its stock soaring nearly 40% so far in 2018. Meanwhile, Cerner stock is down more than 10% year to date.But which of these two healthcare technology stocks is the better pick for investors looking to the future? Here's how Veeva and Cerner compare.Image source: Getty Images.An ideal stock would have a huge market opportunity in front of it and a strong  that protects it from competition. Veeva Systems checks off both boxes.Veeva is the leader in cloud-based software for the life sciences industry. The company has enjoyed tremendous success, with its customer base including many of the world's largest drugmakers. But Veeva still has plenty of room to grow.The company's initial product was a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) system. Veeva still makes more than 60% of its total revenue from its CRM offerings. However, the company's Vault content management software represents an even bigger growth opportunity.Veeva isn't limiting itself to the life sciences industry. The company has made inroads into the consumer packaged goods and chemicals industries, picking up some big customers along the way with its new quality management software.How big is the total addressable market for Veeva? The company's management estimates an opportunity of more than $8 billion annually. Veeva's revenue in 2017 was close to $686 million.In addition to a large potential market, Veeva enjoys a strong moat thanks to the high costs for customers to switch to another system. Customers invest a lot of time loading data into Veeva's systems and training employees on the systems. To move to one of Veeva's rivals, they would spend a lot more time and money.Veeva knows this, of course, and continues to roll out more new applications to make it even \"stickier\" for customers. The more of Veeva's systems a customer uses, the less likely they are to switch to another software provider.Cerner ranks as the 800-pound gorilla in the health information management system market for hospitals and clinics. The company's technology is used by more than 27,000 provider facilities across the world. Cerner ranks either No. 1 or No. 2 in market share in all but one global region.The reasons to buy Veeva also apply for Cerner, although the two companies' markets are quite different. Most U.S. hospitals and clinics already have electronic medical record (EMR) systems. However, Cerner thinks that it has a great opportunity to replace competitors' systems.Around 2,000 sites use older legacy systems. Cerner views these sites as prime targets for conversion to its integrated software. In addition, the company thinks that industry consolidation should work in its favor. As healthcare providers merge and make acquisitions, they're likely to want the scale and standardization that a major player like Cerner can give.Cerner also sees plenty of growth opportunities for key products. Revenue from the company's population health management solutions grew 20% in 2017. Cerner's revenue cycle management software enjoyed 15% revenue growth last year.As is the case with Veeva, customers that use Cerner's systems have high switching costs. Implementing EMR, revenue cycle management, and other systems requires massive investments in time and money. Once a customer chooses to go with Cerner, they're highly likely to remain a customer over the long run.Which stock is the better pick? My choice is Veeva.Cerner has hit a few bumps in the road recently. The company reported lower-than-expected revenue  and cut its full-year 2018 revenue outlook. Although a big reason for this stemmed from the delay in a large contract that Cerner expected to close, the company isn't enjoying the solid growth that it once did.Veeva, on the other hand, continues to attract more new customers and sign up more existing customers on additional applications. At first glance, Veeva's forward earnings multiple of nearly 51 might be scary. However, the company's outstanding growth prospects make it an even better value than Cerner, in my opinion. I think Veeva will keep up its winning ways.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Veeva Systems wasn't one of them!

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Computer Programs and Systems has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Cerner has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) right now. This means that CPSI's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.CPSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.26, while CERN has a forward P/E of 24.04. We also note that CPSI has a PEG ratio of 1.34. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CERN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.73.Another notable valuation metric for CPSI is its P/B ratio of 3.27. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CERN has a P/B of 4.08.Based on these metrics and many more, CPSI holds a Value grade of B, while CERN has a Value grade of C.CPSI sticks out from CERN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that CPSI is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Shares have added about 3.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CERN due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Cerner reported adjusted first-quarter 2018 earnings of 58 cents per share, down 1.7% from the year-ago quarter. The figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues of $1.29 billion rose 2.6% year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34 billion.The year-over-year upside in revenues can be primarily attributed to an increase in bookings in the first quarter. Bookings were $1.40 billion, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. The company registered strong bookings on business office services. However, subscription bookings were lower than expected.Instead of reporting in three revenue categories - system sales, support maintenance and services - Cerner reported in six segments in the first quarter.Licensed software in the first quarter fell 5.3% to $134.8 million, on a year-over-year basis. Lower-than expected subscription bookings marred growth in the segment.Subscriptions accounted for revenues worth $76.6 million, down 32.4% on a year-over-year basis.Professional services increased 11.3% year over year to $441.3 million. Per management, strong performance in the segment is likely to enhance revenue cycle position.Managed services segment revenues were $268.3 million, up 3.3% year over year.Support and maintenance revenues were $284.6 million, up 8.6% year over year.Reimbursed Travel sales amounted to $23.9 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.Gross margin in the first quarter was 82.1%, almost flat year over year. Operating margin for the reported quarter was 15.1%, which contracted 427 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.The downside was caused by surge in operating expenses, which rose 6% year over year. The growth was driven by personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates and non-cash items.Cerner exited the first quarter with free cash flow of $255.7 million. Operating cash flow totaled $409 million.Long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, was $527 million, down slightly on a sequential basis.Cerner expects second-quarter 2018 revenues between $1.31 billion and $1.36 billion.The second quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings per share is projected in the range of 59-61 cents.For 2018, revenues are projected in the range of $5.33-$5.45 billion, down from a range of $5.45 billion to $5.65 billion.Full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share is estimated in the range of $2.45-$2.55. Further, the company expects second-quarter 2018 new business bookings in the range of $1.35-$1.55 billion.In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been 11 revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted downward by 8.3% due to these changes. | At this time, CERN has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise CERN has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

There was a hint of better growth ahead, though, with Cerner posting record-high bookings.That better growth appears to be still in the future, however. Cerner announced its 2018 first-quarter results after the market closed on Wednesday. Here are the highlights.Image source: Cerner.Data source: Cerner.The good news for Cerner in the first quarter was that it enjoyed solid growth in three key areas. Professional services revenue increased more than 11% year over year to $441.3 million. Managed services revenue grew 3% over the prior-year period to $268.3 million. Support and maintenance revenue climbed 8.6% year over year to $284.6 million.However, Cerner also posted sales declines in other categories. Sales of licensed software fell 5% from the prior-year period to $134.8 million. Revenue from subscriptions plunged 32% year over year to $76.6 million. Technology resale revenue slipped 1% from the first quarter of 2017 to $63.4 million. In total, Cerner's first-quarter revenue fell below its previous guidance of $1.315 billion to $1.365 billion.Cerner's  net income was helped by U.S. corporate tax reform. The company paid nearly $30 million less in taxes than it did in the same quarter of last year. However, that wasn't enough to offset significant spending increases. Operating expenses grew 6% year over year to $866.4 million. Still, Cerner's adjusted EPS in the first quarter matched the mid-point of the guidance range the company gave in February.Once again, Cerner recorded solid bookings, which represent the amount of prospective revenue from contracts signed but not yet implemented. First-quarter bookings were just under $1.4 billion, bringing Cerner's total backlog to $14.6 billion.Cerner president Zane Burke said, \"Our results in the first quarter included strong bookings and cash flow and in-line earnings, but our revenue was below expected levels.\" He added, \"Our mixed results and revised outlook reflect the delay of a large contract and a less predictable end market. However, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities due to our strong market position and portfolio of solutions and tech-enabled services that align with the pressures healthcare stakeholders are facing.\"Cerner expects revenue to pick up a bit in the second quarter. The company projects second-quarter revenue between $1.31 billion and $1.36 billion. However, because of the weaker-than-expected first quarter, Cerner lowered its full-year 2018 revenue outlook. The company now expects full-year revenue between $5.325 billion and $5.45 billion, down from $5.45 billion to $5.65 billion.The company also projects second-quarter adjusted EPS between $0.59 and $0.61, which would reflect a slight year-over-year decline at the mid-point of the range. Full-year 2018 adjusted EPS is expected to be between $2.45 and $2.55, down from Cerner's previous guidance of $2.57 to $2.73.Some of Cerner's weakness should only be temporary. As Zane Burke mentioned, the delay of a large contract weighed on the company's performance in the first quarter. The challenge for Cerner will be to convert its bookings backlog into implementations that generate solid revenue. Overall, though, the company's business continues to look sound.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Cerner underperformed its  in a year's time. The stock has lost 9.7% compared with the industry's return of 3.2%.The year-over-year upside in revenues can be primarily attributed to an increase in bookings in the first quarter.Bookings were $1.40 billion, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. The company registered strong bookings on business office services. However, subscription bookings were lower than expected. | Instead of reporting in three revenue categories - system sales, support maintenance and services - Cerner reported in six segments in the first quarter.Licensed software in the first quarter fell 5.3% to $134.8 million, on a year-over-year basis. Lower-than expected subscription bookings marred growth in the segment.Subscriptions accounted for revenues worth $76.6 million, down 32.4% on a year-over-year basis.Professional services increased 11.3% year over year to $441.3 million. Per management, strong performance in the segment is likely to enhance revenue cycle position.Managed services segment revenues were $268.3 million, up 3.3% year over year.Support and maintenance revenues were $284.6 million, up 8.6% year over year.Reimbursed Travel sales amounted to $23.9 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.Gross margin in the first quarter was 82.1%, almost flat year over year.Operating margin for the reported quarter was 15.1%, which contracted 427 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.The downside was caused by surge in operating expenses, which rose 6% year over year. The growth was driven by personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates and non-cash items.Cerner exited the first quarter with free cash flow of $255.7 million. Operating cash flow totaled $409 million.Long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, was $527 million, down slightly on a sequential basis.Cerner expects second-quarter 2018 revenues between $1.31 billion and $1.36 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 billion for the same, is higher than the projected range.The second quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings per share is projected in the range of 59-61 cents. The range is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents.For 2018, revenues are projected in the range of $5.33-$5.45 billion, down from a range of $5.45 billion to $5.65 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $ 5.54 billion for the same, is significantly higher than the projection.Full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share is estimated in the range of $2.45-$2.55, which lags the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.64.Further. the company expects second-quarter 2018 new business bookings in the range of $1.35-$1.55 billion.Cerner exited the first quarter on a tepid note, missing the consensus mark on the top-line front. Revenues came below expectations due to software issues, technology resale, lesser-than-expected subscription bookings and the delay of the VA contract. A downbeat guidance indicates concerns for the stock. Further, lower margins on technology resale, resulting from higher mix of device resale is a concern. Additionally, Cerner has been facing macroeconomic challenges along with cutthroat competition in niche space. Surging operating expenses also add to the woes.International growth is likely to boost with the company's prospects in Australia, Canada, Middle East, U.K., Ireland and Germany. Cerner witnessed strong cash flow and record bookings. We believe that the company has growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM), Population Health and ambulatory markets based on its product strength and enviable track record of adding new clients. Solid growth in the HealtheIntent platform also holds promise.

And an aura of future success emanated from the university throughout the competition.Nonaccredited individual investors don't have a way to directly invest in these privately held companies. But the impact they will have on their industries is undeniable.Investors in publicly traded companies need to be aware of key themes evident in this new wave of innovative entrepreneurs.If there's one trend that stood out, it's that new businesses are building their products in the cloud.For example, OZE is creating a cloud-based data analytics platform to help small businesses in Africa, which it's building on  Web Services' infrastructure. And OptiML is creating a machine learning (ML) platform to diagnose eye diseases. It's using  (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units to recognize pictures of eye conditions, and training its neural network on  (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud platform.Getting the IT infrastructure up and running for your start-up isn't as hard as it used to be. Cloud vendors like AWS, Alphabet, and  now offer as much storage and processing as you need, while also providing a plethora of software applications to optimize your business.There's a change underway in our healthcare system.Primary care physicians used to function largely as referrals, getting an early read on patients and then sending them to specialists to better diagnose and treat conditions. Pockets of knowledge independently grew within the healthcare system: \"ologies\" with a specific focus -- such as neurology, cardiology, or hematology.But the parts of our bodies don't operate independently. Everything is interconnected, so tracking conditions and correlating their effects are important to proactively stay healthy.In the new era of healthcare, personal care physicians will play a significantly larger role in collecting patient data. They'll have an arsenal of new tools at their disposal. Wearable devices with advanced sensors can take biometric readings and send pictures and data to the cloud. They can then use machine learning (ML) to immediately diagnose conditions. Many ML algorithms are already operating above 90% accuracy, which provides a more effective diagnosis than many specialists can.These new tools won't  medical specialists. But they will allow them to focus less on diagnosis and more on treating serious conditions, which will have already been identified by the personal care physician.This could be a big win for the electronic health records (EHR) providers, such as  (NASDAQ: ATHN) and  (NASDAQ: CERN) . Detailed, interoperable EHRs that can be shared across hospitals will be crucial for maintaining accurate patient records and developing improved treatment routines. That could, in turn, provide better patient outcomes.Ironically, the biggest beneficiaries of this new wave of innovation could be the most established players.The vast majority of the teams at the competition said their exit strategy was an acquisition. That means that after years of hard work to establish, scale, and manage their businesses, they plan to cash out by selling to the 800-pound industry incumbents.It's hard to blame them. Established companies already have strong relationships with their industry's largest customers. Displacing those relationships would take a lot of time, cost, and effort.If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Many entrepreneurs would be happy to sell their businesses -- for the right price -- directly to the incumbents.This gives forward-looking acquisitive firms, such as  (NYSE: JNJ) ,  (NASDAQOTH: SFTBY) , or Alphabet, a huge opportunity. They can allow entrepreneurs to pave the innovative path, then invest when they see something they like that would complement their own business. Many of these companies are already actively involved in supporting entrepreneurship, by sponsoring innovation centers and accelerators or by establishing their own venture capital arms.With a ton of neat new ideas in the world, growth-style investors have quite a bit to look forward to. The rise of cloud computing is accelerating the pace of innovation, which will have a huge impact on healthcare and acquisitive companies.

The company's earnings met with estimates in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. At present, Cerner is grappling with stiff competition in the niche space and regulatory headwinds. The mixed sentiments justify the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a detailed look at the company's performance and operations to analyze why investors should hold on to this stock. | Cerner is one of the best known HCIT giants with a large client base and a comprehensive array of solutions for patients. It is one of the major EHR (Electronic Health Record) vendors gaining significant market traction. In the past, Cerner had used Amazon Web Services (AWS) for storage, computer networking and databases and on-demand disaster recovery.

Reputed names such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Epic Systems, GE Healthcare Technologies, McKesson Corp and Quality Systems pose significant challenges apart from hurting pricing and margins.The company's long-term debt and declining operating margin raise concern. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, gross margin was flat year over year, while operating margins contracted 280 basis points year over year.Furthermore, the industry Cerner operates in is highly regulated by the government.

(Symbol: CERN) saw new options begin trading this week, for the December 21st expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CERN options chain for the new December 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $51.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CERN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $57.96/share today.Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.64% return on the cash commitment, or 8.57% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.20. If an investor was to purchase shares of CERN stock at the current price level of $57.96/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.77% if the stock gets called away at the December 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CERN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CERN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

In this regard, the federal budget deficit has already reached $228 billion in the first three months of the current fiscal, almost $18 billion more than the deficit in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.However, Republicans spurned these concerns with the belief that tax cuts will drive faster growth.In fact, the right-wing conservatives are of the opinion that America's unparalleled purchasing power, massive demand for medical services, and opportunity for innovation has lent it a competitive edge in the global space.So, despite the CBO's assumptions, continuous technological and strategic advancements, especially in the MedTech sector, should help the nation in increasing its gross domestic production (GDP), and minimize the deficits over the long haul.In this regard, per Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board, U.S. health care spending is estimated to reach approximately $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP.Consequently, here we take a sneak peek on how the U.S. MedTech space is gearing up to counter the unsettling CBO projections, and which are the major companies that would lead the process.The future of MedTech is embedded in artificial intelligence, virtual reality and Big data.Apart from GoogleFlu and HealthMap, the latest trend of Electronic Health Records has been gaining prominence in the Big-data market.

It has also fortified the industry against new entrants. The companies will benefit from higher market cap, which will put them in a position to negotiate with suppliers.The latest buyout of  by  ($67-billion deal), which follows just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant  announced plans to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer  ($69 billion-deal), deserve a mention.The MedTech industry has been favored by a massive change in consumer behavior lately. This along with changing market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation of the U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years.This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.When the market is full of mixed sentiments, value investment trick can easily work.

Millennials have started to recognize the increasing need of the emerging automation trend and subsequently robotics, IoT, 3D printing are becoming part of our daily life with the latest buzzword being Artificial Intelligence (AI).While Siri and Ok Google have made life easier, the latest version of Global Positioning System helps track almost anything and everything along with its intelligent route map. Also, not being a pro on social network sites like Facebook, Twitter or snapchat can be seen as primitive.According to investment giant Jim Cramer, AI along with big data will soon let companies to bat a thousand. Interestingly, the benefits of the same will not remain restricted to any particular industry but will be felt across all business segments and investment arenas.Non-healthcare bigwigs like Apple  , Google, Amazon  , IBM and Microsoft with their digital affluence are already eyeing the healthcare and device market of late, courtesy of its solid prospects.Two things to be noted here:Health treatment costs have skyrocketed over the past few years. Surprisingly, medical devices and pharmaceuticals account for only a small portion of healthcare expenses. Per Josh Makower, MD, general partner venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates, the greater part of healthcare costs goes in paying the salaries of healthcare employees. AI can help to curtail this high labor cost.Going by 2018 Deloitte data, global health care spending is projected to increase at an annual rate of 4.1% in 2017-2021, a significant escalation from just 1.3% in 2012-2016. Per the report, rising labor cost is acting as a major spending growth driver.Also, with growth in the aged population, the necessity for AI has increased by leaps and bounds. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, between 2012 and 2050, there will be a significant rise in the aged population in the United States. In 2050, the population aged 65 or older is projected to be 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and this is the global scenario as well.Notably, the industry is bearing the brunt of an exploding population at present. The World Health Organization's (\"WHO\") latest available data show that more than 45% of WHO Member States worldwide report to have less than 1 physician per 1000 population. The density of physicians to patients in the United States is 2.3:1000.The strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Evidently, companies that adopted AI technologies have already witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome by more than 50%. is undoubtedly among the first MedTech manufacturers forging ahead with initiatives to bring in AI techniques in manufacturing processes. Back in 2016, the company partnered with IBM Watson to utilize the latter's machine learning algorithms to incorporate AI in its diabetes app MiniMed. In 2017, they jointly launched the first artificial pancreas systems. Metronic has utilized sugar IQ with the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for diabetes.EHR technologies developer  is also adopting AI techniques rapidly. Lately, the company has been in the headlines, courtesy of its efforts to digitize electronic health record systems. In this regard, the company recently entered into two collaborations, one with Salesforce, a renowned player in the field of customer relationship management, and the other with Centrus Health, a clinically integrated, physician-led network. With the latest development, the company is planning to advance its flagship big-data platform HealtheIntent. designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system - an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This AI platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps negate trauma associated with open surgery. The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair.Of late,  has also been putting an all-out effort to incorporate AI techniques in neuromodulation, cardiac rhythm management, cardiology, electrophysiology, peripheral interventions, oncology, endoscopy, urology and pelvic health.A long debate can be structured on how an intelligent machine intensive technology can make human capabilities outmoded gradually - but that's a different story. Despite several adversities, AI undoubtedly has emanated to change the behavioral pattern of consumers in medical device space like all other sectors. Once again going by Jim Cramer's say,  I love behavior-change investing. It can be incredibly lucrative, and when you have a behavior-change theme you can use selloffs to pick stocks based on those changes.\" Thus, it goes without saying that the market holds ample promise and the proper execution of AI will definitely prove to be a trump card for the space.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  ,  ,  and  .The tax-repeal saga has been dominating the headlines of the U.S. MedTech industry since the last couple of months.While numerous reports are expecting it to be a solid buffer, the Congressional Budget Office (\"CBO\") forecasts rather ominous implications of this tax relief on the nation's economy.A report published by the CBO projects that the two-year tax suspension will cost the federal government about $3.7 billion during that period, and $310 billion to federal-budget deficits over the next decade. In this regard, the federal budget deficit has already reached $228 billion in the first three months of the current fiscal, almost $18 billion more than the deficit in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.However, Republicans spurned these concerns with the belief that tax cuts will drive faster growth.In fact, the right-wing conservatives are of the opinion that America's unparalleled purchasing power, massive demand for medical services, and opportunity for innovation has lent it a competitive edge in the global space.So, despite the CBO's assumptions, continuous technological and strategic advancements, especially in the MedTech sector, should help the nation in increasing its gross domestic production (GDP), and minimize the deficits over the long haul.In this regard, per Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board, U.S. health care spending is estimated to reach approximately $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP.Consequently, here we take a sneak peek on how the U.S. MedTech space is gearing up to counter the unsettling CBO projections, and which are the major companies that would lead the process.The future of MedTech is embedded in artificial intelligence, virtual reality and Big data.Apart from GoogleFlu and HealthMap, the latest trend of Electronic Health Records has been gaining prominence in the Big-data market. A research report by Fact.MR expects the global big data analytics in healthcare market to multiply at a double-digit CAGR by 2026. In fact, companies banking on big-data analytics would save over 25% in annual costs in the upcoming years.Of the major companies,  has been hogging the limelight, courtesy of its consistent efforts to digitize electronic health record systems.M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion (Data provided by BioSpectrum Asia).The latest trend of rising consolidation in the healthcare space has led to a reduction in the number of players, greater market concentration and reduced competition. It has also fortified the industry against new entrants. The companies will benefit from higher market cap, which will put them in a position to negotiate with suppliers.The latest buyout of  by  ($67-billion deal), which follows just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant  announced plans to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer  ($69 billion-deal), deserve a mention.The MedTech industry has been favored by a massive change in consumer behavior lately. This along with changing market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation of the U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years.This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.When the market is full of mixed sentiments, value investment trick can easily work. This is because most of the fundamentally good stocks are often found lying within the discounted range due to the volatility.Thus, here we take a look at three stocks that are currently available at a cheaper rate and have been gaining prominence in the MedTech markets on the back of above trends.

The transaction has been valued at $2 billion and is subject to close by 2018, following approval from NxStage stockholders and other customary conditions.Fresenius Medical expects the buyout to prove accretive to earnings within three years from deal closure.

Although the healthcare technology company reported both revenue and earnings increases, the performance wasn't impressive. However, management projected a little better growth for the fourth quarter.So when Cerner provided its fourth-quarter update after the market closed on Tuesday, investors were eager to find out if the company was able to deliver better results. However, it again underwhelmed. Here are the highlights from Cerner's fourth-quarter performance.Image source: Getty Images.Data source: Cerner.First, the bad news. In its third-quarter update, Cerner projected fourth-quarter revenue between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion. The company delivered, but just barely. However, Cerner's actual adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter fell below its guidance of $0.60 to $0.62. Even worse, adjusted EPS declined from the prior-year period.The good news was that Cerner posted a huge increase in  net income in the fourth quarter. There is a catch, though. Nearly all of the improvement stemmed from an income tax benefit of $115 million compared to an income tax expense of $66 million in the prior-year period. The fourth-quarter tax benefit included Cerner's current estimates of the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017.Perhaps the best news, though, was that Cerner recorded bookings in the fourth quarter of $2.329 billion. That's an all-time high, and it reflects a year-over-year increase of 62%. Bookings represent the amount of prospective revenue from contracts signed but not yet implemented. Cerner's sales backlog at the end of the fourth quarter stood at $17.55 billion, up 10% over the prior-year period.The company reported operating cash flow of $348.9 million during the fourth quarter. The company generated free cash flow during the period totaling $185.1 million. As of Dec. 31, 2017, Cerner had a cash position of $805.8 million, including cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.Cerner president Zane Burke put a positive spin on the company's fourth-quarter performance. He said:How is the current quarter shaping up? Cerner expects first-quarter 2018 revenue between $1.315 billion and $1.365 billion. That reflects roughly 7% year-over-year growth at the mid-point of the range. The company also projects first-quarter adjusted diluted EPS between $0.57 and $0.59. In the same quarter of 2017, Cerner reported adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59.As for full-year 2018, Cerner projects revenue between $5.45 billion and $5.65 billion. That translates to year-over-year growth of around 8% at the mid-point of the range. However, the full-year revenue guidance was a little lower than the company's preliminary outlook provided three months ago. Full-year 2018 adjusted diluted EPS is expected to come in between $2.57 and $2.73, an 11% increase from 2017.Investors will certainly want to watch to see what changes new CEO Brent Shafer might make.

This process helps identify other therapeutic alternatives and patient specific coverage alerts like quantity restrictions and step therapy requirements.Consequently, this will reduce the number of patients abandoning their prescriptions if the prescribed drugs become unaffordable for them. Hence, greater price transparency may improve medication adherence and also build stronger relationships between the patients and physicians.Per a study conducted by Allied Market Research, North America was the leading regional HCIT market in 2015. The North American healthcare asset management market is projected to witness a CAGR of 17.4% to $9.7 billion by 2022.Rising needs to curtail healthcare costs and growing focus on quality of care drive the market.Accordingly, we believe, the addition of the new functionality in EHR platform is a strategic move by Cerner as it is likely to secure a diversified client base in the near future.In the past year, Cerner has underperformed the  in terms of price.

For the fourth quarter, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 5% on a year-over-year basis.

Two companies at the forefront of that tide are  (NYSE: VEEV) and  (NASDAQ: CERN) -- and today they'll be going head-to-head.Interestingly, I authored an  with the exact same matchup 10 months ago. Back then, I gave the nod to Veeva. Since then, the stocks have tied; both returned 30%, handily beating the broader market.Image source: Getty Images.So how do they stack up today? By evaluating the companies on three different criteria, we can get a better idea of what we're paying for when we buy shares and which is the better bet today.For truly long-term investors -- we're talking a minimum of three years -- there's nothing more important to evaluate than a company's  competitive advantage, often referred to as a \"moat.\" At its core, a moat is what keeps customers coming back for more while holding the competition at bay for decades.Veeva's key moat is provided by high switching costs. The company got its start providing software-as-a-service (SaaS) for customer relationship management (CRM). But the real coup has come from Veeva Vault, which has several subcategories that help drug companies do everything from capture electronic data from clinical trials to managing regulatory requirements. As more and more companies sign on -- and use more and more Vault applications -- switching costs for those clients soar.Last quarter, management  that the number of clients using multiple Vault applications grew 50%, an enormously positive sign for the company's shareholders. Over the next year, keep an eye on two new Vault applications -- Clinical Trial Management Systems (CTMS) and Electronic Data Capture (EDC). The former is an area of need for drug companies that are still relying on clunky legacy systems, and Veeva already has 11 companies signed on. The latter is a more developed market, largely dominated by  and  The idea is that as drug companies start to use Veeva Vault for all of their other needs, the decision to use the company for EDC will make more sense.Additionally, the popularity of Vault has been so high that companies outside of pharmaceuticals have been asking for access to the cloud application. These companies are largely concentrated in highly regulated industries like chemicals, manufacturing, and consumer packaged goods. In response, management released Vault QualityOne, a solution for such companies. Thus far, details from the effort have been scant, with management  that it wants to focus on success with early adopters now and focus on adding more customers in 2018.Finally, Veeva also announced an application set to become available in 2019: Vault Safety. This application will allow drug companies to collect data from adverse reactions to medication, handle communication with authorities, and -- most interesting to me -- attempt to use data to signal when more health problems might be on the horizon.Cerner also uses the SaaS model and enjoys the benefit of high switching costs. The company provides real-time data for doctors and other healthcare professionals and has been around for much longer than Veeva, which only got its start in 2007.Normally, I would call this a tie, as both have enviable moats. But they seem to be headed in opposite directions. While Veeva has not only added far more customers than expected over the past three years  branched into providing software for companies in other industries, Cerner's bookings have  lately.And Cerner is certainly not growing its business as quickly as Veeva is right now. Next year's revenue is expected to be in the ballpark of 9%, while Veeva has said that it expects growth of 20% or more every quarter until 2020. Because both of these companies have high switching costs, that means lots more sticky revenue for Veeva.Ask most investors and they'll tell you that excess cash should be handled in one of two ways: given back to shareholders via buybacks or dividends, or reinvested in growth opportunities. While there's certainly a place for both of those, there's also something to be said for keeping a boring old pile of cash around.That's because every company, at one point or another, is bound to run into difficult financial times. Those that have cash on hand can actually emerge from these episodes stronger by buying back shares on the cheap, acquiring distressed rivals, or outspending the competition to gain long-term market share.Keeping in mind that Cerner is valued at almost three times the size of Veeva, here's how they stack up.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing twelve-month basis.Even after factoring in size, Cerner has more cash flow and net income than Veeva. At the same time, Veeva's net cash position outstrips Cerner by a fairly wide margin. But there are a few key aspects to keep in mind: Cerner is a more mature business and many of its applications are at a scale that they can enjoy robust margins. Veeva, on the other hand, has spent the money to roll out new applications (like EDC and CTMS), but has yet to achieve scale with customers.Furthermore, while some would argue that it makes sense to take on debt as Cerner has in a low-interest rate environment, Veeva's net cash position -- 70% larger than Cerner's -- gives it more flexibility if an economic crisis hit. It would be easier for Veeva to buy back a larger share of stock, acquire rivals, or temporarily lower prices -- driving start-up competition into bankruptcy -- to gain and maintain market share.Withstand and benefit from recessions. That's why Veeva wins this one as well.Finally, we have valuation. There's no one metric that lets you know if a stock is cheap or expensive. Instead, I like to look at a number of different metrics to get a more comprehensive perspective. Here are three of my favorites.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E presented using non-GAAP EPS. TTM = trailing twelve months.Without a doubt, Cerner is the cheaper company at today's prices.While both companies have enviable moats, Veeva's appears to be growing, while Cerner's is either caught in neutral or shrinking. Combined with Veeva's lack of debt, I'm giving it the upper-hand, even over the demonstrably cheaper Cerner.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $67.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $65.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CERN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $68.75/share today.Because the $67.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

The company builds, repairs, and reconstructs transportation infrastructure projects, including highways, roads, bridges, airfields. Sterling Construction Company, Inc. was founded in 1955 and is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.On October 30, the company reported EPS of $0.26 when $0.22 was expected. It was the third consecutive beat of the Zacks Consensus estimate and good for an 18% positive earnings surprise.Revenues were sharply higher than expected. The company posted sales of $304M when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for $262M. That $42M difference translates to a 16% positive revenue surprise.Importantly, the company guided higher as well in moving the revenue range from between $850M - $880M to $915M to $935M when the consensus was calling for $875M.Stocks that beat and then raise guidance have the best chance of seeing a post earnings drift higher.Over the last several months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been moving higher. Back in July, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 was sitting at $0.36 but bumped up to $0.39 in August. By October the number was up to $0.44 and we are currently at $0.45. Those are all positive moves in the right direction.The 2018 number hasn't seen as much movement. It was $0.96 back in May and moved to $0.98 in October and that has been the only movement. Still, that number implies some very strong earnings growth for next year.As noted above, the earnings growth for next year is more than 100% -- well 119% to be exact, so you are going to have to pay for that kind of earnings growth. The forward PE for STRL is 38x and that is more than double the industry average of 16x. The price to book multiple of 3.2x is only slightly higher than the 2.8x industry average. Finally, the price to sales multiple of 0.5x is well below the industry average of 0.9x. : recently missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and that led to analysts lowering future earnings estimates. When that happens, the Zacks Rank falls, and now as a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) CERN is the Bear of the Day.Cerner Corporation is contributing to the systemic change of health and care delivery. For more than 30 years Cerner has been executing its vision to make health care safer and more efficient. Leveraging the experience of more than three decades in clinical information systems, Cerner is building on the knowledge that is in the system to support evidence-based clinical decisions, prevent medical errors and empower patients in their care.The company offers Cerner Millennium architecture, which includes clinical, financial, and management information systems that allow providers to access an individual's electronic health record at the point of care, and organizes and delivers information for physicians, nurses, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, front- and back-office professionals, and consumers.The most recent report was a miss, but it was only 1 cent. Prior to that, there were two meets and one beat out of the last four reports. To me, that looks OK, and is not enough to become a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The detailed estimates page shows me that there have been a ton of negative revisions over the last 60 days. This is the reason the stock is now a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Just when you thought earnings season was over\u2026 shares of both Lululemon and Broadcom are up in late trading today following their respective Q3-18 and Q4-17 earnings reports. Even beneath their headline beats, both companies raised guidance and supplied investors with plenty of goodies heading into holiday season.Broadcom, noteworthy lately for its move to buy out like-sized competitor Qualcomm, outperformed analyst expectations on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of $4.59 per share outpaced the Zacks consensus of $4.52 on quarterly revenues of $4.85 billion, better than the $4.83 billion analysts were looking for. Guidance for fiscal Q1 2018 on the top line was raised to around $5.3 billion, well beyond the Q4 actual and the Q1 estimate of around $4.8 billion.A full $2.2 billion in revenues came from the company's Wired business, with $1.8 billion coming from Wireless. Further, Broadcom has considerably upped its interim quarterly dividend by 72%. Shares are up more than a point and a half in after-hours trading, but have been trading down since Thanksgiving.lululemon, for its part, brought forth a 4-cent beat on its bottom line to 56 cents per share. Quarterly revenues easily surpassed the $610 million expected to $619 million in the quarter. This marks the third-straight positive earnings surprise, with a trailing 4-quarter average positive surprise of 8.5%. Comps rose 7% in the quarter, but with limited brick-and-mortar options (388 stores overall) it's clear much of this growth for lululemon has come on-line. The company also raised Q4 guidance.

This isn't the first time that the company has partnered with the leading EHR provider. In the past, Cerner has used AWS for storage, computer networking and databases and for on-demand disaster recovery.Cerner's HealtheIntent platform facilitates the gathering and retrieval of and access to patient electronic records (EHRs) including prescriptions to facilitate their analysis by hospitals and healthcare professionals, thereby reducing the cost and improving upon the outcome of treatment while also taking care of insurance claims. Through Amazon's AWS platform, Cerner intends to deliver these services along with Amazon's advanced analytics at greater speeds to large healthcare organizations that operate on a bigger scale and across geographies.Healthcare professionals have been slow to move to the cloud because of security considerations and the regulatory pressure to maintain utmost secrecy of patient data. But cloud providers have also started recruiting experts in the field to better understand the requirement and create the capability.In Amazon's case, AWS has been built up to meet the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. Earlier this year, it also created a secret team called 1492 to work on healthcare-related technology. The goal of the team is to build solutions that will facilitate interoperability between different EHR systems including the migration of data from one system to another to make data more accessible to both physicians and patients.According to the KLAS US Hospital EMR Market Share 2017 report, the EHR market is dominated by a few large players. According to the report, Epic with its 25.8% share, Cerner with its 24.6% share and Meditech with its 16.6% share were the largest players in 2016. According to Kalorama, Cerner has the leading market share, followed by McKesson and then Epic with the rest of the market comprising GE Healthcare, athenahealth, Intersystems, QSI/NextGen, Meditech, Greenway, eClinicalWorks and 600 smaller players. CNBC quotes the 2017 Black Book Research report to say that Cerner and Epic together dominate the population health management software market.While the fight for healthcare technology dollars is on and companies like Amazon, Microsoft  , Alphabet  and Apple  have targeted it in their own ways, EHR is a segment that Amazon appears to have taken a lead in. That's not to say that the others won't join in or catch up. But Amazon has an advantage because it has several offerings today, has a dedicated team leading the effort and access to customer healthcare data through medtech devices and non-prescription home tests it already sells. This could boost its healthcare-related machine learning to better serve customers.Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Cerner has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). However, you can see  .Amazon shares are up 59.2% this year while Cerner shares are up 47.2%. Both have done remarkably well with respect to the S&P 500, which only appreciated 16.7%.A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Friday, shares of Cerner Corp. (Symbol: CERN) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 21.5, after changing hands as low as $62.855 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 70.1. A bullish investor could look at CERN's 21.5 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

Things slowed down a bit  , with the healthcare technology company meeting its internal expectations on both the top and bottom lines.Headed into the third quarter, Cerner expected to make revenue somewhere between $1.265 billion and $1.325 billion, with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.61 to $0.63. The company announced its third-quarter results after the market closed on Thursday -- and hit its estimates, but just barely on the bottom line.Image source: Getty Images.Data source: Cerner.Nearly three-fourths of Cerner's third-quarter revenue came from support, maintenance, and services. This revenue increased almost 8% year over year to $927.8 million. System sales generated another $324 million in revenue during the quarter, also up close to 8% from the prior-year period. In addition, Cerner posted revenue from reimbursed travel of $24.1 million.While the company reduced general and administrative expenses somewhat, spending increased for sales and client service and for software development. These higher expenses caused Cerner's total operating costs to rise nearly 9%.Cerner reported operating cash flow of $362.9 million in the third quarter. It also generated free cash flow of $222.9 million during the period.Perhaps the biggest disappointment for Cerner in the third quarter was that bookings didn't meet expectations. The company reported bookings of $1.11 billion, down from the prior-year period level of $1.43 billion and well below the record-high bookings from the previous sequential quarter of $1.64 billion. Cerner attributed this lower-than-expected figure to several large contracts projected to close in the third quarter that were delayed. The company anticipates that most of these contracts will go through in the fourth quarter.Cerner president Zane Burke said:Financial results for Cerner in the fourth quarter could be a little stronger. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion. Cerner also anticipates adjusted diluted earnings per share in the next quarter of $0.60 to $0.62.The delay of several large contracts in the third quarter should translate to Cerner setting a new record for bookings next quarter. Cerner projects fourth-quarter bookings between $1.75 billion and $2 billion.Although it's still too early for financial guidance for next year, Cerner did provide a sneak peek at what it expects for 2018. The company thinks revenue will be between $5.5 billion and $5.7 billion. Assuming Cerner hits the midpoint of this range, it would be a 9% jump over what it expects for 2017. Cerner also anticipates adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2018 of $2.52 to $2.68. The midpoint of that range would reflect a 7% increase over 2017 expected results.Overall, Cerner's business model appears to be solid. While the electronic health record market has matured, there remain significant opportunities for Cerner to increase market share by displacing smaller, less robust systems.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Quality Systems' solid recurring revenue base is a key catalyst for the quarters to come. Furthermore, the company's new Entrada and Eagle Dream solutions are likely to drive growth.

We believe solid growth in Ambulatory and CommunityWorks offerings will drive bookings in the third quarter.However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Cerner this quarter.

(Symbol: CERN) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $68.88, changing hands for $69.00/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 16 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cerner Corp., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $52.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $77.00. The standard deviation is $6.302.But the whole reason to look at the  CERN price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CERN crossing above that average target price of $68.88/share, investors in CERN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $68.88 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Veeva's customer relationship management (CRM) and content management systems have become a hot commodity in the life-sciences industry, while Cerner is the giant of electronic health record (EHR) systems for hospitals and physicians.But which one of these healthcare technology stocks is the better choice for investors now? Here's how Veeva Systems and Cerner compare.Image source: Getty Images.Few stocks in any industry have enjoyed the kind of growth Veeva Systems has had. Its customer count has quintupled in the past five years. Earnings increased at an impressive 44% annual rate during the same period. Veeva stock has soared 120% since the beginning of 2016.Can Veeva keep up its tremendous momentum? Its chances  . Veeva has currently penetrated only around 10% of its core market in life sciences. The company continues to launch new products to capture even more of that market.And Veeva's systems are really \"sticky\" -- customers don't want to switch. Part of the reason, of course, is that it's a painful process for a customer to move all of its data to a new system and train users on the system. The other reason, though, is that there really aren't better alternatives available. Veeva tailored its applications to meet the needs for big (and little) pharma.Veeva is also looking to grow beyond the life-sciences space. The company recently closed a deal with a large consumer packaged-goods company for its Veeva Vault content management platform. Look for more growth for Veeva as it spreads its wings beyond its core market.Cerner has been around a lot longer than Veeva, so it's not surprising that the company can't boast similar growth in recent years. However, the big EHR vendor's performance still looks really good: Earnings have grown by an average annual rate of more than 17% over the last five years.The company should be able to continue to grow earnings close to that level over the next few years. That's impressive, especially considering that Cerner's previous growth was fueled in large part by federal incentive money to healthcare providers for implementing EHR systems. Those incentives aren't in place any more.Cerner benefits from a moat that's similar to that of Veeva Systems. Customers aren't likely to undergo the agonizing process of switching EHR systems very often. It can take a hospital, for example, one to two years (and sometimes longer) to convert to a new system.Attracting new customers hasn't been too difficult for Cerner -- a fact that's underscored by the  recorded by the company in the most recent quarter. The company claims a win rate of more than 50% over the past couple of years. Flipping customers from rivals with less robust systems should provide plenty of growth opportunities for Cerner in the future.Cerner is the better pick when it comes to valuation. The big healthcare technology provider's stock trades at 23 times expected earnings compared to 63 times expected earnings for Veeva. Even with Wall Street expecting Veeva to grow earnings at a higher rate, Cerner stock appears to be more attractively valued.However, I suspect Veeva could beat Wall Street's growth projections if it gains traction outside of the life-sciences industry. Veeva stock is more expensive -- but for a good reason, in my view. I like Cerner and expect the stock to be a winner. I think, though, that the better pick right now is Veeva Systems. This hot stock could get even hotter in the next few years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Veeva Systems wasn't one of them!

The healthcare technology giant posted both revenue and earnings at the upper end of its guidance.On Thursday, Cerner announced its second-quarter results. The company continued its momentum with another solid performance. Here are the highlights.Image source: Getty Images.\n  \nData source: Cerner.Support, maintenance, and services continued to be Cerner's bread and butter in the second quarter, with revenue of $917.4 million. That figure reflected a 6.6% year-over-year increase. The company reported a smaller 4.4% increase in its second-quarter system-sales revenue, which totaled $347.8 million.Cerner's earnings growth lagged revenue growth a bit. One reason was a slightly lower gross margin. In addition, the company's operating expenses increased, driven largely by higher spending on sales and client service. Still, Cerner met expectations in the second quarter on both the top and bottom lines.One notable positive for Cerner in the second quarter was the company's bookings of $1.636 billion. That's a record high level for the company and reflects a year-over-year increase of 16%.Cerner posted operating cash flow of $292.2 million during the second quarter, with  of $119.1 million. The company's days sales outstanding was 73 days, a slight dip from the prior-year period.Cerner president Zane Burke said, \"We are pleased with our execution in the second quarter, which included all key metrics being within or above our targeted ranges.\" He added, \"Our record bookings reflect Cerner's strong competitiveness and good marketplace activity.\"Cerner projects third-quarter revenue of $1.265 billion to $1.325 billion. The company expects full-year 2017 revenue to come in between $5.15 billion and $5.25 billion. Cerner's previous full-year guidance called for revenue of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion.The company expected third-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.61 to $0.63. For the full year, Cerner projects adjusted earnings per diluted share between $2.46 and $2.54. The company's previous full-year guidance was for earnings per share of $2.44 to $2.56.While Cerner is still mourning the loss of founder Neal Patterson, who passed away in July, the company remains in solid shape. Perhaps the most important metric that underscores this point is the company's record-high bookings in the second quarter and its expectations of third-quarter bookings of $1.45 billion to $1.6 billion.Although the federal financial incentives for healthcare providers to invest in technology have dried up, Cerner continues to be in a strong position to grow its market share.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Cerner Corp. (Symbol: CERN) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.2, after changing hands as low as $61.55 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 39.8. A bullish investor could look at CERN's 29.2 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of CERN shares:    Looking at the chart above, CERN's low point in its 52 week range is $47.01 per share, with $69.28 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $61.60.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, CERN makes up 4.63% of the PowerShares Dynamic Software Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PSJ) which is trading lower by about 2.3% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Hedge fund trades have been made public over the past quarter with the release of 13F forms filed with the SEC.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Cerner is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CERN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 58 cents per share for CERN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CERN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.75% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that CERN has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see  .Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Cerner, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaries,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Based in North Kansas City, MO, the company provides healthcare information technology (HCIT) solutions worldwide. Cerner has a stellar four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.97%.Last quarter, Cerner reported adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents. Notably, earnings improved from 49 cents in the year-ago quarter. The company reported net revenues of $1.260 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.226 billion. Meanwhile, revenues rose from $1.138 billion in the year-ago period.Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Our proven model shows that Cerner is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. for Cerner is +1.75% as the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 58 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 57 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Cerner currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Cerner's Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise this season. |  We believe Cerner's strong sales performance, solid portfolio and strategic initiatives have positioned it for stellar growth. For second-quarter 2017, the company forecasts revenues between $1.265 billion and $1.335 billion. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the band of 60 cents to 62 cents per share. For full-year 2017, management expects revenues between $5.100 billion and $5.300 billion. Cerner currently forecasts 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $2.44 and $2.56 per share. Cerner announced that it has been chosen by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to develop an electronic health record (EHR) system. Department of Veterans Affairs will use the same system the company is developing for the U.S. Department of Defense, which began its operation at its first site in February.This system will facilitate the exchange of data between military care facilities and civilian health providers, where current and former service members receive care. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is stable at 57 cents over the same time frame. We believe that Cerner's strong product portfolio will help boost its customer base. The frequent contract wins reflect growing traction. Furthermore, the company has strong growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory space. Cerner is one of the largest pure-play HCIT companies and its wide footprint, large reference-able client base and composite array of solutions make it an ideal candidate for investors seeking an exposure to the HCIT industry. Cerner offers an exposure to worldwide healthcare automation. Its international operations provide a more diversified revenue stream. In the past, the company has won contracts in the U.K. as well as in the Middle East. The company has also been working with client organizations globally, to a focus on its population health management profile.Here are a few other companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company  has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

For the past four weeks, the group has ranked in the top 10 among  , even as its customers - hospitals in particular - face a huge amount of uncertainty and financial risk, with the future of Medicaid up in the air.Some companies have reported that the GOP's drawn-out push to repeal ObamaCare, which could reach its climactic stage in coming weeks, has acted as a drag on efforts to win new technology contracts. But the uncertainty hasn't obscured investors' focus on two health care megatrends: the rising dependence on technology and analytics to deliver better, more cost-efficient care and the shift from legacy systems to the cloud.Leading stocks in the Computer Software-Medical group fall into two categories.  (  ) and  (  ) provide cloud-based solutions to the life sciences industry. Both stocks are excelling, with Medidata up 57% and Veeva up 49% since Dec. 30, even as they go head-to-head in simplifying data management for clinical trials, with their success coming partly at the expense of  (  ).Other leading medical software names include  (  ) and  (  ), which both provide tools to help hospitals and medical practices manage electronic records of patients and provide an array of other services, from handling billing and claims to population health management - turning all those records into actionable advice for doctors to help their patients achieve the best, lowest-cost outcome.OptumInsight, a unit of  (UNH), and  (IBM) Watson Health also are leading competitors in patient population health management.Cerner's shares have climbed (up 39% year-to-date) on better-than-expected results and a huge contract win from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Athenahealth punched out a 32% gain this year through Thursday, despite a first-quarter earnings stumble. Investors jumped on board anyway after activist hedge fund Elliott Management took a stake and analysts highlighted a range of possible buyers, including Apple, IBM and UnitedHealth.The recent advance has left Medidata extended from its most recent breakout in April and a quick  in mid-June. Veeva is five weeks into a 16% deep consolidation and testing  . Cerner slipped below its 50-day moving average in light trade on Friday, as it finished the fifth week of a  with a 69.38 buy point.The year started with investors bearish toward technology providers like Cerner and Athenahealth, Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Wieland told IBD, amid uncertainty regarding the impact of the Trump Administration, combined with Tom Price leading Health and Human Services \"and an era of waning demand on meaningful use.\"The Obama administration's \"meaningful use\" payments intended to speed the adoption of electronic health records, as well as the use of those records to improve clinical processes. But those payments ended last year.The next logical step is transitioning government-financed health care from paying providers per service they render to paying for value - the quality and cost-effectiveness of the care they deliver.The 2015 Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA), passed by a GOP Congress and voted for by Price, outlined the path to value-based reimbursements. But the American Medical Association and other groups have appealed to the Trump administration to adjust MACRA rules as part of its deregulation push, saying that \"fair and accurate measurement of physicians' performance will not be possible until better tools become available.\"Some concerns about a softening in health care information technology spending are apparently being realized. BofA/Merrill analyst Steven Valiquette said in a May 15 research note that he expects total IT in the sector to be down 3% this year, though that was an upgrade from his earlier projection of a 6% drop.Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush said at a May 23 JPMorgan investor conference that the company is winning \"75% of the deals where we meet a practice and they make a decision.\" The problem is that there's more reluctance to make a decision, Bush says, amid the prospects of a new national health care law and potential rule change.To help nudge customers off the fence, the company began offering a cost guarantee, pledging that customers would see at least $1.20 in cost reductions for each $1 paid to Athenahealth.The strategy appears to be working.\"Some of our Q1 deals had said \"no\" in Q4. We came back with the guarantee, and they bought,\" Bush said.Still, the \"national breath-holding\" over TrumpCare, along with a surprising double-whammy from a decline in visits per doctor and a decline in payment per visit - perhaps a reaction to high deductibles - resulted in a Q1 earnings miss and led Athenahealth to lower guidance for the full year.Yet a few weeks later, Elliott Management's filing revealing a 9.2% stake in Athenahealth, which the hedge fund dubbed an undervalued, disruptive technology play, lit a fire under the stock. Citi analyst Garen Sarafian threw another log on the fire when he suggested that an Athenahealth acquisition by  (AAPL) could make sense.Sarafian says that Athenahealth could help Apple solve the health sector's patient data \"interoperability crisis,\" while making the iPhone, with its 1 billion users, central for disseminating clinical data, lab results and prescriptions.Wieland thinks it unlikely that Apple would dive into such a regulated, fragmented market. \"I believe that the device manufacturers are going to remain separate from the service providers.\"By contrast, Cerner's first-quarter earnings report easily topped analysts' measured expectations. The company said it's on pace to record strong double-digit growth in revenue cycle management - speeding payments for doctors - and population health management.\"We continue to believe information technology is the single biggest lever to drive cost down and quality up,\" Cerner President Zane Burke told analysts on the April 23 earnings call.The company explained at its May 24 annual meeting that it drove 850,000 interventions last year to change treatment of sepsis stemming from an infection, improving outcomes and shortening length of stays and time in the ICU, by identifying the condition early.Leerink analyst David Larsen on June 19 wrote that his firm's industry checks showed Cerner and privately-held Epic \"are winning the vast majority of share.\" Larsen downgraded  (MDRX), citing the risk of customer attrition.Cerner's momentum among private customers comes as its government business is also striking pay dirt. The VA tapped Cerner to provide its next-generation electronic health records system, facilitating the exchange of data between military hospitals and civilian health care providers where veterans also receive care.That contract, which doesn't yet have a dollar value attached to it, comes as Cerner is already leading the Defense Department's 10-year, $4.3 billion electronic records overhaul.While better care and cost savings are the drivers behind electronic health records, Medidata and Veeva products are in demand from the life sciences industry because the companies can help move cures from their pharmaceutical and biotech customers more quickly to market.The cloud-based software companies aim to displace the legacy, on-premise systems that are still prevalent in the life sciences industry, but which make it especially painful to run clinical trials around the globe while complying with FDA and other international regulations.Veeva first made a splash with its customer relationship management software for global drug sales reps, which simplified their communication with physicians in a compliant way. It has since found success providing cloud-based content management for drug trials and tracking quality control processes for drug manufacturing.This year, Veeva has taken aim directly at Medidata's bread and butter of clinical data management, giving it a full suite of software for managing clinical trials. Given Veeva's track record of taking aim at markets and bowling over the competition, Medidata shares were under a cloud after Veeva's fall 2016 announcement.But now that cloud appears to be lifting, because Medidata is thriving and proving that its market strength is sustainable, says Piper Jaffray's Wieland, noting that Oracle has been \"a net donor of market share.\"Medidata CEO Tarek Sherif said on the April 16 Q1 earnings call that company scored a milestone early in the second quarter, with 18 of the top 25 pharma companies now using the Medidata Clinical Cloud, with  (TEVA) being the recent addition.\"Veeva is going to do well,\" Wieland said. But given the breadth of Medidata's market leadership, the cost of switching software providers and the growing scope of the company's offerings, which have been aided by recent acquisitions, the outlook also looks strong for Medidata, he says, and analysts are projecting revenue growth in the high teens in the next couple of years.Meanwhile, Veeva, which has been seeing 30%-plus quarterly revenue growth, continues to expand its addressable market. The company announced in May that a top-5 consumer-packaged goods company was beginning a trial of its Vault software, which analysts have said has potential to expand into other regulated markets besides the life sciences industry. The number of customers with more than one Veeva Vault application rose 70% year over year, which about is the best testament a software company could hope for.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" was a big mover last session, as its shares rose over 13% on the day.

(Symbol: CERN) saw new options become available this week, for the August 18th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CERN options chain for the new August 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $63.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CERN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $67.13/share today.Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.46% return on the cash commitment, or 15.49% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $67.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of CERN stock at the current price level of $67.13/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $67.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.20% if the stock gets called away at the August 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CERN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CERN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $67.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $67.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.65% boost of extra return to the investor, or 22.97% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 25%.

Below, three of our analysts explain why they believe the durable and powerful competitive advantages of  (NASDAQ: CERN) ,  (NASDAQ: ISRG) , and  (NASDAQ: AAPL) could pay off for investors. : For those of you unaware of Cerner, it's a leading healthcare information technology supplier (HCIT) that helps clients improve their operations and efficiency with a slew of software, hardware and other services. But the key factor supporting Cerner's top and bottom line performance is the high switching costs its customers face.Consider that these complex information technology products have significant implementation times -- ask any IT professional, in any industry, how difficult it is to switch to a new product companywide. Some clients that move to Cerner choose to implement its products over periods as long as 18 to 24 months. But once that's done, switching to a competitor's product is an expensive and inefficient proposition.Investors should also consider that the complexity of health record management systems, and the regulations around them, are only increasing. That bodes well for Cerner, which has a strong reputation within the industry. Clients are buying into its story: The company posted a win rate above 50% and added 360 acute facilities in the past two years. Further, in the  , it posted 11% revenue growth and 7% bookings growth -- and 37% of bookings were from new footprints, as well.Cerner isn't without its risks though, as competition is likely to increase right along with the favorable outlook for the HCIT sector. But as long as the company's products and services remain top-notch, it has competitive advantages that should make it a long-term winner. (  ): One company that practically has \"catch us if you can\" inscribed over its doors is robotic-assisted surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical.What makes this company so great is its  . Those who have only a passing familiarity with the company probably assume that sales of its da Vinci surgical systems generate most of its revenue and profits -- but they'd be wrong. Though these machines cost around $1.5 million each, they're actually quite low margin for Intuitive Surgical.da Vinci Xi with splayed arms.Its real money is made by supplying the instrumentation and disposable supplies for each procedure, and in servicing the da Vinci hardware every so often. Since the training required to use the da Vinci system is complex, and the cost of its surgical systems so high, once a hospital buys one, it's unlikely to switch to competitor's platform. In other words, Intuitive Surgical is able to lock in its customers for the long term, and keep profiting by providing high-margin instruments and services long after the initial sale. Thus, the larger the company's installed base, presumably the higher its margins should head.How far ahead is Intuitive Surgical? According to the company's first-quarter investor presentation, 3,919 da Vinci Surgical Systems were installed worldwide as of Dec. 31, 2016. You could add up all of its competitors' installed bases, and the total wouldn't even be close to that figure. It takes time and money to build the type of rapport with hospitals that Intuitive Surgical has developed, and that's not easily replicable.The company is also constantly innovating. A little over two weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration approved the next version of its da Vinci system, which isn't as pricey as its other systems and could have significant appeal in overseas markets. Not to mention, Intuitive Surgical's marketing team is doing a great job in pushing physicians to use its robotic devices in more general soft-tissue surgeries.Opportunities abound domestically and internationally for Intuitive Surgical, and it has its massive business advantages to thank for it. :  With your indulgence, I'm going to go ahead and state the obvious: Apple has a huge business advantage when it comes to selling smartphones. And no, I don't mean the iPhone 8.Fact is, analysts are starting to argue that iPhone 8 might actually  be the best thing that could happen to  -- not if the long-awaited 10th Anniversary edition of the iPhone gets introduced late in 2017, siphons sales out of 2018, and thus  . (Too abrupt a slowdown could rapidly cool enthusiasm for the stock).Rather, what I'm referring to here is the fact that while many companies (and lately,  ) have proven they're able to sell smartphones and capture market share, Apple is far and away the best company at earning  from selling smartphones.According to market researcher Strategy Analytics, Apple captured 79% of all profits made from selling smartphones last year. Indeed, in one quarter -- Q3 -- Apple accounted for  % of smartphone profits earned worldwide. Put another way, if selling smartphones is a zero sum game, with Apple competing on one side versus everyone else on the other, then Apple earned all the profit that quarter, and everybody else lost money. magazine explained the phenomenon last year: \"The last several years, Apple and Samsung have nearly exclusively owned smartphone profits and have typically combined to secure more than 100%. Profit shares are able to exceed 100% as smaller handset makers post losses. Companies like Apple and Samsung gobble up everything else.\"And here's the thing: Profits are what smartphone companies use to fund their R&D for new smartphones. Because Apple has most of those profits, its ability to innovate and develop the new technologies that will allow it to remain dominant is secure. Meanwhile, a lack of profits puts its competitors at a real disadvantage in developing their own next-gen devices.Long story short: Investors may debate whether Apple is \"too expensive\" with its P/E ratio at 17 and its long-term projected growth rate at only 11%. But at least Apple  profits, and a P/E to debate about. Most of its competitors have neither on the smartphone front -- and that's a huge business advantage for Apple.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: CERN) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $66.06, changing hands for $67.34/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 16 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cerner Corp., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $45.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $77.00. The standard deviation is $8.621.But the whole reason to look at the  CERN price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CERN crossing above that average target price of $66.06/share, investors in CERN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $66.06 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Veeva's share price has soared nearly 50% year to date, while Cerner stock is up a solid 35%.Veeva and Cerner could have even more room to run. But which of these health information services stocks is the better pick for long-term investors? Here's how Veeva and Cerner compare.Image source: Getty Images.To understand just how successful Veeva Systems has been, consider that it's the  ever to reach $500 million in sales. Veeva achieved that distinction by addressing the complex needs of the life sciences industry with its cloud solutions. After 10 years in business, the company now claims 517 customers.Veeva's revenue has more than quadrupled in the last five years. Its earnings have increased from $18.8 million in 2013 to $68.8 million last year, and the company doesn't appear to be slowing down much. Veeva will announce its 2017 first-quarter results later this week and is expected to post a 20% year-over-year earnings increase. Analysts project that the company will grow earnings over the next five years by an average annual rate of 21%.The company's Commercial Cloud and Vault products should be critical to achieving this level of growth. Commercial Cloud is built around Veeva's vaunted customer relationship management (CRM) system. Vault includes the company's clinical data management and clinical operations solutions.Veeva's stock valuation isn't for the faint of heart. Its shares currently trade at nearly 63 times expected earnings. That's pricey even factoring in the company's growth prospects.Cerner ranks as the largest stand-alone healthcare information technology provider in the world. The company's systems are in more than 25,000 healthcare facilities worldwide, including hospitals, physicians' offices, laboratories, and more. Eighteen of the 30 largest healthcare systems use Cerner's technology.Over the past five years, Cerner's revenue has increased nearly 80%. During the same period, its earnings grew 60%, from $397.2 million in 2012 to $636.5 million last year. In the  , Cerner reported a year-over-year adjusted earnings per share increase of nearly 21%, thanks primarily to higher system sales. Wall Street analysts think the company will grow earnings by an average annual rate of 14% over the next five years.Cerner expects much of its growth will stem from replacing other electronic health record systems. The company also sees significant opportunities for its population health management solution and managed services businesses, ITWorks and RevWorks. ITWorks targets the needs of hospital information technology departments, while RevWorks includes solutions and services to help healthcare organizations improve their revenue cycle functions.Cerner's shares trade at 23 times expected earnings. The company's valuation is higher than most of its major competitors, but still is well below the valuation of one key rival --  .If we only looked at valuation, Cerner would definitely be the better pick. Its stock is much less expensive than Veeva's stock using pretty much every valuation metric available.However, the market tends to prize growth more than anything else. Veeva Systems is likely to grow faster than Cerner will. I think both Cerner and Veeva are solid long-term picks.

Did Cerner's sunny outlook prove accurate? Here are the highlights.Image source: Getty Images.Data source: Cerner.Cerner enjoyed solid growth in system sales. Revenue from sales of new systems increased 14.5% year over year to $319.9 million. Revenue from support, maintenance, and services rose 9.4% from the prior year period to $918.2 million. Revenue stemming from reimbursed travel increased 17% year over year to $22.4 million. Cerner's total revenue came in at the high end of the guidance range provided previously.The company's bottom-line improvement was even better. Cerner kept costs under control, with total operating expenses in the first quarter of $817.4 million, up 9.4% from the prior year period. General and administrative expenses actually declined almost 2% from the first quarter of last year to $88.4 million. As a result, Cerner was able to post earnings at the high end of its guidance range.Bookings (the amount of prospective revenue from contracts signed but not yet implemented) in the first quarter totaled $1.25 billion. That reflected a 7% increase from the prior year period and was above the midpoint of Cerner's guidance range.Cerner reported first-quarter operating cash flow of $303.6 million, with free cash flow of $144.4 million. Days sales outstanding in the first quarter was 71 days, down from 76 days in the same quarter of 2016. The company's total backlog stood at just over $16 billion, up 10% year over year.Commenting on his company's first-quarter performance, Cerner president Zane Burke said, \"Our first-quarter results represent a strong start to the year, with all key metrics at or above expected levels. Our results again included a significant number of new client wins, reflecting our strong competitive position and an active marketplace.\"Cerner projects second-quarter revenue between $1.265 billion and $1.335 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter are expected to come in between $0.60 and $0.62.For the full-year 2017, Cerner projects revenue in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $2.44 and $2.56. Both ranges are consistent with previously provided guidance. The company also expects second-quarter bookings will be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion.Cerner continues to attract new customers, with recent wins including St. Joseph's Healthcare System in New Jersey and Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center in California. The healthcare technology provider is also gaining additional ground with existing customers. For example, longtime customer Palmetto Health in South Carolina recently expanded Cerner's revenue cycle management software across four of its acute facilities.The company's business appears to be in solid shape for the future. Recurring revenue from support, maintenance, and services gives Cerner a reliable revenue stream.

Focusing on the company level for the health care sector, the top 10 performers are averaging 41% year-to-date, while the bottom 10 are averaging a 8.9% return.The disparity between the top- and bottom-performers tells us that this is a stock pickers dream of a sector. Today's three big stock charts takes a look at  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) as leadership stocks that are ready to move even higher.Pharmaceutical sourcing company AmerisourceBergen has lit it up to the tune of 20% year-to-date. This matches the stock's 12-month return, indicating that it has been a comeback kid within the sector.The charts for ABC is bullish from a short-term trend perspective as shares are breaking above $92. This price stood as resistance in February and took the stock all the way back down to $80 in April.A good earnings report sparked a short-term rally that now has ABC stock breaking through the $92-level chart resistance with a higher target.The last two days have seen AmerisourceBergen stock teeter on breaking through the top Bollinger Band, a move that will add to the positive volatility the shares have experienced. Look for ABC shares to target $100 on that move.Anthem is one of the health benefits companies providing leadership in the health care sector with 31% year-to-date gains.ANTM stock is in the midst of a volatility rally as shares broke through chart resistance at $185 on Thursday. The move also took the stock through the top Bollinger Band for the first time since late April.The Bollinger Band break in April resulted in a 10% rally that stalled at $185, thus creating the chart resistance for Anthem at that level.We expect to see the technical traders move into the shares quickly as ANTM stock breaks higher with a target of $200.It is no surprise that a technology company in the health care sector is taking a leadership role in this rally. Cerner shares have racked-up 40% gains over the last 12 months and are setting-up to break above a key chart level.The $67.50 price point caused CERN stock to tumble as \"sell the news\" traders took profits after the August 2016 earnings results, which were positive. From that point, Cerner stock rode a \"slope of hope\" decline into its January lows at $47.50.Now, with positive fundamentals and a strong technical backdrop, CERN stock is set to take out those August 2016 highs. The break above this long-term chart resistance level will attract the attention of the long-term traders and likely increase buying volume.A bonus on CERN shares is that the short interest is in the process of receding, indicating that the stock is being driven by a short covering rally.

Most market participants focused on the first-quarter gross domestic product statistics from the Commerce Department, which at 0.7% marked the weakest growth rate for the U.S. economy in three years. Readings on consumer spending were surprisingly weak, especially in light of more encouraging news on home sales, but many of those who follow retail suspect that things have already picked up during the current quarter.Some individual companies also had good news to report, and  (NYSE: RCL) ,  (NASDAQ: CERN) , and  (NASDAQ: ALGN) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.Shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises finished 6% higher after the company reported its first-quarter financial results. The cruise operator said that net income more than doubled from year-ago levels on a 5% rise in revenue, as substantially reduced operating costs fell through to the bottom line. Volume metrics were strong, with gains in number of passengers carried, number of cruise-days booked, and occupancy rates on the company's vessels. In response, Royal Caribbean boosted its full-year earnings outlook and now believes it will post between $7.00 and $7.20 per share for 2017. Add to that a new authorization for a $500 million stock repurchase program, and investors are responding favorably to the confidence that Royal Caribbean has in itself and its future prospects.Image source: Royal Caribbean.Cerner stock rose 8% in the wake of the company's first-quarter earnings report. The health information technology specialist said that bookings and revenue were up slightly more than it had originally expected in its previous guidance, and adjusted earnings were also at the high end of its predicted range. The company continued to take advantage of strong demand for health IT services, citing several new client wins among the factors accelerating its top-line growth. Cerner repeated its past guidance for the full year, and it believes that its competitive position in solid enough to hold rivals at bay. Backlog growth of 10% to $16.1 billion points to several years' worth of business in Cerner's pipeline, and that only highlights how important its services are to its clients.Finally, shares of Align Technology jumped 12%. The maker of Invisalign orthodontic devices said that sales jumped 30% to a record high, with case volume rising by a fifth in North America and at more than double that rate internationally. Align has found that although it originally sought to market to adults needing orthodontic services, use among teens has grown at a faster pace than the company expected. The company also expects its second-quarter growth to be strong, with volume and dollar-value revenue climbing in the neighborhood of 25% to 28%. With nearly 39,000 doctors using Invisalign, Align Technology has a clear hit on its hands, and the biggest question is the extent to which the company can take full advantage of the growth opportunity it has in its arsenal.

(Symbol: CERN) saw new options begin trading this week, for the December 15th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 234 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CERN options chain for the new December 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $57.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $57.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CERN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $59.38/share today.Because the $57.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.74% return on the cash commitment, or 8.95% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., and highlighting in green where the $57.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.40. If an investor was to purchase shares of CERN stock at the current price level of $59.38/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.45% if the stock gets called away at the December 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CERN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CERN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.41% boost of extra return to the investor, or 11.56% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 25%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 26%.

This is the first time that we've seen a build in short interest over three periods since May of 2016, ahead of a relatively short and fast correction in the market.We're taking a look at the model results from our short interest analysis of the S&P 500 companies to identify those that have the potential for short squeeze rallies as prices continue to edge higher. The table below identifies the top 15 companies that matched our short squeeze criteria. Today, the additions to total short interest represent some concern, as the market is showing weakness as we head into the first-quarter earnings season. That said, there are a number of companies that are showing signs that the \"wall of worry\" is strong enough to maintain their rallies.After that, we chose three companies to highlight, ones that look primed to push out their short sellers.They are, in no particular order\u2026Home builders and home-building-related stocks have been on the rise as the outlook for the economy and consumer spending continue to improve.  (NYSE:  ) shares were one of those that spent the entirety of the last home-building-driven rally leading the market higher, and it looks ready to do it again.Click to Enlarge Leggett & Platt shares are only trading about 4% higher on a year-to-date basis, as the stock has been jammed in a trading range. The trading range has brought the short sellers into the mix, as we've seen short interest on LEG shares increase to their highest levels in more than two years.The current short interest represents roughly 10 times the average daily volume for Leggett & Platt stock, indicating an elevated probability that a short squeeze will occur - all that's needed is a trigger.That trigger may come in the form of a breakout of the stock's range. The stock is in the process of challenging $51. A move above this mark would break the top of the range that has been in place since December, triggering a potential covering rally. Our models are suggesting a target of $56 at the hands of short sellers covering their positions.Healthcare companies have been stuck in a rut as possible regulatory changes have been uncertain. The recent failure to replace Obamacare has resulted in some strength in the sector, including  (NASDAQ:  ) stock.Click to Enlarge Year-to-date, Cerner shares are up more than 25%, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the number of shares that have been shorted. Short sellers increased their bearish bets on the stock over the last two weeks by 4%. This took the current short interest to its highest readings in more than two years.The high short interest results in a short interest ratio of 8.8, or nearly 9 days to cover, which is above our model's trigger level indicating a higher-than-normal probability of a short covering rally.In Cerner's case, the price trigger for a covering rally appears to be any move above $60. The stock has spent the last two weeks bumping its head against this round numbered resistance, rejected each time.A break of $60 will start to shake the short sellers out of the stock as the chart's next target price is $65. Our model suggests a similar level for a short covering rally to target.The semiconductor sector has been on fire for more than a year, leading the technology and broader markets higher. Microchip Technology has been right there as the stock has gained more than 50% over the last twelve months and 15% so far in 2017.Click to Enlarge Microchip Technology is holding strong trendline support as the shares are above their 50-day moving average which is also trending higher. Our historical back testing shows that this combination is bullish for a stock over the intermediate-term (one-to-three-month) outlook.Short sellers aren't aware of the performance, though, as we've seen bets against Microchip Technology increase an incredible 50% since the beginning of the year, while the stock has been in strong rally mode. This builds a strong case for a short covering rally to move Microchip Technology even higher.The stock surged above $76 after its last earnings report, but quickly moved back below $74.50, which has acted as resistance since then. This level is the likely trigger price for a potential short covering rally.Microchip Technology won't announce earnings until May 3, but a \"buy the news\" rally is likely to occur before that date based on the company's performance last quarter. Given this, we would definitely expect to see them making a covering rally materialize over the next few weeks.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["orth Kansas City, MO-based  , a leading global provider of healthcare information technology solutions (HCIT), is set to report first-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell on Apr 27.Last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 57 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the company's earnings did not top the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the last four quarters, resulting in an average miss of 0.45%. Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this release.We believe that Cerner's strong product portfolio will help it to boost its customer base. The frequent contract wins reflect growing traction. Furthermore, the company has strong growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory space.The company forecasts revenues between $1.200 billion and $1.275 billion for first-quarter 2017. Booking revenues are projected in the band of $1.125 billion and $1.275 billion. Adjusted earnings are expected at 57 cents to 59 cents per share.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive and Cerner, a major player in this space, has been facing cut-throat competition from other reputed players. This has impacted the company's pricing and margins to a great extent. Stringent hospital budgets exert further pressure on pricing. We do not expect the first quarter to have been an exception.Also, overall activities of Cerner during the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts' confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported fell 2 cents to 53 cents per share in the last 90 days. | Our quantitative model doesn't point to an earnings beat for Cerner this quarter.

(Symbol: CERN) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $57.50, changing hands for $57.77/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cerner Corp., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $45.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $69.00. The standard deviation is $7.229.But the whole reason to look at the  CERN price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CERN crossing above that average target price of $57.50/share, investors in CERN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $57.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Industry leaders heaved a sigh of relief on President Trump's promise of repealing major healthcare taxes including the two signature taxes of Obamacare: the unpopular Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans) and the controversial 2.3% MedTech tax. These taxes, which were commonly addressed as the 'fund of the Affordable Care Act (ACA),' simply took a toll on the entire medical device industry.According to MedTech majors, the abolition of the ACA taxes will directly address issues like lack of opportunity for research and development, innovation, pipeline development and increase investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products. This will also help in boosting job creation and quality of patient care.On the other hand, going through the just-released proposed Trump action plan - The American Healthcare Act (AHA) - the first thing that comes to mind is whether the intensive research and development, which will result in the development of expensive cutting-edge healthcare products, will be a fruitful investment. This is because the industry is likely to witness a shrinking customer base post-enactment.Let's dig deeper inside for a better understanding of this:Although Trump has proposed a full replacement of Obamacare through the enactment of AHA, there is uncertainty regarding this. It's, after all, difficult to find a substitute for a policy that has extended health insurance to 21 million people. Not to forget, this was the plan which drove the rate of uninsured to a historic low.The replacement bill talks about stopping the Medicaid expansion plan in its entirety, which may reduce federal deficit at the cost of stripping healthcare coverage for millions of poor Americans and non-American inhabitants. A projection by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has added fuel to the debate.Per the projection, federal deficit will fall $337 billion between 2017 and 2026 under the replacement bill. According to the CBO and JCT, the reduction in outlays for Medicaid and elimination of the ACA's subsidies for nongroup health insurance will contribute to the majority of this deficit reduction. Apparently, this may lead the economy to touch new highs.At the same time, CBO and JCT also indicated that if the Obamacare replacement act is passed, in a decade from now, approximately 24 million Americans would lose insurance coverage. In 2018 alone, 14 million people would be left uninsured under the legislation.There is mixed sentiment in the medical device community. The medical device trade association AdvaMed is one of the few who are in favor of the replacement policy. According to them, the entire MedTech fraternity is looking forward to the new policymakers who will be working on improving the FDA regulatory process, repeal of the medical device tax, and ensuring that the coverage process allows patients access to the latest innovations.However, the data from CBO and JCT discussed above is a dampener. A shrinking customer base indicates an impending slash in the demand for expensive medical procedures and devices. While the White House and Capitol Hill responded to the forecast as 'just absurd,' they have yet to justify their stance. Economists worldwide are divided on this proposal. If it materializes, it may lead to major demand supply disequilibrium within the medical device niche.Within the Zacks Industry classification, Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level:  ,  ,  and  .We rank all the 260-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit:  .As a guideline, the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'The Zacks Industry Rank for med instruments is #98; Medical Info Systems is #169 while Med/Dental-Supp is #176 and med products is at #181. Analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments, it is obvious that the outlook for these aforementioned MedTech subsectors is overall negative.The price performances of these four Zacks categorized sub-industries also symbolize a bearish market sentiment.It has been observed that since the election results on Nov. 8 last year, these four subsectors have performed below the market at large.Over this period, while the S&P 500 Market Index gained 10.7%, the med instruments space grossly underperformed with a rise of 7.61%. Some of the stocks within this space that have grossly underperformed the S&P Index are Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:  -  ), T2 Biosystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:  -  ) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (NYSE:  -  ).Medical Product stocks grew a mere 5.06%. The stocks belonging to this space include INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:  -  ).Another small subcategory medical info systems was no exception either. Since the Republicans occupied the chair, the sector has failed to surpass the market index with 9.1% growth rate. One of the stocks that contributed to this underperformance is Cerner Corp.

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We believe that Cerner has solid growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) suite of solutions. In fact, the segment has been a strong contributor in 2016 with RevWorks services posting a solid performance. In fact, for the full year, the segment witnessed 19% revenue growth and record level of bookings.The next biggest driver of growth for Cerner is its Population Health (PH) Management platform. Notably, the company clinched a high number of large contracts for the PH platform in the last reported quarter.Cerner offers exposure to worldwide healthcare automation. Its international operations provide a more diversified revenue stream. In the past, the company had won contracts in the U.K. as well as the Middle East. Furthermore, Cerner constantly pursues complementary business acquisitions that enable it to expand its solutions, device offerings and services.On the flipside, Cerner operates in the HCIT space which is intensely competitive and fast evolving, subjecting it to rapid technological changes. Bigwigs like Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Epic Systems, GE Healthcare Technologies, McKesson Corp, Quality Systems and others pose competitive threat to Cerner in the niche area.Cerner's share price movement has been quite impressive in the past three months. The company gained 24.9%, higher than the Zacks categorized Medical information-systems sub-industry's return of 17.9%.On the flip side, the estimate revision trend for the current fiscal remains unfavorable with 11 estimates moving south over the last two months, compared with no movement in the opposite direction. The company's current estimates slipped 3.3% over the past two months.Notably, over the last four trailing quarters, the stock posted a negative earnings surprise of almost 0.5%. Cerner ended fourth-quarter 2016 on a mixed note, wherein adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues missed the same.Better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include Inogen Inc.  , IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  and Fluidigm Corporation  .

Shares have added about 2.5% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Cerner Corp (CERN) reported adjusted fourth-quarter 2016 earnings of $0.57 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, earnings inched down 1.7% on a year-over-year basis.The company reported net revenues of $1.257 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.262 billion. Meanwhile, revenues rose almost 7% on a year-over-year basis and were pegged at the midpoint of Cerner's previously provided guidance of $1.225 billion to $1.300 billion.For full-year 2016, the company registered revenues worth $4.80 billion, up 8% on a year-over-year basis. Of the major revenue segments, System sales accounted for 26.3% of net revenues in 2016. Furthermore, Support, maintenance and service revenues had a share of 71.8% and Reimbursed travel segment accounted for 1.8% of net revenues in 2016.Bookings in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $1.44 billion, up 7% on a year-over-year basis. In comparison with the company's previously provided guidance, bookings were at the lower end of the range due to the lack of new ITWorks deals.Revenue Cycle was a strong contributor to the company's results, courtesy of strong sales and solid contribution from RevWorks services (revenue management services). For the full year, the segment witnessed 19% revenue growth and record bookings.Population Health service businesses also drove revenues in the fourth quarter on the back of solid growth in the company's flagship HealtheIntent solutions. For the full year, the segment witnessed 13% growth in revenues compared to 2015.Meanwhile, Cerner and the University of Missouri Health Care announced an agreement to extend their partnership in the fourth quarter. The duo extended their existing HealtheIntent population health management platform across the Health Network of MissouriThe company also posted an impressive performance in the ambulatory and small hospital market. For the full year, ambulatory bookings grew 16% on a year-over-year basis.System sales decreased 7.8% year over year to $352.2 million, owing to a decline in technology resale and software.Total services revenues, including professional and managed services, rose 13.5% from the year-ago quarter. This is in line with management's guidance and reflects solid execution by the company's service organizations.Due to lower equipment maintenance revenues as a result of technology resale, Support and maintenance revenues increased 3%.Geographically, domestic revenues increased 7% from the year-ago quarter to $1.11 billion and non-U.S. revenues grew 8% to $145 million.Gross margin in the reported quarter contracted 10 basis points, totaling 82.9%, courtesy of the lower mix of technology resale and improving service margins.Cerner registered adjusted operating margin of 23.3% in the reported quarter, which is down from 24.7% year over year.As a percentage of revenues, sales and client services expanded 110 basis points (bps) to 42.7%. Meanwhile, both software development and general and administrative expenses contracted roughly 40 and 20 bps, respectively.Cerner had a total backlog of $15.927 billion, up 12% on a year-over-year basis.Cerner ended the fourth quarter of 2016 with $466 million of total cash and investments.Total debt for Cerner, including capital lease obligations, was $564 million.Operating cash flow for the quarter was $333.2 million.For first-quarter 2017, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.200 billion and $1.275 billion. The company expects booking revenues in the band of $1.125 billion and $1.275 billion. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the band of $0.57 to $0.59 per share.For full-year 2017, management expects revenues between $5.100 billion and $5.300 billion. Cerner currently forecasts 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $2.44 and $2.56 per share.Analysts were quiet during the last one month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions. | At this time, Cerner's stock has a nice Growth Score of 'B', though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a 'C'. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated also a grade of 'C' on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of 'B'. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for growth investors than those looking for value and momentum.Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Over many years, the value of stocks traded on U.S. stock markets (as judged by market cap) have traditionally fluctuated between 33% and 43% of all publicly traded issues worldwide.Not only that; in terms of the quality of the regulatory environment, the U.S. is among the nations where we can most trust the reported revenues and various filings. (Earnings, which are regrettably the most reported upon numbers released to the public, can be manipulated in any number of ways, no matter where the company is domiciled.) Taking the midpoint of that range U.S. markets look like thisIn bear markets, history shows that few investors elect to stick with their index funds. But in bull markets, there is a preponderance of advice given that individual investors and active managers cannot keep pace with simply buying the lowest-cost passive index fund that mimics one index. Many investors have short memories and forget the carnage of previous bear markets (like March 2000 to March 2003 and October 2007 to March 2009.)As a result, many of us are quick to jump on the index bandwagon. The index most often employed is the most appropriate one if investors are inclined to hand responsibility to one index: the most popular index is the SPX, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. It should be. The S&P 500 Index consists of all the large-cap stocks, some mid-cap stocks and a few REITs; in the aggregate, it is a fine cross-representation of America's biggest and best (or, since we are talking market capitalization rather than corporate assets, revenues, etc., it is comprised more accurately of the \"most popular\") companies.So popular have U.S. equities become, in fact, and so disrespected are equities in the rest of the world right now that, according to the latest numbers from S&P, U.S. markets now comprise 52% of total global markets.Some may read this chart and say, \"Go, USA! We're No. 1!\" I look at it and wonder, given that this is a position beyond what it has typically been, if there might be a reversion to the mean. That doesn't mean U.S. stocks will have to fall. It might be just as likely that foreign stocks will rise. In either case, it is the biggest reason why we are diversifying our holdings at this point to include more foreign-based multinationals.I certainly haven't given up on U.S. securities. Indeed, the biggest single position in my family accounts and many client accounts is the Gotham Index Plus Fund. I wrote about it  in the process of discovering the way to publish a \"secret\" article. If you ever want to write an article that no one will read, just select the \"Mutual Fund\" category during your submission! I usually get a couple thousand page views and a half-dozen comments on even my most obscure articles, but by writing about a mutual fund I ensured that no one would read it and only one person would comment on it.It seems the current popular opinion makes discussions of mutual funds moot: \"Mutual funds bad. ETFs good! Active management bad. Passive good! Lowest expense ratio (even if total return is not as good) totally excellent. Higher expense (even if after-expenses total return is better) bad, bad, very bad!\"The interesting thing is thatGotham Index Plus Fund is an index fund, albeit one with a twist. Its foundation is a straight S&P 500 index fund. It is also a 130/30 fund, or in this case, 190/90, co-managed by value investors  (  ,  ), author of \"The Little Book That Beats the Market,\" and his partner and co-Chief investment Officer Robert Goldstein. (A caveat: this fund has a $250,000 minimum investment, but many  age firms have negotiated a much lower entry price, like $5,000.)I own a number of U.S. stocks, ETFs, mutual funds and CEFs and always will. But for me the mix is changing in two ways. Here's why I believe a straight S&P 500 fund is simply not the way to create an all-seasons, best-performing portfolio: all markets revert to the mean (RTM). (For those inclined to pillory me for trying to protect client and reader portfolios from a possible decline, please remember that RTM is classic Jack Bogle! If you have 20 or 30 years until you need to tap your portfolio then RTM, even if it leaves your mouth dry and your heart beating loudly as it traces its bottom, will ultimately trace higher above the mean as well.)However, I don't personally want to own only one asset class - U.S. stocks - even if they are divided into the subsets of U.S. large cap, some U.S. midcap and a few U.S. REITs. Here are the asset classes I consider investing in:And here, highlighted in yellow, are the asset classes the S&P 500, the most popular investment choice of the greatest number of American investors invests in:This may look complicated at first glance, but it isn't. Just because we have that full smorgasbord from which to choose doesn't mean we have to use every one of them. Sometimes I'm quite satisfied to be in only one or two of them. There are certainly times in the investing cycle when it would be a good thing to put all your eggs in the basket defined by all U.S. large caps, a number of U.S. mid caps and a few REITs. Heck, for most of the past eight years that would have been as good a choice as any and better than most!But I am a value investor so today I have selected the primary asset classes of U.S. and international developed market securities (be they stocks, funds or ETFs), U.S. REITs, specific income holdings and alternatives - five broad classes that provide growth, income and risk management.Eight years ago companies that were selling for 11 times earnings are now selling at 33 times earnings; companies selling at a book ratio of 1.1 are now at 2.5. And as for investor sentiment, too many people are whistling past the graveyard hoping nothing jumps out and grabs them. These people will stick with their narrow band of asset classes defined by the S&P 500.For the rest of us, might I suggest you at least consider doing what we are doing for clients and suggesting for subscribers. Right now - and this will change if trailing stops execute or I decide to change the allocation parameters- we are about 35% long U.S. all-cap, midcap and value funds as well as U.S. health care stocks like  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).We have also purchased natural gas firms like  (  ),  (  ) and  (CHK), which I suggested for purchase recently, and tech companies like  (CSCO) and  (HPQ). We also have about 8% of the sample portfolio in U.S. REITs like  (DOC) and  (LADR).We own about 10%, and will own more, in the international equities arena. Some examples are  (RHHBY),  (MXE) and  (DBEU). At this stage of the market cycle, we also own another 13% or so in income holdings like ETF First Trust Preferred and Income and T Rowe Price Floating Rate Fund and another 14% in smart beta funds like AQR Long/Short and Vivaldi Merger/Arbitrage.It really isn't that complicated to trulydiversify to protect against market risk. I happen to love doing the reading, research and analysis of common stocks so I have quite a mix. But you could do much the same, with hopefully similar results, using just six or seven funds or six or seven ETFs.As Sgt. Phil Esterhaus used to say, \"Let's be careful out there!\"Good investing,I am long Cerner,Enzo Biochem, Tekla Health Sciences, Range Resources, Southwestern Energy, Chesapeake Energy, Cisco, HP,Physicians Realty, Ladder,Roche Holdings, Mexico Fund and ETF Europe Hedged Equity.

Rather an obvious statement, but too many investors look solely at periodic past performance rather than implementing a rational plan that is right for them.This article first appeared on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["t can be tough to choose the right investments for your work-related retirement account. Most have few choices, and fewer allow you to invest in individual stocks. That said, for those who have individual options, we think you should consider buying your company's stock or  (NASDAQ: CERN) . Meanwhile, those who don't should consider buying the entire stock market via the  (NYSEMKT: VTI) or a similar fund. I have only worked for one company that has even offered a 401(k), and the only stock I could buy at the time was that of my employer. However, that's actually not a bad option because it allows you to participate in the value you are creating for the company's investors. As that value increases, it serves as an incentive to continue working hard.Image source: Getty Images.That said, not everyone would agree with this advice, and for a good reason. Investing in your company's stock concentrates your financial risk. For example, if tough times hit the company, it could be a double-whammy with the potential for you to lose both your job and investment in the company's stock. Just ask former employees of Enron, many of whom lost everything when it went belly up because they loaded up on the stock.However, there are ways to limit this risk. The most important is to know your company and its industry well enough to determine if it's built to last. Consider whether it operates in a cyclical industry and if there has been a history of layoffs. That would be an ominous sign. On the other hand, if it has consistently grown earnings and cash flow, and has a bright future, then there's no reason you wouldn't want to be an investor, too. That said, in either case, you should keep your allocation to a comfortable level. A good rule of thumb for any investment is to keep it to less than 10% of the whole. That's meaningful enough to make a difference if things go well, but not so much as to cause permanent damage if they do not. While most of us are stuck with fairly strict parameters on what we can buy in our 401(k) plans, if you're one of the lucky investors with the ability to select individual stocks, Cerner Corp should be on your list of candidates.Cerner is a leading healthcare information technology supplier that provides a range of software, hardware, and services to thousands of hospitals and facilities around the world. The interesting thing about Cerner is that it develops and creates its own software and services internally, which provides a high-quality and more seamless product than its competitors. Historically, that's led to Cerner creating long-term relationships with its clients, which fuels top- and bottom-line growth.Another positive factor for investors is that Cerner's clients face high switching costs. Implementation of Cerner's IT products and services can take longer than a year in some cases, and with a service contract lasting even longer, it gives incentive for consumers to keep the same system and products -- especially considering that healthcare information technology is responsible for human lives. data by  .As you can see in the graphic above, Cerner has been able to translate its in-house developed products into a strong brand and consistently growing top and bottom lines. That's not likely to change in the near term, and that's why Cerner should be a top candidate for your 401(k) or owned in the funds you choose. As Daniel already mentioned, buying shares of anything for your 401(k) can be extremely difficult. Usually, the options are limited to whatever the company that's executing your plan makes available. That's why my suggestion is to go with whatever the broadest, lowest-fee index option is.For the past decade, the popularity of Vanguard's ETFs have boomed. Instead of turning over large sums of money every year to \"professionals\" who  beat the market, investors are getting wise and realizing that such \"potential\" usually goes unfulfilled. In return, they are willing to get market-matching returns and pay very low fees.I think an investor's best bet is to go with the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF. The fund has exposure to over 3,500 different stocks -- so there's plenty of diversification. Additionally, its expense ratio is just 0.05% -- extremely low. If your plan doesn't offer this specific ETF, I'd suggest aiming for a fund with similar diversification and low costs.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

With tens of millions of baby boomers heading toward retirement -- and likely needing more healthcare -- that won't soon change.That's why today's matchup is so interesting. In one corner, we have an industry heavyweight in  (NASDAQ: CERN) , the leading provider of information-technology systems in U.S. healthcare. In the other, we have  (NYSE: VEEV) , an upstart that is building out a cloud solution specifically designed to help drug companies take products through the approval process and to market.Image source: Getty ImagesBetween these two, which is the better buy today? That's impossible to answer with 100% precision. But by viewing the question through three different lenses, we can get a better idea.When we one day create the first time machine, I'm going to jump on it and tell my younger investor self one thing: \"Devote almost all your time to researching a company's sustainable competitive advantage.\" Often referred to as a \"moat,\" this has been -- by far -- the most important metric to study.Both Veeva and Cerner benefit from a massively important moat in the form of high switching costs. When hospitals starting using Cerner's systems, they become heavily reliant upon them to provide critical data in real time. Switching providers may not only be costly and create headaches for hospitals -- it also puts emergency-room lives on the line.Likewise, Veeva is becoming more and more ingrained in the ecosystem of pharmaceutical companies. Veeva got its start by offering customer relationship management (CRM) tools for company sales forces. More recently, however, it has spread its wings in offering Veeva Vault -- a solution that allows drug companies to keep mission-critical documents all on a single cloud-based platform as a drug moves through clinical trials.I would often call such a matchup a draw. But here, I believe that Veeva has a slight edge. The company keeps rolling out new products, signing on more drug companies, and becoming more ingrained in the operating culture of its clients. Recently, Cerner has seen its bookings drop, and its chief rival, privately held Epic Systems, is gaining market share. Veeva has no serious competition in the pure play for pharmaceutical cloud companies.While it's exciting to see a company aggressively reinvesting in its business -- or offering an outsized dividend -- we can't underestimate the importance of having a sizable cash stash on hand. When companies face hard times -- and they all eventually do -- those with cash on hand have options. Those with lots of debt simply don't.Here's how Veeva and Cerner stack up in terms of financial fortitude -- keeping in mind that Cerner is valued at roughly three times the size of Veeva:\n  \nData source: S&P Global Market Intelligence and Yahoo! Finance.Both these companies have fairly healthy balance sheets. Once again, however, Veeva gets the win. The company's lack of any long-term debt is a very positive sign that it can weather whatever uncertain future lies ahead.Lately, Cerner's acquisition of  Health Services for $1.3 billion has been looking a little overpriced, as it hasn't delivered the type of revenue growth investors were hoping for.Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is, including the ratios of price to earnings (P/E), price to free cash flow (P/FCF), and price-to-earnings divided by growth (PEG):\n  \nData sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings.Here we have a different outcome: Cerner is by far the cheaper stock. Even after accounting for the potential for growth (via the PEG ratio), Cerner looks to be trading at a discount to Veeva.So there you have it: Veeva has a slightly wider moat, and a slightly better balance sheet than Cerner, while Cerner comes in with a more favorable valuation. The moat provided by Veeva -- and its business momentum -- is part of the reason that it occupies over 3% of my real-life portfolio, while I hold no shares of Cerner. I suggest that shareholders with a long-term time horizon and a stomach for some volatility dig deeper into Veeva's story.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Veeva Systems wasn't one of them!

The reason? At the aggregate level, shorts are getting out of the market. Source: With stocks hitting all-time highs, it makes sense that the shorts would be throwing in the towel and abandoning their bearish bets. It's also a warning for those of us who monitor whether there is still a \"wall of worry\" in place for stocks to climb higher. Put simply, lower short interest means that there has been an erosion of that wall.What does this erosion look like? Well, the chart below displays aggregate short interest for the  companies since January 2015.Note the precipitous decline in total short interest since March of last year.Of course, the market has appreciated by more than 20% during this time. In other words, we've been witnessing a short covering rally of epic proportions over the last year that helped drive the markets to their new highs.So, this means that there aren't any more opportunities for short squeezes to drive outperformance, right?Wrong? As with everything else, it just means we must work harder to find the opportunities, which is where our database models come into play.The table below displays the top 15 S&P 500 stocks that still show potential for short squeeze rallies based on recent short interest and prices activity trends.And here are the three companies from this list you'll want to keep the closest eye on.A great example of being in the sweet spot of the Donald Trump Rally is  (NASDAQ:  ). The company provides logistic solutions using contract motor carriers, railroads, air freight carriers and ocean carriers. The transport and logistics companies are often among those that are market leaders during an economic expansion, which is why we're seeing attention to these stocks.C.H. Robinson Worldwide has outperformed peers, but not by a huge margin, which is why we've see shorts building positions in the stock just ahead of a technical move that is now attracting the crowd.Short interest on C.H. Robinson Worldwide was a 10% increase in the last report, just as the stock was breaking back into a technical bullish pattern. Now, shares are crossing above $78, the site of short-term chart resistance. This level, along with $80, will be the trigger for a short-covering rally that will drive the stock towards $90.Among the industrial stocks that stand out in our short squeeze filters is  (NYSE:  ). Short interest on the heavy machinery company increased by 3% in the last report. This took the short interest ratio to a reading of 9. This is well off the highs that the company saw last year, but still indicates a short covering rally is likely.Last week, Deere & Company reported better-than-expected earnings. Initially, the market reacted with higher prices that faded later in the trading session. The charts indicate that this resistance is likely due to nothing more than round-numbered resistance at the $110 price.For now, a trigger price for a short covering rally is $110. That will likely set a price target of $125 over the short-term.Healthcare companies have been on the ropes as traders and investors are trying to determine the risks associated with the new administration's goals for the health care system. As a result of the uncertainty, companies like  (NASDAQ:  ) had fallen to multiyear lows, creating potential short-term trading opportunities.Cerner shares have been in rally mode for the year to date, gaining more than 16% since the beginning of January.Short sellers have been betting against a continuance of the trend, as short interest on Cerner rose 6% in the last report. The increase in short interest has the short interest ratio working back towards the high end of its range. The ratio above 6 indicates a higher chance of a short squeeze rally based on a technical trigger, which appears to be looming.Cerner shares are preparing to cross above their 200-day moving average for the first time since breaking this support level in November. The move above this trendline will likely trigger shorts to start covering their positions, adding buying power to the stock.Currently, our models are forecasting a move to $62.50 on the back of a short covering rally in Cerner shares.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoIn early trading on Thursday, shares of CSX topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 16.8%.

The company missed its guidance, causing shares to drop.Cerner announced its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results after the market closed on Thursday. System sales didn't improve, but the company received help from other sources. Here are the highlights from Cerner's update.Image source: Getty Images.Data Source: Cerner.Cerner's guidance provided in November called for fourth-quarter revenue between $1.225 billion and $1.300 billion. The company hit the upper end of that range. Cerner also projected adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.60 to $0.62 in the fourth quarter. The actual result came in right at the midpoint.As was the case in the third quarter, Cerner's systems sales dropped significantly from the prior-year period. The company reported fourth-quarter systems sales of $352 million, down nearly 8% year over year.However, Cerner more than offset that decline with its support, maintenance, and services. Revenue from these areas increased 13.5% year over year, to $880 million.Cerner's GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings fell in the fourth quarter, though, because of higher operating expenses. One big driver of this higher spending was the company's sales and client services expenses, which climbed to $537 million -- up almost 10% from the prior-year period. Cerner's general and administrative costs soared nearly 33% year over year, to $125 million.The company reported full-year 2016 revenue of $4.8 billion, an 8% increase from the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $2.30, up 9% from 2015.Cerner president Zane Burke said, \"I am pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, with all of our key metrics in our expected ranges.\" He added, \"Our results included particular strength in new client wins, and we enter 2017 with a strong competitive position, a significant pipeline, and a solid growth outlook.\"Cerner expects 2017 first-quarter revenue will be between $1.200 billion and $1.275 billion. That's down from the fourth quarter of 2016, but it reflects a year-over-year increase of 8.6%. First-quarter adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $0.57 and $0.59. This guidance is also lower than the fourth quarter of 2016, but it is in line with consensus estimates.For full-year 2017, Cerner thinks revenue will be between $5.100 billion and $5.300 billion. The midpoint of this range represents an 8% increase from 2016.This guidance doesn't reflect the larger picture for Cerner's future prospects. The company reported a backlog in the fourth quarter totaling $15.927 billion. This backlog is 12% higher than the prior-year period. Because Cerner's systems can take a long time to implement, though, the company won't see that amount of revenue in 2017.The gravy-train days when hospitals and physicians scrambled to implement electronic health-record systems to obtain federal incentives are over. Cerner's results in 2016 and its guidance for 2017 reflect this reality.However, the company has a strong market position and can rely on recurring revenues from maintenance fees. Cerner appears to be in solid shape to navigate the changes in the healthcare landscape.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cerner wasn't one of them!

However, earnings improved 10% on a year-over-year basis.Notably, despite a miss in the last reported quarter, the company's earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.9%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this quarter.A glimpse at the stock price performance over the past three months reveals a negative return of roughly 7.7%, wider than the Zacks  industry's decline of 2.3%.Furthermore, the stock's current return also compares unfavorably with the S&P 500's 8.3% over the same time.Meanwhile, the current year projected sales growth for Cerner is pegged at 9.74%, way below the industry's 16.3%, signaling trouble down the road.We believe that Cerner's strong product portfolio will help it to boost its customer base. The frequent contract wins reflect growing traction. Furthermore, the company has strong growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory space.The company forecasts revenues between $1.225 billion and $1.300 billion for fourth-quarter 2016. The mid-point of the guided range reflects 7% year-over-year growth. Cerner expects booking revenues in the band of $1.425 billion to $1.575 billion and the midpoint reflects 11% growth. Adjusted earnings are projected in the band of 60 cents to 62 cents for the fourth quarter, flat on a year-over-year basis at mid-point.Of the major developments in the quarter, Cerner's extended partnership with the University of Missouri is notable. The duo extended their existing HealtheIntent population health management platform across the Health Network of Missouri (HNM). Notably, HNM is a joint venture of six independent health care organizations that use different electronic health record (EHR) systems (read more:  ).Of the negatives, the HCIT market is highly competitive which exerts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Cerner, a major player in this space, has been facing cut-throat competition from reputed names such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Epic Systems, GE Healthcare Technologies, McKesson Corp, Quality Systems among others. This has impacted the company's pricing and margins to a great extent. Stringent hospital budgets exert further pressure on pricing.Cerner's estimate revision trend for the current year has been mixed with one estimate moving north and one in the opposite direction over the last two months.Coming to the current quarter estimate revisions, one estimate moved upward with no movement in the opposite direction over the same time frame. | Notably, the current quarter estimate is pegged at 57 cents while the full-year estimate stands at $2.14.Our quantitative model doesn't point to an earnings beat for Cerner this quarter.

Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for CERN broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 12.6% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for CERN stock.If that wasn't enough, Cerner isn't looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 12 estimates have been reduced, while none have moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for CERN.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (NYSE:  -  ).Here is a synopsis of all three stocks: NASDAQ:  -  is a financial services company and an  age. It operates through two segments, Trading and Investing, and Balance Sheet Management. The Trading and Investing segment offers retail brokerage products and services, investor-focused banking products, and corporate services. The Balance Sheet Management segment manages asset allocation; loans previously originated by the company or purchased from third parties; deposits and customer payables; and credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk.

It has a market cap of $9.5 billion with a forward PE of 19. The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of \"C\" in Value and \"B\" in Momentum.

The recent rise in interest rates will help.The company sits in an industry ranked 40 out of 265 (Top 15%) of the Zacks Industry Rank. And its Sector Rank is in the top 13%, or 2 out of 16.Since the election, almost every financial stock ripped. E*Trade wasn't left behind, with the stock going from $30 to $36 in just a couple weeks. The bullish thesis is that higher interest rates, corporate tax reform and a rollback of Dodd-Frank will allow financials to become much more profitable then they have been under the Obama Administration.The big question is if there is more room to the upside, and for certain companies the answer is yes. Because of a recent solid earnings beat and rising estimates, E*Trade still has room higher.On October 20 th the company reported third quarter EPS at $0.51 versus the $0.38 expected. Revenue came in at $486 million versus $468 million expected. Net new brokerage assets went to $5.4B v $2.1B year over year, while net new brokerage accounts came in at 162K v 2.2K year over year.New CEO Karl A. Roessner had some comments on the quarter: Since EPS, the stock has seen multiple analysts lifting price targets including JMP to $36, Barclays to $43, Suntrust and Duetshe to $40.The next couple quarters show moderate ticks up in estimates revisions. The current quarter has seen a 10% jump over the last 90 days, while next quarters has fallen. Keep in mind that the next couple quarters won't be in a factor in what drives the stock. What will matter is the actions taken by the Trump Administration that will help the company down the road.In anticipation of that, analyst will start taking estimates higher on the longer time frames. For now 2017 is looking pretty good, with a 4.5% tick higher over the last 90 days. : NASDAQ:  -  designs, develops, markets, installs and supports information technology and content solutions for healthcare organizations and consumers.

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Cerner represents a negative return of 13.3% for the last one month, much lower than the S&P 500's almost 3.5% over the same time frame. In fact, over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2016 earnings decreased by 6 cents to $2.14 per share, with one estimate moving down.Notably, the stock recorded a negative earnings surprise of almost 1.8% in the last reported quarter.On this note, Cerner ended third-quarter 2016 on a dismal note, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and the bottom line. Also, the lowered revenue guidance for 2016, owing to reduced hardware revenues, is a dampener.In the quarter, while System sales decreased 7.3% on a year-over-year basis there was a 21% decline in technology resale and 12% drop in licensed software. All these are likely to mar prospects for Cerner going ahead.Coming to the HCIT space, of late the niche market has been gaining prominence, courtesy of latest technologies like EMR (Electronic Medical Record) and Electronic Health Record (EHR).Cerner, a major player in this space, has been facing cut-throat competition from reputed names such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Epic Systems, GE Healthcare Technologies, McKesson Corp, Quality Systems among others. This has impacted the company's pricing and margins to a great extent. Stringent hospital budgets exert further pressure on pricing.As a result, Cerner's projected sales growth is now pegged at 8.65%, much lower than the industry average of 18.5%.However, we are upbeat about Cerner's Revenue Cycle management and Population Health platforms. The platforms posted strong results in the quarter, courtesy of solid sales, inclusion in new EHR deals and solid contribution from RevWorks services (revenue management services).Additionally, a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 14.7% instills some confidence among investors.Better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space include HMS Holdings Corp.  , Medidata Solutions Inc.  and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  . Notably, HMS Holdings and Medidata Solutions carry a Zacks Rank #2 while IDEXX Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .HMS Holdings Corp has a long-term expected growth rate of 14.26%. Notably, the company has a solid one-year return of roughly 58.8%.Medidata Solutions has a strong one-year return of roughly 18.22%.

Investors expected the healthcare technology company to deliver strong year-over-year earnings growth, but Cerner failed to meet those expectations. Shares dropped over 5% in after-hours trading. Here are the highlights.Image source: Getty Images.Data source: Cerner. YOY = year over year.Cerner's third-quarter revenue fell $15 million below the company's previous guidance. However, the company's profitability wasn't affected by the revenue shortfall. Earnings came in about where Cerner expected -- but a little lower than what many investors thought the company would report.On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, Cerner posted earnings of $202.6 million, or $0.59 per diluted share. These adjusted numbers were more favorable than the GAAP numbers, primarily because of the exclusion of acquisition-related costs and share-based compensation expenses.Bookings, a measure of the value of contracts signed but not yet recorded as revenue, totaled $1.434 billion in the third quarter. This figure was below Cerner's guidance and was down 10% from the prior-year period. However, bookings in the third quarter of 2015 were exceptionally strong and present a tough year-over-year comparison.Other highlights from Cerner's third quarter included:Zane Burke, Cerner's president, acknowledged the challenging quarter:Cerner expects fourth-quarter revenue between $1.225 billion and $1.300 billion. The company also adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter to come in between $0.60 and $0.62. Both revenue and earnings guidance for the quarter are less than what many investors anticipated.For full-year 2017, Cerner projects revenue between $5.2 billion and $5.45 billion. The midpoint of that range reflects an 11% increase from 2016. Cerner also expects adjusted earnings of between $2.50 and $2.70 per diluted share. The midpoint represents a 13% year-over-year increase.Despite a disappointing third quarter, Cerner shareholders can take solace in one important detail from the company's results. Recurring revenue from support, maintenance, and services comprised nearly 73% of Cerner's total revenue. Even if new sales aren't up to par from time to time, the company can count on a steady recurring revenue stream.With no more federal incentives for healthcare providers to purchase new systems, Cerner and its peers face a more difficult path in the years ahead. However, there are still many providers on older systems that could be solid targets for Cerner. The sluggish growth in new sales from the third quarter could turn out to be just a bump in the road.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

No time limit was set for completion of the program. The repurchase will be funded from working capital.Cerner ended the third quarter of 2016 with $837 million of total cash and investments compared with $720 million in the second quarter. Total debt for Cerner, including capital lease obligations, totaled $573 million. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $240 million, down from $272 million in the year-ago quarter.We believe Cerner's strong product portfolio will help it to win customers in the rest of 2016 and beyond. The company has growth opportunities in revenue cycle management, Population Health and ambulatory market based on its product strength and an enviable track record. Additionally, the growing percentage of higher margin software in the company's business mix is expected to drive margins.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which exerts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins.

(Symbol: CERN) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $61.72/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $47.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.00. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.2% return against the $47.50 commitment, or a 3.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CERN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $47.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cerner Corp. sees its shares decline 23.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $45.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.00 from $47.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.2% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., and highlighting in green where the $47.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $47.50 strike for the 3.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cerner Corp. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $61.72) to be 26%.

Just look at  , which has disrupted the traditional taxi industry in just seven years.

Healthcare looks like a pretty good bet as well.According to a report from the Commonwealth Fund, the amount spent on U.S. healthcare came to roughly  (in 2013) or about 17% of the gross domestic product. That's more than 50% higher than what is spent in other developed countries, such as Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the U.K. and Sweden.And on our current track, spending is expected to increase even further.

That's also because of tremendous amounts of waste,  , according to the Journal of the American Medical Association.That's where technology comes in.A number of tech stocks are purely dedicated toward innovations that should alleviate cost pressure and improve outcomes.

Traditional healthcare companies continue to rely heavily on marketing channels like TV, print, radio and billboards. But unsurprisingly, some firms have shifted toward digital channels, where more people are spending their time.And digital channels offer some distinct advantages, such as clearer analytics and a greater opportunity to build relationships with customers.All this benefits  (NYSE:  ), which operates a variety of digital platforms and mobile apps that provide healthcare content and interactive tools to consumers and professionals. Already, investors have been catching on; EVDY has logged a return of more than 35% so far this year.Better yet: Everyday Health is in its early stages, and the opportunity is a healthcare industry that spends $30 billion a year on marketing.The real gem for EVDY might not be its consumer properties, though, and instead its professional business. Remember: Pharma companies spend three to five times more on marketing to physicians than consumers. Everyday Health has a base of 738,000 U.S. practicing physicians and 103,000 nurse practitioners/physician assistants. The company also has its own customer relationship platform that has been gaining lots of momentum.

Successful clinical trials can mean the difference between tremendous success or abject failure. It's not uncommon to see a stock plunge by 80% or more on news of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejection. In light of this, biotech companies want to make sure they use top-notch technology platforms to manage their clinical trials. (NASDAQ:  ) offers one such platform.Founded in 1999, Medidata has amassed a sterling customer list, and has managed the clinical trials of 17 of the world's top 25 global pharma companies. MDSO has been able to translate this into solid financials, such as last quarter's 17% increase in revenues to $114.6 million. Cash flows from operations were a healthy $25.5 million, too - that's more than double on a year-over-year basis!MDSO's cloud platform, Rave, allows for real-time collaboration, tracking and analytics. This platform has helped Medidata snag customers from its rivals. For example,  (NASDAQ:  ), which had previously used  (NYSE:  ) platform.Medidata has continued to push the envelope with its technologies, as seen with the efforts with mobile apps. The company has been investing in  (NASDAQ:  ) ResearchKit system, which should put MDSO in good position to improve its data, especially since smartphones should make it easier to track patients in clinical trials.Most of us probably can't relate to this, but it's true for Cotiviti.

In fact, last year COTV realized savings of $2.7 billion for its clients.Of course it did.

Meanwhile, the market opportunity for healthcare payment accuracy alone is $5 billion.It does take time for COTV to acquire new clients and realize substantial monetization. But once it reaches a critical mass, revenues tend to be highly reliable. The average length of relationships of its 20 largest healthcare clients is about nine years. (NYSE:  ) got its start back  . At first, the focus was on allowing consumers to get medical diagnosis by telephone, but the launch of the iPhone really took TDOC to the next level.Now, Teladoc is the largest player in the fast-growing telemedicine market.

IBM has invested huge amounts of money into Watson, its sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Watson Health alone has more than 7,000 employees that work on categories including imaging, oncology, life sciences and value-based care.IBM has already created made some major achievements. For instance, researchers at the University of Tokyo announced that Watson  for the diagnosis and treatment of a rare form of leukemia. This was actually the world's first example of AI being used in such a way.In fact, IBM thinks that Watson could help transform healthcare systems as well.

The term \"stock pickers market\" is fit for this market as the technical picture is dividing those that are ready to revert to their means from those continuing their moves higher. (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) are among those that are telecasting their next move to traders via their technical patterns.Stryker Corporation has rallied strongly with the health care sector lately as the equipment and supplies company has led the S&P 500 in relative strength measures. The company tripped over itself a bit after their earnings report resulted in a 5% pullback in shares.The post-earnings selling took Stryker shares to a test of their 50-day moving average, which has been trending higher since early March. After \"passing\" the technical support test at their 50-day, Stryker shares are targeting higher prices again as health care stocks continue to see a migration of cash from other areas of the market.Shares of Stryker also registered an oversold buy signal last Thursday as the stock was beginning its short-term bottoming process. We should see the momentum indicators like the MACD follow suit in confirming that the trend is going to remain in place on Stryker shares this week, confirming that the upside favors the stock at this time.Yet another stock that has seen some short-term profit-taking is ConAgra Foods Inc. The company announced earnings on June 30, before rallying more than 1% while the S&P 500 remained locked in its current tight trading range.More recently, Conagra shares have given that move up as they just bounced from their pre-earnings price of $46.The pullback to $46 resulted in another short-term oversold stock being added to our list, a bullish signal for the traders out there. The technical charts suggest that Conagra shares have about 6% upside before running back into overhead resistance, which is enough for a trader to grab gains in a tightly traded market like this.According to the longer-term charts, should Conagra shares fail to maintain their current support, the stock is likely to target a lower price of $44 per share, which would be a secondary entry to either add to existing positions or initiate new allocations.Another health care company on the technical radar is Cerner Corporation, though there are two pictures of the stock from the charts right now. First the short-term.Cerner shares are currently presenting themselves as ready for a correction as the stock is rounding out a top just above $62 while maintaining a short-term overbought signal. This, after the shares were able to break through resistance at $60 in July.Cerner is set to announce their earnings results today  . The last year-plus of earnings results have been \"sell the news\" events for the stock, leading to a warning sign for the short-term traders. Given the current technical picture, a reversion to the $58 mark is possible and likely. But there's good news for traders.Cerner shares just completed a golden cross technical formation last week. This pattern indicates that the intermediate-term pattern for the shares has been growing stronger and opens the upside for additional moves higher. The cross occurred just below the $58 level, which is where we see intermediate-term support for the stock and a likely buying opportunity.In short, Cerner's chart suggests that it's time to lock in profits ahead of earnings but that a buying opportunity exists on a pullback.The post ), ConAgra Foods Inc () and Cerner Corporation () appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["MAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.In the first quarter,  (NASDAQ: CERN)  with lower-than-expected revenue. The company attributed the shortfall to lower resales of low-margin technology. Was Cerner able to show improvement in the second quarter? The giant healthcare technology company announced its second-quarter results after the markets closed on Tuesday. Here are the highlights.YOY: YEAR OVER YEAR. DATA SOURCE: CERNER.How did Cerner achieve year-over-year growth for its bottom line that far exceeded its sales growth? By holding the line on expenses. The company posted decreases in three of four operating expense categories, most notably cutting general and administrative costs by one-third compared with the prior-year period.On a non-GAAP basis, Cerner's earnings growth wasn't quite as impressive. The company reported adjusted net income for the second quarter of $199.2 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, up from $183 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the same quarter of 2015. However, Cerner enjoyed additional tax benefits in the year ago quarter that it didn't have this year.Cerner announced that bookings, which reflect the value of new business won that hasn't yet been recognized as revenue, hit $1.40 billion in the second quarter. That's a 9% year-over-year jump -- and much better than first-quarter bookings, which were flat compared with the prior-year period.Other highlights from the second quarter included:Cerner President Zane Burke pointed out several positives from his company's second-quarter performance:Cerner's stock was up a little in early after-hours trading after topping investors' earnings expectations. That's a positive short-term reaction, but it's more important to focus on the company's long-term prospects.There are still plenty of opportunities for Cerner in its core business of providing healthcare software to providers. The company estimates that over 3,000 sites are on what it terms \"vulnerable platforms\" that might be ripe for the picking. Of course, Cerner's rivals are eyeing those same prospective customers.Privately held Epic Systems continues to be the main threat for Cerner. However, the company also must watch out for up-and-comers such as  (NASDAQ: ATHN) . That company counts only around 80 hospitals as customers right now, but CEO Jonathan Bush seems to view his organization as David against Cerner's Goliath.Last year, Bush stated that he expected both Cerner and Epic to \"collapse like big black swans.\" Based on Cerner's latest results, don't expect Bush's prophecy to come true anytime soon. Nevertheless, Cerner shouldn't be overly dismissive of athenahealth's efforts to gain market share.Even larger opportunities lie with expansion into population health, global markets, and revenue-cycle management. Cerner is already making progress on all three fronts, as Zane Burke mentioned in his comments. Revenue cycle management could present the biggest market -- and a very profitable one.

After a miss in the previous quarter, bookings recovered, increasing 9% year over year to $1.40 billion.However, the company lowered the high end of its guidance for revenues but reiterated the earnings guidance for the full-year of 2016.Cerner reported adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share (including stock-based compensation), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and increased 11.5% on a year-over-year basis driven by 8% growth in revenues. Excluding stock-based compensation, earnings were 58 cents, up 11.5% year over year in the quarter.Meanwhile, revenues of almost $1.22 billion also beat the consensus mark of $1.21 billion and were well within the management's guided range of $1.175 billion to $1.25 billion.Revenues in the U.S. increased 8% from the year-ago quarter to $1.073 billion, while non-U.S. revenues grew 9% to $143 million.Cerner believes the replacement market will remain active due to higher number of hospitals on legacy platforms providing a significant growth prospect for the company. Management also noted that its products continue to seize market share from the clutches of its competitors.Cerner stated that most of the new electronic health record (EHR) clients selected the Revenue Cycle product as part of their purchase. Several large clients also chose Cerner's acute Revenue Cycle and ambulatory business office services during the quarter. The company also made several new client additions to the HealtheIntent platform.System sales increased 5.7% year over year to $333.1 million, supported by strong growth in software partially offset by a decline in hardware sales. | Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 12% on a year-over-year basis to $604 million. Support and maintenance revenues improved 1% to $257 million.Bookings were within management's guided new business bookings range of $1.35 billion to $1.48 billion. In the last quarter, long-term bookings comprised 28% of total bookings. Cerner noted that bookings included 45 large contracts worth over $5 million, of which 28 deals were valued at over $10 million.Cerner stated that non long-term bookings grew 20% from the year-ago quarter. In the second quarter, 34% of bookings came from outside the company's core Millennium installed base.In this regard, management expects the replacement market to remain strong over the next two to three years, which will provide Cerner ample opportunities to win contracts at the cost of its competitors.Backlog increased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $15 billion.Gross margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 83.1%, primarily driven by favorable business mix and strong services revenues. Notably, system sales margin expanded 150 bps to 68.1% in the quarter.Adjusted operating expenses (excluding share-based compensation expense, Health Services-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue, and other acquisition-related adjustments) increased 9% to $721 million, driven by personnel expenses related to revenue generating associates.Sales and client service expense jumped up 13%, general & administrative expense increased 6%, while software development expense declined 2% on a year-over-year basis in the quarter.Adjusted operating margin (excluding share-based compensation expense, Health Services-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue, and other acquisition-related adjustments) contracted 40 bps to 23.8%, in line with management expectations.For the third-quarter 2016, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.20 billion and $1.275 billion. The mid-point of the guided range reflects 10% year-over-year growth.Cerner also projects new business bookings between $1.45 billion and $1.60 billion. At mid-point, this reflects a slight decline on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of 59 cents to 61 cents. At mid-point, this reflects 11% growth on a year-over-year basis.For full-year 2016, Cerner revised down its revenue guidance at the range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion (previous guided range was $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion), reflecting 12% (down from 13%) improvement over full-year 2015. The decline resulted due to lower hardware revenues in the first-half 2016.Notably, revenues from support and maintenance are up 5% year to date. Cerner predicts similar mid-single-digit growth for the rest of the year.Adjusted diluted earnings are still expected in the band of $2.30 to $2.40 per share, representing almost 11% growth over 2015.Cerner anticipates margin expansion to be limited for full-year 2016. However, the company expects to expand margins by 50 to 100 bps annually after 2016.Cerner expects capital expenditures to increase in 2016, primarily due to construction of a new campus. However, the company still expects to generate solid free cash flow.For full-year 2017, management expects a decline in capital expenditures, resulting in stronger free cash flow.We believe Cerner's strong product portfolio will help it to win customers in the rest of 2016 and beyond. The company has growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM), Population Health and ambulatory market based on its product strength and enviable track record. Additionally, growing percentage of higher margin software in the business mix is expected to drive margins.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which exerts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may affect margins. Meanwhile, stringent hospital budgets exert further pressure on pricing.Currently, Cerner carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include AMN Healthcare services  , The Advisory Board  and Streamline Health Solutions  .

A company that can grow its earnings at a high rate for years, or even decades, renders the initial price paid far less important. But the risk that the expected growth fails to materialize makes some growth stocks better than others.What growth stocks should investors consider adding to their portfolios in June? Three of our Foolish contributors have some ideas. Shares of fitness wearables company  (NYSE: FIT) have been beaten down since the company went public, with investors no doubt fearing that more-capable smartwatches would eventually render the company's products obsolete. But Fitbit has shown no sign of slowing down, and while heavy spending is reducing profits at the moment, the company's products remain extremely popular.Fitbit sold 4.8 million devices during the first quarter, with revenue rising by 50% year over year. The Blaze and Alta, new products launched by the company, accounted for nearly half of Fitbit's revenue, with one million of each sold. Fitbit expects to generate between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion of revenue this year, up about 37% from 2015.Fitbit's success in the future is far from guaranteed. The company is extremely susceptible to disruption, and its spending has exploded in an effort to keep up its growth. During the first quarter, R&D spending more than tripled year over year, while sales and marketing costs more than doubled. Profits took a hit as a result.With a market capitalization around $3 billion, Fitbit trades for a bit more than its expected revenue in 2016. The market is clearly pessimistic, assuming that Fitbit can't keep up its growth, and can't improve its profitability. But for investors who believe in the Fitbit story, the stock offers growth at a reasonable price. Growth-stock investors would be wise to give  (NASDAQ: LGND) a closer look after the stock dipped close to double digits in May.Ligand Pharmaceuticals isn't your traditional drug developer that spends hundreds of millions on the drug-development process with the hope of bringing game-changing drugs to market. Instead, it invests in royalty assets, which allows it to use a low-overhead cost structure to reap big benefits from even a reasonably small stream of revenue. Ligand's bread and butter is Captisol, which helps improve the solubility and stability of select drugs.During Ligand's November Investor Day Presentation, we learned that it had more than 125 fully funded programs in the works from six-dozen partners. Two of the compounds it's currently generating sales from include  '(NYSE: NVS) Promacta, and  's(NASDAQ: AMGN) multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis, which are both projected to become blockbuster drugs, with sales north of $1 billion per year. Because Ligand's technology is found in so many developing therapies, the failure of a single therapy in clinical trials isn't devastating.Looking ahead, Ligand is forecasting total sales of between $115 million and $119 million in 2016, which would represent about 60% growth from the $71.9 million it reported in sales last year. For 2017, management is projecting sales will be north of $160 million, with adjusted EPS expected to eclipse $5. For comparison, adjusted net income in 2015 was only $3.37.Ligand offers growth potential that could easily surpass 20% per year through the end of the decade, and it has a highly diverse number of developing assets using its technology. As such, I believe it could be an attractive growth stock to buy in June. One growth stock that I think deserves some attention from investors this month is  (NASDAQ: CERN) , the nation's largest provider of healthcare IT. Shares have been falling during the past year and are now more than 25% off their 52-week high, which I think affords investors the chance to buy a growth stock at a discount.Cerner's flagship product is its Millennium electronic health-record system, which helps healthcare providers of all types to better manage their back offices. Cerner's platform makes it easier for providers to store and share patient information, eliminating the need to keep paper charts, and hospital systems around the country have been racing to adopt its offerings during the past few years.Despite being in business for nearly four decades, the company is still growing at a healthy pace. Revenue in the most-recent quarter jumped 15.3%, to $1.14 billion.Thanks to the scalable nature of its business, the company's net income grew even faster, jumping by nearly 36%, to $150 million. Better yet, the company's backlog also increased by 12%, to $14.6 billion, which should help to ensure that Cerner's top and bottom lines continue to head in the right direction.For the full year, Cerner's management team believes that its adjusted earnings per share will land between $2.30 and $2.40, which would be up double digits from the $2.11 that it showed last year. With the stock price down during the past year, investors can buy shares for about 24 times full-year earnings estimates, which I think is a fair price to pay for a company that should be able to grow at double-digit rates for the foreseeable future. Add in the fact that its board recently authorized another $300 million share-repurchase program, and I think this is a solid growth stock to consider right now.

AthenaClinicals' growth, on the other hand, picked up slightly from the same quarter of last year.While the company reported a GAAP loss from continuing operations -- largely due to stock-based compensation -- adjusted net income for the second quarter was $13.5 million, or $0.34 per share. That reflected a small increase from the $12.4 million, or $0.32 per share, in adjusted net income posted in the prior-year period.Athenahealth also announced that chief operating officer Ed Park will transition out of his role by the end of this year. Park is expected to be elected to the company's board of directors.Athenahealth chairman and CEO Jonathan Bush said:Athenahealth expressed optimism about the rest of 2016 based on the numbers from the second quarter. While the company didn't revise its fiscal 2016 guidance, Athenahealth now expects GAAP revenue and non-GAAP adjusted net income per diluted share to be at or above the midpoints of the guidance ranges.The company's core products for physicians should continue to be the primary driver of Athenahealth's financial performance. However, the company is focused on battling for market share against bigger rivals Epic and  (NASDAQ: CERN) .As of the second quarter, Athenahealth had nearly 80 hospitals under contract. That's far behind Cerner, which added over 200 acute facilities in 2015 alone. There are plenty of opportunities for Athenahealth to go head to head with the larger healthcare technology providers. Cerner's CFO Marc Naughton told participants at the Jefferies Healthcare Conference in June that his company has identified over 3,000 hospitals on \"vulnerable systems.\"Athenahealth made a couple of moves during the second quarter that should help in its quest to compete against the big players, like Cerner, in the future.

The mid-point of the guided range reflects 18% year-over-year growth. The company also projects new business bookings between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion.Adjusted earnings (before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments) are expected in the range of 52 cents to 54 cents. At mid-point, this reflects 18% growth on a year-over-year basis.We believe that Cerner's strong product portfolio will help it boost its customer base. The frequent contract wins reflect growing traction. Moreover, the company has strong growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory market.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive which exerts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may affect margins. Meanwhile, stringent hospital budgets continue to exert pressure on pricing, which is an added concern.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cerner is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

The cloud-based healthcare-technology provider's stock plunged more than 27% by early February before mounting a comeback. Athenahealth shares were still down by 13% year to date coming into yesterdays' earnings report.The company had its chance to shake things up with its first-quarter earnings results announced after the market closed on Thursday -- but the market reacted poorly to seemingly solid numbers, sending shares down 6% the morning after the report. Is athenahealth now poised to soar, yet again? Here are the highlights from the first-quarter results.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance.Although the healthcare-technology provider posted a net loss, the situation looked better on a non-GAAP basis. Athenahealth's adjusted net income increased to $13.4 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, from $9.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2015.Highlights from the quarter included:Athenahealth also reaffirmed its previous fiscal 2016 guidance. The company continues to expect revenue for the year between $1.09 billion and $1.12 billion. Athenahealth projects non-GAAP net income to come in between $1.65 and $1.85 per share.Jonathan Bush, athenahealth's chairman and CEO, focused more on the future than on the first quarter in his comments. Bush said:Athenahealth continues to position itself to compete head-to-head against big players in the hospital electronic health-record system market, including the biggest of them all --  . While athenahealth's first-quarter revenue of just more than $256 million pales in comparison to the $1.17 billion in revenue expected for Cerner, the smaller company is making moves that should help in the battle.Two developments in April by athenahealth show how the company is aggressively upping its game. On April 14, athenahealth announced its acquisition of Arsenal Health. The deal gives athenahealth a solid schedule-optimization service that allows it to better match up against Cerner's built-in scheduling-management capabilities.Just four days later, athenahealth also announced a new partnership with Intacct. California-based Intacct provides cloud-based enterprise-resource planning (ERP) software for hospitals. Athenahealth plans to integrate Intacct's financial applications with its own revenue-cycle management services.This collaboration with Intacct fits right into Jonathan Bush's strategy of increasing interoperability with third-party solutions. He has previously stated that companies like Cerner are destined to \"collapse like big black swans\" -- in part because they're not as open as they need to be to effectively support the changing dynamics faced by hospitals.Only time will tell if Bush's vision for what athenahealth can become will be achieved.

But there are also concerns about the competitive environment, as well as the ominous signs of slowing economic growth.So, for contrarian investors, perhaps there is an opportunity here? And maybe Wall Street has already discounted the bad news?Well, I think so.

The company missed expectations on profits, which was the first time in  .But then again, the holiday season was particularly tough. Consider that  's  (  ) \"Star Wars\" franchise got a big share of customers' wallets.Yet ATVI still continues to remain highly profitable, driven by offerings like \"Call of Duty.\" And yes, there are some interesting potential blockbusters in the pipeline, such as \"Overwatch.\"But there should be some other catalysts to get the stock moving. ATVI greatly boosted its mobile footprint with the acquisition of  . The reach is now  , and there should be lots of potential synergies with ATVI's existing list of titles for consoles and PCs.Finally, the company is making aggressive moves into the e-sports category, such as with the  of  (MLG). This involves staging tournaments where top-notch gamers compete.And the market potential is enormous. According to the analysis from  , the eSports category is expected to generate $2 billion in revenues by 2018, with 240 million viewers.But investors should pay some attention to CERN, especially\nsince the valuation is much more reasonable now. Keep in mind that\n- during the latest quarter - the company missed expectations on . Among the potential stocks to buy in the tech space,  (  ) is likely not to be one mentioned a lot. The company does not get much buzz.But investors should pay some attention to CERN, especially since the valuation is much more reasonable now. Keep in mind that - during the latest quarter - the company missed expectations on  .However, it is important to realize that CERN's business can be volatile because it generally sells to major customers, which means that deals are more complex and can take longer.Basically, Cerner is one of the world's top suppliers of health care information technology, with its systems installed at over 20,000 facilities across the world. The company has two core product offerings. One is Cerner Millennium, which provides for secure access of electronic health records as well as comprehensive management of clinical, IT and financial data. Then there is HealtheIntent, which provides similar services - but uses cloud technologies.Going forward, Cerner's business should continue to see robust demand. After all, the U.S. healthcare system is undergoing tremendous change so as to lower costs. But to do this, there will need to be the kinds of technologies that Cerner provides.For example, the company recently implemented its HealtheIntent platform in a state's Medicaid population, which helped to improve the outcomes to an  according to the most recent .More importantly, few operators have the scale and experience to pull this off, which means the company has a nice moat against the competition.So what's going on?

Lately it has been a horrible ride for investors in  (  ). For the year so far, the stock is off about 27%.So what's going on? For the most part, there are concerns about the emerging competition, as well as worries about the global economy, which could hinder travel expenditures.But over the next couple years, there are some key drivers that can help get TRIP stock back on track. One is that the company has been diversifying away from its core advertising business model by implementing its instant booking business. In fact, it is now available on a global basis and should provide a potentially strong new revenue stream. There should also be a lift from a recently signed partnership with  (  ).What's more, TRIP has been expanding into other categories. Perhaps the most impactful one is attractions, which could mean some interesting opportunities to get juicy lead-generation fees. Interestingly enough, TRIP thinks this could be the company's  .Besides, when it comes to travel reviews, the fact remains that the company is a dominant player - and it will be tough for competitors to get an edge. TRIP gets over 200 reviews per minute for a total of over 320 million.But this may turn out to be an advantage for ( ) because the company focuses on open-source software, which is\ngenerally free.

When looking for stocks to buy, it may seem not to be a good idea to look at those companies focused on the enterprise market. With the economic uncertainty, CEOs may be more inclined to hold off on major IT purchases.But this may turn out to be an advantage for  (  ) because the company focuses on open-source software, which is generally free. Rather, to make money, RHT charges for premium services, education and various subscriptions.Furthermore, open-source software has another key advantage: it is fairly easy to customize. No doubt, this is incredibly important for large clients.So it should be no surprise that RHT continues to grow at a nice pace. In the  , revenues jumped by 18% to $479.6 million and earnings came to $53 million. If anything, RHT has been a model of consistency, with 56 consecutive quarters of revenue growth.But things may actually start to perk up even more. Consider that RHT has been investing heavily in its cloud infrastructure business. Essentially, it allows customers to choose from a variety of providers, such as  (  ),  (  ,  ) and  (  ).In fact, during the latest fiscal year, the business posted  .The return? It's about -61%.

In fact, MU was still able to pump out an impressive $763 million in operating cash flows.Actually, there are some  that can help bring back some growth. For example, MU has been getting traction with emerging categories like the automation of cars and homes. Oh, and there is the Internet of Things. All these will generate strong demand for memory chips.Next, MU has a strong product line. To this end, there is the GDDR5X, which allows for super-fast graphics processing, as well as the 20 nanometer 8GB chip, which should gin up lots of interest in the enterprise market. And finally, MU should get a boost from its investment in mobile and its next generation 3D NAND chips, which involve a major partnership with  (  ).Finally, the valuation on MU stock is at rock-bottom levels, with the price-to-earnings multiple at a mere 6X.In other words, it will probably not take too much good news to bring back some hope to the stock price.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["earable activity trackers are transforming how we stay in shape. Image source:  , Flickr.Technology always seems to change things, doesn't it? We're happily enjoying our horse-drawn carriages when boom -- automobiles enter the scene. One day we're watching cable TV and then boom -- video streaming services arrive. Technology is changing the face of healthcare, too, such as via robots that can help surgeons perform surgeries. Here are three other ways that technology is transforming healthcare. For years healthcare providers largely avoided shifting to the use of electronic health records (EHRs) to manage patients' medical histories and instead stuck with their tried-and-true method of using paper charts. Even today, many providers still rely on paper charts and fax machines to send prescriptions and medical histories back and forth, which is a very inefficient process. This system may have worked well a few decades ago, but it's now completely outdated and it makes it difficult for different types of healthcare providers to access your full medical history.That's all changing now, especially with the government's big push to incentivize healthcare providers to adopt EHRs. If your health records are not yet available electronically, then they likely will be soon as providers who do not shift to electronic record will see their reimbursement rates cut.One company that's poised to benefit from the eventual transition is  (NASDAQ: CERN) , one of the country's largest providers of healthcare IT services and EHR systems. Its systems also help medical practices with mundane tasks such as scheduling and receiving payments. Revenue growth at Cerner has been  in recent years thanks to the big nationwide push to adopt EHR, and yet its stock has been stuck in reverse over the past year. Shares are still fetching a premium valuation, but considering that the company is poised to benefit from an undeniable long-term trend, I think that opportunistic investors might want to give this company a closer look.Multicellular bioprinted liver tissue and endothelial cell networks. Image source: Organovo.com. Arguably one of the most exciting ways technology is changing the healthcare space is through the use of 3D-printed biologics for testing purposes, and potentially even transplantation. One of the leaders in this space is  .Organovo's only commercial product at the moment is the exVive3D Human Liver Tissue assay, which is a test that allows hospitals, drug developers, universities, and research labs to test the toxicity of medicines on 3D-printed liver tissue. Think about this for a moment: Instead of running a costly phase 1 trial on dozens of patients, and also possibly dealing with adverse events, drug developers would be able to order Organovo's exVive3D system to test liver toxicities in advance to determine whether or not a clinical drug is safe. Organovo believes this could, over time, grow into a $100 million opportunity. The company is also working on a kidney tissue product it anticipates introducing for commercial contracting in the third quarter of this year.But that's not all. In addition to assay tests, Organovo has lined up a number of partnerships that could yield promising bioprinted and transplantable tissues for the future. In late 2014, Organovo and the Yale University School of Medicine's Department of Surgery formed a collaboration to develop organs for transplantation. While a commercial transplantation business may be years off, this is a true first-of-its-kind collaboration that could completely alter the organ waitlist process. -like technology isn't developed overnight, but Organovo has just about the closest thing to it at the moment. Our overall health is not completely in our own hands -- many diseases or accidents will come out of left field and are not things we can really prevent. Still, much of our health  in our hands, and in recent years, technology has been making it easier for us to take care of ourselves.Think, for example, of wearable fitness technology, such as the  Vivosmart HR activity tracker that you wear on your wrist like a watch. It actually  a watch, but it also counts your steps, the floors you've climbed, and the distance you've traveled, among other things, praising you when you meet certain goals and vibrating to remind you to move if you've been sedentary a while. It tracks your heart rate and helps you meet the recommended goal of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, and it can monitor your sleep, too. There are many different activity- and heart-rate-tracking devices on the market today.There are also lots of helpful and motivating apps you can use on your smartphone, such as ones that track the nutrition value of foods you're eating and ones that aim to get you from being a couch potato to running a 5K by giving you daily goals. Many wearable devices coordinate with apps, too. For example, some Garmin devices will sync with MyFitnessPal.  devices sync with the Fitbit app that lets you monitor your diet as well as your activity.It's still largely up to us to get healthy and stay healthy, but these days, there's a wide range of wearable devices and apps that can help us do so. And stay tuned -- because they will only get better. One day, for example, many of us may routinely be sharing health data with our doctors automatically via our wearable devices.Investors who keep an eye on how technology is transforming healthcare will likely encounter some terrific long-term investments along the way.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually. For example: One easy, 17-minute trick could pay you as much as $15,978 more...each year! Once you learn how to take advantage of all these loopholes, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

But the vast ramp-up among providers of the technology, which uses Big Data analytics to improve and streamline health care services, turned heads earlier this month when it helped  (  ) shares to their best day since 2009.IBM announced Feb. 18 that its Watson Health unit will buy Truven Health Analytics for $2.6 billion. The price - more than twice as much as a  for Truven back in 2012 - reflects its importance to Big Blue's reinvention, the potential network effect from amassing health data of so many consumers and the rapid shift in the way the government is reimbursing health care providers.The acquisition boosts \"IBM's play to really kind of corner the Big Data market\" and offer its clinical decision-support tools on a paid subscription basis, said Jennifer Bresnick, HealthITAnalytics editorial director.The combination with Truven, IBM's fourth health analytics acquisition in the past year, means that Watson Health now has access to the health data of 300 million patients, which it can analyze in every which way. The goal: to discover what works best for patients, improving health outcomes while reducing costs by billions of dollars a year.The Watson power play was seen as something of a negative for other major players in the sector, whose stocks traded down modestly on the merger news. Those include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). But while IBM's Watson is no doubt a formidable competitor, it approaches customers from a different vantage point -- primarily from the cloud.The other companies offer a broader range of health enterprise IT services, generally from the ground up to the cloud, starting with the management of electronic health records, the digital data that can be mined for cost-saving solutions.Cerner, for example, \"is literally taking over hospital IT departments,\" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Donald Hooker, putting it in an ideal position to analyze best practices and pinpoint waste in clinical workflows.An example of how all this can work is detailed in the January issue of  magazine. The issue explores ways in which Advocate Health Care of Downers Grove, Ill., has worked with Cerner to deliver better care at a lower cost.One productive use has been to better determine the most appropriate next step for patients being discharged. This may mean sending them to a skilled nursing home or providing in-home care to reduce the risk of a readmission within the following 30 days. A test involving 5,600 patients at a system hospital yielded procedures that have reduced readmissions, Advocate says.Advocate, along with Cerner, developed an algorithm to predict a patient's chances of readmission, deriving a score based on 30 different inputs that are updated every two hours. Not only can physicians monitor the score, but they can quickly drill down to find out why it is elevated and what interventions would be appropriate to lower readmission odds. Once implemented, readmissions of high-risk patients fell by 20% within a matter of months.The laser-like focus on avoiding readmissions is logical, but a relatively new phenomenon. Until recently, providers were paid based on the volume of care they provided. More care meant more cash. Now, increasingly, financial incentives reward them for the quality of care and penalize readmissions.Medicare has set a goal of having 50% of payments based on value rather than volume by 2018. Up until now, participation has been largely voluntary. But thousands of hospitals face the possibility of being financial penalized for excessive readmissions of patients treated for heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia.Last year, hospitals also began risking a 3% payment reduction for excessive readmissions of patients who had undergone total hip and knee replacements or treatment for obstructive pulmonary disease. The problem: Out of 3,400 hospitals subject to the program, only 799 avoided a penalty. Hospitals complain that socio-economic status has a lot to do with readmissions, but that may not be something that hospitals are well-equipped to fix.Still, the urgency is growing for medical systems to buy into population health applications in order to maximize the value of the care they provide. In another milestone, Medicare will make bundled payments mandatory for hip and knee replacements in 67 major metropolitan areas, starting this April. Poor performance, perhaps due to after-surgery infections, would put hospitals at risk of paying for a portion of cost overruns, starting in the second year. Medicare expects that the program will save the government $343 million over five years.Market research firm International Data Corp. predicts that by 2018, physicians will use population-health-type applications to identify the most effective treatment for 50% of complex cancer patients, resulting in 10% reductions in both mortality and cost.KeyBanc's Hooker notes that the sickest 5% of patients account for 50% of $3 trillion in annual U.S. health care spending. Saving just 10% of the costs for treating those patients -- something he sees as eminently doable, given the \"tremendous amount of inefficiencies in the system\" -- would net $150 billion in savings, he said.After a surge in spending on electronic health records (EHR) systems earlier in the decade, the anticipated second act has been slow to materialize. A Jan. 7 report from RBC Capital Markets analyst David Francis noted that recent capital investment has been focused on facilities. But \"the perceived imminence of new reimbursement models for health systems and physicians is ... finally driving the provider market to prepare for the next investment wave in the form of 'Population Health' applications and infrastructure.\"With health care inflation back on the rise after historically slow growth for much of the decade, Francis suggests that there's unlikely to be any let-up in Washington trying to tackle health care costs. He's expecting a boost in order activity in the second half of 2016 and solid revenue growth in 2017 and beyond.That couldn't happen at a better time for IBD's Computer Software-Medical group. Patience has worn a little thin as investors have waited for the population health trend to take off. Cerner, Allscripts and Athenahealth all saw their stock prices slump after falling short of their revenue targets. Yet each of the companies entered the year with momentum, riding important business wins that proved they have staying power.The Department of Defense in July awarded Cerner, along with  (  ) and  (LDOS), a $4.3 billion, 10-year contract to overhaul its electronic health records for close to 10 million active duty troops and retirees at over 1,000 facilities. Privately held Epic, which along with Cerner is one of the two biggest competitors in the field, teamed with IBM Watson in the bidding.Francis of RBC Capital Markets expects value-based pricing to drive a new round of consolidation among health care providers. That, in turn, could benefit IT vendors large enough to offer a comprehensive portfolio of capabilities, such as Cerner and  (EPIQ). For providers, Francis writes, \"successful implementation of these systems ... will determine who are the hunters and who are the hunted\" in the next round of consolidation.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoIn early trading on Tuesday, shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (  ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 7.9%.

Meanwhile, the acquisition of Siemens Health Services is expected to enhance growth by expanding the product pipeline.Cerner is one of the only two vendors gaining market traction in the medium to large hospital space. Additionally, the company has a strong presence in the rapidly growing ambulatory clinical IT market. Cerner is also performing well internationally. Previously, the company had acquired contracts in the U.K. and the Middle East and has also expanded its HIT solution client base in 24 countries.Further, Cerner's strong balance sheet and cash flow provide the necessary support as it uses cash to return value to investors. It is expected that aggressive share buybacks will boost earnings over the long haul.However, stiff competition in the HCIT market poses serious threats.Nevertheless, Cerner may face difficulties owing to stringent government regulations, such as the EHR program. Further, stingy hospital budgets are a matter of concern.

However, the company maintained its full-year revenue and earnings guidance based on continuing customer wins, suggesting strong demand across its entire product portfolio.Cerner reported adjusted earnings of 49 cents per share (including stock-based compensation), which were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but increased 16.74% on a year-over-year basis driven by 14.3% growth in revenues.Excluding stock-based compensation, earnings surged 17.8% year over year to 53 cents in the quarter, in line with the mid-point of management's guided range of 52 cents to 54 cents.Meanwhile, revenues of almost $1.14 billion missed the consensus mark of $1.17 billion as well as management's guided range of $1.15 billion to $1.20 billion. The miss was primarily due to lower hardware sales.System sales increased 7.6% year over year to $279.4 million, supported by strong growth in subscriptions on higher recurring revenues from Siemens Health Services and licensed software.Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 20% on a year-over-year basis to $589 million. Support and maintenance revenues improved 10% to $251 million.In the first quarter, bookings decreased 2% year over year to of $1.17 billion, which was within management's guided new business bookings range of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to tough comparisons, as the long-term bookings in the year-ago quarter were 37%, an all-time record for the company.In the last quarter, long-term bookings comprised 24% of total bookings. Cerner noted that bookings included 43 large contracts worth over $5 million, of which 18 deals were valued at over $10 million.Cerner stated that non long-term bookings grew 18% from the year-ago quarter primarily driven by continued client addition like Universal Health Services  . In the first quarter, 36% of bookings came from outside the company's core Millennium installed base.In this regard, management expects the replacement market to remain strong over the next two to three years, which will provide Cerner ample opportunities to win contracts at the cost of its competitors.Backlog increased 12% from the year-ago quarter to $14.6 billion.Gross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 84.6%, primarily driven by favorable business mix and strong services revenues. Notably, system sales margin expanded a massive 300 bps to 68.1% in the quarter.Operating expenses (including share-based compensation expense and acquisition related adjustments) increased 19% to $701 million, driven by personnel expenses related to revenue generating associates, higher non-cash expenses and an extra month of Health Services expenses in the last quarter as compared to the year-ago quarter.Operating margin (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization adjustments) contracted 70 bps to 23%, in line with management expectations.For the second quarter of 2016, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.175 billion and $1.25 billion. The mid-point of the guided range reflects 8% year-over-year growth. Management expects revenue growth to be higher in the third quarter, which is an easier comparable period than the second quarter.Cerner also projects new business bookings between $1.35 billion and $1.48 billion. At mid-point, this reflects 10% growth on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted earnings (before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments) are now expected in the range of 56 cents to 58 cents. At mid-point, this reflects 10% growth on a year-over-year basis.For full-year 2016, Cerner reiterated its revenue guidance at the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, reflecting 13% improvement over full-year 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings, before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments, are expected in the band of $2.30 to $2.40 per share, representing almost 11% growth over 2015.Cerner expects capital expenditures to increase in 2016, primarily due to construction of a new campus. The company still expects to generate solid free cash flow.We believe Cerner's strong product portfolio will help it to win customers in the rest of 2016 and beyond. The company has growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory market based on its product strength and enviable track record. Additionally, growing percentage of higher margin software in the business mix is expected to drive margins.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which exerts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may affect margins.

Image source: CernerThings were looking up for  headed into the fourth quarter. Bookings, which reflect new contracts won but not yet recognized as revenue,  . Expectations were for a solid finish to the end of 2015. Cerner announced its fourth-quarter results after the market closed on Tuesday. The company capped off 2015 with an exclamation point -- but there's a question mark now for this year.\n  \nData source: Cerner.Those numbers met or exceeded the expectations that Cerner set around three months ago. Fourth-quarter sales were right in the middle of the range that the healthcare technology provider gave in November. Cerner's adjusted earnings of $0.61 per share easily beat the per-share range of $0.56-$0.58 provided earlier. Other highlights from the fourth quarter and full-year 2015 included:Cerner continued to grow its system sales at a strong pace -- up over 36% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Revenue from support, maintenance, and services also rose over 24% year over year.Operating expenses, however, increased nearly 37%. While higher acquisition-related amortization expenses jumped significantly, Cerner also saw every other expense category increase by at least 30%.Zane Burke, Cerner's president, underscored his company's success in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015. Burke said:With strong double-digit percentage gains on both the top and bottom lines, you might expect investors to be happy with Cerner's performance. However, its stock plunged as much as 16% in after-hours trading following Cerner's announcement of fourth-quarter results. What gives?Cerner expects first-quarter 2016 revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are projected to come in between $0.52 and $0.54. It expects full-year 2016 revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share (before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments) between $2.30 and $2.40. All of those are right in line with the consensus of Wall Street analysts.The problem stems from Cerner's forward guidance on bookings. New business bookings for first quarter are projected to come between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion. That's slower than the last two sequential quarters and seems to have worried some investors.There's no doubt that Cerner is facing plenty of competition. In the past, the company faced off frequently with privately-held Epic. Now, however, Cerner also must battle up-and-coming rival  .Athenahealth's success story so far has been primarily in the physician market. But the company recently landed its first contract with a major hospital, the University of Toledo Medical Center. What's more, athenahealth leveraged its prior relationship with the hospital's physician clinics to win the hospital contract.Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush has stated in the past that he expects Cerner and Epic to \"collapse like big black swans.\" It's definitely a huge overreaction to use Cerner's sluggish bookings forecast to claim that Bush's prediction is coming true. However, investors in the hospital EHR space will definitely want to closely watch the changing competitive dynamics in the industry in the months and years ahead.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

There is no time frame set for the completion of the program.Per management at Cerner, around 5.7 million (1.7% of outstanding shares) can be bought back based on the closing price of Mar 7, 2016. The repurchase, which will be funded through working capital, is planned to counterbalance a portion of the dilution created by future equity grants.The company in Sep 2015 had announced a share repurchase program worth $245 million, which has been completed.We believe that the latest share repurchase program will significantly boost shareholders' return, reflecting the company's strong balance sheet. We feel that apart from share buybacks, frequent contract wins will help instill investor confidence in the company.This month, Cerner inked an extended collaboration with Dignity Health, under the terms of which, the latter will extend the use of Cerner's PowerChart Ambulatory electronic health record (EHR). Meanwhile, the deal is expected to help Cerner's EHR gain significant market traction, given that Dignity Health is one of the largest health care systems in the U.S. with about 9,000 physicians and over 400 care centers.In Feb 2016, The University of Kansas Hospital and xG Health Solutions picked Cerner's HealtheIntent population health management platform.However, it is to be noted that Cerner expects bookings growth to remain flat in the first quarter of 2016. This weak outlook, provided during the fourth-quarter 2015 conference call, has significantly dampened investor's confidence. In fact, the stock price plunged almost 14.1% following the announcement.Meanwhile, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which exerts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may affect margins. Also, stringent hospital budgets exert considerable pressure on pricing.Currently, Cerner has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the medical space are Abiomed  , CryoLife  and Luminex  .

And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them,  . We're talking healthcare innovation, on this tech edition of Greetings, Fools! Sean O'Reilly here at Fool headquarters in Alexandria, Va. It is Friday, Feb. 12, 2016, and joining me to talk about healthcare innovation on today's crossover  episode is the exceptionally perceptive and sagacious Ms. Kristine Harjes. How are you today, Kristine? Wow, I am doing even better after those words, thank you. Do you know what \"sagacious\" means? No, I don't. It means possessing keen judgment. OK, I'll take that. And maybe not keen vocabulary. [laughs] Fine. Anyway, welcome to the tech show, Kristine. I guess we're finishing out the crossover, mix it up, whatever week. Yeah. It's been an interesting week of overlapping Venn diagrams. How was your show with Dylan? I didn't get to listen to it yet. It was fun! We kicked off the show talking about how nice it is to do it with somebody in the studio, as opposed to -- Because you never get to do that. Yeah. I mean, I love doing the show with Todd, but we do it via Skype. It's a completely different experience to be able to sit down in the studio and make my hand gestures toward you and you can actually see them. It's kind of cool. Ninety percent of human communication is nonverbal, so, yeah. I'm sure that's great for the world of podcasting. Yeah. I understand Dylan took your chair, though. Yeah. That's OK. I let him have it. It's OK? All right. So, basically, we're talking about the marriage of healthcare and technology, particularly in the IT space. First, right off the bat for all of our listeners, how important is tech and healthcare, particularly in IT? This is huge. It's basically been a driving force of healthcare since about 2009, when you had the stimulus package passed, and there was the HITECH Act part of it, which provided $25.9 billion to promote and expand the adoption of healthcare information technology, healthcare IT. It was a carrot-and-stick kind of incentive, where you could get benefits for adopting electronic health records, HRs, and becoming a more digitally sound healthcare company. So the federal government was writing checks to doctors in order to incentivize them to do this? Yeah. Wow. Incentives capped out at $44,000 per doctor, which is actually not a whole lot when you consider the cost of these systems. They cost $100,000, at least. But yeah, then, Obamacare, again, had a lot of motivation behind it to get hospitals and doctor's offices onto a more advanced, sophisticated IT platform. So this, of course, begs the question, Kristine: Who's getting these $44,000 checks? Yeah. To expand that question a little bit toward who is actually making it happen, when you look at the huge, huge players in this healthcare IT space, you've got Epic Systems, which is a privately held company. But they're, as the name would imply, absolutely massive. And you have  . So they're the two Goliaths in this space. They're both really, really good at what they're doing. What kind of market share are we talking here? Because Nova is obviously a big office healthcare system around here in the metro D.C. area, and I'm pretty sure I see Epic Systems on all their computer screens whenever I go by a Nova facility. Yeah. So, Epic Systems has 54% -- Oh my gosh! -- of U.S. patients, and roughly half of hospitals. And Cerner, I don't have numbers on that, but if I had to guess, I would say almost all of the other half there. Right. And this is, the market is the United States of America, so these are clearly huge companies. Yeah. And the thing is, it kind of is a winner-take-all space, so it's odd to me that there are two major companies, especially because they won't talk to each other. [laughs] So you've got these health records, and you want to be able to go to your primary-care physician -- It's Coke and Pepsi. [laughs]  Exactly, except there's so much more on the line here. If you can't have -- say you go to your mental health doctor and you're prescribed an antidepressant, and all of a sudden, there's some drug interaction that's possible, and it's not well documented in a name your other doctor can actually access -- there could be that interaction, and it's up to you, the patient, to say, \"Oh, yeah, I'm taking this.\" It's all self-reported unless you have medical records that can talk to each other and be stored in one comprehensive place. That's not the case right now. So, the downsides here are considerably larger than mixing Coke and Pepsi. [laughs] Yeah, theoretically. [laughs] Do they use -- and you may or may not know this -- are you implying that they don't all use the same codes and stuff? What happens there? Really, security is the heart of that issue, where you don't want your medical records to be easily accessible. So there's a lot of cybersecurity wrapped into that, and this is actually what I talked about with Dylan on Wednesday's healthcare show. But the long story short is that you need really, really comprehensive security, and because of that, it's a really good argument for saying, \"Oh, well, we don't want to share information with this other company, because every time that you transport data or share information, there could be some sort of additional vulnerability.\" So for them, it's a great rationale for saying, \"No, I'm not going to play nice.\" Unbelievable. So, also, I understand that both of these companies, and a lot of these guys, they have big business not only with private hospital chains, but also the federal government and the Department of Defense and stuff. Yeah, the Department of Defense contract, that's a really interesting story. So this was -- Not a small customer, obviously. Yeah [laughs]. On the heels of a 2012 story where the VA made headlines -- Oh my gosh, that! Do you remember that? Yeah! So for those that aren't familiar with the story, basically, the Veterans Benefits Administration office building in North Carolina nearly collapsed under the weight of all of its paper files. They still had computers from the 1980s or something. [laughs] Yeah! According to these reports, one floor had totally overflowed, and you had stacks and stacks of paper going up to the cabinet, and falling out of boxes -- You're talking about physical files! Yeah, yeah! Oh my gosh! You have actual paper files! And there was such a backlog, just, for people waiting to get more information, and they just weren't online at all. So the floor almost collapsed. Wow! So the Department of Defense decides, \"OK ... \" \"Maybe we should use computers!\" [laughs] \"Maybe we should modernize a little bit.\" So there was a huge battle between a bunch of companies that are in this space, and it ultimately ended up being that Cerner, a combination of Cerner and  and  , they beat out a partnership between Epic and  , and they also beat out a couple of others competitors to win this $11 billion contract. Which, interestingly, it was originally anticipated to be $11 billion but was whittled down to $9 billion, which is the effect of competition. But going forward, these things, they don't get cheaper. These contracts only expand. So this is a huge deal. Right, and once you're in on the federal government, you're in. [laughs] Yeah, this is definitely a long-term partnership. Got it, OK. So what other customers do these companies have? As an EHR company, you're trying to get your hospitals, you're trying to get your small doctors' offices, but really, I would say the hospitals are the major people that you're trying to capture here, just because there's so much consolidation within the industry that if you get one major hospital provider, that's bank. Got it. So before we move on to a few possibly publicly traded options, can you give us a rundown on some more numbers, or what we need to know we're up against if we want to invest in one of these competitors? I'm glad you brought that up, because one of the most important things to note when you're looking at the space is, these companies are really expensive. I mean, you're not talking about cheap, single-digit, or even low -- There are no 15 P/Es here. [laughs] Yeah, exactly. Let's see, I have some numbers in front of me. Cerner, that's actually the cheap one [laughs]. They've got a P/E of 32 based on 2015 earnings, forward P/E of 26. Then, Epic is private, as we mentioned. You look at another key player in the space, which is  , they've got a P/E of 87 based on their 2015 earnings, and a forward P/E of 68. That's huge! This is also a company -- What's the market assuming? \"Oh, yeah, they'll be monopoly someday, it'll be fine.\" What? [laughs] Basically, healthcare is the last holdout industry that hasn't modernized its IT, so you're assuming that, OK, this, the huge, huge deal, to get all of these records online, and to get functioning computer systems through the healthcare industry. Make it efficient, yeah. So, the expectation there is that somebody is going to win this. When they do, it's extremely sticky. So they are really intriguing companies; they're just expensive. Right. Before we move on to Athenahealth really quick, as a potential investor in this space, should I be worried about that darn market share of Epic Systems? Because, I see 54% market share, and I'm like ... [groans] kind of nervous. Yeah, Epic is a very, very fierce competitor. Their CEO, Judith Faulkner, she's awesome. [laughs] Actually, in researching this episode, I came across a story that might not be totally related, but kind of made me laugh. She was basically being made fun of for driving around in an old Volvo by one of her board members. This was, like, last year or something? I don't know when this was. I take it was pretty recently. And so the board member says to her, \"Well, you know, next time you buy a car, take a man with you.\" Uh? And she's like, \"OK ... \" Really? So she, reportedly, doesn't say anything initially, but a few years later, she was introduced to the board member's fiancee, and she precedes to just hammer her with all these interview questions about, like, \"What's the most meaningful book you've ever read,\" all your classic interview questions, and the board member is, like, \"What are you doing?\" And she goes, \"Next time you take a wife, take a woman with you.\" [laughs] Ooooh! Wow! So she's pretty awesome. She is very, very adamant about keeping Epic private. And she's done a great job of building it up. It's totally internally built. They have been really smart about acquisitions, too. But, this is an enormous company that was built by this woman. Awesome. OK. All right, before we move on to talking about publicly traded companies that operate in the space, I wanted to point our listeners to the newly redesigned  . There, you can take advantage of a discount on The Motley Fool's  newsletter that works out to $129 for a full two-year subscription. Once again, that's  .OK, so, Kristine. In spite of the fact that Epic and their awesome CEO makes me nervous about possibly investing in this space, I don't know, it's still the first inning or second inning of the innovation in IT for healthcare? Where do you think we are? Yeah, I would say so. OK. First up, I wanted to get your thoughts on was Athenahealth. This is publicly traded. I've been involved and looking at them through  What do you think about them? Right. Athenahealth is an interesting player here, because they're kind of a smaller company, relative to Epic and Cerner. But they're pretty intriguing to me, because they snap up these small fish that Epic won't touch. Epic is very exclusive about their customers -- When you say small fish, do you mean individual doctors' offices? Yeah, exactly, a small practice or small hospital. And they're going after all of these companies. So there is this interesting dilemma that they're facing, because they're so much consolidation within the industry that a lot of investors are kind of worried, are they going to lose their business? If you have your local doctor's office all of a sudden get bought out by a bigger conglomerate practice, will they transfer to Epic's system, if the big hospital is using that? Well, not only that, but will your doctor eventually say, \"Ugh, all the other hospitals are on Epic Systems' computer system; I'm just going to give in.\" At what point does that happen? Interestingly, though -- and, of course, you would expect management to be bullish on its own company -- Naturally. But management seems to think that the cases going to be that, when you have your small fish getting snapped up, they're actually going to end up transferring to Athenahealth. Remains to be seen. Really. What? Do they have evidence to support this? Probably? [laughs] Maybe? We don't know? All right, so moving on to my favorite company in this space, I'm not going to hide that fact. I don't own shares yet, but I might in the near future, is  . Got to love that cash flow. [laughs] Yeah, that's definitely a highlight for this company. Well, you're over there and talking about companies that lose money that ... it's just nuts. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, I'm also coming from the biotech space, so that's pretty normal. For those of you that don't know, Kristine, do you even know in the biotech space what a black number on the income statement looks like? Like, a positive number? [laughs] What does that even mean? [laughs] Like, oh my gosh! A black number? They didn't lose money? You mean one that's not in parentheses? Yeah, it's crazy. Talk to me about Veeva, particularly their first-mover advantage with everything. Yeah, that's a huge advantage here. What Veeva does, they're a life sciences data management company. They've got two main parts of the business. You have your core CRM business, which is your customer relationship management, and you've got Veeva Vault, which is a management system. So -- What a name. -- the CRM -- yeah, it's very catchy. I'm sorry to interrupt, their customers are the  s and the  s, and the biotech companies that you're talking about? Yeah, through Vault, actually, they're actually working with 34 of the 50 largest pharmaceutical companies. That'll do. Yeah, so Vault, essentially, is a system where you take all of the information about processing a drug's clinical trials and approval records and what not, and storing it, sharing it, having it be really secure, and be able to transfer these master files to parties like the FDA. I know a few people, in fact, a good friend of mine works for Merck. These are not small amounts of data. The amount of analysis and data tracking that goes into one drug in simulations and everything, it's huge, I would assume. Yeah, it is a mind-boggling task to get a drug to market. There are estimates now that the cost of getting a drug to approval is $2 billion per drug. And this is why our drugs are expensive, folks. Yeah. This process lasts more than a decade, usually. So, obviously, with that, you're going to have this tremendous amount of information, so what do you do with it? You need somebody that can store it, and cloud-based software is a really, really intriguing way of meeting this need. So, how does the Vault software help with the R&D process and making it more cost-effective and stuff? It's kind of like looking up the DoD that we were talking about earlier -- Are you implying that Veeva's customers had everything in actual physical files and -- I'm just kidding [laughs]. Yeah, at one point, that's how it was! Oh my gosh! You would have physical paper! So, Veeva comes in and they're like, \"That's ridiculous! Let's get this in the cloud!\" So they're solving the problem that way. You were talking, when we were talking about Epic, you were talking about $44,000 systems, $100,000 systems. Do we have any idea of what Pfizer pays Veeva or anything? I'm not going to put a number on that, because I'm not confident it would be spot-on. OK. It's a big number. So talk to me a little more about Vault opportunity going forward. Yeah. So Vault is only 25% of the company's revenue right now. But the CEO has estimated that it has as big of an address of the market as the other half of the company, which is the CRM platform, which is to say this is the growth driver for the company. We're looking at a potential addressable market around 2 billion. Wow. Yeah. So a lot of times, when we're talking about -- here at The Motley Fool, at least --  -type investments, where you're just like, early stage, probably not profitable. What's the address of the market, how big could this get? What is that for Veeva? I would pin that at probably 5 billion. Your CRM business is supposedly a 2 billion size market. As previously mentioned, the Vault software might have another 2 billion, there's also the third part of the business that's still very young, so not even really worth talking about, but I'll just estimate there, maybe another billion from that. Cool, OK. Before we head out, I just want to give you the last word: Which of these companies do you like the most? Ooh, that's an interesting question. And you can't say Epic because you like the CEO and they're private. I'm actually going to go with Athenahealth. They've always been really interesting as a company to me, and probably the only reason I haven't invested in them is just because they are very expensive at this point. Got it, cool.

Moreover, the company's full-year 2016 bookings guidance reflected slowing momentum in winning new business.Cerner reported adjusted earnings of 58 cents per share (including stock-based compensation), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel and increased 16% on a year-over-year basis driven by almost 27% growth in revenues. Excluding stock-based compensation, earnings surged 29.8% year over year to 61 cents in the quarter.Meanwhile, revenues of almost $1.18 billion missed the consensus mark by a whisker. However, the revenue figure was in line with the mid-point of management's guided range of $1.15 billion to $1.20 billion.Core Cerner revenues totaled $930 million, while Siemens Health Services contributed $245 million. Reimbursed travel revenues inclined 1.1% to roughly $17.7 million in the quarter.Meanwhile, system sales surged 36.3% year over year to $382.1 million, supported by strong growth in subscriptions on higher recurring revenues from Siemens Health Services and licensed software.Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 23% on a year-over-year basis.Support, maintenance and service revenues improved 23.4% to $775.5 million, riding on strong growth in core support and maintenance along with higher contribution from Health Services.In the fourth quarter, bookings improved 16% year over year to of $1.35 billion, which was well below management's guided new business bookings figure of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion. Bookings included 46 large contracts worth over $5 million, of which 29 deals were valued at over $10 million. Long-term bookings comprised 27% of total bookings in the quarter.In full-year 2015, bookings surged 28% from 2014 to $5.43 billion, which bettered management's guidance by almost $200 million. Backlog rose almost 34% from the year-ago quarter to $14.2 billion.Gross margin contracted 170 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 83%.Sales & client service and Software development expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased 110 bps and 50 bps on a year-over-year basis, respectively. Also, general and administrative expenses rose 130 bps to 8%.For the first quarter of 2016, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion. The mid-point of the guided range reflects 18% year-over-year growth. The company also projects new business bookings between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion.Adjusted earnings (before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments) are now expected in the range of 52 cents to 54 cents. At mid-point, this reflects 18% growth on a year-over-year basis.For full-year 2016, Cerner projects revenues in the range of $4.9 to $5.1 billion, reflecting 13% improvement over full-year 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings, before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments, are expected in the band of $2.30 to $2.40 per share, representing almost 11% growth over 2015.Cerner currently expects approximately 80% of full-year revenues to come from backlog, which is higher than the past levels.We believe Cerner's strong product portfolio will help it to win customers in the rest of 2016 and beyond. The company has growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory market based on its product strength and enviable track record. Additionally, growing percentage of higher margin software in the business mix is expected to drive margins.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which exerts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may affect margins.

But in this clip, Sean O'Reilly and Kristine Harjes look at a smaller player,  .They examine how it's competing in the space, how big the niche it operates in is, and what strategies the company has up its sleeve for future growth.A full transcript follows the video.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them,  . I wanted to get your thoughts on athenahealth. This is publicly traded. I've been involved and looking at them through Supernova. What do you think about them? Right. Athenahealth is an interesting player here, because they're kind of a smaller company, relative to Epic and Cerner. But, they're pretty intriguing to me, because they snap up these small fish that Epic won't touch. Epic is very exclusive about their customers ... When you say small fish, do you mean individual doctor's offices? Yeah, exactly, a small practice or a small hospital. And they're going after all of these companies. So, there is this interesting dilemma that they're facing, because they're so much consolidation within the industry that a lot of investors are kind of worried: Are they going to lose their business? If you have your local doctor's office all of the sudden get bought out by a bigger conglomerate practice, will they transfer to Epic's system, if the big hospital is using that? Well, not only that, but will your doctor eventually say, \"Ugh, all the other hospitals are on Epic System's computer system, I'm just going to give in.\" At what point does that happen? Interestingly, though -- and, of course, you would expect management to be bullish on its own company -- Naturally. Management seems to think that the cases going to be that, when you have your small fish getting snapped up, they're actually going to end up transferring to athenahealth. Remains to be seen. Really.

It has increased in the last half of the year.Measures of financial uncertainty based on stock market volatility in both the United States (VIX) and the Euro area (VSTOXX) rose in response to recent events including the Greece bailout referendum in July, China's stock market crash in August, and the Paris terrorist attacks in November.However, the Fed says the levels of uncertainty in both the U.S. and the Euro area remained below their prior peaks during the global financial crisis in 2007-09 and the onset of the European debt crisis in 2011.It's not all doom and gloom. But it's close. Europe showed some manufacturing growth. Cost competitiveness rose there on the back of a cheap euro currency.Here is what Markit's Chief Economist had to say-\"The JPMorgan Global Manufacturing PMI\u2122, compiled by Markit, fell from 51.2 in November to 50.9 in December, its lowest reading for three months.

These stocks are well bid already.(1) Health Care is Attractive. Focus on Medical Care particularly. Other industries hover at Market Weight.CERNER CORP. designs, develops, markets, installs and supports information technology and content solutions for healthcare organizations and consumers that are capable of being implemented on an individual, combined or enterprise-wide basis and are accessible over the internet by consumers, physicians and healthcare providers.(2) Info Tech looks Attractive.

The Attractive industries are Banks & Thrifts and Real Estate. Insurance industries have fallen back. That says the cyclical game is largely played out.(7) Energy is now a Market Weight. The Oil-Misc industry, with its refiners and gas stations is strong. Energy-Alternates, with the strong Paris climate accord, is strong. Oil & Gas Drilling and the big integrated companies remain in the tank.(8) Industrials are Unattractive. The leader is solely the Airlines.

This year's CES witnessed a plethora of real things like smart beds, fan, smart lock, digitized shoes and wearables that are expected to make our lives more modernized.For your recollection, IoT refers to connecting devices over the web for the purpose of communication. In IoT, devices collect and share data that is stored over cloud from where information can be analyzed much faster and more accurately to gain insights.Market observers recognize IoT as a booming space and the number of connected things will likely surge 30% year over year to 6.4 billion in 2016, per Gartner. The research firm estimates 20.8 billion connected devices in use by 2020.While networking giant Cisco predicts 50 billion connected devices by 2020, IT giant Intel expects the number to reach 200 billion in the same time frame. Moreover, market research firm IDC expects spending in the IoT platform to increase from $656 billion in 2014 to $1.7 trillion in 2020.While the almost all sectors look risky considering their performance in 2015 and the market's dismal beginning to this year, it might be a good idea to pick a few stocks that have exceptional long-term growth prospects. Given such impressive projected numbers in the IoT space, you should definitely consider IoT stocks.Although there are a number of IoT players and all of them will benefit with the expected boom, you should focus on those that have near-term growth potential as well. We use our new  to zero in on such stocks.Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from the company's financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth. Our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Score of 'A' or 'B' and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space.Below are the four IoT stocks that have the right combination to stand out in 2016:NVIDIA Corporation  - NVIDIA's Tegra chip currently dominates the connected-car market with major brands like Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche and Bentley in its client list. Increasing demand for infotainment, which is a mix of an information system device and entertainment, is expected to remain the key growth catalyst for the company.Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 53.2% over the trailing four quarters. Cerner Corporation  - According to  , the healthcare IoT market is expected to grow from $32 billion in 2015 to $163 billion by 2020, which represents a CAGR of 38.1%. This opens up significant scope for Cerner, which is a leading Electronic Health Record (EHR) provider in the inpatient and ambulatory markets.Healthcare IoT aims at developing real-time communication between patients and care-givers, which will help improving the quality of patient care. Cerner's innovative product portfolio and its partnership with the likes of Qualcomm Life position it well for growth in 2016.Amazon.com Inc  - The e-commerce provider has significant growth prospects based on its new AWS IoT platform, which was launched last October. The managed cloud platform helps connected devices securely communicate between cloud applications and other devices.Amazon Echo also continues to attract third-party partners like Ford and Alarm.com. The growing demand for Amazon's voice activated speaker is a key growth catalyst, in our view.We also note that the company has trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of almost 148% over the trailing four quarters.Texas Instruments Inc.  - The semiconductor giant has substantial opportunities stemming from the increasing demand for its microcontrollers - low cost, low power, embedded chips that have programming and data memory. Increasing number of connected devices is expected to drive demand for these chips in 2016 and beyond.Texas Instruments' broad product portfolio and its relentless focus on gaining share in the infotainment and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) segments of the automotive market are likely to spur growth in 2016.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

It doesn't look like athenahealth's fourth-quarter results -- announced after the market closed Thursday -- will cause any big moves, though shares fell around 1% in after-hours trading. Here are the highlights from the quarter.\n  \nSource: Yahoo Finance!Sales grew at a solid pace. That's the good news. But the bad news was that athenahealth's GAAP earnings slipped year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings also fell to $17.8 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, from Q4 2014's $22.5 million, or $0.58 per diluted share.The problem was that athenahealth spent a lot more money. Direct operating expenses rose 28% compared to the prior year period. Selling and marketing costs soared 30%.However, athenahealth did notch several achievements during the fourth quarter, including:What about the outlook for 2016? The company provided guidance for this year that didn't disappoint. It expects revenue between $1.085 billion and $1.115 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $1.65 and $1.85.Looking at the big picture, Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush said:As Kristi Matus, chief financial and administrative officer, also noted, \"In 2015, we grew athenahealth-branded bookings by over 30%, onboarded a record 13,067 providers onto our network, and improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our service offerings.\"Investors will definitely want to pay attention to athenahealth's entrance into the major hospital market.

Comparing Cerner to athenahealth is a little like comparing Goliath to David. Cerner, for example, racked up $1.128 billion in revenue in the third quarter alone -- more than athenahealth made in revenue for all of 2015.But Cerner and other big hospital EHR vendors shouldn't be too complacent. Athenahealth began its relationship with the University of Toledo by first winning its physician group's business back in 2014. The company was able to build upon that relationship to ultimately win over the hospital's business. That's a progression that could be repeated elsewhere.

Cerner has been NAH's IT vendor since 1997 and currently offers its services to two of the health system's acute hospitals and 38 ambulatory facilities.Under the terms of the latest deal, Cerner will provide Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) services to NAH through the BOS. Cerner BOS is designed to ease front- and back-office tasks for healthcare providers.The new contract win will also help Cerner's Electronic Health Record (EHR) and BOS solutions reach 200 community providers of PathfinderHealth - a regional accountable care organization managed by NAH and different local health systems.It is to be noted that Cerner's solutions, of late, have been picked by a number of healthcare providers. We believe the new contracts will help Cerner gain better market penetration, which in turn, is expected to drive top-line growth.Earlier this month, Cerner's population health management platform, HealtheIntent was selected by Broward Health. The transaction will help Broward Health's systems come out with advanced clinical outcomes through superior analysis of patient health and access to a large data base.This November, IASIS Healthcare selected Cerner to implement an integrated EHR and revenue cycle system across the former's health care provider operations, which serve more than 1.1 million patients on an annual basis.Furthermore, in October, Geisinger Health System chose Cerner's HealtheIntent population health management platform to further expand the former's data-driven population health capabilities.We believe the clients wins will further boost bookings growth, which touched an all-time high of $1.59 billion in the third-quarter of 2015.However, the winding down of the government EHR program is expected to create a headwind for Cerner.

A problem in the early years was a lack of young people signing up, as they're healthier, and their low demand for services was needed to offset the cost of older, sicker enrollees. But with non-coverage penalties rising to $695 and higher this year, more young people have signed up, and the estimated cost of Obamacare is falling -- with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that Obamacare will cost $1.207 trillion between 2016 and 2025, down 11% from an earlier estimate of $1.35 trillion.So, which companies will be benefiting from Obamacare in 2016 and beyond? Here are three to consider.Image source: marketplace.cms.gov. Obamacare has grand goals this year, and it's looking to end 2016 with more than 10 million paying customers. (It narrowly missed this mark in 2015.) Initially, you might think insurers and hospitals are in line to benefit from the increase in enrollment, but I believe these companies are where the biggest cost question marks lie. I have more confidence in a health information services company such as  .Inovalon's job is pretty simple: Take copious amounts of patient data, and turn the chaos into order. Its cloud-based programs and analytics help optimize patient care for hospitals, clinics, and health-benefit providers.Why Inovalon? Obamacare is an expense wildcard for insurers, hospitals, and clinics. No one is sure if consumers are going to be visiting the doctor more often now that they have easier access to healthcare, and in turn, businesses are worried about whether or not they'll be reimbursed for care given.That's where Inovalon comes in.Inovalon's products do cost money, but they're designed to optimize efficiency for clients, presumably improving margins and eliminating a lot of wasteful spending. For instance, the collaborative efforts between  and Inovalon recently led to a new product, Data Diagnostics.

To understand what EHRs are and can do, imagine going to your primary care physician, a specialist, or an emergency room, with whoever examines you having access to your records electronically. Since they'll be able to see your prescriptions, health issues, treatments, immunizations, lab results, and more, they'll likely be able to make better decisions and deliver better care.Healthcare-oriented information technology is a growing field, and EHRs are expected to become more widely used -- partly due to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The HITECH Act offers both financial carrots and sticks to spur adoption (such as offering billions of dollars in incentive money for providers to be using EHRs in \"meaningful\" ways), and that has helped companies in the EHR business grow. Indeed, as of October 2015, close to 500,000 healthcare providers received incentive payments for EHR participation.Cerner Corporation is a key player in EHRs, and it's also ready to help medical practices with tasks such as scheduling and payments. Its revenue has nearly doubled over the past four years, it's free-cash-flow positive, and its net margins recently topped 12%. The company's bookings hit an all-time high of $1.6 billion in the last quarter, up 44% year over year. At recent levels, Cerner stock doesn't appear to be a screaming bargain, but with a forward-looking P/E ratio around 26, well below its five-year average of 40, it offers a lot of potential for long-term believers.Image source: Healthcare.gov looks like a good Obamacare play in 2016 because of its focus on the emerging electronic health record business. As Selena notes, the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, places a major emphasis on the digitization of medical records in order to cut costs and improve the quality of care, making companies developing these types of technologies worth a deeper look from investors.Although Allscripts Healthcare Solutions is a relatively small company compared to most of its peers operating in the emerging healthcare information technology space, it does offer a number of digital solutions for medical service providers that span the entire continuum of care. In particular, the company's Sunrise EHR solution has become the chosen platform for several major medical service providers recently because of its ability to serve a variety of patients types, such as those in inpatient, ambulatory, emergency and surgical settings.Another bit of good news is that Allscripts' balance sheet is in respectable shape, with a debt-to-equity ratio of only 46% at last count. By contrast, some of Allscripts' closest competitors have taken on eye-popping levels of debt to build out their overall business, meaning they are burdened with hefty interest payments weighing on their bottom lines.So, with digital medical records rapidly becoming a permanent fixture in the U.S. healthcare landscape, I think Allscripts is a good stock to consider adding to your portfolio next year because of its diversity of offerings for healthcare providers in general and its comparatively clean balance sheet.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Image Source: Three months ago, investors in Cerner Corporation weren't happy campers after the company  and management provided disappointing third-quarter guidance. The big healthcare information technology company announced its third-quarter results after the market closed on Tuesday. Did Cerner disappoint investors again?\n  \nData Source: Cerner CorporationThe solid year-over-year growth reflected in the chart above was achieved on the back of exceptionally strong bookings, which hit an all-time high of $1.59 billion in the third-quarter -- up a whopping 44% over the same period last year. Bookings reflect the value of new business won, but they aren't recognized as revenue until actually invoiced to the customer. Other highlights from the quarter included:Cerner also provided guidance for the fourth quarter. Management expects sales between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion. The midpoint of that range reflects a 27% year-over-year increase. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be in the $0.56 to $0.58 range -- around 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014.Executives were understandably happy about the all-time high level of bookings. \"The highlight of our results in the third quarter was our strong bookings, which again included a record number of new clients joining Cerner,\" said Chairman and CEO Neal Patterson. \"We have signed more new clients in the first three quarters of 2015 than any full-year in our history, and I attribute this success to our strong competitive position in an active marketplace.\"Cerner reported a solid third quarter, but expectations remain high -- and potentially tough to achieve. The company faces a significant challenge in the hospital EHR (electronic health record) market from privately held Epic. Cerner seems to be faring well in that duel, though, as evidenced by its recent snag of Arizona-based client Banner Health from Epic.It could be an even tougher battle in the physician systems market.  appears to be firing on all cylinders lately. The cloud-based healthcare technology company also recently posted  . And in a recent KLAS study, athenahealth scored higher than Cerner as the easiest system to connect with.Athenahealth's CEO, Jonathan Bush, stated earlier this year that he expects Cerner and Epic to \"collapse like big black swans.\" If so, some investors could be disappointed again when Cerner reports next quarter. Based on the company's most recent results, however, Cerner's wings appear to be flapping quite nicely for now.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

In the last quarter, the company reported earnings of 50 cents which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. We note that Cerner has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average surprise of almost 1%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe Cerner is favorably positioned for growth banking on a strong pipeline and new business opportunities. The company continues to win contracts that are expected to drive its top line. We believe continuing client wins will further boost bookings growth, which touched an all-time high of $1.59 billion in the third quarter of 2015.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which puts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may affect margins. Meanwhile, stringent hospital budgets exert pressure on pricing.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cerner is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or at least #3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Cerner has a 0.00% ESP. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 53 cents. : Cerner's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:AMN Healthcare  with an Earnings ESP of +2.44% and a Zacks Rank #1.Kite Pharma  with an Earnings ESP of +6.1% and a Zacks Rank #2.WebMD Health  with an Earnings ESP of +1.75% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Further, the company's preliminary full-year 2016 guidance failed to impress investors, the combined effect of which led to a 9.7% ($6.39) decline in the company's shares in after-hours trading.Adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share (including stock-based compensation) missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Revenues of almost $1.13 billion also lagged the consensus mark of $1.17 billion. The revenue figure also fell below management's guided range of $1.15 billion to $1.20 billion.However, adjusted earnings advanced almost 28.2% on a year-over-year basis driven by 34.2% growth in revenues. Excluding stock-based compensation, earnings surged 28.6% year over year to 54 cents in the quarter.Core Cerner revenues totaled $877 million, while Siemens Health Services contributed $250 million. The revenue miss in the quarter can be primarily attributed to lower-than-expected upfront software revenues on some large contracts and lower technology resale revenues. Reimbursed travel revenues declined 16.8% to roughly $19 million in the quarter.Meanwhile, system sales surged almost 45% year over year to $325.1 million, supported by strong growth in subscriptions on higher recurring revenues from Siemens Health Services and licensed software.Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 30% year over year backed by higher contribution from Health Services as well as growth in core Cerner managed services.Support, maintenance and service revenues improved 32.2% to $783.9 million, riding on strong growth in core support and maintenance along with higher contribution from Health Services.Bookings improved 44% year over year to an all-time high of $1.59 billion. Backlog rose 36.3% from the year-ago quarter to $13.9 billion. Bookings included 45 large contracts worth over $5 million, of which 31 deals were valued at over $10 million. Long-term bookings comprised 31% of total bookings in the quarter.Cerner noted that 39% of the bookings came from customers who are not Millennium users, reflecting the company's improving competitiveness and a market that presents growth opportunities through product replacements.Gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 83.1%, primarily owing to unfavorable business mix (higher low margin tech resale revenues in third-quarter 2015).Sales & client service and Software development expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased 10 bps and 20 bps on a year-over-year basis, respectively. Also, general and administrative expenses rose 100 bps to 8.8%.For the fourth quarter of 2015, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion. The mid-point of the guided range reflects 27% year-over-year growth. The company also projects new business bookings between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion.Adjusted earnings (before share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments) are now expected in the range of 56 cents to 58 cents. At mid-point, this reflects 21% growth on a year-over-year basis. Share-based compensation expense is likely to impact earnings by roughly 3-4 cents in the fourth quarter.The fourth-quarter revenue guidance projects full-year revenues in the range of $4.400- $4.450 billion, lower than the company's guided range of $4.475-$4.575 billion. At mid-point, this reflects almost 30% growth on a year-over-year basis.For full-year 2016, Cerner projects revenues of over $5 billion, at least 13% improvement over full-year 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments is expected to be in the band of $2.30 to $2.40 per share, representing almost 13% growth over 2015.Cerner currently expects approximately 75% of full-year revenues to come from backlog, which is higher than the past levels.We believe Cerner's strong product portfolio will help it to win customers in the rest of 2015 and beyond. The recent contract wins from Catholic Health Initiatives, University of Missouri (MU), Baptist Health South Florida, McLaren Health Care and Geisinger Health System reflect growing traction.Cerner is the core EHR supplier in the consortium that won the Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) project. The group, led by Leidos Holdings  , has notable companies like Accenture  , Henry Schein  and Intermountain Healthcare on board. The deal will significantly help Cerner expand its footprint going forward.Moreover, Cerner has growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory market based on its product strength and enviable track record. Additionally, growing percentage of higher margin software in the business mix is expected to drive margins.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which exerts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins.

(Symbol: CERN) saw new options begin trading today, for the January 2018 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 795 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CERN options chain for the new January 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $46.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CERN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $56.69/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 12% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CERN stock at the current price level of $56.69/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 16.95% if the stock gets called away at the January 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CERN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CERN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 46%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

While population growth in general is expected to slow over the coming decades, the global population is poised to get older and wealthier, which should combine to increase the demand for healthcare services for decades into the future. With a megatrend like that in place there are also bound to be dozens of smaller trends at play in the healthcare sector, so investors in the space should be aware of them and looking for ways to position their portfolios to take advantage.We asked our team of Motley Fool contributors to share a trend in healthcare that is here to stay and could make for a great investing idea for at least 20 years into the future. : One of the most important parts of Medicare reform over the past several years has been the shift away from service-based payments toward more of a quality-based payment model. In effect, Medicare is looking to reward those hospitals and healthcare facilities that offer high-quality care in a way that reduces the need for subsequent readmissions. By doing so, Medicare gives an incentive for healthcare providers to get things right the first time rather than plan for a return trip to a hospital.The system is still new enough that investors shouldn't draw any firm conclusions from the ratings. However, it's clear that hospitals and other healthcare facilities -- both nonprofit and for-profit -- will need to watch closely to make sure that their quality levels allow them to get the maximum reimbursements possible from Medicare. Going forward, it seems likely that this trend will gain momentum, and hospital organizations will have to work increasingly hard in order to sustain and build on their reputations for quality service.Investors should also watch closely to see what kinds of innovations hospital companies come up with, as the moves they make now could result in competitive advantages down the road that could generate stronger returns.: While the rising costs of drugs have  recently, it's likely that the government will look for ways to help rein in the cost increases. One way they may do just that is making it easier for biosimilar drugs, which are generic version of biologics, to find their way to market.Most drugs fall into one of two categories: chemical and biologic. Chemical drugs have faced generic competition for years once they lose patent protection, as manufacturers can easily flood the market with generic alternatives that dramatically reduce prices.That hasn't happened with biologic drugs: since they are produced from living organisms, they are susceptible to heat and microbial contamination, which makes manufacturing copycats far more difficult. Up until recently the regulatory pathway for biologic drugs was unclear, but  earlier this year when the FDA approved its first biosimilar.Now that the door has been busted open, it's likely that we will see a flood of biosimilars hit the market over the coming decades, which could go a long way toward reining in drug prices. While this is a win for consumers, it could spell trouble for big pharma companies like  and even blue-chip biotechs like  , which depend on revenue from biologic drugs that have already lost or will soon lose patent protection.Of course, one company's loss is another's gain, so investors can put the trend on their side in a number of ways. Pharma giant  to help build up its biosimilar presence, and  '  Sandoz could also be a big player in the biologic market. For those interested in a smaller biosimilar pure-play,  already has three biosimilars in advanced trials.No matter how this story plays out, biosimilars represent both a huge threat and a huge opportunity, making this an important trend to watch over the coming 20 years.: One trend in healthcare that's likely to be a boon to doctors, patients, and some investors is the growth in electronic health records, or EHRs. An increasingly busy corner of the software world is devoted to healthcare-oriented information technology, and many are focused on EHRs.Imagine going to your primary care physician, a specialist, or an emergency room, with whoever examines you having access to your records electronically. They'll be able to see your prescriptions, health issues, treatments, immunizations, lab results, and more. That's a prescription for better care, as doctors can make more informed decisions.It's a relatively new concept, and many in the healthcare community are not embracing it, as it's costly and not a simple thing to implement. But there's an important catalyst giving growth traction now: the U.S. government, which enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, promoting the adoption of health information technology. It offered both financial carrots and sticks to spur adoption (such as offering billions of dollars in incentive money for providers to use EHRs in \"meaningful\" ways), which has helped companies in the EHR business grow.One such company to consider for your portfolio is  , which offers integrated systems that can help medical practices not only with EHRs but with scheduling, payments, and more. The company received a $4.3 billion contract this summer from the U.S. military, which will provide more wind in its sails. It pays no dividend at the moment, but is free-cash-flow positive and has double-digit net margins, which suggests that this could be a great company to play on the trend of EHRs.: Every day almost 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 in the U.S. -- that's one every nine seconds. Boomers, who made political and social protests the norm in their youth, will demand control over their healthcare -- something we haven't seen in previous generations. In addition, thanks to medical advances over their lifetime, boomers will live longer.So what stocks or healthcare industries are boomers likely to put on the fast lane to continued success?Let's start with wearables, in the form of monitoring devices for people with chronic medical illnesses. I'm talking about innovations from companies like  , with its pain-free wearable for monitoring glucose, or , whose wristbands are being used by cardiac-surgeons to track activity in their patients. Medical wearables could provide colossal opportunities in the coming decades.What about Big Pharma? The average 70-year-old takes three times more prescription drugs than the typical 40-year-old does, so this sub-sector looks set for multi-decade gains. Oncology titan  could be a particularly good bet. Roche has one of the most robust drug pipelines in Big Pharma, and its strong diagnostics business provides a unique edge. Combining diagnostics tools with treatment means more integrated, personalized healthcare solutions -- exactly what this demanding generation will expect. : The next big thing in healthcare is actually here already, but you're probably going to witness it evolve slowly over the next 10 to 20 years.Personalized medicine, or the idea of throwing out the one-size-fits-all cures for certain diseases, such as cancer, is one way I believe you could find substantial profits and improved quality of life for many years to come. Personalized medicine focuses on the idea of targeting specific genes or proteins within a person's body to effect positive biologic change.Two ways to consider taking advantage of personalized medicine is through diagnostics and drug developers themselves.Within diagnostics, a company like  with its BRACAnalysis test has spearheaded the campaign to identify women who have a much higher risk factor for breast and ovarian cancer. The test analyzes whether or not the patient is a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation carrier. Some patients, like Angelina Jolie, took the pre-emptive measure of getting a mastectomy to substantially lower their risks. Others can use the test as a cue to be screened for breast and ovarian cancer early and often.Another approach is to consider cancer drug developers focused on specific genes, or on enhancing the way your body fights disease. Cancer immunotherapy vaccines are a great example of a medicine designed to teach your immune system how to more effectively and efficiently locate and destroy cancer cells. For instance,  's Opdivo demonstrated a response rate of around 60% in patients expressing high levels of PD-L1 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. It also boosted survival times by a whopping eight months, which is impressive for NSCLC patients who've progressed on prior therapies.The future is now when it comes to personalized medicine, and you should consider examining ways to incorporate this huge growth potential into your portfolio.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Investors are ecstatic with the numbers -- as they should be. Revenue was up 24% year over year. And, on the bottom line, athenahealth posted $5.8 million in income compared to a loss of $1.6 million in the year-ago quarter.The key measurement for growth at athenahealth is the number of new physicians using its cloud-based electronic health records, billing, mobile applications, and the like. In the third quarter, the company added 4,784 providers with athenaCollector, athenaClinicals, and athenaCommunicator all having net additions. The number of additions was a record for the company, suggesting that there's more growth ahead.athenahealth's smaller rival  was also up substantially today after releasing earnings on Thursday after the bell. Revenue growth at Quality Systems wasn't nearly as impressive, up just 4% year over year. While the growth isn't all that impressive, Quality Systems has struggled of late, so any growth is good news.We'll have to wait for nearly two weeks to see if the growth at athenaheath and Quality Systems came at the expense of their larger rival,  , which isn't scheduled to release earnings until November 3. Cerner was up slightly today, so investors don't seem too worried. It's, of course, possible for athenahealth, Quality Systems, and Cerner to all add physicians because these healthcare IT companies are not only competing with each other but also against the pen and paper. Management didn't make any changes to its guidance but noted that revenue would be \"at or above the mid-point of the $905 million to $925 million guidance range.\" At the mid-point, athenahealth is guiding for fourth quarter revenue of $248 million, which would only be a 16% increase over the year-ago quarter.It seems likely that management is sandbagging a little bit, but we'll have to wait until the quarter ends to know for sure.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

All this and more on today's episode of Industry Focus.A full transcript follows the video.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them,  . What to watch in October. This is Industry Focus.Welcome to Industry Focus, healthcare edition. Like it or not, October is here. I'd say it's officially time to get in the fall mind-set, start thinking about Halloween costumes and maybe what the month has in store for the healthcare industry. I'm Kristine Harjes and joining me to chat via Skype is healthcare contributor Todd Campbell. Todd, can you believe we're talking about October already? I really can't -- it's a gray sky out here today in New England, and I'm already starting to think about my winter vacation plans. It's just not right. You're way ahead of me. I'm still dwelling on the Thanksgiving plans and Halloween costumes. What will you dress as this year? I have no idea. October sprung up on me, but I guess now that we're here we've got two things on our mind for this month. There's a PDUFA date coming up at the end of the month and a shift in the way medical coding is done.We'll start with the latter since this change is going into effect tomorrow, October 1. All healthcare providers, starting tomorrow, are going to have to shift from a standard of medical codes known as ICD-9, to an updated version known as ICD-10.Todd, can you give our listeners some background? Sure. I think the easiest way to explain this is just to think about it from the doctor's perspective. If you're a patient and you go in and you get treatment, your doctor looks at you and tells you what you can do to improve your condition and then sends you on your way.But there's a lot of back-office things that occur at the doctor's office after that visit. That includes figuring out how they're going to get paid for providing that service to you. One of the ways they do that is by using a coding system based upon whatever it was you discussed with your doctor that day. Previously, until tomorrow, the U.S. was using ICD-9 and that was a very antiquated coding system. This has been around for almost 40 years. Yeah, it's been the standard since 1979. Yeah, getting very long in the tooth. People argue that it's an incredibly inefficient way to bill for services because it was put in place prior to all the technology that allows for online billing of an insurance company, or to Medicare, which is obviously the granddaddy for a lot of these providers and sources of income. Meanwhile, all the other countries have been using ICD-10, which is the new version of this coding system, for more than a decade and the U.S. is the only country in the industrialized world that's still holding out. We've absolutely been dragging our feet on this and it's much to the -- all these foreign countries are like \"Come on!\" They'll pull kicking and screaming and they want to be able to share data and come up with new findings as a result, but the U.S. has been reticent to disrupt how healthcare is provided. Obviously, switching over from a system that has less than 20,000 healthcare codes to a system that has 130,000 to 140,000 codes is no small feat.It's also a pricey and time-consuming prospect. Hopefully, providers have taken the initiative and gotten on top of this because over the course of the last couple years as deadlines were approaching to get us switched over to ICD-10, providers continually pushed back and said they needed more time. This switchover was supposed to happen a long time ago and private insurers have signals that they're ready. They've said to bring it on and they want this updated version, but it's the providers themselves, the healthcare practices that are dragging their feet. Apparently, in October last year 82% of healthcare practices have said they're not quite ready for it and needed more time.An entire year was given as an extension and we're now finally bumping up against the date, tomorrow, when the switch will finally be made. Doctors are pretty pressed for time as it is. I think a lot of them were looking at practicing medicine rather than dealing with the back-office nightmares that are likely to occur. The other issue is when you switch over from something so much more complex, something that is brand-new -- anyone who's coding in medical offices today has been using this ICD-9 for their entire career.It's not like they've changed many times and this is just one more change. There are a lot of opportunities for error and in that error, if there is error; that could significantly derail the income stream for these practices. If you don't code correctly, the payer can deny the claim.If the payer denies the claim, that means the doctor will then have to jump through many more hoops to provide the information necessary to that payer. That means there could be potential delays in receiving payment, it also means potentially never receiving payment depending on the certain situation.There's a lot of reasons that doctors have basically put off getting things in place until the last minute. The vast majority should be OK. A study that was done in the middle of September showed that only 30% were ready to go as of September 15, but well over 80% said that they're most likely going to be ready and more than 90% said they'll probably be ready. \"Probably\" is the key word there. I've seen a lot of responses from different doctors in practices throwing it out there on different forums saying they'll probably be OK, but they're not sure. I saw once a group of physicians were polled and they said that 33% of them took out a line of credit to protect against the financial impact against potential delays. Yeah. That was a standard operating procedure recommendation from a lot of the companies that have been hired as consultants to come in and help practices prepare for this launch. Essentially, they'll need to protect their revenue stream by knowing you can tap into money if there are delays. As investors, what does this mean for us? There are a couple different takeaways. There could be some difficulties for hospitals, but most hospitals that are publicly traded are large institutions. They have tremendous resources, most likely the impact on them -- if any -- would be pretty small. Instead, a much bigger impact would probably come in the form of upside to healthcare IT companies whose software is being deployed to make it easier to collect the revenue from the patient, or the payer.Also, the software that they're selling that's going to leverage all this new data -- think about all the opportunity that having so many more codes they provide, you'll now be able to parse that data in so many different ways and that could be used to help design treatment outcomes to evaluate the quality of care that's being provided, to better identify global threats of epidemics such as Ebola, or something else occurring in the future.There are a lot of opportunities here for those companies that are going to be analyzing the data. I like  , which is one of the companies in that space. They're a big player and the second largest in market share in many of these markets. I also like  , which has a very big present in the private practices of doctor's offices and helping them get up to speed in the healthcare IT. You mentioned the granularity of the data and I totally agree that there's so much opportunity there, and in this new catalog of codes, you've got more than 200 different codes for diabetes alone, there's more than 100 different codes for gout. I think I even saw that the government's listed more than 30 different codes for industries caused by acts of terrorism.You get really specific with this kind of data. The ability to analyze it just increases exponentially. I think that could be good news for insurers, too. Absolutely. As you're able to dig deeper into this data, you should be able to find cost savings. It increases efficiency, you should be able to design treatment protocols that work more effectively that would reduce readmissions or disease progression. All of those things could result in cost savings for payers like insurers. This does seem like this entire shift, even if it does cause some bumps in the road for small practices in the short term, healthcare IT is still going to be big. All these new waves of technology are going to continue to reform the industry and probably make it even more profitable, hopefully across the board. None of us probably wanted to upgrade our Windows software, but anybody who's trying to run Windows 3 right now is probably struggling. Exactly.

I would highly recommend that you check it out.Moving on, the most important PDUFA date of October is coming up at the end of the month. Todd, what's going on? One of the things I like to do -- and I think this is helpful for all investors who are listening, or watching on the program -- at the end of every month, go online and do a bit of due diligence and look and see what's on the calendar at the FDA because decisions that are coming out of the FDA can have a huge impact on the direction of a stock price in the near term.While you shouldn't be investing over a period of weeks, you need to have a longer-term thesis, you can't ignore the potential impact of a new drug that could potentially be coming to market. Looking at the calendar for this coming month, the company that I think could really see the needle move on an approval would be Shire. Shire submitted an application for approval for a treatment for treating dry eye disease earlier this year.One of the most common complaints of people going into eye doctors is the negative effects, and pain associated with dry eye. Shire has a drug that it believes will do a better job than anything that's currently out there at helping to relieve the symptoms of this condition. If so, Shire thinks this drug could be worth $1 billion a year in sales at some point. Care to take a stab at the pronunciation of this drug? Oh, boy. Lifitegrast. I always struggle because with the generic names of the drugs, it's either to-may-to or to-mah-to. Lifitegrast is what I'll go with today. OK. We can go with that. Lifitegrast. This is an intriguing drug. One of the reasons I'm so intrigued by it is that a dry eye typically occurs more frequently as you get older. As a long term investor, one of the trends I think investors should be focusing on is an ever larger, older population her in America. As baby boomers continue to get older, there's likely more baby boomers who are going to be going to their eye doctors and complaining about this condition.If so, the demand for this drug could be strong. If it is strong and sales are strong, then it certainly helps propel Shire toward that goal they have of 10 billion in sales by 2020, which would roughly be a doubling from where they were when  was courting them as part of that failed merger. Right. I think one of the most promising signs for this drug and its upcoming potential approval is the fact that it received priority review. What exactly does that mean? Why is that so important? Typically speaking, when you have a drug in development coming through the works in the pipeline, it addresses a condition that is an \"unmet need.\" The FDA will give you a perk. They will say that they understand that they're developing something for a condition that doesn't have a lot of effective therapies for.What' they'll do is cut the amount of time that they spend in reviewing that application. In this case they're reducing the application review to 8 months from 12 months. In reducing that time and giving it priority review, that theoretically allows the drug maker to get that drug to the market more quickly and to capture those additional months of sales. For a $1 billion drug, that can be pretty substantial. Exactly. One of the things that's got people talking about this drug is that the phase 3 trials produced mixed results and there's already a drug developed by Allergan that's out there to treat this disease, but I think getting priority review for this drug from the FDA is a really good sign for it. There's got to be something there that the agency is seeing that could revolutionize this treatment space. Yeah. Again, that phase 3 trial does make it really interesting. That's another reason why we want to be watching this as investors this month. On the one hand it improved the symptoms of dry eye, but on the other hand key biomarkers that are used to evaluate dry eye didn't really improve. There's a bit of a disconnect on the efficacy side of this.However, on the safety side, it did appear to fine. There were no real serious adverse events that led to mass discontinuation of this drug. I think what will probably happen is -- if I were going to handicap this -- the FDA will probably say they've got a safe drug for a condition that there aren't a lot of effective therapies for, and it works on the symptoms. Then they'll go ahead and approve it.There is the risk that they approve it conditionally where they say they'll approve it but the company then has to come out with another study just to resolve that discrepancy in the primary outcomes data. If so, that would hinder the profitability of this drug for Shire because trials are expensive. Exactly. The other thing to keep in mind is that the 25th is a Sunday. I'd say it's more likely than not that we'll actually hear an answer before then. Definitely keep your eyes peeled. This will be a really interesting catalyst for Shire.As always, people on this program may have interests in the stocks that they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against those stocks. So, don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear on this program. Do your research on Shire and Allergan and everyone else that we've mentioned today. Keep your eyes out for this FDA decision coming up sometime prior even on October 25.Todd, thanks as always for being here and folks, thanks for joining us today.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC.

HealtheIntent will form an essential part of Geisinger's system-wide data management platform Unified Data Architecture (UDA).HealtheIntent is a population health management platform that retrieves data from various sources, including Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Health Information Technology (HIT) systems, and helps organizations understand patients better and also provide appropriate treatment. It is a cloud-based platform that enables real-time access to and processing of data to provide improved and accurate health care.Digitization of healthcare information through EHRs is a vital step for the medical industry. However, the assimilation of data from EHR platforms and other external sources needs to be done for a more personalized care and treatment of patients. HealtheIntent intends to provide such a service to Geisinger and other such organizations who have adopted the platform.In fact, HealtheIntent has been gaining contracts for quite some time now. Most recently, HealtheIntent, along with Cerner Millennium EHR, was selected by McLaren Health Care for the implementation of EHR and population health management across their facilities in Michigan. Moreover, both these platforms were selected by Western Connecticut Health Network in September and by Baptist Health South Florida in August.HealtheIntent is one of the major solutions that Cerner provides and its rising popularity will certainly boost revenues for the company in the future.Cerner currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the medical sector include Streamline Health Solutions  , Masimo Corporation  and Cesca Therapeutics  .

Last quarter, the company recorded earnings of 48 cents per share, which were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, Cerner has bettered the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 0.58% over the last four quarters.Let's have a look at how things have shaped up over the last few months.Cerner continues to win contracts that are expected to drive its top line. A string of new deals has helped the company gain market traction in the third quarter and is expected to propel growth even in the future. Notably, growing adoption of Cerner's Millennium EHR and HealtheIntent has been a key catalyst in recent times.Apart from contract wins, Cerner is expected to gain considerable synergies from new partnerships and extension of the existing ones.For the third quarter of 2015, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion. The mid-point of the guided range reflects 40% year-over-year growth. The company also projects new business bookings between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion.Notably, Cerner is the core EHR supplier in the consortium, led by Leidos Holdings, that won the Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) project. The $4.3 billion deal will significantly help Cerner expand its footprint.We believe Cerner is well positioned for growth owing to its strong pipeline and business opportunities. However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which exerts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Low technology resale margins also raise concern.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cerner is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Cerner has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 51 cents. Cerner carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:AmSurg Corp  with earnings ESP of +8.79% and a Zacks Rank #1.Opko Health Inc.  with earnings ESP of +100.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.Henry Schein Inc.  with earnings ESP of +1.37% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This summer, Cerner, along with partners  and  , was awarded a mammoth 10-year, $4.3 billion contract to overhaul the military's healthcare records systems.Overall, because Cerner has a 10-year compounded annual sales and earnings growth rate of 14% and 22%, respectively, that indicates it knows how to capitalize on opportunities, I think Cerner is positioned nicely to benefit from ongoing Obamacare-inspired demand.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them,  . Healthcare goes hi-tech. This is Industry Focus.Hi, everyone! Welcome to Industry Focus, healthcare edition. I'm your host Kristine Harjes, and I'm joined today by Motley Fool healthcare contributor Todd Campbell. Today, we're going to talk about healthcare IT. Information technology in the healthcare sector. When I think about big trends going on in healthcare right now, there are plenty that come to mind, but one of the really huge ones that I think about is IT.This is an absolutely ginormous thing to watch going on right now because you've got the government pushing for it. Back in 2009, as a part of the stimulus bill, we had this HITECH Act that was passed and it basically said, \"Here's $25 billion. With this, we want to promote the expansion and the adoption of health information technology.\" Of course, that's a pretty vague term right there, but one of the really big efforts within health IT is the establishment of EHRs.EHRs are your Electronic Health Records Systems, where you essentially have everything you need to know about a patient stored electronically. You've got their patient demographics, their progress notes, drugs they're taking, problems they're having, vital signs; I could go on and on. Allergies, immunization dates; any sort of medical history or something that a doctor might want to know in a clinical setting.EHRs automate and streamline provider workflow to get all this information together, have it in one place, have it digital, and be able to work with it that way. To me, this seems like an absolutely huge initiative. Todd, where do we stand on it? It's a mammoth initiative. If you think about this, healthcare is being dragged kicking and screaming into the world of information technology. It's one of the last major sectors that are a holdout on embracing these computerized systems. Not that long ago, we would go into a doctor or dentist's office and there would still be rows and rows of file cabinets behind the desk.You look at that and say that's from the 1970s, but there were a lot of reasons for it. There weren't any financial incentives for doctors and hospitals to embrace technology because if they have a paper record, they'll invoice Medicare or Medicaid or a private payer like an insurance company and they don't need to have a lot of bells and whistles. Why would they spend the money? It would be a huge effort for any single provider to totally reform and not be incentivized to do so. You're basically taking a car that's not as fast, but it's going 60 miles per hour and you're pulling up the emergency brake and telling the car to go into another direction. I think that's one of the reasons the HITECH Act was so important to create both a carrot-and-a-stick approach to getting providers to embrace these health IT systems.You've got the carrot side of things in which doctors and providers can receive tens of thousands of dollars for multiple years for bringing in these health IT systems. Then you've got the stick approach, which kicks off very soon and that's going to start dinging providers on the amount of money they receive back in reimbursement for Medicare if they haven't adopted these systems. Basically, you've got these players that, as a practice, if you decide you don't want to implement EHRs, your option is to either face these penalties, which will get bigger and bigger each year, or stop accepting Medicare. Both of these are going to absolutely kill your business. Right. You can't. You can make a decision knowing that you get X amount of money from Medicare in the practice and consider if they ding 1% that might not be a lot. Maybe it's a lot relative to how much it would cost to institute the health IT system from one of the many providers that have popped up and race to capture part of this money that's being given out or has been given out by the government as part of the incentives. At the same time, you're just delaying the inevitable there. This is a reform that is going to end up being ubiquitous. Technology is going to happen. Evolution happens. There's a lot of argument and studies have been done and released this year saying that the HITECH Act was great; it really was. All of this is pulling things forward. If that never existed, then doctors and hospitals would still embrace these systems. It would have just happened two to three years later.Two to three years is still substantial. When it comes to technology, if you can shorten the curve, it's almost exponential. The next advance will come quicker and the advance beyond that will come quicker. There's also a lot of debate right now with EHRs questioning if the systems are really doing what they were supposed to do when they were first conceived.Are they really communicating across different doctors and providers? Can a specialist really pull up my record? Can a hospital then pull up my record, make changes, and have it go back to notify the primary care? There are a lot of challenges here. Yeah. That raises the issue of interoperability, which is healthcare-speak for saying that these systems don't speak the same language right now. Your biggest provider -- Epic Systems and they're a privately held company -- they have this closed-box system that won't play well with others. They also don't have any incentive to play well with others.They've got half the market share in hospitals, and there's no reason why they would make a system that can nicely communicate with all the other systems because they're trying to leverage their size and drive everyone else out of this market. Right. It's the race to the top. You want to squeeze out all of these small players who came in during 2009 and 2010. There's a high level of dissatisfaction due to the interoperability issue. Most of the major hospitals either have systems in place either from Epic or from  and those are not going to communicate with these other smaller systems that have been put in place.A lot of people are now saying, \"I'm going to have to toss out the one I just spent all this money on and replace it with this other system. Who's to say I even like the system? Who's to say if I get one of these other systems that it's still going to be able to communicate with Epic?\" Like you said, Epic has no interest and no incentive.A lot of people will then say \"The HITECH Act is flawed because it didn't mandate that it should be built around a common code. Then you're getting in a muddily area. How much do you want to stifle market ingenuity and innovation by mandating a certain approach? The other side of that coin is one of the reasons these systems don't talk to each other is security. You're talking about people's health records. That needs to be on lockdown. If you're Epic, you don't want to open up your system where anyone can talk to it because all of a sudden you could be compromised that much more easily. Right. Someone uses a backdoor through another company to get into your system and then guess what? The press release is \"Epic's System Has Been Hacked.\" Exactly. There are these really high profile acts that have happened. There was one in August of 2014 that I remember, with  . They had this hugely public breach that involved 4.5 million patients. That just looks bad. Even if you don't end up getting penalized by HIPAA you are still getting all that bad publicity. Absolutely. This is very different than putting a system in place at any one corporation. Its' all about silos versus non-silos. If you've got a grocer, even if its system is opened up to all the different grocery stores and all the different distributors, it's still a closed system to that grocer. You don't have competing grocers having access to your systems.This is a new animal because you're really trying to create something that is open to all that should get it, but closed to all that shouldn't. Trying to figure that out is a magic bullet. I think one of the questions we've danced around is: is this a 'winner takes all' type of game, or is there room for some of these smaller players like  to come in and develop a really niche-y type of business and survive in the face of Epic? I think one of the things that's interesting about all of these different companies -- Cerner is obviously a huge player in acute hospitals. Athena is a big and growing player in primary care practices that wants to get into that hospital market. There are different ways that you can attack this market. For that reason, I think you can have huge players like Epic and Cerner and small players like Athena surviving and possibly even thriving.However, beyond those leaders in these respective niches it's very hard to argue that an upstart would jump in or that some of these other players like  , who's another big player, but it's hard to imagine that over time they're not going to continually lose ground. The reality is, you've got to go with whatever system is installed by the most people if you truly want interoperability. I would agree there. There are only 10 EHR vendors that account for 90% of the hospital EHR market. Meanwhile, in 2014 there were only three vendors that actually posted a gain in market share. Those were Epic, Cerner, and Athenahealth. Athenahealth actually doubled its market share in 2014. They're a smaller player, but I'm personally rooting for them. They're a smaller player. You could take that information with a grain of salt. They've made a big acquisition this year with Razor Insights that really launched them into the hospital acute care market. They're definitely one to watch. Cerner is probably the most compelling, from an investment stand point because they're big, they're growing, they're profitable, and their valuation is far more reasonable than Athenahealth. They're still high though. Yeah, it's still high for the space. You have to look at this as a technology company, not an insurer or drug maker which will have relatively low valuations. Other parts of healthcare will see P/E ratios in the 10 to 20 range fairly commonly, but you have to look at this almost like it's a software company where you can really get valuations that go in the forward P/Es of 30s. Yeah. That's a good point. You can't talk about Cerner without talking about the Department of Defense contract. I remember having discussions about this contract in 2014 here on Industry Focus and chatting a lot about who would be the big winner. What you've essentially got here is the Department of Defense with a massive job in caring for all the people that receive healthcare because of their service.You've got 55 hospitals, 100s of clinics, plus you have all of these former service men and women who are getting civilian care. Trying to get all of those records together to communicate has been a nightmare. You've got legacy old systems that have been patched here, patched there, tried to be connected, and nothing is talking together.The DOD finally said \"Let's scrap this and start over. Let's do a major modernization effort and get it the way it should be. Initially, when this was first talked about -- to put this into perspective you're talking about a 10 year contract that could be worth as much as $10 billion. That's massive. It's actually larger than the amount of spending that will be spent on healthcare IT without it in any given year.This is a big deal and a lot of people wanted this contract, but the ones who came out on top were Cerner, and then a partnership that orchestrated with  -- which is another name that The Fool happens to talk about and like -- and another prime contractor by the name of Lidos. They're a spin-off, but a big player in government contracts.They won this contract for the first two years, it's a $4 billion contract initially, but if they continue to do well and win the contract extensions this could be worth up to $11 billion possibly. Who knows with government contracts? They tend to grow, not shrink. One of the interesting parts about this story, I think, is how fierce this competition was and what it did to that estimation. Originally, this was an $11 billion contract, and I'm seeing estimates that have now dropped down to $9 billion. That is the effect of competition.You had Epic teaming up with  . Talk about a powerhouse. You had another power team of AllScripts with  and  . A lot of big guys were fighting for this contract so the fact that Cerner was able to pick it up is a huge deal, and it's certainly part of the investing thesis for the company. Everybody wanted a piece of it, and we have to remember as investors that this contract is big. It could be $9 billion, it could grow. They're saying $9 billion now, but they said $11 billion last year. Let's call it $10 billion. As an investor, you have to remember that not all that money is going to go to Cerner. It's split among the three companies that big on it.Regardless, this is a needle moving deal. It should certainly help earnings over the course of the next two year at least -- conceivably much further beyond that. Exactly. Before we wrap up, I want to ask you: Between the two companies that we've talked about today -- Athena Health and Cerner -- which one would you want to add to your portfolio today? Personally, it's Cerner. If I have to pick one, it's Cerner because you've got a company that's growing as quickly, or quicker than Athena that is profitable, and has a lower valuation. Athena has a monstrous short position. It's probably best suited only for the aggressive investors. I like it, but of the two, I like Cerner more. You bring up a good point. Different companies are suited better for different people. As always, you want to do your own research. Todd and I could have interests in the stocks we talk about. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy. The Motley Fool could have formal recommendations for or against these companies.Long story short, don't buy or sell based solely on what you've heard today. Hopefully, this provides some good information about a really exciting space within healthcare. Go forward with that. Do some research, dig in, and definitely keep your eyes on these stories that are developing because this is the future of healthcare.

Source: Cerner CorporationGood news came to  last week in the form of a big Department of Defense contract. The major health information technology company announced its second-quarter results after the market closed on Tuesday. Was there more good news?On the revenue front, the news wasn't very positive. Cerner posted second-quarter revenue of $1.126 billion, a solid 32% jump over the same period last year. However, the figure fell short of the company's guidance and the consensus analysts' estimate of $1.2 billion.Earnings looked much better, though. Cerner announced adjusted earnings of $183.0 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. That represented a 30% year-over-year increase. It also was right in line with Wall Street's expectations.The company reported operating cash flow for the second quarter of $108.7 million. However, Cerner also posted negative free cash flow of $46 million. This negative amount stemmed mainly from payouts related to a voluntary separation plan in the second quarter.Cerner didn't provide details in its initial announcement about reasons why revenue didn't meet expectations. However, it seems safe to conclude that there could have been an impact from the timing of deals. The company had all-time high bookings of $1.29 billion during the second quarter -- 20% greater than the same quarter in 2014. Also, Cerner's backlog during the quarter was $13.3 billion, which is 37% higher year over year.The bottom line wasn't affected as badly by the revenue miss, though, because Cerner kept expenses under control. On a GAAP basis, earnings were down in the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago. However, the aforementioned voluntary separation plan combined with acquisition expenses and stock-based compensation expenses helped boost the adjusted earnings upward.Investors weren't pleased with the lower-than-expected revenue and in-line earnings. Cerner's shares fell 4% in early after-hours trading. Shareholders found even more to dislike with Cerner's updated guidance. The company expects third-quarter revenue to come in between$1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, less than the consensus analysts' projection of $1.22 billion. Cerner anticipates third-quarter adjusted earningsbetween $0.54 and $0.55. Wall Street expects adjusted earnings of $0.55 per share.For the full year, Cerner now thinks that revenue will be between $4.475 billion and $4.575 billion. That range is well below the previous full-year revenue guidance of $4.65 billion to $4.8 billion. It's also less than analysts' estimate of $4.72 billion.There was one bright spot, though. Cerner bumped up its lower end of guidance for full-year earnings from $2.07 to $2.09 per share. The company maintained the upper end of the range at $2.15 per share. Wall Street thinks Cerner should post full-year adjusted earnings of $2.12 per share.Cerner's relatively pricey valuation makes it susceptible to taking a beating whenever a quarter doesn't go as well as expected. Investors still have good news to cling to, though. Cerner remains a dominant player in the health technology space. Landing part of the multibillion-dollar DOD contract was nice. There's still plenty for investors with a long-term perspective to like about Cerner.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"... But you'll probably just call it \"how I made my millions.\" Don't be too late to the party --  when the Web goes dark.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC.

The revenue figure also fell below management's guided range of $1.18 billion to $1.23 billion.Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) advanced almost 30% on a year-over-year basis driven by 32.2% growth in revenues. However, on a reported basis, earnings declined 10.8% year over year to 33 cents in the quarter.Core Cerner revenues were $866 million, while Siemens Health Services contributed $260 million. The revenue miss in the quarter can be primarily attributed to lower services revenues (year-over-year decline in third-party services and limited hiring) and higher number of long-term booking contracts. Reimbursed travel revenues plunged 37.8% to $18.1 million in the quarter.Meanwhile, system sales increased 34.3% year over year to $315.1 million, supported by strong growth in subscriptions on higher recurring revenue from Siemens Health Services and licensed software. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 30% year over year backed by higher contribution from Health Services as well as growth in core Cerner managed services.Support, maintenance and service revenues improved 34.8% to $792.8 million, riding on strong growth in core support and maintenance along with higher contribution from Health Services.Bookings increased 20% year over year to an all-time high of $1.29 billion. Backlog surged 37% from the year-ago quarter to $13.3 billion. Bookings included 38 large contracts worth over $5 million, of which 23 deals were valued at over $10 million. Long-term bookings comprised 35% of total bookings in the quarter.Cerner noted that 34% of the bookings came from customers who are not Millennium users, reflecting the company's improving competitiveness and a market that presents growth opportunities through product replacements.Domestic revenues increased 30% year over year to $995 million, while international revenues surged 54% to $131 million. The rise in international revenues was primarily supported by higher Health Services revenues.Gross margin expanded 200 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 82.9%, primarily owing to favorable business mix.Sales & client service and Software development expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased 90 bps each on a year-over-year basis. Also, general and administrative expenses rose 570 bps to 12%.As of Jul 4, 2015, Cerner had cash and cash equivalents (including short-term and long-term investments) of $856.6 million, which decreased from $888.7 million as of Apr 4, 2015, due to negative free cash flow.In the second quarter of 2015, free cash outflow stood at $46 million primarily due to lower operating cash flow, which totaled $109 million, from $214 recorded in the first quarter. The decline resulted from expenses related to voluntary separation plans and lower collections owing to delayed billings.For the third quarter of 2015, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion. The mid-point of the guided range reflects 40% year-over-year growth. The company also projects new business bookings between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion.Adjusted EPS (before share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments) is expected in the range of 54 cents to 55 cents. At mid-point, this reflects 30% growth on a year-over-year basis. Share-based compensation expense is expected to impact EPS by roughly 3-4 cents in the third quarter.Cerner slashed its full-year 2015 revenues guidance range to $4.475--$4.575 billion from $4.65--$4.8 billion. At mid-point, this reflects 33% growth on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted EPS is now forecasted in the $2.09 to $2.15 range as compared to the earlier band of $2.07-$2.15. At mid-point, this reflects 28% growth on a year-over-year basis. Share-based compensation expense is expected to impact EPS by roughly 14-15 cents in 2015.Management expects combined operating margin to be close to the 2014 level, better than the original expectation of over 200 bps of decline.We believe Cerner's strong product portfolio will help it to win customers in the rest of 2015 and beyond. The recent contract wins from Catholic Health Initiatives, University of Missouri (MU) and Baptist Health South Florida reflect growing traction.Cerner is the core EHR supplier in the consortium that recently won the Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) project. The group, led by Leidos Holdings  , has notable companies like Accenture  , Henry Schein  and Intermountain Healthcare on board. The deal will significantly help Cerner to expand its footprint going forward.Moreover, Cerner has growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory market based on its product strength and enviable track record.

Cerner is one of America's largest providers of software solutions to healthcare providers, and demand for its products has swelled in the past few years as healthcare reform has taken a carrot and stick approach to advancing the use of healthcare IT.However, Cerner appears to have hit a speed bump in the second quarter given that its $1.12 billion in sales, which was up 31.5% year over year, was below the company's prior guidance for at least $1.17 billion in sales and fell $80 million short of analyst projections. This marked a second consecutive quarter where Cerner's top line was shy of its forecast.On the bright side, Cerner did report EPS of $0.52 in the second quarter, up 30% from a year ago, which was in line with what investors were looking for. Cerner's ability to offset the impact of its sales shortfall on the bottom line is encouraging -- especially in light of the fact that Cerner's backlog has swelled 37% to $13.3 billion in the past year. If Cerner can keep a lid on its costs, it could translate into bigger profit as this backlog is worked through.Looking forward, demand for Cerner's solutions should remain strong because healthcare providers are increasingly adopting software solutions to track, evaluate, and report on patient health. Additionally, Cerner should also benefit from revenue opportunities tied to providers switching from prior generation solutions that are becoming obsolete.Regardless, investors will want to keep an eye on Cerner's sales progress over the coming year to make sure that its recent revenue shortfalls aren't the start of a longer lasting trend.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

By a similar token, and before Obamacare was put into effect, a 2012 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey found that a mere 15% of physicians were happy with the U.S. healthcare system.Yet ask those same consumers who don't particularly care for Obamacare as a whole whether or not they like their own health insurance plan, and their frown probably gets turned upside down. A Gallup poll released in November suggests that 70% of respondents are happy with their health insurance plan. In fact, poll any group of Americans and you'll find that a vast majority will state that they need health insurance and access to medical care.Any way you look at it, improving our healthcare system is clearly an important issue.The good news is a technological and innovative revolution is currently under way within the healthcare sector which looks to completely change the way we interact with our doctors, receive diagnoses, and ultimately get treatment.Slowly dwindling away are the one-size-fits-all physician-patient relationships that have persisted for decades. Instead, we're now witnessing technology and medical innovation individualizing treatments for patients, and allowing physicians access to patient data in a more efficient manner than ever before.The way I view it, there are three major ways that personalized medicine is set to completely transform your life.Source: National Cancer Institute via Facebook One of the biggest challenges for physicians is getting their patients to open up and be honest about their health history. Conversely, the biggest challenge a patient might face is merely getting their doctor's time and attention. The latest survey from the Association of American Medical Colleges predicts that there will be a shortage of as much as 90,000 physicians by 2025. Thus, time is becoming an increasingly scarce commodity for our nation's doctors.Personalized technology may be the solution to alleviating some, if not most, of these concerns.The rise of wearable technology holds the potential to be a major step forward in health maintenance. We tell our doctors we exercise daily, eat right, sleep well, and are keeping up on whatever health measurements we should be following (e.g., blood glucose levels for diabetics). Yet when push comes to shove we probably don't have this data handy to share with our physician. It makes a proper diagnosis or even disease treatment maintenance tough on our doctors.Source: AppleHowever, wearable devices such as the  Watch and its health applications (which are found on its smartphones) could give our physicians critical insights into our true health. Apple's HealthKit service, with your permission, can interact with other apps that you use to track your fitness and health data and aggregate that data within Apple's Health app. This health data vault can be shared with your physician, potentially before your visit, to help expedite and narrow any potential diagnosis and treatment. There's still some work to be done, as Apple's Health app isn't compatible with a handful of major fitness tracking apps currently in use, but it's showing incredible promise.Telemedicine is a second way personalized medicine is taking shape and transforming your relationship with your primary care physician, or PCP. Routine visits and checkups may be able to be performed from home on a video conference. In fact, a survey of businesses from  and the National Business Group in 2015 found that 52% planned to introduce telemedicine as an option for their employees, up from 28% in 2014. Overall, telemedicine could lead to quicker diagnoses and reduce congestion at hospitals and the doctor's office.Finally, adaptive cloud-based software from companies such as  are being developed and implemented in hospitals and doctor's offices to make your visit more efficient. Everything from payroll, billing services, scheduling of patients and staff, product reordering, and data analytics can be run through these cloud-based programs. And since they're in the cloud, your PCP has access to them from anywhere on any device. But it's not just how you and your doctor interact that's going to change. It's how you're diagnosed, too.Advancements in life sciences and in diagnostic tests have allowed researchers to hone on specific biomarkers that could increase your risk for certain diseases, or signify the presence of a disease.Source: Exact Sciences via FacebookOne example is the approval last year of  ' noninvasive DNA-based colon cancer screening test known as Cologuard. Cologuard allows a patient to mail a stool sample to ExactSciences headquarters, where its highly specific technology analyzes the sample for any DNA abnormalities.Specifically, Cologuard examines cells shed from the intestinal wall. Cancerous and advanced adenoma cells have an abnormal DNA structure, signaling to the patient that it's time to get a colonoscopy. The test isn't perfect, but at a cancer-positive sensitivity of 92% and with a 42% success rate in identifying advanced adenomas, or polyps, it was a marked improvement over the prior noninvasive test on the market.NextSeq 550. Source: IlluminaAdditionally, life sciences companies such as  and its HiSeq and MiSeq platforms allow for the rapid analysis of the human genome. What once took weeks and cost upwards of $50 million can now be done in about a day and costs closer to $1,000. These efficiencies may make it almost practical for the majority of the population to one day get their genome mapped in order to identify and monitor high-risk health factors. Lastly, your PCP will be able to tie in his or her more intricate involvement with your health history and diagnosis history by prescribing therapies or medical devices geared toward an individual's needs.For instance,  developed a variant of its BRACAnalysis test for identifying the BRCA 1 or 2 genes, which are known to increase a woman's chances of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Known as BRACAnalysis CDx, this test analyzes a patient for genetic variants that would qualify a patient to take Lynparza, a cancer drug geared toward patients with defective BRCA genes.Currently the list of companion diagnostic tests that correspond with specific targeted therapies is fairly short -- less than two dozen therapies. However, this list is expected to explode in size as the technology behind genome identification and the drug development process itself become more refined.Source: National Cancer Institute via FacebookOf course, we can't talk about targeted therapies without mentioning the work biopharmaceutical companies have done with immunotherapy vaccines. By harvesting some of a patient's white blood cells and \"retraining\" them to identify cancer cells, researchers and vaccines developers have had modest to fantastic success in improving the cancer-killing response in patients and in reigniting patients' immune systems.

Core Cerner revenues were $820 million, while the recently-acquired Siemens Health Services contributed $176 million.However, revenues missed management's guided range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. The miss can be primarily attributed to higher number of long-term booking contracts. Revenues were also affected by a $12.5 million adjustment to earnings for deferred revenue at the Health services business.System sales increased 25.6% year over year to $259.5 million, supported by strong growth in subscriptions. Support, maintenance and services revenues escalated roughly 29% to $718.4 million, riding on strong growth in core support and maintenance along with the addition of Health services. Reimbursed travel revenues, however, dipped 12.1% to $18.2 million in the quarter.Bookings surged 32% year over year to an all-time high of $1.20 billion. Backlog soared 41% to $13 billion. Bookings included 24 large contracts worth over $5 million, of which 19 deals were valued over $10 million.Domestic revenues increased 25% year over year to $871 million, while international revenues surged 44% to $126 million. The rise in international revenues was primarily supported by higher Health services revenues.Gross margin contracted 40 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 83.1%, primarily owing to low tech resale margin in comparison to the year-ago quarter. Lower gross margin at the Health services segment also affected the gross margin.Sales and client service expenses, as a percentage of revenues, remained flat on a year-over-year basis at 42.2%. Software development expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased 110 bps to 12.8%. Also, general and administrative expenses increased 440 bps to 11.4%.Operating earnings (including stock based compensation) contracted 590 bps on a year-over-year basis to 16.8%, primarily owing to lower revenues and higher expenses.As of Apr 4, 2015, Cerner had cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments) of $684.2 million, which decreased from $1.42 billion as of Jan 3, 2015, due to the $1.37 billion acquisition of Siemens Health Services. At the end of the first quarter, total long-term debt and capital lease obligations (including current installments) increased significantly to $626.2 million from $130.3 million reported at the end of fourth-quarter 2014.In the first quarter of 2015, free cash flow was $68.9 million, down from $100.2 million generated in the previous quarter, but up from $41.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Cerner expects to continue generating strong free cash flow in 2015.However, free cash flow will be impacted by the Voluntary Separation Plan (VSP) for some of its employee that ends later this month. Management expects to a report a charge of $35 million net of tax related to this transaction.For the second quarter of 2015, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.18 billion and $1.23 billion. The mid-point of the guided range reflects 41% year-over-year growth. The company also projects new business bookings between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion.Adjusted EPS (before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments) is expected in the range of 51 cents to 52 cents. At mid-point, this reflects 29% growth on a year-over-year basis. Share-based compensation expense is expected to impact EPS by roughly 3-4 cents in the second quarter.Cerner slashed its full-year 2015 revenues guidance range to $4.65--$4.8 billion from $4.8--$5 billion. The revision was made due to lower revenues in the first quarter as well as reduced expectation from the Siemens Health Services business.Adjusted EPS is now forecasted in the $2.07 to $2.15 range as compared to the earlier band of $2.05-$2.15. At mid-point, this reflects 28% growth on a year-over-year basis. Share-based compensation expense is expected to impact EPS by roughly 14-16 cents in 2015.Management expects combined operating margin to decrease approximately 100 bps to 150 bps for the year, better than the original expectation of over 200 bps of decline due to the addition of Health services.We are impressed with Cerner's strong bookings in the first quarter. The company is well positioned for growth in 2015 and beyond, banking on a strong pipeline and new business opportunities.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which puts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may further affect margins. Meanwhile, stringent hospital budgets exert further pressure on pricing.Currently, Cerner carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the medical information systems industry include Foundation Medicine  , Merge Healthcare  and Medidata Solutions  . All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The newly inked deal is expected to expand their joint research in the field of electronic medical records (EMR).In 2009, the two had jointly established their brainchild - Tiger Institute for Health Innovation. It was primarily formed with an aim to benefit the health system through better information technology and innovation.Through the new initiative, the institute will look to redefine patient engagement through mobile health care. It plans to develop an extensive population health strategy and network for MU Health Care to provide cost-efficient services.The collaboration has previously helped MU Health Care to figure in the top 2 percent of health systems nationally ranked by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS). In the course of its partnership with Cerner, MU Health Care has managed to clinch several noteworthy recognitions in its sphere.Since its inception, the Tiger Institute has remained focused on bringing innovation to the table. The institute's recent developments comprise an e-visit technology, integrating calculators into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and developing a consumer facing mental health app. Early in 2015, the team rolled out OpenNotes, a function that gives patients access to their clinic notes through the MU Healthe patient portal.We note that of late, Cerner has been rather active on the partnership front. In April 2015, the company inked a strategic partnership with Geisinger and xG Health Solutions to enable SMART on FHIR EHR Apps. Cerner also collaborated with Qualcomm Life, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc.  , to extend the scope of its medical device connectivity expertise, from hospitals to the home space.We believe a string of new contracts and the renewal of existing ones will aid Cerner to gain better market traction and generate better top-line growth, going forward.Currently, Cerner has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other well-placed medical stocks at the moment include AMN Healthcare Services  and Cancer Genetics  . Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include the  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Over the last couple of years, the very mention of the word \"apple\" first draws up a sleek, white, bitten-off reflection of the fruit rather than the red and juicy illustration of it. That's precisely how popular the company  (  ) has grown to be.Planted way back in 1976, Apple has revolutionized the way the world looks at computing. Today, this consumer electronics company is set to alter the face of the healthcare industry with its latest fruit - the Apple Watch - ripe to be plucked.Apple's smartwatch, announced in Sep 2014 and made available for pre-order on Apr 10, 2015, is already anticipated to be seen on more than 2.3 million wrists, once shipping begins on Apr 24. Interestingly, this translates to more sales than that recorded by all Android smartwatch manufacturers in 2014.Until now, the smartwatch was seen as a niche product appealing only to hardcore tech users and calorie-counting fitness buffs. However, thanks in large part to the positive reception of the Apple Watch, one can be sure that the company's latest device will make smartwatches mainstream.As this technology becomes more commonplace in the world of consumer electronics, it will also make inroads into the medical world, where it has a lot to offer.Healthcare, often viewed as an industry that is slow to adopt the latest technology, is actually standing on the threshold of transformative change. Currently valued at $2.9 trillion, the U.S. healthcare industry is more concerned than ever about monitoring a patient's health outside the walls of the hospital through intelligently connected devices.A number of technology companies are releasing wearable devices that can double as health trackers. From headsets that measure brainwaves to clothes that incorporate sensing devices to smartwatches that allow fitness tracking, personal health monitoring is the wave of the future.In the medical world, where pagers and landline phones are still widely used by doctors to coordinate care, an effective wrist-based communication tool allows for continuous monitoring of a patient's health. The use of smartwatches in healthcare communication, in particular, has the potential to improve the speed and quality of care delivery.While the monitoring of activity, sleep cycles, pulse rate and other physiological parameters has become state of the art in today's smartwatches, the latest devices have a dozen other applications that can not only help people to keep fit, but in extreme cases to stay alive.Specific applications designed for select groups like heart patients, diabetic patients and epileptic patients can actually be used by doctors to continuously track the patient's health vitals, flagging clinicians when signs fall below normal, thus allowing them to adjust treatments accordingly and deliver better patient outcomes.Apple Watch, which pairs with the users' iPhones via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, is being endorsed as a comprehensive health and fitness device. While it allows users to send and receive text messages, speak into the phone to search content and answer calls, health monitoring is actually believed to be a major feature of the watch.From collecting data in new ways to helping hospitals reduce costly emergency room visits, the potential of Apple's smartwatch in healthcare is something that cannot be ignored.Although reception to smart watches from device makers like Samsung and Sony has been tepid, healthcare companies are not the ones to dismiss a new offering from Apple as it brings with it a new level of technological power, not to mention brand appeal.To tap the power of Apple's latest device, a number of healthcare companies are seen developing and announcing a plethora of medical apps for the Apple Watch platform. We believe that Apple will, in fact, need the support of these app developers, health care companies and medical technology companies to create the functions to give people a reason to want to wear a computer around their wrist all the time.By way of this rationale, as the Apple Watch begins to shine on people's wrists, it will throw some spotlight on the healthcare industry as a whole.As healthcare stands to greatly benefit from the adoption of smartwatches, we feel the time is ripe for investors to enter the arena and ride the approaching wave of growth.Several health and health care companies came out to show off their new Apple Watch apps at the 2015 Healthcare Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) conference held at Chicago this month. While all the apps need to prove their worth in order to reserve a spot on the tiny wrist-based screen, we believe that the Apple Watch apps of the following three companies stand a good chance to do so.A favorable Zacks Rank and an impressive Growth Score (for explanation, please see our  ) lend additional credence to the growth prospects of these companies: (  )Developer of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, DexCom has made its G4 PLATINUM CGM System with Share app available on the Apple Watch.Being among the first in the category to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, DexCom's app will allow diabetic patients to track their blood glucose statistics right from their wrist. The app will also allow them to share this information with caregivers, parents, doctors, or other authorized individuals and send an alert when the glucose levels are beyond the normal range.Flaunting a Growth Score of 'A,' DexCom has seen solid activity on the earnings estimate revision front as well, suggesting that analysts are gaining more confidence on its prospects in both the short and the long term. Over the past 60 days, estimates for the current year have doubled from a penny to 2 cents a share, while for the next year it has improved 9.5% to 46 cents a share.Currently, DexCom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). (  )One of the leading providers of cloud-based services and electronic health records (EHR) for hospitals and clinics, athenahealth introduced a new care coordination and communication Apple Watch app - AthenaText.The app is designed to help providers quickly locate and communicate with other members of a patient's care team and support staff. The AthenaText app can sync care coordination activities and information across multiple devices so that the patient record is always up to date. Providers will also be able to refer a patient across town, request a peer consult, or ask for a specialist's recommendation. While the initial version of the app will provide read-only capabilities, athenahealth is expected to add interactive capabilities in June.Currently, athenahealth sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Growth Score of 'B'. Moreover, the firm has also been enjoying positive estimate revisions over the past month which has caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate to climb 4.5% to its current level of 23 cents a share for the current year and 2.2% to its current level of 46 cents per share for fiscal 2016. (  )Healthcare information technology company Cerner launched its patient engagement app - HealtheLife - on the Apple Watch.The app, designed with push notification reminders to track health data and a display dashboard for tracked metrics, will help patients manage their own health, thus building a healthier community. With patients' consent, the data will be sent directly to the Cerner Millennium EHR which will help providers focus on personalized patient care and population health management.Cerner's population health management and care coordination offerings are important growth catalysts for the company. We believe that an expansion of such services will enhance the company's visibility, which, in turn, will drive top-line growth.Moreover, it is worth mentioning that Cerner, holding a Zacks Rank #3 and a Growth Score of 'B,' has an expected long-term earnings growth of 17.3%, higher than the industry growth of 16.8%.Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings of 44 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Over the trailing four quarters, Cerner posted a positive average earnings surprise of 1.28%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.We believe that Cerner is well positioned for growth in 2015 and beyond, owing to a strong product pipeline and new business opportunities. Moreover, multiple industry recognitions earned recently will help the company gain significant market traction.Cerner's plan to expand its business via strategic collaborations will benefit its business scale greatly, in turn boosting its top-line prospects. In our view, the company's recent partnerships with the likes of Qualcomm  and Apple  are significantly accretive for the company's overall growth.Meanwhile, Cerner seems to be benefiting from the accelerated momentum among medical providers to comply with federal Electronic health Records (EHR) requirements. Further, its non-EHR offerings for the untapped Healthcare Information Technology (HCIT) market, such as population health management and care coordination, are considered important growth catalysts.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which puts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may affect margins.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cerner is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Cerner has an Earnings ESP of -2.38%. That's because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 41 cents a share, which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents per share. Cerner carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Mirati Therapeutics  with an Earnings ESP of +2.82% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Sirona Dental Systems  with an Earnings ESP of +7.90% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

From biotech stocks developing the next cancer drug to medical device makers attempting to perfect the next life-saving device, healthcare companies receive a good chunk of their valuation from Wall Street and investors based on the future sales potential of drugs, devices, or diagnostics in their product portfolio or pipeline, or the potential population they could eventually reach (e.g., insurers reaching out to the uninsured).Another major driver of healthcare valuations are what you might refer to as \"megatrends in healthcare,\" or macro drivers that are shaping investments and future growth within the sector. Right now, I'd suggest there are three megatrends in healthcare that are shaping its future and that investors should be paying close attention to. : The passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, in 2010 signaled a major change in the way consumers would sign up for health insurance and how health-benefits providers and doctors would eventually treat their patients. Although years went into planning the eventual implementation of the ACA for consumers on Jan. 1, 2014, that didn't mean merely the flip of a switch made everything good to go. Instead, nearly all areas of the healthcare industry are in an ongoing process of transition to meet the dynamic needs of healthcare reform.Arguably, insurers have had to be the most nimble of all, adjusting their strategies to attract consumers on a transparent marketplace exchange. Prior to Obamacare, it was difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons of health insurance premium pricing, but the implementation of marketplace exchanges has eliminated most of that confusion and made differentiation of their brand and healthcare plans a tough task for insurers.Source: Covered California. (previously WellPoint) has probably been the model which other insurers hold in the highest regard. Anthem enrolled the most new Obamacare enrollees in 2014, and it appears to have carried that success over into 2015. Per the  , through Jan. 15, 2015, Anthem had enrolled 29.1% of all enrollees on the Covered California exchange, or 353,635 people.But, it's not just insurers adapting. Hospitals have been scrambling to adapt as well by updating their systems to all-electronic platforms. Even more so, the uncertainties created by Obamacare's rollout in terms of costs have encouraged medical care providers to employ cloud-based resource management platforms.Source: Cerner, Facebook.Healthcare information technology juggernaut  has been at the forefront of this movement, optimizing training, data analysis, and revenue cycle management for hospitals, as well as leading the electronic health records charge. In its fourth-quarter results from February, it announced record quarterly bookings of $1.16 billion and a 16% increase in revenue to $926 million. In sum, IT-based healthcare companies are probably going to be busy for many years to come as Obamacare continues to evolve. Another megatrend in healthcare has been the ongoing push toward personalized medicine. Although we have one-size-fits-all preventative medicines, such as vaccines, \"one size fits all\" doesn't work with every disease.For example, one cancer medicine does not cure all types of cancer. Taking into account that everyone has their own unique genetic makeup, and that there are  different types of cancer, it's plausible to assume that no two cancer cases are alike. This is where personalized diagnostic equipment and specialized cancer-focused drugs could come in handy.Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Facebook.On the diagnostic front,  is making significant strides to help people better understand their risk factors for developing cancer, as well as providing critical diagnostic testing to help qualify patients for specific cancer treatments.For years, Myriad's BRACAnalysis test has helped patients decipher whether or not they carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Both mutations have been shown to come with a higher risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer for women. A positive reading for the BRCA mutations was the primary reason Angelina Jolie underwent a preventative double mastectomy in 2013.In Dec. 2014, Myriad also received approval as a companion diagnostic test for  's advanced ovarian cancer drug Lynparza. Similar to its predecessor test, BRACAnalysis CDx tests for germline mutations in BRCA1/2, qualifying the patient for Lynparza if they've progressed on three or more lines of chemotherapy.Among cancer drugs,  ' Zykadia is a perfect example of specialized care coming to the forefront.Source: Novartis.Approved in April 2014 in the United States as a treatment for late-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Novartis' Zykadia specifically targets the anaplastic lymphoma kinase receptor, or ALK-positive NSCLC patients. While NSCLC comprises 85% of all lung cancer cases, ALK-positive NSCLC amounts to just 2% to 7% of all NSCLC cancers. This is a very specialized treatment for patients with this mutation that in clinical trials shrank the tumors of about half of all patients tested and had a duration of response of roughly seven months.In the coming years, expect to see diagnostic device makers, drug makers, and even device makers working together to make treatment for all serious diseases, not just cancer, more personalized.Finally, a more recent megatrend in healthcare has been consolidation -- although the reasons behind the need to merge or buy out other businesses have varied.Arguably the less popular but still pronounced reason for healthcare consolidation has been corporate tax inversion. Within the United States, corporate marginal tax rates can fly as high as 40%, the second-highest corporate marginal tax rate in the world, behind only the UAE. The simple solution for U.S. businesses is to purchase a similarly sized business in an overseas market and relocate their headquarters overseas to a lower corporate tax environment.Source: Medtronic.A good example here is medical device kingpin  buying Covidien for $42.9 billion in cash and stock, and then relocating its headquarters from the U.S. to Covidien's home country of Ireland when the deal was done. Ireland's highest corporate marginal tax rate is a mere 12.5%, saving Medtronic potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. For a company growing by low- to mid-single-digits, this could lead to a major boost in shareholder value.However, the more popular reason for healthcare consolidation could be to mask a lack of organic growth. Big pharmaceutical stocks, for instance, are struggling under the weight of patent losses, which are exposing blockbuster drugs to cheaply priced generic competition. A vast majority of pharmaceuticals have been unable to replace their lost revenue quickly enough, resulting in falling revenue and generally stagnant EPS growth.Source: Lipitor, Facebook.This is why we've witnessed  , which has lost patent protection on the best-selling drug of all time, Lipitor, be so hungry for acquisitions. Last year, Pfizer pursued AstraZeneca to no avail (partly for its tax inversion potential), but wound up announcing the acquisition of Hospira in early February for $90 in cash per share, or close to $17 billion in enterprise value. Hospira's injectable drugs coupled with its growing biosimilars portfolio gives Pfizer instant access to accretive earnings growth potential and helps alleviate some of the $18 billion in revenue that's disappeared since 2010 because of patent losses.I'm sure more megatrends in healthcare will emerge over time, but for now, I believe these three megatrends will be largely responsible for value creation and innovation within the healthcare sector throughout the remainder of the decade.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich.

In our view, the company's recent partnerships with the likes of Qualcomm  and Apple  are significantly accretive for the company's overall growth.Cerner's latest collaboration with Geisinger Health System and xG Health Solutions, is aimed at initiating the use of emerging SMART on FHIR industry standards for hassle-free use of software applications across compliant open platform electronic health record (EHR) systems like Cerner Millennium.Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technology (SMART) on FIHR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is essentially an approach which enables plug-in apps to run smoothly on any compliant EHR system.With the help of SMART on FHIR, physicians will be able to use the apps in a streamlined manner on EHR systems. In order to eradicate disconnected workflows, Cerner has facilitated smooth unification of xG Health apps into the Cerner Millennium open platform.The EnrG | Rheum app, which is the first of a series of xG Health EnrG apps, gathers information about a patient from various sources and then presents it in a way which helps provide better health care at low cost.The EnrG | Rheum software was used at two sites and reportedly it helped ramp up 26% increase in productivity, on the back of lower chart review and documentation time. xG Health is expected to launch EnrG | Rheum this summer. It will be made available through Cerner Store and other channels.The demand for improved and robust interoperability expertise is gradually on the rise. This validates Cerner's latest collaboration as an important step toward the advancement of the overall quality of health care.Cerner's partnership with Qualcomm Life, a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc., seeks to extend the scope of its medical device connectivity expertise, from hospitals to the home space.Meanwhile, the company's strategic alliance with Apple intends to make available its patient engagement app, HealtheLife, on Apple Watch.

Reportedly, the 'Aging in Place' program will use health monitoring devices and offer special attention from health professionals to help older adults avoid unnecessary re-hospitalization and excess burden of costs.Cerner's patient engagement solution - HealtheLife - will be used in this program to provide better access to patient's health information. The participants will also be able to track data from the patient monitoring devices.This will, in turn, help detect small medical problems among older patients before they aggravate further. North Kansas City Hospital is looking to develop a case management program for monitoring and assisting participants with their transition.We feel this program will bode well for Cerner's HealtheLife patient engagement solution, given that an estimated 77 million senior adults in the U.S. are expected to transition into retirement over the next 25 years.We believe increasing healthcare requirements of this baby boomer market presents significant growth opportunity for Cerner.

Healthcare providers will take the driver's seat as the benefit of digital systems increases their demand. However, healthcare providers have also become more price sensitive when negotiating HCIT contracts. Well-positioned companies (those who focus on large hospital systems and interoperable solutions) will grow at a 6-12% CAGR through 2017.\u00b7  Changing government specifications will significantly increase costs for HCIT companies as they rework products to meet new requirements.\u00b7  Security breaches could create patient mistrust of the system, reducing demand for HCIT solutions and increasing costs for the industry.The HCIT industry includes companies specializing in software development, technology consulting, medical device integration, records maintenance, and revenue cycle management. The industry had revenues of $35 billion in 2013, low market share concentration, and it was the beneficiary of increasing government regulation since 2004. 3 Companies compete by selling software products and winning long-term service contracts.The HCIT industry is widely regarded as a growth industry, which has benefited significantly from government regulation. Companies who specialize in providing electronic medical record services for doctors and medical facilities saw the largest gains, as this was the goal set out by legislators. While most of the growth has occurred in the United States due to the transitioning health care system, opportunities also exists internationally. 1With many health care providers meeting the first benchmark established by the HITECH Act, HCIT companies transitioned to meeting the second benchmark, improving care by using EMRs established in Stage 1. This transition will shift revenues from software sales to systems management and maintenance. This is because healthcare providers have already adopted EMR software, and HCIT companies will have to provide new services to generate secondary revenue streams. For many companies, this secondary revenue stream is built in to their contracts through maintenance and services. For others, secondary revenues will come from the additional products they market to existing customers.Companies compete in this industry in several ways. First, some companies benefit from working with health care providers of a specific size. For instance, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. (  ) made gains in market share by working primarily with small and mid-sized medical practices. In contrast, Epic Systems Corporation gained the largest market share by focusing on large health care organizations and academic medical centers. Companies also compete through their product offerings, where successful companies tailor their software to the needs of clients.The key topic discussed throughout this report is government regulation. This trend started with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, specifically the provision titled the HITECH Act. The Federal government established this policy to promote the use of EMRs in the United States' health provider system. The ultimate goal was to create a universal electronic health record (EHR) system. The universal EHR system would enable health care providers to access a database of EMRs not only from their system, but also from organizations across the country.The HITECH Act is characterized by three stages, which healthcare providers are required to meet. The chart below lists the requirement timeline for healthcare providers based on when they initiated the process. The numbers in the middle identify which stage a company should be in. For instance, a provider who started the process in 2011 should be in Stage 3 by 2016.According to the  Stage 1 involves adopting EMRs and using them in ways that positively affect patient care. 4 For attesting to Stage 1, providers can receive Medicare incentives up to $43,720 spread over five years and Medicaid incentives up to $63,750 spread over six years. Additionally, eligible providers who choose not to participate face Medicare payment reductions of 1% per year (up to a maximum of 5% annual adjustment) beginning in 2015. Many healthcare providers initially focused on meeting Stage 1 goals, which represented the first wave of industry demand. However, it is the second wave of demand that will drive the HCIT industry forward.Stages 2 and 3 represent the second wave of demand, and it is characterized by the focus on interoperable systems. Stage 2 meaningful use involves increasing the amount of digitally available data and using secure electronic communication between doctors, labs, and pharmacies. Healthcare providers have until 2016 to meet Stage 2 requirements. The transition to Stage 2 will result in software sales below those recognized during Stage 1. As a result, companies will need to sell new products to their customers. Cerner (  ) is a company who has made this transition. Their revenue cycle management product is offsetting slowing software sales, and it generates reoccurring revenues, unlike the software sales in Stage 1.Stage 3 meaningful use is focused on improving  5 The deadline for early adopters to attest to Stage 3 is 2017. Companies who invested early in patient-friendly products will benefit most from Stage 3. Companies who have a proven track record in data security will also benefit from the transition to Stage 3.As of December 2014, almost 89% of hospitals and 63% of physicians attested to Stage 1 meaningful use requirements, signaling an industry shift to Stage 2. The December 2014 data also reported that 55% of required hospitals and 8% of physicians met Stage 2 requirements (physicians have until March 2015 to meet Stage 2.)The push to meet Stage 2, and eventually Stage 3, will benefit the HCIT industry because it puts pressure on providers to adopt new technologies. Stage 2 involves installing interoperable programs, which connect hospitals to improve communication of EMRs. Stage 3 will also benefit HCIT companies, because it requires providers to communicate medical information with patients through secure methods. One example of this is eClinicalWorks' Patient Portal, which gives patients access to their medical records and a means to communicate with their doctors. 6 As providers attest to Stage 3 requirements in 2017, expect the maturing industry to grow 5-6% annually.Companies that provide interoperable systems will see the strongest growth through 2017. However, only companies that can effectively sell their business efficiency products will see above-average growth beyond 2017.According to IBISWorld, \"Healthcare reform will likely lower industry prices and enforce reimbursement models that create powerful incentives for hospitals to form large systems of care\u2026 As a result of these changes, reform is expected to increase both the number and size of [hospital] mergers.\" 13 In 2014, there were 95 hospital mergers, which represents a 44% increase since 2010. This is in addition to the 105 deals reported in 2012 and 98 reported in 2013. 14 These mergers are a result of the increased efficiency of large hospital systems. This is important in the post-Affordable Care Act environment, where there is strong pressure to reduce healthcare costs. While the industry is still largely fragmented, the increased consolidation will create more and larger contracts for HCIT companies. Additionally, companies who hold contracts with the purchasing healthcare provider increase their market share because of a merger. Ultimately, this trend will lead to more consolidation in the HCIT industry.SaaS models involve providing clients with software solutions through a subscription system. Software is made available online, and updates are conducted through the cloud. SaaS is projected to account for 30% of industry revenue in 2014. 1 The resulting effect of SaaS on HCIT companies is a decline in revenues from maintenance services. Since providers are able to update their own software through the cloud, their demand for a HCIT company's support will decline. On the other hand, maintaining a cloud is an expensive endeavor, and the spending in cloud-based solutions is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 20.5% from 2012 to 2017. 3 The benefits of a SaaS and cloud system are widely recognized by healthcare providers, and the decline in software revenues from SaaS models will be offset by service revenues from cloud maintenance.The 2009 HITECH Act opened the field of competition in the healthcare technology industry. As healthcare providers work to meet the stage goals, they depend heavily on HCIT companies to provide solutions that meet government requirement, make their businesses more efficient, and improve their patient outcomes.In this market, companies vie for contracts through price, effectiveness of services, support, maintenance of systems, and the ability to tailor solutions to their client's needs. While some companies benefit from working with large or merging healthcare providers, as discussed above, others are able to grow by working with small to mid-sized providers. In doing so, they provide more tailored solutions for their clients.In general, the market concentration is low. While some companies hold a large share of a specific client type, few are able to provide solutions that meet the needs of all client segments. 1 Investing in research and development (R&D) and skilled programmers is very important in the industry. This enables HCIT companies to meet a client's specific need and provide new, differentiated software solutions. However, this also has a significant impact on their cost structures, so a fine balance must be achieved in this regard.Finally, as with many growing industries, the competition level is very high. As shown in the discussion of recent contract moves, the type of competition HCIT companies face is mostly within the industry. The availability of substitutes gives clients bargaining power, and the poor performance of an HCIT company's software or support could lead to the shift of an important contract.Epic is a privately owned company, headquartered in Verona, WI,that specializes in mid to large hospitals and integrated healthcare organizations. As such, the company focuses on providing enterprise-wide solutions for their clients. Epic leads its competitors with 97% of hospitals attesting to Stage 2 and is second in physician attestation at 26%. 15 Epic is well-positioned in the industry with an estimated 22% of market share. 1 In 2014, Epic made significant gains by winning new contracts at the expense of their competitors including McKesson, Cerner, and Allscripts. Epic focuses on many of the key industry drivers listed above. Specifically, they provide interoperable solutions and have a strong hold on the large hospital market. Epic has the best opportunity to increase their market share and they pose the largest threat to the industry's publicly traded companies.McKesson, located in San Francisco, CA, operates in two major segments. The first, McKesson Distribution Systems, focuses on the distribution of pharmaceuticals for biotech and pharmaceutical companies. The second segment, McKesson Technology Solutions, \"delivers enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, strategic management software solutions, as well as connectivity, outsourcing and other services, including remote hosting and managed services, to healthcare organization.\" 16 Their 2014 annual revenues were $137.6 billion, with $3.18 billion coming from the McKesson Technology Solutions segment. They also reported an operating margin of 1.2% and R&D expenses of $456 million in 2014. 16 Finally, MCK has a higher portion of debt compared to their peers, which will put them at a disadvantage if they wish to increase their market share through debt-financed acquisitions. McKesson's market share will not increase significantly, and I do not see them as a positive investment opportunity in this industry. Their strengths and efficiencies lie in their distribution business segment, which is a significantly different business model from the typical HCIT company.Cerner, headquartered in Kansas City, MO, provides HCIT solutions to healthcare providers of all sizes, including hospitals, ambulatory facilities, and small physician practices. The company provides cloud-based systems and statistical algorithms aimed at improving patient outcomes. They also provide software that improves billing cycle management, helping hospitals collect payments more effectively.  . 17 They accomplished this high margin due to their popular brand name, successful performance with large hospital systems, and comparatively large-scale operation. While CERN is able to compete for major contracts within the United States, it has also seen significant growth in the United Kingdom, Middle East, and Australia. Cerner is the best-positioned publicly traded company in the HCIT industry because they also focus on many of the drivers identified above. Cerner's low debt level enables them to finance any future acquisitions with debt, even though previous deals were financed with cash. CERN may be stuck at the number two position, because of the positive outlook for Epic, the current industry leader.CareFusion, located in San Diego, CA, focused on \"areas of medical management, infection prevention, operating room effectiveness, respiratory care, and surveillance and analytics.\" 18 CareFusion operates in a slightly different environment than Epic, Cerner, and McKesson by providing products that improve efficiency and medical performance, where their competitors look to provide enterprise-wide EMR solutions. CFN has a market share of 11% and revenues of $3.84 billion, and their operating margins are about 18%. 18 While CFN presents an appealing opportunity for growth based on their niche offering, the trends towards an enterprise-wide HCIT solution give their competitors a better long-term strategy. As hospitals merge, they will force their smaller components to adopt their HCIT system. This could decrease CareFusion's market share while strengthening their competitors'.The main growth factor in the HCIT industry is the HITECH Act and the increased focus on reducing healthcare costs. The incentives and penalties will continue to drive investment into IT solutions. When new software or system sale growth slows, HCIT companies will be needed to transition to a maintenance-based model.The other important growth catalyst is the trend towards reducing healthcare costs, while improving patient care. With the use of data analytics, increased communication among providers and patients, and ability to remotely diagnose and treat patients, the HCIT industry will help achieve both of these goals.\u00b7 The HCIT industry will continue to benefit from an increased awareness of healthcare costs in the United States. As pressure is applied to healthcare providers to become more efficient, they will seek HCIT companies to help improve their business model.\u00b7 The implementation of new IT solutions will generate immediate and long-term revenues for HCIT companies. As they transition from installing new systems to improving and maintaining those systems, they will continue to generate profits.\u00b7 As important as the HITECH Act was in spurring a growth opportunity in the HCIT industry, a change in legislation could significantly affect the industry. A change in the incentive/penalty policy would reduce the demand for some healthcare providers, changing the outlook for industry.\u00b7 Cloud storage is widely regarded as a more secure storage system than the previous, paper copy system used in hospitals. However, the threat of a data breach is very real; any significant events in this regard would cause Americans to reexamine the industry.In the coming years, there will be transition in the industry towards system improvement and maintenance. I expect current growth rates of 6-12% to continue until 2017, when many healthcare providers will meet Stage 3 requirements. Beyond 2017, growth rates to slow to around 6%.Companies that focus on large hospital systems, interoperable products, and improving additional revenue streams are best positioned to take advantage of industry trends. Companies like Epic and Cerner will increase their market share as hospitals merge and look to reduce costs. Epic and Cerner will grow closer to 12% per year through 2017, but even they will be subject to increasing pricing pressure and declining demand in the long-term. In 2018 and beyond, Epic and Cerner will slow to 6% annual growth.1. \"Electronic Medical Record Systems in the US\" IBISWorld. 2014.2. NCHS Data Brief, 2013:3.

Going forward, Intermountain plans to bring all acute care facilities, ambulatory clinics, affiliated practices and business offices live on iCentra in 2015 and 2016, by using a regional deployment strategy.Cerner and Intermountain had partnered in Sep 2013 with a shared vision to improve quality and make healthcare costs sustainable. A component of this multi-year partnership is to implement Cerner's electronic medical record and revenue cycle solutions across all of Intermountain's hospitals and clinics.We note that iCentra was implemented 15 months after Cerner and Intermountain announced their strategic partnership. With the intent of creating a truly integrated health care system, iCentra was developed by teams of Intermountain and Cerner associates, as well as input from 400 Intermountain physicians.As part of their multi-year strategic partnership, Cerner and Intermountain will continue to work with physicians, clinicians, and business teams to improve iCentra and enable future innovations.We note that Cerner is greatly benefiting from the accelerated momentum among medical providers to comply with federal EHR requirements. Further, the MEDTECH Act, which aims at reducing the FDA's regulatory supervision of the Medical IT, is also expected to benefit EHR vendors like Cerner.The lenient FDA regulation will help EHR vendors to commercialize innovative solutions at a much faster pace that will ultimately benefit their top line. Software upgrades will also turn out to be much easier and cost-effective.We believe that Cerner's non-EHR offerings for the untapped Healthcare Information Technology (HCIT) market, such as population health management and care coordination, are also important growth catalysts.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which puts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may further affect margins.Currently, Cerner carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company will also provide tools like computerized physician order entry to support DSHS' objective to improve patient safety.Apart from patient safety, one of DSHS' objectives in replacing the existing systems is to support the transition to ICD-10 compliance by Oct 1.ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) - a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). After several delays, the deadline for the implementation of the ICD-10 in the U.S. is set at Oct 1, 2015.In order to comply with the same, healthcare providers need to install new software, provide training for physicians, staff members, and administrators and also develop new practice policies and guidelines, and update paperwork and forms.We believe that the deal with Cerner is a result of the State of Washington government's strong initiatives for digitization in the health care industry and to eventually meet the ICD-10 deadline.We note that Cerner is greatly benefiting from the accelerated momentum among medical providers to comply with federal EHR requirements. Further, its non-EHR offerings for the untapped Healthcare Information Technology (HCIT) market, such as population health management and care coordination, are considered important growth catalysts in our view.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which puts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins.

Merge recently posted yet another weak quarter with revenues trailing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Fourth-quarter 2014 adjusted net income per share was 4 cents, a penny higher than the year-ago quarter. Total revenue in the reported quarter remained almost flat year over year at $53.6 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $55 million.Revenue loss over the past few quarters remains a major cause of concern. We remain wary about declining Medicare reimbursement for advanced medical imaging that could negatively affect hospital and imaging clinic revenues, thereby reducing demand for imaging-related software and services offered by Merge.Moreover, the company's growth prospect is highly dependent on capital investments by hospitals for advanced imaging solutions, which are in turn tied to general economic conditions. Per management, the tough capital spending environment in the hospital space was mainly to be blamed for the fourth-quarter debacle.Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the company's recent acquisition of DR Systems - a privately held San Diego-based company that provides medical imaging information systems, for a total of $70 million. Following this buyout, Merge Healthcare will be able to deploy its iConnect Network services, including pre-authorization services, to a broader client base of DR Systems.The transaction is expected to be accretive to Merge's non-GAAP adjusted EPS in 2015 and beyond. Merge expects this acquisition to expand the company's footprint in the medical imaging arena.Moreover, increase in the number of cardiology bookings and significant revenue growth from Merge's eCOS platform was the highlight of the fourth quarter. Significant increase in operating profit was another upside. According to management, the company will be able to achieve positive top-line growth in 2015.It is also commendable that despite the general slowdown in hospital spending, low demand for imaging equipment and related technology due to global credit crisis and macroeconomic factors, Merge witnessed client wins and bookings growth. We believe the company has immense potential in the diagnostic imaging market, especially with the government emphasis on Healthcare IT and demographic tailwind. We believe Merge is well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity over the long term.Merge currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors interested in the broader medical sector can also consider stocks like Cerner Corp.  , Cardiovascular Systems Inc.  and Hospira Inc.  .

The data will then be passed on to Cerner healthcare clients with the help of Cerner's CareAware device connectivity platform. This initiative is expected to help care providers monitor chronically ill patients in near real-time and reduce the risk of any aggravation.Qualcomm Life's 2net Platform is known for collecting and storing multiple patient data, obtained from connected medical devices. Cerner's CareAware will then transfer these data to the Cerner Millennium electronic health record (EHR) following which the patient will be able to view it on Cerner's patient engagement solution, HealtheLife. Agnesian HealthCare is the first enterprise client that will stand to benefit from the use of this combined technology.The initiative to extend Cerner's CareAware device connectivity platform to connect devices within the home to the patient's EHR will help health care organizations cut down the rate of hospital readmission and at the same time, deliver better satisfaction to patient within the comforts of his/her home.The collaboration will help Cerner's connectivity platform and patient engagement solution gain better visibility and consequently, larger adoption. This will, in turn, drive top-line growth for the company, going forward.Recently, Cerner recently announced that its patient engagement app - HealtheLife - will be available on Apple Watch. Apple Inc's  much anticipated device is set to hit stores on Apr 24.Cerner is expected to conduct initial deployments with clients this month to collect biometric values from the Apple Watch-compatible HealtheLife app, including weight, blood pressure and blood sugar values.

(Symbol: CERN) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $69.80/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $40 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 90 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.2% return against the $40 commitment, or a 1.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CERN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $40 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cerner Corp. sees its shares fall 42.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $39.10 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 90 cents from $40), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1.2% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cerner Corp., and highlighting in green where the $40 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $40 strike for the 1.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cerner Corp. (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $69.80) to be 20%.

On a year-over-year basis, EPS surged an impressive 158.8% driven by strong bookings and revenue growth.Revenues in the quarter grew 16.4% year over year to $926 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $19 million. The upside can be attributed to stronger revenues from system sales and services.System sales rose 14% year over year to $280.3 million, supported by strong growth in technology resale and software revenues. Support, maintenance and services revenues escalated 18.3% to $628.3 million, riding on strong growth in professional services, managed services and ITWorks.Reimbursed Travel revenues, however, dipped 5.3% to $17.5 million in the quarter.Bookings revenues grew 5% year over year to an all-time high of $1.16 billion. Cerner's bookings performance led to a 19% increase in total backlog to $10.6 billion. Total backlog comprised $9.79 billion in contract revenue backlog and $826 million in support and maintenance backlog.Booking margin in the fourth quarter was 85% of total bookings.Gross margin contracted 80 basis points (bps) year over year to 81.3%, primarily owing to higher level of tech resale and third-party services compared to the year-ago quarter.Sales and client service expenses, as a percentage of revenues, expanded 30 bps year over year to 40.5%, primarily driven by a continued increase in revenue generating associates in Cerner's services businesses.Software development expenses, as a percentage of revenues, remained almost flat with the year-ago level at 11.5%. General and administrative expenses declined 58% year over year to $66 million in the quarter under review.Operating earnings grew nearly 145% year over year to stand at $205.3 million, supported by reduced operating expenses.As of Jan 3, 2015, Cerner had cash and cash equivalents of $635.2 million, higher than $496.5 million as of Sep 27, 2014. Total long-term debt and capital lease obligations (including current installments) declined to $130.3 million from $146.8 million as of Sep 27, 2014.In the fourth quarter of 2014, free cash flow stood at $100.2 million, in stark contrast to a cash outflow of $41.7 million in the prior-year quarter. Cerner expects to continue generating strong free cash flow in 2015.For the first quarter of 2015, Cerner anticipates revenues between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion. The company also projects first-quarter new business bookings between $1.05 billion and $1.15 billion.Adjusted EPS (before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments) are expected in the range of 44-45 cents. Share-based compensation expense is expected to reduce EPS by roughly 3-4 cents in the first quarter of 2015.For full-year 2015, Cerner projects revenues between $4.8 billion and $5 billion. Adjusted EPS is forecasted in the $2.05-$2.15 band. Share-based compensation expense is expected to impact EPS by roughly 14-16 cents in 2015.We are impressed with Cerner's strong bookings, revenue and earnings growth posted in the fourth quarter. The recent close of the Siemens Health Services acquisition is expected to significantly enhance Cerner's capabilities by expanding its range of solutions and services and non-U.S. growth opportunities.We believe that Cerner is well positioned for growth in 2015 and beyond, driven by a strong pipeline and new business opportunities.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which puts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may further affect margins.

That suggests that McKesson -- and its $188 billion in annualized revenue -- is a great proxy for the health care sector. If so, then McKesson's fiscal third quarter and fiscal nine month results indicate that aging baby boomers and rising health insurance enrollment continue to drive demand for prescription medicine higher.Source: McKesson CorporationIn the fiscal third quarter, McKesson's total revenue jumped 37% to $47 billion. The company's adjusted earnings per share, or EPS, totaled $2.89, up 95% from last year.In the first nine months of its fiscal year, McKesson's revenue has grown by 36% from $99.5 billion last year to $135.8 billion. Importantly, the company's gross profit has climbed even more quickly, increasing by 49% to $8.7 billion. Through the first nine months of its fiscal year, McKesson's EPS total an adjusted $8.17, up 34% year-over-year.Additionally, McKesson continues to generate plenty of shareholder-friendly cash. In the third quarter, McKesson's operating cash totaled $1.2 billion, which allowed the company's cash stockpile to increase from $3.8 billion in the previous quarter to $4.6 billion exiting December.McKesson gets most of its sales from its drug distribution business and after adjusting for currency conversion, revenue for that unit surged by 39% to $46.3 billion during the quarter.The company's acquisition of the international drug intermediary Celesio is the major reason behind McKesson's sales surge, but sales at the company's North American business still grew by a more than respectable 17%.Although revenue from the drug distribution segment is growing quickly, it remains a very low profit margin business. The segment's operating profit totaled just $785 million on a GAAP accounting basis last quarter, which works out to an operating margin of only 1.7%.The performance from McKesson's much smaller health care technology solutions business wasn't nearly as good, with revenue slipping 7% to $755 million.Market share leaders Epic Systems,  , and  continue to battle with McKesson over health care IT market share, and that is eating into sales for McKesson's Horizon technology products, which are used by health care providers to create patient electronic health records and manage operations. However, with an operating margin of 14.7%, the unit still remains solidly profitable with the business posting an operating profit of $111 million last quarter.The Celesio acquisition accounts for the lion's share of the company's growth and profit expansion, and Celesio's benefit to McKesson's bottom line should continue. The company estimates that Celesio will add between $1 and $1.20 to the company's earnings during the first 12 months following the deal and that annual cost savings should reach an annualized run rate of between $275 million and $325 million by the fourth year following the acquisition.McKesson's sales and profit should also continue to benefit from demographic tailwinds given that 10,000 baby boomers are turning 65 daily and that the number of prescription per year written for seniors is double the number that is written for people under age 55.Ongoing increases in insurance enrollment tied to the health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion also support prescription volume. As of last week, the Department of Health and Human Services reports that nearly 7.5 million Americans have enrolled in health insurance through the federally run health care.gov website. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have announced that 10.1 million more people are covered under Medicaid than were covered by the program prior to the institution of Medicaid expansion in 2013.For these reasons, McKesson is boosting its guidance for fiscal 2015 EPS from between $10.50 to $10.90 to a new range of between $10.80 and $10.95.

In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, over the trailing four quarters, the company has posted a positive average earnings surprise of 2.17%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.In the third quarter of 2014, Cerner reported in-line earnings of 39 cents per share. On the other hand, although the company's revenues missed the mark, the same increased year over year driven by strong growth across all the segments.We are also impressed with the company's bookings performance which led to a 21% increase in total backlog.Meanwhile, Cerner seems to be benefiting from the accelerated momentum among medical providers to comply with federal EHR requirements. Further, its non-EHR offerings for the untapped Healthcare Information Technology (HCIT) market, such as population health management and care coordination, are considered important growth catalysts.However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which puts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may further affect margins.Recently, Cerner completed the acquisition of Siemens Health Services. However, the transaction will have no effect on the fourth quarter earnings.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cerner is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

That is not the case here as you will see below. : Cerner has a Zacks ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 43 cents. : Cerner has a Zacks Rank #3.

The deal, announced in Aug 2014, was worth $1.3 billion in addition to working capital adjustments. The acquisition will lift Cerner's revenues from $2.91 billion in 2013 to an estimated $4.8-$5 billion in 2015.Cerner projects annual pre-tax synergies from cross selling and cost savings to be more than $175 million in 2017. Furthermore, the deal is expected to be accretive to Cerner's adjusted EPS by more than 15 cents in 2015 and over 25 cents in 2016.Both companies project an annual research and development investment of $650 million. The takeover is likely to boost Cerner's business scale massively. Post-acquisition, the combined entity will have 20,000 associates in more than 30 countries, and 18,000 client facilities, including some of the largest health care organizations in the world.As part of the deal, Cerner and Siemens AG will form a strategic alliance, combining Cerner's health IT leadership and Siemens' strengths in medical devices and imaging. Both companies will invest up to a combined $100 million to bring new solutions to market for the purpose of enhancing workflows and clinical outcomes.Cerner follows a strategy of acquiring complementary businesses that enable the company to expand its solutions, device offerings and services, and grow its market and client base. Strategic acquisitions have helped the company to rapidly penetrate the hospital clinical information technology (HCIT) market.Over the last few years, the acquisitions of Resource Systems (2011), Clairvia (2011), Anasazi Software (2012), PureWellness (2013), Labotix (2013) and InterMedHx (2014) have not only expanded Cerner's product portfolio but also helped improve its market share.

All three have seen benefits from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus bill. All have also seen their share of recent ups and downs.The initial bill set aside $19 billion to help health care providers convert their patient records systems from paper to digital, or electronic health records. As of Dec. 1, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported the program had paid more than $25.7 billion to participants, including hospitals, doctors and insurance companies, meeting \"meaningful use\" requirements.Beginning this year, the government will ratchet up the pressure by trimming reimbursements to medical providers not yet converted to EHR systems, or converts that are falling short of the meaningful-use benchmarks set out by the stimulus bill.Nearly 80% of physicians and hospitals are already using EHRs or plan to start soon, according to data from the federal government and industry research groups. That's up from the paltry 17% of doctors and 9% of hospitals equipped with EHRs in 2008, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.An increasing number of new conversions are using software-as-a-service (SaaS) type implementations, driving a growing portion of the health industry to cloud-based products.As a result, the global cloud computing market segment within the health care industry is expected to reach $6.7 billion in 2018, rising from $1.8 billion in 2011, according to research firm Transparency Market Research.It's a major industry shift that suggests fertile ground is still ahead.\"Health care is littered with decades-old technology,\" Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Wieland told IBD. \"There's a significant replacement cycle to come.\"Companies that provide EHR services are generally alike in that they digitize the medical world. All are also making acquisitions to expand their technological capabilities and client base. But that's largely where the similarities end.The largest, measured by market capitalization and revenue, is Cerner. Founded in 1979, it got its start selling medical lab software to hospitals. Today, the Missouri business supplies its clinical and revenue management software to 14,000 large health organizations worldwide, including 3,000 major hospitals and 4,900 large physician groups.No. 2 Athenahealth is known as a leader in cloud services. It provides Web-based billing and EHR functions to 59,000 health care providers, mainly doctor's practices. This month, the Massachusetts-based company expanded into the hospital inpatient segment with the purchase of RazorInsights, a cloud-based EHR and billing system for hospitals.Third in line is Veeva Systems, a California-based newcomer that went public in October 2013. It sells its cloud-based software programs to pharmaceutical companies and biotech organizations. Veeva says it now serves 59,000 providers in the biotech and life sciences industries.While each firm is focused on health care, all three companies also belong to the broader cloud computing industry segment, right along with firms including leading customer relationship management software businessesSalesforce (  ) and employee services providerWorkday (  ).With investors excited about the potential of the cloud/SaaS sector, IBD's Computer Software Medical group rallied for five years to a high in early March of 2014. The SaaS group then turned -- along with a broad swathe of the software sector. Athenahealth tumbled 53% from March to May. Veeva tanked 57%. Cerner was hurt least, dropping 23%.Analysts attributed the sell-off to worries about the end of a federal stimulus program and investor overexuberance about cloud firms.The sell-off in cloud stocks followed Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's March 19 comments that year indicating that the central bank's stimulus program could end as early as last fall, Stifel analyst Tom Roderick told IBD. \"It started in late February and picked up steam as the Fed had some commentary about interest rates inevitably rising. That seemed to take a lot of risk appetite off the table from institutional investors,\" Roderick said.And investors had gotten absolutely giddy early last year about all things cloud. \"If you had cloud in your pitch book, your stock was going up, whether you were health care or non-health care related. The fundamentals were not driving the (stocks') move either up or down, it was just the buzz around the cloud,\" added Piper Jaffray's Wieland. \"It was momentum buying, then it hit a peak, and then it was momentum selling.\"Solid fundamentals revived the stocks, analysts said.\"Throughout that whole time, Athenahealth was reporting 30% growth in its core business and Cerner was reporting beat-and-raise quarters,\" said Wieland. \"Everything was thrown out in the sell-off, but Cerner and Athenahealth had fundamentals that were good, so people started to gravitate (back) towards those names.\"As for Veeva, Roderick said: \"Their Q2 results were extraordinary, you could see it in the growth margins and the cash flows. They put up fantastic results, but the market didn't have a lot of patience for stocks that were high multiples at that time.\"Challenges for all the companies remain.While the federal stimulus funding was the initial catalyst for EHR installation and growth, companies must now prove \"meaningful use\" in order to get full payment for delivering medical care.For example, Wieland gave the theoretical case of a physician using Athenahealth who gets paid an incentive fee for each of their patients who gets a flu shot, but some of those patients get flu shots at a chain drugstore rather than at the doctor's office. Putting IT systems in place to collect and analyze that kind of \"population health management\" data is the next level of investment that is driving today's electronic health technology spending, Wieland said.Cerner, already the largest player in the group, will nearly double in size after it completes its $1.3 billion acquisition of the Germany-based Siemens health IT business unit, which it announced in August. The deal is expected to close Feb. 2.The single biggest challenge post-merger \"is not doing any harm\" to Cerner's core operations as it digests the $4.5 billion Siemens unit and its far-flung network of clients, products, workers and research initiatives, FBR Capital Markets analyst Steven Halper told IBD. \"You don't want to take resources away from Cerner and move them over to Siemens, because that will erode the deliverables from Cerner,\" Halper said. A second feat will be to hold onto Siemens' existing customer base as well as to sell those clients additional health care IT products, Halper said.Cerner is also vying for a major contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to replace and standardize its EHR systems, which now support nearly 10 million active duty service members, retirees and dependents.Another applicant for the military's $11 billion EHR contract is PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has teamed withGoogle (GOOGL) and others in its bid.Athenahealth's Jan. 14 announcement that it would acquire RazorInsights moved the company into providing cloud-based electronic health record services to small and rural hospitals, expanding their traditional focus on physicians' practices.\"That marketplace (small, rural hospitals) is not as easy as you might think, because they are not very sophisticated buyers of IT, and because their existing vendors are pretty sticky,\" said Halper.Veeva Systems is dependent on Salesforce.com's cloud-based Force.com suite of tools. But Salesforce.com does not compete in the drug manufacturing segment where Veeva thrives. Veeva's cloud-based CRM tools for the life sciences industry now provide 85% of the company's revenue, according to a November report by J.P. Morgan analyst Sterling Auty.Veeva has, Auty said, been snatching market share from Siebel's customer relationship management system - which is owned byOracle (ORCL) -- and from Cegedim, a global technology and services company specializing in health care that's owned byIMS Health (IMS).Analysts are pinning great expectations on Veeva's three-year-old cloud-based document management system, called Vault. That offering simplifies the production and sharing of regulated materials, both internally and with external partners. The system now has 230 customers, including 33 of the 50 largest global pharmaceutical firms, according to Auty.The Vault system \"is at an inflection point now, where they are starting to land multimillion-dollar deals with large pharma firms,\" said Roderick, the Stifel analyst. \"The document management story ... is ripe for disruption in the same way that customer relationship management was 8 to 10 years ago.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["xpected Earnings Release: 02/10/2015, After-hoursAvg.

Source: AppleTherefore, it's surprising that recent reports suggest that Apple will add a stylus to its long-rumored 12.9-inch iPad Pro. In a research note obtained by  ,  KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo claims that the iPad Pro stylus will be an \"optional\" accessory that would \"improve the user experience.\" Kuo also believes the stylus will be a pricier one than the inexpensive plastic versions included with  Surface Pro tablets. Under Steve Jobs, Apple launched devices that beat existing ones on the market by simplifying the user experience into the fewest steps possible. That's why the classic iPod had its iconic wheel, while the iPhone and iPad relied completely on touchscreens.Older Windows tablets and two-in-one devices flopped for three main reasons. First, Microsoft and its OEM partners marketed Windows Tablet PCs to a niche group of designers and art students. Second, the first OS for tablets, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, included touchscreen features but wasn't built from the ground up as a touchscreen-based OS. Lastly, the lack of an app ecosystem meant that mainstream consumers weren't compelled to buy a Windows tablet or convertible laptop.An old Windows Tablet PC. Source: Wikimedia Commons, With the iPhone, Apple directly addressed those problems by launching a touch-based OS, nurturing the development of touch-dependent apps and marketing that combination to mainstream consumers. Jobs then expanded the iPhone into a tablet form with the iPad.To Jobs, introducing a stylus would represent a dramatic step back toward failed Windows tablets and dull PDAs. However, times have changed since his passing. Android tablets saturated the global tablet market, which IDC reports only grew 7.2% year-over-year in 2014, compared to 52.5% growth in 2013. Sales of the iPad fell for three consecutive quarters in fiscal 2014.Meanwhile, sales of the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 unexpectedly perked up, and Surface sales more than  both year-over-year and sequentially to $908 million last quarter.  was attributed to some businesses and consumers upgrading older laptops and desktops to the Surface Pro 3 as a backward-compatible \"bridge\" between PCs and tablets. By comparison, iPads were still commonly seen as media consumption devices that still needed dedicated apps to synchronize with PC software.Last year, Apple signed a historic deal with  to launch enterprise apps for the iPad. Apple also inked deals with  ,  , and  to sync electronic health records to iOS 8 devices and to become the  of U.S. hospitals. These steps were solid ones in the right direction, but they didn't do enough to directly compete against Windows' dominant market share in PCs.Therefore, launching the iPad Pro as a dedicated productivity device with a stylus (and maybe even a keyboard or docking station)  convince businesses to take the iPad more seriously as an enterprise option. Steve Jobs once claimed that 7-inch tablets would be \"dead on arrival,\" and that there wasn't a market for devices between smartphones and tablets. Yet  's Kindle Fire highlighted the usefulness of one-handed tablets for reading, while the rise of phablets proved that a market exists between smartphones and tablets.Steve Jobs in 2010. Source: Wikimedia Commons, Jobs probably would have hated the 7.9-inch iPad Mini, but the device didn't flop. Now that the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus phablet has arrived, there is speculation that Apple might phase out the Mini to avoid product cannibalization. If that happens, the iPad Pro could fill that void.On the surface, swapping iPad sizes around seems like shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic. But if we look at Apple's Mac revenues, which rose 12% year-over-year in fiscal 2014, we realize that there's still a  market for Apple's desktops and laptops. This means that Apple might be able to market the iPad Pro to Mac users and blur the lines between the two product categories. Rumors, previously reported by DigiTimes, that Apple could somehow  with the iPad Pro also support that strategy. Today, Steve Jobs is often remembered for his best ideas. But when Jobs talked about a stylus ruining the iPad, he was talking about past Windows devices and not the productivity gap that now needs to be filled between PCs and tablets. In my opinion, introducing a stylus or type cover keyboard could breathe fresh life into Apple's flagship tablet and might finally give stubborn owners of older iPads a reason to upgrade.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed. It could make early investors wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"... But you'll probably just call it \"how I made my millions.\" Don't be too late to the party-  when the web goes dark.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC.

The S&P healthcare index ETF return more than doubled the return of the S&P 500 in 2014. However, that doesn't guarantee that healthcare stocks will lead again in 2015. In fact, with so many healthcare stocks hitting new highs, it may be getting harder for investors to figure out which healthcare stocks are worth keeping in their portfolios for next year. With that in mind, here are five healthcare stocks that could be worth owning in 2015. Biotechnology stocks get a lot of the press in the healthcare sector, but healthcare insurers have been top-performing stocks thanks to healthcare-reform-driven membership growth. Establishing exchanges that allow the uninsured to get coverage and expanding Medicaid in 27 states are proving to be major sources of revenue growth for insurers, which should continue in 2015. If so, then  stands to benefit.UnitedHealth is the nation's biggest health insurer, but its approach to the exchanges was tepid during the first open enrollment period. However, that's changed this year, with UnitedHealth offering plans on exchanges in 23 states. As a result, membership growth should provide significant tailwinds next year, which has UnitedHealth telling investors to expect it will deliver EPS of between $6 and $6.25 in 2015. Insurers aren't the only beneficiaries of rising insurance enrollment -- hospitals are enjoying profit growth thanks to reform, too. Historically, hospitals set aside billions of dollars every year to pay for care provided to the uninsured. Thanks to rising enrollment in health insurance plans and Medicaid, the industry is slowly, but surely, writing off less of that care. Since exchange enrollment is expected to grow again next year, and Medicaid expansion has been embraced by more states, hospitals like  should be able to drop even more revenue to their bottom line in 2015.After acquiring Health Management Associates earlier this year, Community Health has become one of the nation's top hospital operators, and that positions it perfectly to benefit from rising insurance enrollment. It's not just insurance reform, however, that could help Community Health's shares climb next year; aging baby boomers are requiring more procedures, and an improving economy should boost the number of elective surgeries, too. If that proves to be true, then more paying patients should help Community Health deliver on analysts' EPS estimates for $3.97 in 2015, which would be up 23% from 2014. Ditching metal file cabinets for integrated software solutions is a major healthcare trend that should continue to offer support for healthcare IT providers next year, and few are better positioned to capitalize on that trend than  .Cerner is one of the nation's biggest providers of healthcare software solutions designed to coordinate healthcare across hospitals, specialists, and primary care doctors. In addition to this software being used to create electronic health records, it's also being used to streamline scheduling and payment practices to reduce cancellations and speed up payments. Couple those benefits with healthcare reform's carrot-and-stick approach of bonuses and penalties, and more and more providers are deploying systems made by Cerner.In the third quarter, Cerner's sales grew 15%, to $840 million, bringing year-to-date sales to $2.47 billion, up from $2.12 billion in 2013. Since third-quarter bookings hit an all-time high for the period, it appears that Cerner's momentum will continue into next year. That could mean it's in good shape to hit analysts' EPS target of $1.96 next year, which would be up 18.7% from 2014. Biotechnology stocks can offer tremendous promise, but they're incredibly volatile, and can make or break a portfolio if investors take on too much risk. That's why I like to focus on biotech stocks with existing products that kick off billions of revenue, compelling pipelines, and rock-solid balance sheets.Based on those criteria, one of my favorite biotech stocks for 2015 is  . Celgene already sports three top-selling drugs, including the second-line multiple myeloma drug Revlimid. Revlimid sales jumped 19% year over year last quarter, and the drug is on pace to deliver more than $5 billion in sales next year. Revlimid's sales could end up even higher next year if the FDA approves its use as a first-line multiple myeloma treatment. An FDA decision is expected in February.Beyond Revlimid, Celgene also markets the cancer drug Abraxane, which had sales of $212 million last quarter, up 25%, and the multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst, which is used as a third-line treatment, and had sales of $181 million last quarter. Additionally, the company is conducting more than a dozen late-stage studies to either expand the labels of existing drugs or add new products to its portfolio, and it has an enviable balance sheet, as well.The company's cash stockpile grew to $3.7 billion in the third quarter from $3.2 billion in December, and its current ratio, which offers insight into a company's ability to meet short-term financial obligations, is strong at 6.3. Combine those compelling reasons to own the stock with the fact that analysts predict EPS will grow 32% next year to $4.86 per share, and you could have a recipe for another solid year. In addition to those four companies, investors may also want to consider owning the dentistry medical device company  in 2015.Align isn't a household name, but the company's well-known Invisalign clear aligner products continue to enjoy demand growth as consumers turn to less visible corrective dentistry products. In the third quarter, sales of Align's clear aligners grew 16% year over year, to $178.1 million, and sales for the company's CAD/CAM scanners and services business grew by 7.1% in the third quarter.Overall, Align's revenue through the first nine months totals $563 million, up from $482 million last year -- but sales growth isn't the only reason to consider owning this stock. Align is also highly profitable, and it's debt free. Align's net profit during the first nine months totaled $106 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, up from $22 million, or $0.26 in 2013, and analysts think EPS will reach $2.11 in 2015, up 18.5% from 2014.Healthcare is a major part of our economy, and investors are right to want to have exposure to the sector, particularly as overall spending on healthcare grows. However, that doesn't mean that investors should put all their eggs in one basket. Instead, investors should spread the healthcare portion of their investments around the various healthcare industries. Because these healthcare stocks provide investors with exposure to different areas of healthcare, and each offers investors sales growth and a sleep-friendly balance sheet, these five companies may make sense for portfolios in 2015. Healthcare stocks soared in 2014, and 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks. But if you want to make sure you're buying one of the best healthcare stocks, you need to know where to start.

This forum offers business and clinical management services to health care providers, in-vitro fertilization centers, and other physicians treating independent women.WHUSA supports more than 250 healthcare providers who serve almost 300K patients in Connecticut. Apart from athenaOne suite, WHUSA will use athenaCollector and athenaCommunicator for its In Vitro Sciences business in Connecticut and New York.Both the companies have also entered into a partnership, under which they will offer their joint co-branded services in new markets. The alliance will help athenahealth to enter new markets much faster, in our view.We note that strategic alliances have played a key role in developing athenahealth's growth trajectory. This year, the company signed partnership agreements with the likes of Henry Schien (HSIC) and Steward Health System.As part of its More Disruption Please (MDP) program, athenahealth is partnering with startups and new healthcare technology providers that are challenging traditional companies. Through this program, athenahealth is looking to accelerate high-value innovation via the cloud.We believe that these alliances will boost athenahealth's physician base in 2015 and beyond. Moreover, an impressive product portfolio that comprises the fast growing Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) offering and dominant EHR product will continue to drive top line.We believe that athenahealth will continue to benefit from its extensive athenaCollector client base and higher retention rate (approximately 95%). The company's updated knowledge base gives its customers real time information that no competitor has been able to exactly replicate. In addition, the Epocrates acquisition is likely to enhance athenahealth's mobile user network.However, we feel athenahealth's long-term goal of 30% top-line growth is challenging, given the consolidation trend among small physician practices.

The Software as a Service (SaaS)-based approach allows for a lower-cost and more flexible delivery mechanism that is expected to help athenahealth win deals.In our opinion, athenahealth will continue to benefit from its extensive athenaCollector client base.

This year marks the first performance evaluation by KLAS in the field of Ambulatory RCM Services.In the newly released report, KLAS ranks the best-performing healthcare IT vendors providing outsourced billing/RCM on their overall performance. It also evaluates their performance in key RCM areas such as effectiveness of claims processing, transparency into billing/financial operations, denials and rejections management, sustainability of pricing, trust as a business partner and, efficiencies gained through partnerships.Among select surveyed vendors comprising Cerner (  ), athenahealth (  ), and privately-held Kareo and eClinicalWorks, NextGen RCM Services received the most favorable ranking for overall performance.Additionally, NextGen Healthcare scored the highest amongst all ambulatory vendors for its performance in the following key RCM areas - effectiveness of claims processing, patient-facing support performance, efficiency gained by customers, sustainability of pricing and, trust as a business partner.The report further elaborates that all of NextGen's RCM clients recognize NextGen as a trusted business partner due to its transparency, consistent delivery and the ability to transform patient care into positive financial outcomes.In Oct 2014, KLAS released its August 2014 report - Ambulatory Electronic Medical Record (EMR) Impact on Patient Care 2014. As per this report, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.'s (  ) Sunrise Ambulatory Care was deemed to be the most highly-rated EHR across four categories, namely, measuring and managing outcomes, facilitating physician-patient interaction, longitudinal care, and seeing patients in a timely manner.Allscripts Healthcare also scored the highest among its peers in a side-by-side comparison of ambulatory EMR vendor performance.With rising complexities in healthcare reimbursement, revenue cycle effectiveness is becoming increasingly essential. By attaining the status of 'trusted business partner' in the RCM services space, ambulatory EMR vendors like Quality Systems aim to enable hospitals and providers drive proactive and responsive patient care across all settings.Currently, Quality Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The bill drafted by Senators Orrin Hatch (Republican-Utah) and Michael Bennett (Democratic-Colorado) argues that certain software should not be categorized under medical devices.Software providing administrative or operational support and EHRs excluding diagnostic image data are some of the medical technologies that the bill proposes should be kept out of FDA's purview as they do not pose risk to patient safety.Per Reuters, the bill is expected to maintain FDA's jurisdiction over medium and high risk software. However, the legislators have not asked for a separate body to categorize the risk of the said software.The MEDTECH Act follows the Preventing Regulatory Overreach to Enhance Care Technology (PROTECT) Act that was introduced in Feb 2014. The PROTECT Act was supported by the likes of athenahealth, Inc. (  ), International Business Machines Corp. (  ) and a number of IT companies who develop healthcare-related software.The ACT reduces FDA oversight on some high-risk CDS software, mobile medical apps and other medical device functionality. These include wellness apps, emergency care predictive analytics software and hospital patient monitoring software. Per Boston Globe, the Act will also help health IT companies to avoid 2.3% tax charged to medical device makers as part of federal health reform.The PROTECT Act was a companion bill to SOFTWARE Act, which was introduced to the House of Representatives in Oct 2013. The PROTECT Act is now under the purview of Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Although the MEDTECH Act will take some time to get formally introduced in the Congress, the proposed amendments will definitely bring cheer to EHR providers like athenahealth, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (  ) and Cerner Corp. (  ).The lenient FDA regulation will help these companies to commercialize innovative solutions at a much faster pace that will ultimately benefit their top line. Software upgrades will also find their way out in a much easier and cost-effective manner.Moreover, the MEDTECH Act is expected to remove ambiguity and uncertainty related to regulatory environment in the medical IT market. This will be significantly positive not only for large providers but also for many start-ups, ultimately helping them to offer better health care in the long run.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Allscripts has a leading market share in both inpatient and ambulatory settings. We believe that the company's strong market position is a significant competitive advantage, which will enhance its growth prospects in the long run.The HITECH Act, which has authorized the Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive program or the Meaningful Use program, presents significant opportunities for EHR vendors like Allscripts. We note that Allscripts continues to benefit from the HITECH Act, as reflected by the significant number of client admissions during the year and additional related orders for its EHR products.In the first nine months of 2014, Allscripts added more than 550 new clients for its EHR and related solutions. Further, its non-EHR offerings for the untapped Healthcare Information Technology (HCIT) market, such as population health management and care coordination, are considered to be future growth drivers.Acquisitions have lent the company increased scale and cross-selling opportunities across products and markets. However, Allscripts' ability to integrate acquisitions remains to be proven as it continues to face strong competition in a fragmented market. Moreover, heavy reliance on mergers and acquisition activities presents substantial integration risks for the company.Allscripts faces intense competition from larger players like Epic and Cerner (  ), which are expected to enjoy an advantage over smaller competitors in winning stimulus-driven contracts. These companies compete against Allscripts with a far simpler rationale for their unified and seamless products, serving both inpatient and outpatient segments. Furthermore, the market is price sensitive, particularly on the lower end.Currently, Allscripts carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Merge Healthcare (  ) and OmniComm Systems (  ) are two better-ranked stocks in the medical information systems industry.

Healthcare appears to be one area where the changes could be dramatic. We asked three of our top healthcare contributors to weigh in on what they think the election results could ultimately mean for this industry. Here's what they had to say. After sweeping midterm election wins for Republicans, what's going to happen to American healthcare? Is the Affordable Care Act toast?That scenario isn't probable. Benefits are much easier to add than take away, and President Barack Obama has already vowed to veto any outright repeal. Republicans in Congress know they don't have the votes to stand up to a presidential veto and kill the healthcare law outright.But the battle lines have been drawn. The Republican Congress will doubtless go after a slew of unpopular stipulations, and a likely provision to fall first is the 30-hour rule.Congressional Democrats could well get behind a bill such as the Save American Workers Act (H.R. 2575), which passed the House last year. The act would restore the traditional definition of full-time workers (who must be offered health coverage) to employees who work 40 hours a week or more. Major private-sector advocates argue the 30-hour standard is unreasonable and has encouraged businesses to slash worker hours. The result is decreased productivity and more workers seeking subsidized coverage, increasing the cost of the health reform law. A Republican Congress could try to change the $35 billion meaningful use program, which awards subsidies to healthcare providers that \"effectively\" use electronic health records, or EHRs. Six Republican senators have offered a \"reboot\" for the meaningful use funds.One of the six, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, is expected to become chairman of the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which could give him the clout to reform the program. The \"reboot\" lawmakers claim the use of health information-technology systems might have \"accelerated the ordering of unnecessary care\" and that more measures should be introduced to \"prevent fraud and abuse.\"Altering the rules of meaningful use could slow the adoption of electronic health records, causing revenue growth at EHR companies such as Epic and  to stall. Yet certain aspects of the plan -- such as forcing top EHR companies to share their patient data with competitors -- could be beneficial to other players like  and  . Epic, for example, reportedly received over half of the $24 billion spent on meaningful use so far, thanks to its dominant market share. Therefore, EHR investors should pay close attention to how the reboot saga plays out. While the change in control of the U.S. Senate received the most attention, the election results for state legislatures and governors could make the greater difference for healthcare.Republicans now control 68 o f the 98 state legislative chambers in the U.S. That's the highest number for the GOP ever. Republicans also now also hold the governor's office in 31 states -- the most since the 1920s.What does this mean for healthcare? Perhaps the biggest impact is on Medicaid expansion.Twenty-one statesto date have opted against expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act's provisions.The GOP, which has been largely opposed to the Obamacare Medicaid changes, holds the governor's office and the state legislature in 16 of those states. In how many of the 21 states do Democrats control both the executive and legislative branches? Zero. The prospects for any significant expansion of Medicaid in the near term appears to be small.This reality could limit the prospects for health insurers with Medicaid operations in these states. For example,  has enjoyed success from Medicaid expansion in 11 of the 21 states where the company competes in the Medicaid markets. However, the GOP solidly controls all 10 of the other states.Recent tax increases have affected nearly every American taxpayer.

The company reported adjusted earnings (including stock based compensation expense of 4 cents) of 44 cents per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents and declined 18.5% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues (including adjustments related to software license contracts, which were acquired) of almost $736 million were well-short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $748 million. This marks the third consecutive quarter of revenues lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top line also declined 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.However, Alere's share price increased 4.13% ($1.55) to close at $39.12 on Oct 28, owing to a better-than-expected outlook provided by management.Professional Diagnostics revenues declined almost 1% from the year-ago quarter to $586.3 million. U.S revenues fell 5.4%, which was primarily attributable to lower revenues from sales of Beckman Coulter BNP tests, due to supply constraints. Lower pain management revenues from Toxicology business also negatively impacted results.Infectious disease business revenues grew 3% driven by strong global growth rates of Malaria (16%), CD4 (75%) and HIV (13%). New products contributed favorably to overall growth rate, with sales of CD4 and Epoc products increasing $2.6 million and $1 million, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Health Information Solutions revenues fell 7.3% to $123.9 million, while Consumer Diagnostics declined 8.3% to $26.4 million in the reported quarter.Health Information Solutions revenues were positively impacted by 12% growth in Patient self testing services. However, this growth was fully offset by weak results from Condition and case management, Wellness, and Women's & children's health, which fell 14%, 3% and 16% respectively, from the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, revenues from China, India and Africa increased 21%, 23% and 18%, respectively.Adjusted gross margin contracted 240 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 43.6% in the quarter.Both research & development (R&D) and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses declined in the quarter, reflecting stringent cost control. Headcount reductions lowered R&D by approximately $7 million and total operating expense base by $17 million annually.However, improving costs failed to fully offset a significantly lower gross margin base as operating margin contracted 140 bps from the year-ago quarter to 16.7%.Segment wise, Professional Diagnostics operating margin fell 130 bps, which was partially offset by 300 bps and 160 bps operating margin expansions in the Health Information Solutions and Consumer Diagnostics businesses, respectively.Alere exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $483.8 million (including restricted cash and marketable securities).Cash flow from operating activities improved significantly to $91.7 million from $19.3 million at the end of the previous quarter. Free cash flow came in at $63 million, a notable turnaround from a cash outflow of $7.6 million recorded in the previous quarter.Alere is divesting its Health Management business unit to Optum, a division of United Healthcare for $600 million. The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter.The company announced the sale of Alere ACS unit, its health information exchange system. Alere sold 40% of its stake at Vedalab for approximately $10 million. It is also selling Bionote, its vet business unit for approximately $45 million.Alere expects to use this $655 million proceeds from divestitures to pay off its debt, which currently stands at $3.79 billion. The company continues to pursue strategic alternatives for Alere Analytics unit.New CEO AppointmentAlere appointed Namal Nawana as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), President, and a member of the Board of Directors. Nawana had joined Alere in Dec 2012 as Chief Operating Officer (COO) and was appointed Interim CEO and President of Alere in Jul 2014.Alere expects cost savings from headcount reductions, lower R&D expense and strict cost control to result in $100 million savings by the end of the fourth quarter and into 2015. The company expects to reduce R&D expense by approximately $20 million to a maximum of $120 million for 2015.Divestiture of non-core profitable businesses is also expected to improve cost structure going forward. The company has already achieved $75 million in targeted savings and the remaining is expected to come from the divestitures. Management believes that this cost savings will add at least 50 cents to 2015 full year earnings per share.Alere expects strong organic top-line growth will come from Afinion, Malaria, CD4, Epoc and Toxicology reagents, as well as from geographies like China, India and Africa.Further, Alere believes that cold weather in the Northern hemisphere that results in respiratory problems will boost demand for its molecular platform Alere i, in the near term.Although Alere reported a dismal third quarter, its optimistic outlook is positive for the stock, in our view. The lower R&D and SG&A expense suggests that the company's cost control plans are working. The continuing divestment of non-core assets will not only boost profitability but will also help Alere focus more on developing its core operations.Alere recently won a U.S. government contract to develop diagnostic countermeasures for pandemic influenza. Investments on Triage, Epoc, Alere Q, toxicology and lateral flow infectious disease business are significant positives. We believe Alere's strong product pipeline improves its position amid growing competition from the likes of Bio-Rad Laboratories (  ), athenahealth (  ) and Cerner Corp (  ).Alere continues to focus on international markets with strong potential, particularly in Africa and India. Given its focus on  development in addition to its diverse product portfolio, Alere is positioned to perform well going forward.However, in our opinion, proper execution of its cost savings will be the key to Alere's future growth.Currently, Alere carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company is responsible for delivering roughly one out of every three prescription drugs used in the United States daily and generates more than $138 billion in annual revenue. But McKesson isn't just America's biggest drug distributor; it's also a large technology services company that's helping healthcare providers create and deploy health IT systems.McKesson reported its fiscal second-quarter results for the quarter ended in September, and results were better than hoped for. McKesson's sales of $44.8 billion beat analyst forecasts by $1.81 billion, and the company's EPS of $2.79 came in $0.06 ahead of estimates. Let's take a closer look at what's behind McKesson's solid results.McKesson gets the lion's share of its revenue from its drug distribution business, and last year that business grew 13% to $134.4 billion. Thanks to aging baby boomers, prescription demand is continuing to increase.In the fiscal second quarter, McKesson's sales jumped 36% from a year ago, thanks to a 37% increase in its drug distribution segment, which posted sales of $44 billion. The main driver behind jumping distribution sales is the company's acquisition of Celesio, a major overseas drug intermediary.While Celesio was a big reason for distribution sales growth, McKesson's North American operations, which includes U.S. Pharmaceuticals, McKesson Canada, and Specialty Health, also reported a very respectable 14% lift from a year ago.The distribution business, however, remains a very low-margin segment. Despite revenue that eclipsed a $175 billion annualized run rate in the quarter, the company's GAAP operating profit from it totaled just $793 million, giving the company an operating margin of just 1.8%.Although McKesson notched respectable top-line growth for its low-margin distribution business, sales in its higher-margin technology solutions unit dipped 6% to $770 million. Rising competitive pressure in the healthcare IT space from  and the privately held Epic continue to negatively affect demand for the company's Horizon clinical software program. Regardless, the unit still delivered operating profit of $125 million, for an operating margin of 16.23%.The company has a fairly predictable revenue and margin stream that kicks off a lot of shareholder-friendly cash. That cash is being returned to shareholders through both dividend payments and buybacks. In the past two quarters, McKesson paid out $115 million in dividends and spent $105 million on repurchases. Since the company still has $3.8 billion in cash, up from $2.96 billion a year ago, and expects to generate operating cash flow of $3 billion this fiscal year, there should be plenty of dry powder to continue funding that activity.For the full fiscal 2015, McKesson is telling investors to expect EPS of between $10.50 and $10.90 per share. That would be nicely above the $8.35 the company earned per share last fiscal year and well north of the $6.38 per share it earned in fiscal 2013. A good portion of the company's projected earnings this year will come from integrating Celesio. McKesson believes that Celesio will add between $1 and $1.20 per share to earnings in its first 12 months. Celesio's earning tailwind is likely to continue, given that McKesson expects to deliver annual cost saving synergies of between $275 million and $325 million by the fourth year following Celesio's integration.In addition to earnings upside tied to the Celesio deal, McKesson also stands to benefit from longer-living baby boomers. Roughly 10,000 boomers are turning 65 daily, and since those 65 and older are prescribed nearly twice the medicine of those 54 and younger, prescription demand is likely to head significantly higher. If that proves true, McKesson may find that it can grow even more quickly than it has historically. Between 2007 and 2014, McKesson's sales and earnings climbed by a compounded 5% and 17% per year, respectively.Getting a part-time job is one way to increase your income in retirement, but it isn't the smart way.

RazorInsights is a cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) and financial solutions company, serving rural, critical access, and community hospitals.The acquisition of RazorInsights will help athenahealth foray into the inpatient hospital market, which accounts for around one-third of the U.S. hospital market. The company already has an established position in the ambulatory space, where it serves more than 59,000 health care providers and has achieved Best in KLAS recognition for its revenue cycle management (RCM), EHR, and patient engagement services.Following the acquisition announcement, shares of athenahealth rallied as much as 2.7% in the trading session, before pulling back to close at $141.19 on last Wednesday. Notably, this Watertown MA-based company has generated a healthy return of around 26% over the last three months.We note that in addition to positioning athenahealth to serve a new segment of the health care market, the buyout will advance the company's connectedness across the care continuum. The addition of RazorInsights' strong customer base, complementary and award-winning cloud model and increased network knowledge will bring synergies to extend athenahealth's presence across the health care market.Though financial terms of the transaction have been kept under wraps, a recent Stifel report revealed that industry sources estimate the purchase price at roughly $40 million.We believe that this acquisition is a strategic fit to athenahealth's plans of operating as a cloud-service provider rather than a software company. However, in our opinion, it doesn't yet lend athenahealth a competitive edge over big enterprise EHR vendors like privately-held Epic Systems and Cerner (  ).athenahealth also faces intense competition from the likes of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (  ) and Quality Systems (  ).However, we believe that the HITECH Act, which has authorized the EHR Incentive program or the Meaningful Use program, presents significant opportunities for EHR vendors like athenahealth. The company's impressive product portfolio that comprises the fast growing RCM offerings and dominant EHR products will continue to serve as key positives.Currently, athenahealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Net earnings rose 12.0% to $134.9 million from $123.6 million in the third quarter of 2013.Revenues in the quarter grew 15.4% to $840.1 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $852 million. The increase can be attributed to stronger revenues from all the businesses.Revenues from  rose 10.7% to $224.3 million,  went up 16.6% to $593.1 million, and  escalated 36.3% to $22.7 million.Third quarter days sales outstanding were 67 days, up from 66 days in the comparable quarter of 2013.Bookings revenues grew 19% to all-time high of $1.1 billion. Cerner's bookings performance led to a 21% increase in total backlog to $10.2 billion. Total backlog comprised of $9.34 billion in contract revenue backlog and $814.0 million in support and maintenance backlog.Cerner had cash and cash equivalents of $496.5 million as of Sep 27, 2014, more than doubled from $202.3 million as of Dec 28, 2013. Total long-term debt and capital lease obligations declined 11.5% to $146.8 million as of Sep 27, 2014 compared with $165.8 million as of Dec 28, 2013.In the first nine months of the year, cash flow from operating activities improved 12.5% to $623.6 million from $554.4 million in the same period of 2013. Capital expenditure slid 8.3% to $200.4 million compared with $218.4 million in the year-ago period. As a result, free cash flow rose 39.2% to $292.4 million from $210.0 million in the 2013-period.For the fourth quarter of 2014, Cerner anticipates revenues between $880 and $915 million. Adjusted earnings are expected between 46 and 47 cents per share. These compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $905 million 43 cents for revenues and earnings per share, respectively for the quarter.The leading healthcare information technology (\"HCIT\") solutions provider also expects 2014-fourth quarter new business bookings between $1.15 and $1.25 billion.Currently, Cerner retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We believe long-term investors may consider Cerner, which serves a sizeable installed hospital base that requires composite clinically-oriented applications complying with \"meaningful use\" needs, reimbursement difficulties and coding challenges. The company has long-standing, integrated and seamless solutions for both inpatient and ambulatory settings.However, competition is fierce with well reputed names such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (  ), athenahealth (  ), Quality Systems (  ).

And reducing the unnecessary readmissions could save taxpayers like you and me as much as $17 billion.There are a number of ways that hospitals may be able to potentially reduce readmissions -- including providing patients with more comprehensive post-admission training than the boilerplate printed instructions commonly used in the past. Hospitals may increasingly turn to health aides to visit patients in their homes to catch problems before they result in readmissions, or they may embrace telemedicine to follow up with patients more often at a potentially lower cost. Hospitals are also embracing healthcare IT solutions made by companies like  to design more effective treatment plans, evaluate potential risks, and improve patient follow up.If these programs work to reduce readmissions everyone would benefit. Hospitals would see higher reimbursements and profits, taxpayers would spend less money, and hopefully patients would get better treatment.Recent tax increases have affected nearly every American taxpayer.

In the last reported quarter, Cerner recorded a positive earnings surprise of 2.78% on the back of higher revenues from all businesses and strong bookings performance. Moreover, Cerner's trailing four-quarter average beat is 4.33%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.One of the leading players in healthcare information technology, Cerner is poised to largely benefit from the Affordable Care Act which is driving hospitals and healthcare providers to lower costs and improve quality. Cerner will gain from the ongoing adoption of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems at hospitals as well as the industry-wide consolidation activity.As Cerner's clients acquire hospitals, it leads to higher booking contributions for the company. Notably, the company expects new business bookings between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in third-quarter 2014, the mid-point of which reflects 13% growth over the prior-year quarter.Cerner has also raised its 2014 revenue guidance to the range of $3.3-$3.4 billion from the prior range of $3.25-$3.4 billion. With Cerner's recent $1.3 billion deal to acquire Siemens Health Services, the company's annual revenues are expected to cross $4.5 billion this year. Furthermore, 2014 adjusted earnings are expected to be higher at $1.64-$1.67, compared with the prior range of $1.63 to $1.67, excluding share-based compensation expenses.While Cerner's outlook remains bright, competition is fierce with well reputed names such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, athenahealth, and Quality Systems. The intensity of competition may pressurize both pricing and margins. Stringent hospital budgets might pressurize pricing further.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cerner is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or at least 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%, as both these estimates stand at 39 cents. Cerner's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.

Although Duncan informed the nurse that he had visited West Africa within the past four months, the hospital released him the following day, after which he came into contact with as many as 100 people. On Sept. 28, Duncan was readmitted to Texas Health, where he died on Wednesday.Texas Health initially stated that Duncan's release was caused by \"a flaw in the way the physician and nursing portions of our electronic health records (EHRs) interacted.\" This immediately sparked a panic, since Texas Health's EHR vendor, Epic Systems, covers more than half of all patients in the U.S. However, Texas Health subsequently retracted its statement, claiming that \"there was no flaw in the EHR,\" without a follow-up explanation.Whether Epic's EHR, human error, or a combination of both were to blame is unclear, but the Texas Health case highlights some major problems with electronic health records in hospitals today. In theory, EHRs should be  to digitize healthcare -- a patient's health records are entered into a system and kept in a synchronized database that can be accessed by different healthcare providers. To encourage the effective use of EHRs, President Barack Obama signed the HITECH Act in 2009 to award subsidies to practices that met \"meaningful use\" standards for electronic health records. Unfortunately, aging systems in hospitals and the lack of interoperability between providers have prevented EHRs from reaching their full potential.The industry is split into fiefdoms. The biggest player is privately held Epic, while  and  are the two largest publicly traded EHR providers by revenue, according to GlobalData. The problem with these fiefdoms is that they don't like to share patient data with their rivals, which can cause problems when one hospital uses multiple EHRs or transfers patient data to another hospital. Epic, in particular, is frequently criticized for its closed platform which hinders data sharing with other EHR providers. Yet Epic has received  of the $24 billion spent on the meaningful use program so far , thanks to its dominant market share,according to a recent RAND report . and  previously tried to combine EHRs into single personal health records, or PHRs, with Health and HealthVault, respectively. However, Google canceled Health in 2011 due to a lack of interest from patients and doctors, and HealthVault continues to suffer from similar problems. 's new  , which combines EHRs from Epic, Cerner, and  on iPhones, is a possible solution to this data fragmentation, but once Apple collects all that information, it's unlikely to share it with Google or Microsoft. In response to Texas Health's initial statement regarding Epic's EHR, athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush told CNBC that mistakes in electronic health records are \"fixed only at the place where they appeared,\" and that such errors \"constantly\" occur. Athenahealth announced on Oct. 3 that it had updated its database with additional information about Ebola, and vendors scrambled to do the same.But simply adding information about Ebola to EHRs doesn't solve the problem. The more pressing issue is the long overdue upgrade from  . International Classification of Diseases codes are used to classify specific diseases. ICD-9, which most U.S. hospitals still use, only lists Ebola under a shared code with \"multiple viral diseases,\" while ICD-10 gives it its own code. If Ebola is being lumped together with other diseases in EHR and hospital records, it could certainly cause additional confusion during the physician workflow.China has been using ICD-10 since 2002, but the U.S. still hasn't upgraded all its systems to recognize ICD-10. In May, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services extended the upgrade deadline to Oct. 1, 2015 -- its  since January 2009. That wasn't surprising, since a QualiTest survey last June found that 75% of healthcare providers still weren't prepared for the change. The spread of Ebola highlights just how messy and fragile the EHR industry is today. EHR companies need to share their data with each other and ICD codes must be updated to properly catch threats such as Ebola. If the healthcare industry can finally accomplish those two things, unifying platforms like HealthKit could help make the system healthier, more efficient, and better managed.

The increase can be attributed to stronger revenues from all the businesses. Domestic revenues rose 24% in the quarter. Global revenues continue to fall. It was down 4% in the quarter mainly due to the timing of a couple of global contracts.Revenues from System sales revenues rose 17.0% to $234.6 million driven by solid gains in software and technology resale. System sales margin grew 19% in the quarter, driven by continued strong software sales.Support, maintenance and services went up 20.9% to $588.2 million, driven by strong growth in managed services and professional services.

Bookings margin was $980 million or 91% of total bookings.CERN's bookings performance led to a 21% increase in total backlog to $9.7 billion. Contract revenue backlog increased 23% to $8.9 billion from the year-ago level. Support revenue backlog went up 7% to $806.6 million in the quarter.Gross margin for the quarter was 80.9%, down 130 basis points (bps) from 82.2% in the prior-year quarter due to higher level of third party services to support a significant number of systems.Operating earnings rose 15.1% to $191.6 million from $166.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin in the quarter dipped 100 bps to 22.5% from 23.5% in the 2013-second quarter, due to increases in third party services and reimbursed travel revenues.CERN had cash and cash equivalents of $315.3 million as of Jun 28, 2014, significantly up by 55.8% from $202.3 million as of Dec 28, 2013. Total long-term debt and capital lease obligations declined 6.3% to $155.4 million as of Jun 28, 2014 compared with $165.8 million as of Dec 28, 2013.In the first half of the year, cash flow from operating activities improved 3.6% to $404.1 million from $390.2 million in the 2013-first half. Capital expenditure ebbed 2.2% to $132.0 million compared with $135.0 million in the year-ago period. As a result, free cash flow rose 4.6% to $185.4 million from $177.3 million in the 2013-period.In December last year, CERN's board of directors approved authorization of stock repurchase of up to $217 million of the company's common stock. Thereafter, in May this year, CERN authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100 million of its common stock.In the second quarter of 2014, CERN repurchased 2.8 million shares for roughly $142 million, bringing its year-to-date repurchase to 4.1 million shares for an investment of $217 million. With this, the company has exhausted the approved share repurchase authorization in December of 2013. However, CERN still has an additional $100 million worth of shares remaining under the approved authorization in May.For the third quarter of 2014, CERN anticipates revenues between $840 and $870 million, the midpoint of which implies a growth of 17% over the 2013-quarter. Adjusted earnings are expected between 38 and 39 cents per share, including share based compensation expense. These compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $834 million 39 cents for revenues and earnings per share, respectively for the quarter.The leading healthcare information technology (\"HCIT\") solutions provider also expects 2014-third quarter new business bookings between $1 and $1.1 billion, the mid-point of which reflects a 13% growth over the prior-year quarter.For full year 2014, CERN upgraded revenues guidance to the range of $3.3 to $3.4 billion from the prior range of $3.25 to $3.4 billion. Adjusted earnings are also expected to be higher at $1.64-$1.67, compared with the prior range of $1.63 to $1.67, excluding share based compensation expense (which is expected to be 11 to 12 cents for the full year). These compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $3.3 billion and $1.54 for revenues and earnings per share, respectively for the year.For 2014, CERN expects capital expenditures between $260 and $280 million, down from $353 million in 2013. It also anticipates capitalized software to remain in the mid-$40 million range per quarter throughout the year, which is flat or modestly higher than $175 million capitalized in 2013.Currently, CERN retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We believe long-term investors may consider CERN, which serves a sizeable installed hospital base that requires composite clinically-oriented applications complying with \"meaningful use\" needs, reimbursement difficulties and coding challenges. The company has long-standing, integrated and seamless solutions for both inpatient and ambulatory settings.However, competition is fierce with well reputed names such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (  ), athenahealth (  ), Quality Systems (  ). The intensity of competition may pressure both pricing and margin. Stringent hospital budgets place further pressure on pricing.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

We are confident about the stock given its strong bookings growth, reflecting client confidence in new offerings by MDRX.Bookings improved 9.3% to $234.0 million in the second quarter of 2014 from $214.0 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was driven by higher client demand for new and enhanced solution functionality across the entire MDRX product portfolio by healthcare systems, hospitals and ambulatory markets. The impressive bookings performance in the second quarter reflects strong Allscripts Sunrise EHR platform sales to new domestic and international clients.Further, MDRX is working aggressively to deliver the Meaningful Use 2 and ICD-10 upgrades to its clients. The company's all five flagship products viz. Sunrise Clinical Manager 6.0, Sunrise Financial Manager, Allscripts Data Exchange 1.5, Enterprise EHR 11.4, and Professional EHR 12.0 were made generally available.However, global economic weakness presents a substantial risk for MDRX. Unlike the manufacturers of life-saving devices, the demand for the software company's products is closely tied to budgetary processes of clients.Moreover, MDRX's products have a long sales cycle which involves decision-making at different managerial levels. This increases the company's operating expenses and might result in cancellation of orders.On the other hand, companies such as Cerner Corp. (  ) and privately-held Epic compete against MDRX with a far simpler rationale for their products. Among them, Cerner have long ago developed unified and seamless products serving both inpatient and outpatient segments.Currently, MDRX carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In the last quarter, the company posted a neutral surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cerner is the largest pure-play HCIT company and its wide footprint, large reference-able client base and composite array of solutions make it an ideal candidate for investors seeking an exposure to the HCIT industry. The company continues to be a winner in the market for hospital clinical information technology with a significant presence in the rapidly growing ambulatory clinical IT market.However, Cerner faces fierce competition from reputed names including  (  ),  (  ), and  (  ). The intensity of competition may pressure both pricing and margin.For the second quarter of 2014, Cerner anticipates revenues between $790 and $830 million while adjusted earnings are expected between 36 and 37 cents per share, including share based compensation expense. These compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $810 million and 36 cents for revenues and earnings per share, respectively for the quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cerner is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. , the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate of 36 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of the same, stands at nil. The combination of Cerner's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and nil ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks #4 and #5 Ranks (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: CERN) has taken over the #225 spot from HCP, Inc. (Symbol: HCP), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Cerner Corp. (Symbol: CERN), the market cap is now $18.68 billion, versus HCP, Inc. (Symbol: HCP) at $18.64 billion.Below is a chart of Cerner Corp. versus HCP, Inc. plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (CERN plotted in blue; HCP plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CERN vs. HCP:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.At the closing bell, CERN is up about 2%, while HCP is up about 1.2% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n trading on Wednesday, shares of Cerner Corp.

The company's earnings plunged roughly 64% to $6,024 million or 10 cents per share from $16,903 million or 28 cents recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.

However, reported earnings were almost flat at $398.4 million or $1.13 per share during the year.Revenues in the year grew 9.2% to $2.9 billion, driven by rise in Support, maintenance and services and Reimbursed Travel revenues, partially offset by a fall in revenues from System sales.

Bookings revenues were $3.77 billion, up 20% over 2012.Gross margin for the quarter was 82.1%, up 370 basis points (bps) from 78.4% in the prior-year quarter due to record software levels and a lower mix of technology resale. For 2013, gross margin was 82.3%, up 510 bps from 77.2% in 2012, also driven by record software and lower technology resale.Operating margin in the quarter was 25.6% (before share-based compensation expense and the settlement charge), up 160 bps from the prior-year quarter. For the full year, operating margins increased 220 basis points to 25.1% due to a combination of ongoing operating efficiencies, fall in lower margin technology revenues and strength in software.CERN had cash and cash equivalents of $202.4 million as of Dec 28, 2013, down from $317.1 million as of Dec 29, 2012.

Adjusted earnings are expected between $1.51 and $1.55, after share based compensation expense. These compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $3.3 billion and $1.54 for revenues and earnings per share for the year.For 2014, CERN anticipates stronger free cash flow, driven by growth in operating cash flow, a decline in capital expenditures and flat-to-slightly-higher capitalized software. The company expects average capital expenditures in the range of $65 to $70 million per quarter, versus about $90 million in 2013.Currently, CERN retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, revenues increased on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong growth across all segments. We are impressed with the company's bookings performance which led to a 21% increase in total backlog. Meanwhile, Cerner is benefiting from the accelerated movement among medical providers to comply with federal EHR requirements. Further, its non-EHR offerings for the untapped HCIT market, such as population health management and care coordination are considered to be future growth drivers. However, the HCIT market is highly competitive, which puts considerable pressure on both pricing and margins. Moreover, a growing proportion of low-margin services and technology resale may further affect margins. Thus, we maintain our Neutral recommendation and set a target price of $70.00.Based in North Kansas City, MO, Cerner Corporation (CERN) provides healthcare information technology (HCIT) solutions worldwide.

Excluding the Epocrates and other revenues (consisting of third-party tenant revenues) totaling $17.2 million, core athenahealth revenues rose 27% to $134.3 million. Growth was led by expanded clientele for the company's offerings since the acquisition of Healthcare Data Services and strong athenaCoordinator business.Following the release of third quarter results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 remained the same at 33 cents per share. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 went down 6.0% to 63 cents over the same timeframe. ATHN now has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).athenahealth's unique business model makes it a strong niche provider of RCM services (athenaCollector) to small physician practices.

Further, its EHR product (athenaClinical) is a key player in ambulatory or physician billing.However, athenahealth's long-term goal of 30% top-line growth is challenging, given the consolidation trend among small physician practices.

Given its history, traders can expect very active trading in the upcoming After-hours session immediately following the company's release of its quarterly earnings. An analysis of historical premarket and after-hours trading activity and liquidity conditions in CERN following an earnings release indicates that the price change in the extended hours is likely to be of significant value in forecasting additional price movement in the following regular session.Analysts at MidnightTrader have tracked how CERN's stock price has reacted to quarterly earnings events the past both in the after-hours and following regular session. The result of that study is below.Over the last year, when shares of CERN rose in the extended-hours session in reaction to its earnings announcement, history shows that 25% of the time (1 out of the last 4 quarters) the stock posted additional gains in the following regular session by an average of 2.00%.Over the last year, when shares of CERN dropped in the extended-hours in reaction to its earnings announcement, there is limited evidence to suggest a follow-through in the same direction the next day.Our analysis of over a decade of company specific earnings related news and price data on over 5,000 US companies demonstrates that earnings event related trading opportunities can exist for those trading in the after-hours and premarket sessions. Certain stocks demonstrate a historical tendency to either underprice or overreact to earnings news in the extended-hours (the time when companies typically release earnings) relative to the following regular session close.This report was created using historical data and analysis provided by the Midnight Trader Pro service at MidnightTrader.com.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n Nov 29, we retained our Neutral recommendation on  (  ).

Currently, Cerner has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).CERN is the largest HCIT company and its wide footprint, wider client base and composite array of solutions make it an ideal candidate for investors seeking an exposure to the HCIT industry.

Now, federal rules aim to make medical records even more effective through the Affordable Care Act.But the effect on software makers has so far been murky. Many of the mandates under the Affordable Care Act won't be enforced until 2014. Medical software developers are seeing margins shrink now, however, as they invest in technology and marketing to try to capture bigger pieces of a market that is simultaneously advancing and consolidating.As the industry's Q1 reports have trickled out, results in the medical software group have varied, and at least a few have invoked the ire of investors.Accelrys (  ), one of biggest providers of software for medical research, announced Q1 earnings on April 30. The next day, shares plummeted 19%. They have since recovered only a small piece of that sell off.Company executives announced a 19% increase in product development spending, a bid to keep up with the shifting industry. Spending on marketing jumped 45%. As a result, Accelrys came in under Wall Street's forecast.\"Over nearly four years, we've been hard at work, building a competitively differentiated comprehensive suite of offerings,\" CEO Scipio Carnecchia told analysts. \"We remain convinced of the significant market opportunity available to us.\"Such spending on new development isn't unique to Accelrys.Athenahealth (  ), one of the largest electronic medical records providers, reported its research spending spiked 67% in Q1. ForMedAssets (  ), product development spending jumped 22.8%, while customer acquisition and integration expenses skyrocketed, growing 543% from the year-earlier period. Those expenses are expected to \"be incurred throughout the remainder of 2013 and well into 2014,\" said CEO John Bardis.Athenahealth reported its highest per-share profit growth in eight quarters on May 2. But management offered light full-year guidance, saying it will have to up its investment in new technology for clients. The result: Shares dropped 9% the following day and the stock has shown no signs of a rebound.\"The health care act is absolutely affecting these companies,\" said Judy Hanover, analyst with IDC Health Insights.The current struggles and investments being undertaken by medical software providers aren't necessarily bad for the industry, as long as investors can take a long view, observers say.\"We refer to them as foundational technologies for health care reform,\" Hanover said of the new electronic records technology that Athenahealth and others are building. \"They'll be the base.\"Medical software makers develop and sell software to a broad range of health care providers, from individual physician's practices to hospitals. The 12-stock Computer Software-Medical group was a top 20 player in the third quarter of 2011 among the 197 industries tracked by IBD. A third of its stocks still hold strong EPS ratings of 80 or higher. But first-quarter travails steepened the group's decline, sending it to a No. 153 ranking on Friday.The group had been on a roll following the 2009 economic stimulus bill, which included the $27 billion Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HiTech, act. That act subsidized health care providers in a push to convert the industry from paper to electronic records.As a result, medical information management providers likeAllscripts Healthcare Solutions (  ) boomed from late 2009 to late 2011. Sales growth at Allscripts reversed last year, and the company reported a 36% drop in Q4.The Affordable Care Act signed by Obama in 2010 has taken up the charge from the stimulus and pushed its effects further. It mandates that most -- if not all -- providers move health records online by 2014.It's not just the individual-patient electronic records industry that'll get a boost from Obama's health care reform. The bill more broadly will require a \"value-based\" Medicare and Medicaid payment system that tracks what providers charge for services. That and other types of records will be linked together to allow for more \"meaningful\" access, according to the American College of Emergency Physicians.\"So these companies were already benefiting from the stimulus incentive,\" Hanover said, \"and PPACA (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) intensified hospitals' needs for optimized records and operational goals that have been created by health reform.\"Electronic records leaderCerner (  ) registered slowdowns in both per-share profit and revenue growth from the year-earlier period. Shares took a quick hit, but rebounded quickly. In fact, Cerner's shares are trading up 25% so far this year, picking off new highs with solid support at their 10-week moving average.Cerner in the first quarter topped per-share profit estimates, even though sales came in low, at $680 million versus the $708.5 million that analysts had been modeling. But analysts watching Cerner were more interested in \"bookings,\" which are in part a measure of deferred revenue. Bookings were $802 million, above expectations. They were \"meaningfully ahead of consensus estimates of $744 million,\" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Glen Santangelo, who rates Cerner stock as neutral, or hold.So, despite slowing sales growth at Cerner, the future is bright, says Santangelo.\"At the risk of sounding like a broken record, Cerner reported better-than-expected bookings, solid operating metrics and strong cash flow,\" Santangelo wrote, adding that management remains \"bullish on the long-term.\"There are some worries about decelerating growth in electronic records, Santangelo says, although pending benefits from Obama's health care law, as well as an aging U.S. population, could hold investor interest.Deteriorating health among the baby boomer generation is driving considerable consolidation within the health care industry. Large players are buying up smaller players, Cerner Vice President of Client Organization Zane Burke told analysts on a conference call in late April.Health care providers increasingly want to control every level of care, which could help cut their costs. That consolidation is a positive for Cerner, Burke says.Think of it this way: If a Cerner client buys a smaller health care provider that doesn't already use its technology, that smaller provider will undoubtedly be shifted to Cerner products.\"Health systems (are) buying hospitals, physician practices and other venues to control more of the continuum of care, as they position themselves for the population health era,\" said Burke. \"All of these trends have been positive for Cerner and we expect them to continue.\"About 60% of all health care providers are now using electronic health care records, according to research from IDC. That's a big jump from 2009, when just about 20% were using electronic records.Industry leaders Cerner and Athenahealth could be considered outliers in some respects, because they're using Web-based and cloud technology well, says analyst Hanover.\"A lot of venders in the space are not making optimal use of those tools,\" Hanover said.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["eading vendor of cloud-based services for physician practices and inpatient settings,  (  ) recently reported that it will guarantee ICD-10 compliance for new customers who come on stream prior to Jun 30, 2014.In other words, fresh Athenahealth customers on athenaCommunicator, athenaCollector and athenaClinicals offerings will be in accordance with ICD-10 (before the deadline) or else the company will abstain from charges until the benchmarks are achieved.

The share price of this leading provider of Electronic Health Care (EHR) solutions for ambulatory care and hospital settings has been on an upward trend since it reported fourth quarter 2012 results on Feb 7.A positive fourth quarter earnings surprise and improved business prospects following the acquisition of Epocrates facilitated the shares of Athenahealth to gather momentum and achieve a new high.Athenahealth reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of 18 cents beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents. Reported net income in the fourth quarter increased 11.5% year over year to $5.9 million (or 16 cents per share).Athenahealth revealed, earlier in Mar, that it accomplished the takeover of Epocrates, a pioneer of mobile health workflows and point-of-care (POC) health apps. The composite company is well placed to bring to market fresh mobile workflows to meet the data requirements of clinicians. Furthermore, Athenahealth's provider network of 40,000 now encompasses over a million clinicians from the Epocrates set up.Following several prominent client wins, Athenahealth is better positioned to win deals in the enterprise segment.On the negative side, the Stimulus which promoted EHR is gradually being withdrawn. While greenfield opportunities are shrinking, the replacement market is nonetheless growing.Athenahealth is more expensive than its peer group as per most metrics such as forward P/E, price-to-sales ratio and price-to-book ratio. However, given the company's higher long-term growth rate of 25% versus the peer group at 19.1%, the premium valuation may well be justified.Athenahealth's web-based deployment provides a low-cost scalable service while its flexible rules engine leads to higher efficiency in claims settlement. The Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based approach allows for a more flexible delivery mechanism that helps Athenahealth win deals. The company has traditionally enjoyed high customer satisfaction rates, which facilitates a larger number of referrals.Athenahealth's unique business model makes it a strong provider of RCM services (athenaCollector) designed for small physician practices. Its EHR product (athenaClinicals) is a key player in ambulatory settings. We believe that sales of athenaClinicals are likely to remain robust. In addition, the company will harness its newer products, namely athenaCommunicator and athenaCoordinator.Athenahealth should benefit from its extensive athenaCollector client base, as only a minority of its subscriber base also utilizes athenaClinicals. Cross selling represents a real growth opportunity in the near term. In this regard, Athenahealth has made rapid strides in capturing the EHR business of physician practices.

Allscripts and Quintiles plan to collectively develop software solutions to improve the drug development process and demonstrate the empirical worth of biopharmaceutical products.The agreement marks yet another joint activity by the two companies. In an industry where medical errors and safety issues are of prime concern, Quintiles' expertise with data intelligence and trial services are expected to add value to Allscripts clinical analyses as well as enhance patient outcomes.The partnership is expected to benefit biopharmaceutical companies, providers, patients and payers. According to Allscripts, the partnership will fasten the commercialization of new drugs and discoveries to improve standard of patient care.Allscripts and Quintiles will develop relevant products to adequately reduce factors that hinder clinical research, analysis, outcomes, education and proof of new compound safety, effectiveness and value. The focus will also be on late-phase research, recruiting for and monitor of clinical studies and post-market surveillance. A post-market surveillance for newly developed drugs is soon expected to become an increasingly common requirement.Management at Quintiles is enthused about its alliance with Allscripts. Quintiles reasserted its commitment towards steps needed to eliminate industry specific bottlenecks with this partnership.The data intelligence available at Quintiles can accelerate the process of drug development. Consequently, the partnership is expected to allow consumers to leverage de-identified longitudinal data from various sources in a manner which is aligned with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The HIPAA-compliant data will be of further use to peer group companies as it can endow other companies with information required to improve efficiency and evaluation associated with drug development.The HCIT market remains competitive and price sensitive. Among others, Allscripts faces strong competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).However, optimism about the growth prospects of select HCIT service providers remains high under the Obama Administration. It has passed the stimulus package in May 2009, aimed at increasing the use of Electronic Health Record systems by medical practitioners.The strategic alliance to exploit available research opportunities has long been overdue on the part of Allscripts. A faster and efficient drug development process will benefit everyone associated with the industry.

The inking of these two deals is subsequent to Athenahealth's operationalization of its services at Three Lower Counties Community Services and Hudson Headwaters Health Network.As community based and federally funded entities, FQHCs provide primary care to all age groups, irrespective of a person's ability to pay for care. Community Health Programs is a multi-location FQHC in western Massachusetts. Manet Community Health Center is another multiple location FQHC based in North Quincy, Massachusetts. Both FQHCs are slated to implement Athenahealth's range of offerings comprising athenaCollector, athenaClinical and athenaCommunicator.Athenahealth's web-based deployment provides a low-cost scalable service while its flexible rules engine leads to higher efficiency in claims settlement. The Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based approach allows for a more flexible delivery mechanism that helps Athenahealth to win deals. The company has traditionally enjoyed high customer satisfaction rates, which facilitates a larger number of referrals.Athenahealth's unique business model makes it a strong provider of RCM services (athenaCollector) to small physician practices. Its EHR product (athenaClinicals) is a key player in ambulatory settings. We believe that sales of athenaClinicals are likely to remain robust, given the opportunity for physicians to earn incentive payments under the federal stimulus. In addition, the company will harness its newer products, namely athenaCommunicator and athenaCoordinator.The company should benefit from its extensive athenaCollector client base, as only a minority of its subscriber base also utilizes athenaClinicals.

That's huge news, given that the GSA has about three million civilian employees.\"The stock spiked higher on big volume on the news, and broke out to a new high two days later as the broad market (thanks to Spain) rallied to provide a supportive environment.\"That means the stock moves to near the top of my watch list. If it does well, I may write about it again.\"But if you really want to be assured of continuing coverage of the stock for as long as it remains attractive, I recommend you take a look at  , which recommended the stock a month ago and continues to follow it.\"---Well, today I'm writing about Concur again, but not because it's done well--though it has; it's up 2.6% while the S&P 500 is up 1.3%.I'm writing about it because among the responses to that column were two that stood out.The first was bullish on the stock, yet distracted by insignificant details, writing this:\"Your article on this stock was very interesting and I am going to take a serious look at the stock.\"There are two points in the article that deserve comment.\"First, the assumption that a contract with GSA is great news. Yes, there will be plenty of business. However it may cut down the profit margins, rather than raise them. How so? Contrary to popular opinion, not all elements of the government are the same. While Congress regularly encourages contracts in the defense industry, which have generous terms for the contractor such as the no-bid contracts given to Cheney's company, most contracts are very competitive. Unfortunately, the politics of the situation give the impression that all contracts are wasteful. (That goes along with the totally infantile belief that government is a failure unless I get 100% of what I want.) So let's be clear here, a contract with the notoriously penny-pinching GSA is not going to be generous. Sometimes those decisions are pound foolish, but when the corporate culture is low cost forever, such things happen.\"Second, when I retired as a DOD civilian in 2001, there were about 2 million civilian employees in all branches of the federal government. It has not grown since then, and certainly not by 50%. So where would the 3 million figure come from? By adding in the number of those in uniform, i.e., the military? I strongly suspect that is what the press release about the contract with GSA said. If not, it was wrong.\"We have enough trouble with misperceptions about the federal government without a noted publisher adding to the lies circulating out there. By the way, about half of the federal work force is in the DOD.\"--J.R.The second correspondent was bearish on the stock and wrote this:\"You must be kidding. I have followed this company for several years and in my opinion this company is run more for the benefit of the officers and directors than I personally have found for any other publicly traded company in my universe. Up until 2010, the company reported earnings on a GAAP basis and earned .50 for the year. In 2009, the company reported .38 and raised cash by selling stock in the company to Am Express. At that time, CNQR had no long-term debt. The following year they issued bonds and raised around 350M. Interest wiped out GAAP earnings so they began reporting and issuing guidance on a non-GAAP basis as GAAP earnings dropped to a negative .20. As non-GAAP earnings dropped, they became creative and started reporting non-GAAP, pre-tax earnings. Who else reports earnings in this manner? Non-GAAP for 2009 was .72, 2010 was .76 and 2011 was .59 while revenues grew 20%+ per year. They found that by greatly increasing stock-based compensation they could increase their non-GAAP pre tax earnings. In 2009, stock-based compensation amounted to .23 per share. In 2010, it increased to .37 and in 2011, it jumped to a whopping .65 per share (10% of revenues). The Chairman of the Board and the CEO have both sold stock over the last three years netting over 25M each. Not bad for a company not making any money.\"The balance sheet shows intangible assets of $115M and goodwill of another 281M. There is also another 28M in acquisition-related contingent consideration on the balance sheet. Combined this equals around 38% of assets. Back out debt and inventories and you have practically nothing left. Is this company's stock really worth $65? Where can it go from here? Has someone forgot his homework?\"This may be the case when a stock's chart looks appealing, but any type of fundamental analyses says you need to rethink the recommendation. CNQR is presently selling at 45 x 2012 cash flow. When do you anticipate they will actually report any GAAP earnings? You can buy Cerner (  ) for about the same price!\"I have been a subscriber for many years to various Cabot publications. Usually you are right on with your advice. I hope you will rethink this particular recommendation and step up and let your readers know you may have made a mistake.\"--A.A.J.Senior Vice President, Investments (A really big bank)---The first correspondent has my apologies with regard to the numbers of GSA employees. When I wrote the original recommendation, I had no success finding a reliable source for any different number, so I used the three million found online. I have no confidence in that number, but it doesn't affect my analysis anyway.Similarly, the price GSA pays for Concur's services doesn't bother me either. I trust that management has decided the improved volume will be worth it, even if margins shrink a bit.What matters to me is the way the stock reacted to the news, and the way the stock is still acting today!You see, I learned long ago that the stock market is smarter than me. It's also smarter than those two correspondents above and yes, smarter than you, too. Each and every one of us is wrong from time to time, but the market is never wrong. And the market is pushing CNQR up.Why?Because growing numbers of investors are having increasingly positive opinions about the company's prospects!Some of these investors are discovering the company for the first time, while some have been following it for longer, and are impressed with its recent rapid growth--at 28% in the latest quarter, this growth is accelerating! In sum, the buyers are in control, overpowering sellers, and thus creating a long-term uptrend in the stock's price.But what about the arguments of my second correspondent, who knows much more than me about the firm's metrics?Reading them through, I'm impressed. If I were a novice investor, I'd say, \"This guy knows what he's talking about. I'm not touching that stock with a ten-foot pole.\"But I'm not a novice, and I say those numbers don't matter--because the stock tells me they don't matter.Sure, those numbers matter if you're intent on finding undervalued stocks and holding long-term until they reach fair value.But CNQR was recommended by Cabot Top Ten Trader, and subscribers to that publication don't want slow long-term growth. They want fast growth! They want stocks with a high probability of going up in the weeks ahead, and whether these stocks have strong or weak balance sheets and high or low valuations don't bother them.In fact, these things don't bother a lot of investors, which is why great growth stocks are usually viewed as too expensive by fundamental analysts!Whether it's Amazon.com, eBay, and Crox in their heydays or Ulta Salon, Michael Kors, Mellanox, Cirrus Logic today, it's not valuation that matters, it's growth potential and upside momentum that matter.The caveat, of course, is that once momentum fades, it's important that you sell these stocks. Projections of growth and dreams of glory are all well and good as long as the stock is going up, but as I said, the market is always right, so when a growth stock turns down, my opinion of it turns down, too.By the way,  , recommended as an alternative by my second correspondent, looks good, too, but it's more mature than Concur and more widely respected, which means it has less upside potential and is more likely to be a slower grower.---Another query--more timeless-- from a subscriber was this:\"Could you tell me if there are some differences between those terms you employ to comment on your recommendations such as weakness, decline, pullback, dip and correction. Is it the safest way to buy a stock making a new historical high?\"--G.S. Hollywood, FloridaMy answer:\"As to the terms used, all refer to price action. Some are synonymous; sometimes there is a distinction.\"'Weakness' is imprecise, but generally reflects performance over a longer time period, which is not bad, but is at least lacking vigor if not actually losing ground.\"'Decline' is simply loss of price over a period of time. It could be a day; it could be a decade.\"'Pullback' is a decline in the context of an uptrend over a longer time period. A pullback generally lasts a matter of days or a week or two.\"'Dip' is similar, though frequently over a shorter time period. And it is not necessarily in the context of an uptrend. There may be no obvious trend.\"'Correction' is similar to pullback, though usually over a longer time period, as long as 13 weeks in our book.\"As for stocks hitting new highs, growth-seeking investors very much like stocks that have the power and sponsorship that enables them to hit new highs. Growth investors like it best when they are able to buy these stocks at the end of a classic correction. Generally, the briefer the correction, the better--because the odds are greater that the uptrend is intact.\"However, a very long correction that builds a solid base can be a launching pad for a fine advance. 'The bigger the base, the bigger the move.' is a truism. Trouble is, sometimes the move is down, and the longer the base, the lower the odds that the uptrend remains intact.\"Hope that helps!\"Yours in pursuit of wisdom and wealth,Timothy LuttsPublisherThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["e upgrade our rating for  (  ) to Outperform.

Bookings came to $194.6 million, a decrease of 8.4% year over year.We view the reduced guidance as indicative of the company's weakened competitive position. Moreover, the company's ability to integrate large acquisitions remains to be proven.

We believe that Allscripts is well positioned in the fast growing business of selling EHR/EMR to physician practices as well as inpatient settings.The acquisition of Eclipsys provides the company with an acute care product for sale in concert with its ambulatory services.

It's a wise move, but not for the reasons you may think. Cash is not just \"safe,\" but it is also firepower for the next major upward move in the stockmarket . Right now, the  is tumbling, but it's crucial for you to be in a position to jump into the market when a bottom has come in. You'll know it's there when the market is no longer plunging (or occasionally surging) and instead is trading in a tighter range.So if you don't have cash on hand right now, where do you find it? Among your portfolio's best performers. It may seem counterintuitive to part with your most impressive stock picks right now, but you need to know two things. First, they may eventually succumb to the current weak stock market, and their likely higher-than-normal price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios means they could fall by a hefty amount. Second, the losers in your portfolio are just as often a victim of poor  , and can often be oversold in these times of distress.With that in mind, I've compiled a list of 2012's top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 and S&P 400 (which is comprised of  stocks). Every one is up at least 25% since the year began, and all sport a forward multiple that is at least 50% higher than the  (based on both 2012 and 2013  forecasts).I got a chance to dig into this group, and have drawn a clear conclusion. These stocks have mostly moved up for justifiable reasons and don't necessarily make good short candidates. But in many instances, it's simply hard to see any further upside from here. So converting them into cash right now makes ample sense -- especially if you think the market may slip further from here.Take  as an example. The company caught the market off-guard in mid-April by announcing the sale of roughly 800 patents (and the licensing of 300 more) to  for roughly $1.06 billion.  instantly shot up, but now that this one-time event has passed, investors should realize this is a company still struggling for relevance. First-quarter sales and operating profits were roughly 5% below year-ago levels. And though management has done a nice job of stemming even deeper erosion, it's hard to see how AOL will again be a growing company. is another stock that may have already locked in much of its gains. The maker of energy drinks has been a very solid growth story, and has an impressive stock chart to show for it.Yet the company's current growth spurt may be a bit deceiving. Sales grew between 10% and 15% in 2008, 2009 and 2010, before shooting up 31% to $1.7 billion in 2011. Sales are on track to rise another 25% this year, surpassing the $2 billion mark. But it's unclear if sales can keep rising at a fast pace. Analysts currently expect sales growth to slow to around 15% in 2013 and 2014. But one never knows if a market is partially saturated or fully saturated until the moment that growth cools.Meanwhile, it's hard to find a beverage stock that trades for nearly 30 times next year's  forecasts -- and for good reason. The broader beverage category grows very slowly, and the energy drink segment will eventually feel that pull as well.Part of the reason this stock is so richly-valued is that rumors have swirled that  or others might want to buy the company. I discount those rumors, but if I'm wrong, then this would be a bad stock to short. Yet it surely looks like a good candidate for profit-taking, as expectations of a further expansion in the forward multiple seem hard to digest.Lastly, investors have done very well by investing in  , but caution is warranted here as well. Cerner's management is outstanding, capitalizing on the many advantages offered up by the transition toward digital medical records. But a pair of companies in this segment --  and  -- have stumbled badly recently due to poor execution, but also partially due to a market slowdown in the face of the Supreme Court's review of health care reform. This isn't to suggest that Cerner is primed to deliver a bad quarter, but the forward multiple looks pretty rich for a company in an industry showing signs of some growing pains. It would be nuts to short a great company like Cerner, but perhaps equally unwise to expect further major upside if you own it.[block:block=16]Risks to Consider:  In a rising market, it's often wise to \"let your winners ride.\" But in a much tougher market, winning stocks can quickly become vulnerable stocks. You may be able to re-purchase these stocks at lower prices if the market's downward pull finally affects them. But for now, the wisestoption may be to sell the stocks on this list.[  If you haven't heard about this unique opportunity, then I want to tell you about it now.

Its first quarter earnings of $0.51 a share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Cerner remains the trend setter among pure-play, publicly-traded healthcare IT (HCIT) vendors.We believe Cerner is one of the better placed clinical technology vendors to benefit from high HCIT spending over the next few years. The company is diversified not only on a global basis but serves both hospitals and ambulatory outfits. Its integrated solutions have captured market share.Long-term investors may consider Cerner, which serves a sizeable installed hospital base that requires composite clinically-focused applications complying with meaningful use requirements, reimbursement problems and complex coding challenges. :We are downgrading our recommendation on  (  ) to Underperform from Neutral due to the lack of any significant growth catalyst amid the prevailing interest rate, market and currency risks. China Life's full year 2011 earnings declined steeply from the prior year, due to low premium income and increased impairment losses.Operating cash flow also declined substantially due to increased claim expenses and adverse changes in the fair values of securities. Despite a strong brand name, significant competition on the domestic front limits earnings growth.Our six-month target price of $36.00 equates to 25.9x our earnings estimate for 2012. Combined with the $0.81 per ADR annual dividend, this target price implies an expected total return of a negative 8.7% over that period. This is consistent with our Underperform recommendation on the ADRs.Latest Posts on the Zacks  : (  ), one of the world's leaders in manufacturing and marketing of a range of branded packaged meat, bakery and beverage products, is scheduled to report its third quarter 2012 financial results on Thursday, May 3, 2012, before the market opens.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 25 cents a share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects revenues to be $1,944 million for the quarter.Sara Lee, which faces stiff competition from  (  ) and  (  ), posted earnings of 27 cents per share that climbed 28.6% from 21 cents in the year-ago period. Earnings also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents by 8%.Net sales for the quarter climbed 5.8% to $2,044 million compared with $1,932 million in the prior-year period. Revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,153 million.(Read our full coverage on this earnings report:  ).Over the past 30 days, one of the ten analysts covering Sara Lee has revised estimate upwards for the current quarter. For fiscal 2012, two out of the ten analysts have revised their estimates, of which one increased and the other decreased.Sara Lee is on track to split the company into two publicly traded firms: an international coffee and tea business and a North American retail, foodservice and specialty meats business. The spin-off, which is expected to be completed by June this year, is part of Sara Lee's plan to trim its portfolio in order to provide the best foundation for a strong and focused business.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased from 24 cents to 25 cents per share for the current quarter. For fiscal 2012, the estimate increased by a penny to 93 cents over the same period.The overall positive revisions by analysts indicate faith in the pending spin-off, which will allow the company to focus on its most profitable food and beverage businesses.With respect to earnings surprises, Sara Lee has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters. Over the last four quarters, its earnings surprise ranged from a negative 4.00% to a positive 8.00%, with the average earnings surprise being a positive 3.29%.We are encouraged by Sara Lee's focus on leveraging its consumer brands to generate sales growth.

The healthcare reform aims to end the discrimination policy of insurance companies, create competition amongst insurers through the establishment of health insurance exchanges, add value to the overall healthcare system and reduce premiums.However, the legislation has many detractors who have contested several of its stated benefits and consider it another entitlement program that the country can ill afford.Different parts of the legislation have been challenged in federal courts, with detractors attempting to challenge the scope of the law or even declare some parts -- or all of it -- unconstitutional.The Supreme Court heard arguments on certain aspects of these cases in March 2012, including the constitutionality of the individual mandate and expansion of Medicaid in 26 states. Both these provisions are scheduled to be implemented in 2014.The individual mandate has drawn the most amount of attention. This mandate requires all uninsured Americans to purchase a minimum level of health insurance coverage; if they don't they will be fined. The mandate is being viewed as unconstitutional and the Supreme Court is expected to rule on this and other aspects of the Act this Thursday.As mentioned above, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has the potential to change U.S. healthcare as we know it. The healthcare sector is highly exposed to the decision, with several companies having a huge stake in the issue.While it is difficult to predict the Court's ruling, the most likely scenarios could involve the Court revoking or upholding the legislation in its entirety. Another scenario could see the Court omitting the individual mandate and other provisions.Each of these outcomes will affect healthcare companies in varying degrees. The stakes are high with several companies likely to lose billions of dollars depending on the ruling.In the event of the individual mandate being declared unconstitutional or repealed without corresponding changes to other provisions of the legislation, insurance players will face the risk of adverse selection. Provisions that require revision include the guaranteed issue and renewal requirements, prohibition on pre-existing condition exclusions and rating restrictions. If, however, the provisions are left unchanged, insurers will see an increase in medical claims.If the entire law is passed without any amendments and subsequently implemented, then insurers will have to shell out huge sums to align their businesses with the changed landscape.The sector will not be spared even if most of the provisions of the reform are held back. The health insurance sector will continue to be under tight observation and scrutiny. Some new rules will come into effect to rein the steep rise in healthcare costs adopted by many of the insurance companies over the past several years.Companies that should benefit significantly if the Act is shot down entirely include medical device as well as insurance companies. Under the ACA, medical device companies are required to pay an excise tax of 2.3% from 2013. The scrapping of the Act will provide relief to companies like  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Meanwhile, companies like  (  ), which provide managed care plans to large and small employers, individuals, Medicaid and senior markets, stand to benefit if the Court deems Obamacare unconstitutional. In such a scenario, these companies would not be forced to provide coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and would be in a position to charge higher premiums.Insurance companies like  (  ) and  (  ) should benefit if the Act is repealed. Although some provisions of the healthcare reform legislation such as the establishment of minimum medical loss ratios (MLR) are already effective, further changes including the annual fees on health insurance companies, the excise tax on high premium insurance policies and the guaranteed coverage requirements, will come into effect after 2014.Therefore, revoking the Act would be beneficial to these companies. However, it's important to note that these companies would be losing out on the prospect of covering an additional 32 million people.We note that insurance companies like UnitedHealthcare, a  (  ) company, will continue to offer important healthcare insurance protections that were included in the 2010 healthcare reform law, no matter how the US Supreme Court rules.UnitedHealthcare said that it will continue provisions related to coverage of preventive healthcare services, coverage of dependents up to age 26, lifetime policy limits, rescissions and appeals.Sectors rooting for the upholding of the Act include hospitals and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) like  (  ) and  (  ), as well as pharma companies. While Obamacare would provide HMOs with significant opportunities for membership growth in existing as well as new markets, pharma companies would also see an increase in revenues with 32 million uninsured people gaining coverage.The individual mandate of the Act provides hospitals like  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) with the chance to reduce losses resulting from the treatment of uninsured patients.Finally, there are some companies that should benefit irrespective of the Act being repealed or upheld. These are electronic health records companies like  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). Obamacare requires practitioners who have been maintaining paper records to switch to electronic medical records. With several businesses transitioning to electronic records, electronic health records companies should continue to witness demand irrespective of the Supreme Court's ruling.The bottom line is that the much-awaited Supreme Court ruling will remove an overhang which has been affecting healthcare stocks ever since the Act was passed.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["eading healthcare information technology (\"HCIT\") solutions provider  (  ) reported first quarter earnings per share of 51 cents beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents and the year-ago earnings per share of 37 cents.Net income rose 37.4% year over year to $88.7 million (or 51 cents per share) due to buoyant bookings.Revenues for the first quarter rose 30% year over year to $641.2 million, handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $578 million.In the reported quarter, higher revenue from Support, Maintenance and Services (up 18.4% to $403.9 million) was supported by robust System sales (up 60.9% to $225.8 million). Revenues from Reimbursed Travel were up 11.6% to about $11.5 million.Bookings amounted to $652.3 million, up 24% year over year, a record high for the company in any first quarter. Total revenue backlog came to $6.27 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 22% year over year, including $5.57 billion of contract backlog and $704 million of support and maintenance backlog.Gross margin for the quarter dropped to 75.4% from 81.6% a year ago. Operating margin increased to 19.9% from 19.1% in the prior-year quarter.Cerner ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $893.9 million, up 46.3% on a year-over-year basis. Total long-term debt and other obligations rose 45.1% year over year to about $107.9 million.Cash flow from operation was $162.7 million in the reported quarter, up 28.6% year over year. Free cash flow was $113.3 million, up 33.8%.For the second quarter of 2012, the company forecasts sales in a band of $620 million and $640 million and adjusted earnings per share, before share based compensation expense, of 52 cents to 54 cents. Fresh bookings for the quarter are projected between $675 million and $715 million. Cerner projects stock-based compensation costs to dilute second quarter earnings by about 3 cents.For fiscal 2012, the company forecasts sales in the region of $2,525 million and $2,600 million. Adjusted earnings per share, before share based compensation expense, are expected to be in the neighborhood of $2.25 and $2.32. Cerner projects stock-based compensation costs to dilute fiscal earnings by about 12 cents to 14 cents.We believe long-term investors may consider Cerner, which serves a sizeable installed hospital base that requires composite clinically-focused applications complying with \"meaningful use\" requirements, reimbursement problems and complex coding challenges. The company has long-standing, integrated and seamless solutions for both inpatient and ambulatory settings.On the negative side, the federal Stimulus program will gradually wind down. Cerner faces stiff competition from established HCIT players, such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) and many others in a crowded field.

Yet without the wind at your back, marking steady gains becomes that much more challenging. Indeed, April represents the first weak month for the market in quite some time. With the exception of a very tiny pullback in November, the market had been rallying for much of the past six months.Yet market pullbacks bring fresh opportunity because some individual stocks can take really deep hits if they don't have a rising broader market to support them. Consider this item: 16 stocks fell at least 30% in April (among companies with at least $250 million in  ). That's the largest group since September.To be sure, most of these plunging stocks deserve the lambasting they've gotten.  , for example, looked vastly  when the month began. After a recent sharp pullback,  still look overvalued, as I've noted  .And it should be no surprise to see  and  on this list. These companies were so richly valued this past winter that they had only way to go -- down.For that matter, the ongoing troubles at  should have never led to a temporary rebound in the first place. Though I initially suggested shorting this wireless services provider when it traded above $6 back in the summer of 2010, my suggestion  to keep shorting the stock has been more challenging. Shares subsequently rebounded but are falling anew and could still head well lower as cash balances evaporate.Yet the batch of April losers also brings potential opportunities. As an example, the sharp drop in  , appears overdone, as I noted  .Two other stocks in the table above merit your research, as they could make solid rebound candidates.Back in 2010, this company acquired Eclypsis, creating the health care industry's broadest platform for electronic medical records. In the face of looming changes that would eventually compel doctors and hospitals to put away the pen and paper and create fully digital patient records, this stock should be a home run right now. Instead, this will likely go down as one of the most poorly executed mergers of all time.Every quarter brought a fresh excuse as to why the two companies' disparate platforms were taking a long-time to merge. Clashes at the newly joined-at-the-hip respective management teams didn't help. Meanwhile, rivals such as  quietly stepped in and poached customers.If you did the math a few years ago, then the combined entity looked like it might be able to generate $1.50 in  ) or more by now. Instead, the company will be lucky to make half that much.You can only imagine the boardroom infighting when Allscripts announced first quarter  of $0.12, half the already-lowered forecast that had been in place. Several executives and board members abandoned ship, and the company's new Chairman, Dennis Chookaszain, must figure out how to salvage the mess.Value investors may have a different take on the situation. The ongoing turmoil, which has caused the stock to fall by half in just the past three months, has left shares sporting some intriguing metrics. For example, Allscripts now trades for 1.4 times trailing sales. For rival Cerner, that figure is 6.0. Those numbers happen to be identical for each firm in terms of price-to-book (1.4 and 6.0) as well.The challenge ahead is to stabilize operations and perhaps find a buyer. You should expect little from Allscripts in the June quarter, but it will be quite interesting to see what the new Chairman has to say about a  strategy at that time.2. Tempur-Pedic (  )Investors often react emotionally when a company disappoints them. This mattress maker had developed a strong investor base by boosting sales more than 25% in 2010 and again in 2011 (to $1.42 billion).  growth was even more impressive, rising from around $1 per share in 2009 to $2.16 in 2010 to $3.18 in 2011.So when the mattress maker recently warned that growth would cool in 2012, investors sprinted away. Shares closed at $83.75 on April 19, the day that guidance was issued, and fell to $66 the next day and now sit below $60.As analysts at Hilliard Lyon subsequently noted, \"while consensus expectations had apparently gotten a bit too enthusiastic, the reaction strikes us as equally overwrought.\"The sell-off led Hilliard Lyons to raise its rating from \"neutral\" to \"buy,\" along with a $70  . They see earnings exceeding $4 per share in 2013, despite the global economic headwinds, as the company expands into additional markets.[block:block=16]Goldman Sachs carries a loftier $82 price target (down from $90), noting that management guidance now appears too conservative. They see a company generating very impressive  , which should hit $6.25 per share by 2014. That means this former highflyer now sports a free cash flow  in excess of 10%, using 2014 projections.Risks to Consider:  Allscripts is emerging as a deep value play with potentially significant upside, while Tempur-Pedic simply looks like a good company delivering a tepid outlook. Upside is likely more muted for this stock relative to Allscripts, but the recent sell-off looks like a clear overreaction.[  If you haven't heard about this unique opportunity, then I want to tell you about it now.

The company reported earnings per share in third-quarter fiscal 2012, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Quality Systems offers an electronic health record (\"EHR\") product and is benefiting from the migration of ambulatory and inpatient practices to EHR under the federal Stimulus. The company has made multiple acquisitions to bolster organic growth. Its acquisition of IntraNexus, in early 2011, is expected to facilitate its progress in the small hospital segment.In recent times, Quality Systems has not only well managed its ambulatory clinical deals but, in addition, it has nicely executed several enterprise contracts. The company is winning traction with its inpatient package for small hospitals. In the end, however, we believe that Quality Systems' success on the inpatient side will be limited to a relatively small number of hospitals.Revenue growth was impressive in most segments and was driven by the growing client base. Quality Systems continues to expand its recurring revenue stream (estimated to be slightly over 60% of total revenues), which provides further room for encouragement.We believe the company is in a strong position to undertake merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. We also believe that the company's dividend record, unusual for growth companies, holds some promise for investors.The business is crowded with many players operating in the upper end of the market where Quality Systems has traditionally been strong. We harbor doubts about the company's ability to penetrate the low end of the EHR market where it faces competition from lower-priced, cloud-based EHR models.We are concerned about execution risk emanating from Quality Systems' entry into the rural inpatient market. Also, on the negative side, it competes in a fragmented market with larger competitors. The market is price sensitive, and vulnerable to price cutting.

Fresh bookings for the quarter are projected between $560 million and $600 million.

For fiscal 2011, sales were $324.1 million, up 32%, squeaking past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $324 million. The company posted collections of $2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 25%.As for the two reporting segments, sales from Business Services were up 33% to $89.3 million while Implementation and Other revenues rose 41.7% to $3.2 million.Revenues were mainly bolstered by continued adoption of the company's revenue cycle management (\"RCM\") offering athenaCollector and its electronic health record (\"EHR\") service athenaClinicals by physicians. In addition, usage of the newer products athenaCommunicator and athenaCoordinator gathered momentum.Utilization of athenaCollector by medical providers and physicians grew 20.7% and 20.9%, respectively, year over year, in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the use of athenaClinicals by medical providers (as well as physicians) almost doubled year over year. The usage of athenaCommunicator shot up exponentially to 5,830 medical providers (of whom 4,098 were physicians).Adjusted gross margin dropped to 64.2% in the quarter from 66.3% a year ago while adjusted EBITDA was down to 22.4% from 29.1%. Adjusted operating margin dipped to 17.2% from 24.5% a year ago.Athenahealth exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments of $138.5 million, up 13.7% year over year.Athenahealth continued, in 2011, with its effort to create a national health information system. Its efforts have been successful thus far with the launch of athenaCoordinator and permission from the regulatory authorities to build a bilateral system for health information exchange.Athenahealth's web-based deployment provides a low-cost scalable service while its flexible rules engine leads to higher efficiency in claims settlement. The Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based approach allows for a more flexible delivery mechanism that is expected to help Athenahealth win deals. The company has traditionally enjoyed high customer satisfaction rates, which facilitate a larger number of referrals.Athenahealth's unique business model makes it a strong provider of RCM services (athenaCollector) to small physician practices. Its EHR product (athenaClinical) is a key player in ambulatory settings. We believe that sales of athenaClinical are likely to remain robust, given the opportunity for physicians to earn incentive payments under the federal stimulus. In addition, the company will harness its newer products, namely athenaCommunicator and athenaCoordinator.The company should benefit from its extensive athenaCollector client base, as only a minority of its subscriber base also utilizes athenaClinical. Cross selling represents a real growth opportunity in the near term. In this regard, Athenahealth has made rapid strides in capturing the EHR business of physician practices. However, this segment is shrinking as hospitals increasingly absorb physician practices.Athenahealth has geared itself for the enterprise segment through its strategic alliance with  (  ) and the acquisition of Proxsys, both earlier in 2011. The company has recently signed on, and executed several enterprise-sized deals, which provide it with a credible and reference-able client base.Though the federal stimulus will gradually wind down, the replacement market is growing. Competition is fierce and larger competitors may benefit from the incumbency factor. Industry stalwarts, such as  (  ), offer long-standing seamless products integrating inpatient and ambulatory-care systems.  (  ) and  (  ) are two other well-known competitors in a crowded field.We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Athenahealth.

Further, the need for electronic data storage solutions is also growing at a faster space in this arena, replacing paper-based records.Computerized health information systems have become popular over their two decades of existence, and EMR remains at a core of this technology for providing integrated healthcare solutions. The market has registered a boom in the last couple of years following federal government legislation that requires medical providers to modernize their systems.The addition of cloud-based technology has further enhanced this service in terms of security and reliability of records, and generating increased market traction. This mode of paperless and easily accessible medical records has aided many healthcare professionals and is expected to dominate a significant market share in future given its growing importance.According to sources, the electronic health records market is expected to reach approximately $6 billion by 2015 in the U.S. As a result, telecom companies like TELUS are aggressively focusing on this new genre of technological advancement.Although the apparent gain on this deal is yet to realized by Telus, we believe that given Wolf Medical system's 13 years of experience in cloud-based EMR solutions in an industry dominated by big players like  (  )  (  )  and  (  ), Telus has a fair chance of seeing success in this technological front and gain advantage over its peers like  (  ) and  (  ), which have yet to venture into this business. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ), a leading player in the health care information technology (\"HCIT\") market, reported fourth quarter adjusted (excluding one-time items other than stock-based compensation expense) earnings per share of 21 cents trailing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents but ahead of the year-ago earnings per share of 20 cents.For fiscal 2011, adjusted earnings per share of 81 cents matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Reported net income for the quarter was $26 million (or 14 cents per share) compared with a net loss of $6.2 million (or 3 cents per share) in the year-ago quarter.

One particularly interesting technical indicator is the relative strength index (RSI).RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of stock price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100, with readings above 70 indicating overbought behavior and readings below 40 showing oversold behavior. Truly oversold stocks can be expected to rise to a fairer value in the near future, and vice versa for overbought stocks.RSI(14) is one common form of the index, which is measured with data from the last 14 days.To demonstrate RSI, we ran a screen on large-cap stocks for those that are technically oversold, with RSI(14) below 40.Do you think these stocks will soon rise to a fairer value?

Yet there are hundreds of different ways to look at a company\u2019s profitability.Because of the massive amount of options, it\u2019s important to know what to look for when studying a company\u2019s operational results.One of analysts\u2019 favorite profitability tools is DuPont analysis \u2013 it\u2019s a way to look at changes in return on equity (ROE) profitability [i.e. net income/equity] by attributing those changes to certain sources. Some of the sources are more sustainable than others, thereby giving an analysis of strength in increasing profitability.ROE can be broken up into three components: net margin, asset turnover (a measure of efficiency), and financial leverage (a measure of debt). Increases in the first two are preferable and sustainable, while increases in financial leverage are not.ROE= (Net Profit/Equity)= (Net profit/Sales)*(Sales/Assets)*(Assets/Equity)= (Net Profit margin)*(Asset turnover)*(Leverage ratio)From this breakdown, we can focus on companies with the following characteristics: Increasing ROE along with,\u2022 Decreasing leverage, i.e. decreasing Asset/Equity ratio\u2022 Improving asset use efficiency (i.e. increasing Sales/Assets ratio) and improving net profit margin (i.e. increasing Net Income/Sales ratio)Companies passing all requirements are thus experiencing increasing profits due to operations and not to increased use of leverage.To help you explore the topic, we created a universe of about 200 companies that have been identified as takeover or leveraged buyout (LBO) targets by various publications, including Barrons, CNN Money, SeekingAlpha and Nasdaq.com.To narrow down this list, we analyzed company profits, and identified the names that have seen favorable profit trends.1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentioned Acorda Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company, involves in the identification, development, and commercialization of therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury, and other nervous system disorders.

IASIS also owns and runs a Medicare and Medicaid managed health plan in Phoenix, which caters to over 195,000 members.NextGen Healthcare was chosen by IASIS as it desired a fresh practice management product to improve operational and financial workflows. Furthermore, IASIS sought proper fitment with the NextGen Ambulatory EHR as it is presently implementing this know-how for its associate physicians.IASIS added that it has chosen NextGen Practice Management on account of its data base capability. The know-how also grants better functionality in such areas as aging management, denial management and tracking of work flow. The organization intends to improve its cash collections with better accounts receivables management. In addition, NextGen Healthcare solutions provide solid support and the company's products are well integrated and periodically updated.Quality Systems runs a pure-play business model in an attractive industry, with a large number of catalysts, which provoke frequent speculation about mergers and acquisition. In recent times, the company has not only well managed its ambulatory clinical deals but, in addition, has nicely executed several enterprise contracts. Also, on the positive side, we derive comfort from the high proportion of recurring revenues and steady growth in its NextGen pipeline.However, competition is intense from well regarded players such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and others. Price discounting is frequent, particularly on the lower end, and Software as a Service (SaaS) based model appears to have exacerbated pricing pressure.Quality Systems has traditionally focused on providing solutions for physician practices. However, core ambulatory EHR providers, such as Quality Systems, will see opportunities shrinking for selling their products as physician groups are increasingly getting absorbed into hospitals.In the end, we believe that Quality Systems provides only a moderate upside to investor expectations. The company's performance does not sustain its valuation momentum at present, which has boosted its earnings multiple.

It also helps to offer a fat  to entice investors. Utilities and tobacco stocks held up very well in the third quarter, thanks to their hefty payouts.-- David StermanBut it's unwise to expect further  for these stocks. In most instances, their dividend yields are simply too small to entice high-yield investors. And in a more stable market, the unwinding of the \"  \" trades may cause these stocks to lose some appeal, especially if investors move back farther out on the risk curve.But there are a dozen other stocks that have managed to rise in an otherwise tough market. Which of these are poised for further gains as the market stabilizes?-- David StermanTo expect continued gains for gold producer  , which at one point was up more than 30% in the quarter, you have to have a very  outlook for gold prices. Why has Newmont done far better than its peer group? Because it announced plans in July to make major investments in Peruvian and Australian mines that should set the stage for 7 million ounces in annual gold production by 2017. Of course, high gold prices would be necessary to generate the  to fund these projects. Is gold headed back toward the $2,000 per-ounce mark -- or higher?

And the stock is surely cheap at less than 10 times next year's  when cash is excluded. But I remain fearful that the company's  is near a peak as cutthroat competition in the consumer electronics market will eventually crimp growth and margins.Yet there are a few names that look quite appealing -- even in these tough times.If you're on the prowl for companies that can benefit from rising consumption in  such as India, Russia, Mexico, Brazil and China, then you should know this name. VF owns brands such as Timberland, Wrangler, Vans, the North Face and others. These are iconic U.S. brands, synonymous with the \"great outdoors.\" And they're quickly gaining adherents in emerging markets.The June 2011,  of Timberland in particular is turning this into a solid move. Aided by that deal, sales are expected to rise 20% this year and another 20% in 2012 to about $11 billion. Equally important, management has proven quite savvy in managing costs through better  of raw materials. Gross margins are on track to rise from 44% in 2008 to 46% this year. With such a large sales base, a 200 basis point increase in gross margins really fuels the  . Notably, cotton prices had been surging, but have recently pulled back, which should  further  gains in 2012.Merrill Lynch, which upgraded its rating on VF from \"neutral\" to \"buy\" in late September, figures the company can  its strong brands and solid cost controls into healthy  , projecting a rise from $600 million this year to $1 billion by 2013. It also predicts  will rise to $140. That may only be 15% above current levels, but this potential return also comes with a fairly low degree of risk and volatility.Faced with a never-ending onslaught of patent expirations and tepid new drug pipelines, investors have come to see Big Pharma as a no-growth industry. There is one notable exception: Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has less exposure to imminent patent expirations and a fairly robust pipeline of new drugs waiting in the wings.To be sure, the quarters ahead will be a challenge. Sales are expected to drop 13% in 2012 to $18.3 billion, while  ) could slump by a similar amount, from $2.28 to $2.06 in the same period. From there, business should improve markedly. Goldman Sachs estimates a string of new drugs should hit the market beginning in 2012, which will likely eventually constitute 70% of sales by 2016. (Notably, new drugs tend to carry the highest  margins.) Goldman's analysts say \"Street forecasts underestimate the margin implications of BMY's burgeoning new product lineup, which should lead to significant upside in the 2014-2016 period.\" Goldman sees shares rising from a current $31 into the upper $30s once the rest of Wall Street starts to appreciate the company's coming  plans. Coupled with a current 4.3% yield, this stock offers income, stability and growth all in one platform.Risks to consider:  A key theme of these stocks is that they appear to be well-positioned to grow in an uncertaineconomy .

I abandoned that argument at the time because I found even greater strength in metal and coal stocks, but the original idea had merit--not because it's time to be defensive, but because health care might now be a good sector to go on the offensive.As I wrote last year, the  is the best I have ever seen: Just when you think the rally is over, another sector catches the mojo. That seems to be the case now with health care, a sector that has been in the dumps since early 2008 when the market started worrying about increased government regulation.Researching different companies and perusing headlines more recently, I'm finding that things are looking better. For instance, Questcor Pharmaceuticals leapt more than 20 percent on April 5 after reporting a giant revenue number on the strength of its Acthar multiple-sclerosis gel.Cubist Pharmaceuticals surged 15 percent after settling a patent dispute. The agreement itself was minor on the surface, only affecting a six-month period far into the future, but the real impact was that it lifted a cloud of uncertainty because management can now sign marketing deals. In other words, value was waiting to be unlocked. Also that day, we saw a flurry of bullish activity in Irish drug maker Elan. I won't waste space on the details here because most of the key information is in my story, but I will refer readers back to the discussion of moving averages. ELN is now looking pretty interesting as it breaks free of its 500-day and its other key long-term averages line up bullishly.Another company that can be purchased around its current levels is Baxter, which is trying to fill a bearish gap that occurred almost a year ago on a terrible earnings report. It has frequently appeared on our Heat Seeker as it climbed from the low $40s to over $50, but for the last five months has been consolidating those gains. The provider of blood products is now finding support at the higher end of that range and looks like it's ready to fight its way back as it prepares to bring new products to market.CareFusion, which saw a bullish ratio spread recently, could be played for a limited move. It could be purchased for $28 or less with a $0.50 stop and a $30 price target. Not a barn burner, I know, but not a bad risk/reward either.There are a few other categories of stocks I want to mention. The first are runaway breakout names such as Cerner, AmerisourceBergen, and Mako Surgical.CERN is riding the bullish wave in medical IT and software, while ABC is benefiting from the trend of patients shifting to lower-cost generic drugs. MAKO has been selling its orthopedic devices like hot cakes, and at the end of March exploded higher after receiving a big order.Hospital stocks such as Health Management Associates, WellPoint, and HealthSouth also look interesting and appear to be accelerating to the upside. They can be purchased around their current levels with tight stops, or on steeper pullbacks to their 30- or 50-day moving averages. Another buy possibility around here is McKesson, which is in a similar business as ABC and has been consolidating after raising guidance on Feb. 1.The third group is the beaten-down stocks sitting near long-term support. I generally wouldn't recommend buying these when others are actually climbing, but they should be watched for their potential down the road. These include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Amgen, and MedcoHealth Solutions.Saving the best for last, I want to end with Endo Pharmaceuticals. This company, whose main products are in pain management, made a giant move last year, consolidated and is just now breaking into new territory. ENDP may pause around the $40 level or even pull back toward $38-$39, but it seems to be in the midst of a secular bull run and will probably be much higher in one year.The valuations are especially enticing because its trades for just 9 times forward earnings, despite 30 percent revenue growth. It also has a price/sales ratio of less than 3 times, less than half the premium that many other drug makers command.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" One of the most striking developments this earnings season is the jaw-dropping strength of health-insurance companies such as UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, and Humana.UNH was expected to report profit of $0.89 a share but thrashed that number with net income of $1.22. Revenue was also well above consensus.AET was even more impressive because its top line beat by a much narrower margin, while its bottom-line profit of $1.50 crushed the $0.96 estimate. That reflects a massive surge in profitability that no one expected.HUM reported similarly strong results, and guidance from all three companies was significantly above forecasts. Several factors are driving this strength. One is that people are using medical services less: UNH and AET paid out 81.4 percent and 79.2 percent of premiums received in claims, respectively, which is 1 to 1.5 percentage points lower than the levels of 2006 and 2007.Most readers have probably seen evidence of this in their own lives as co-payments have increased, discouraging visits to the doctor. Or perhaps you had to get interviewed by third-party before the insurer pays for a test like an MRI.Income stagnation is another factor because a lot of health-care spending is discretionary: Joe Six-Pack hasn't had a raise in four years, and gasoline prices are killing him. He would like to see a knee doctor, but his out-of-pocket cost for the specialist just doubled. So he simply forgoes the care and lives with the pain.In fact, we seem to be in the early stages of a new secular trend where health-care costs no longer run ahead of broader inflation. Monthly inflation data show that non-seasonally adjusted prices rose 0.98 percent for all items between February and March, the fastest gain since June 2006. There were also strong readings in January and February versus negligible changes throughout 2009 and 2010.But in the category of health-care services, the opposite is happening. Prices increased just 0.1 percent, following a moderation of prices in the preceding 12 months. Health-care inflation averaged roughly twice the overall rate between 1980 and about 2005, so it's clearly slowing compared with the broader trend.It's still a little early, but I will go out on a limb. As I have discussed in previous columns, I like to take a thesis that seems to be true, then try to ride stocks that manifest it. We won't know if it's correct until most of the money has been made, but the price action and earnings will give us a pretty good idea if we're right.The new trend we're seeing is dramatic innovation in health care, an industry that has been fat and lazy for years. While sectors from retail to finance have experienced massive cost reductions, most doctors' offices are at somewhere back in the 1950s (if not the 1850s), clogged with paperwork, redundant processes, and uncountable instances of waste. This is where companies such as Cerner and McKesson are stepping in.The consumers of health care--ordinary people plus state and local governments--are more squeezed financially than ever before. On top of that, you have baby boomers needing record amounts of cheap, commoditized care.All of this offers huge opportunities for greater efficiency and wealth creation, so look for companies that will benefit from this massive change. (Pharmacy-benefit companies such as MedcoHealth Solutions and Express Scripts have also done so by cutting drug costs.)Trust the charts and earnings more than analysts or the media, and don't fall in love with any one stock. It's better to have a broad familiarity with many names and a limited commitment than a deep knowledge of one or two companies and a major commitment to them.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ne investor is positioning for a rally ahead of Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions' earnings report this afternoon.optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker tracking system detected the sale of 3,350 August 16 puts for $0.40. The proceeds were then used to buy an equal number of August 17.50 calls for $0.40, resulting in neither a credit nor a debit. MDRX fell 0.66 percent to $16.66 yesterday and is down 21 percent in the last three months. The company enjoyed a big run last year along with peers such as McKesson and Cerner amid strong demand for physician cost-reduction software.It rallied more than 300 percent between October 2008 and October 2009, and has been consolidating its gains ever since.Yesterday's option trade will simulate ownership of the shares, delivering unlimited gains if MDRX rallies above $17.50 by expiration. Because of the short position in the puts, the investor stands to lose money if the stock falls below $16.That level is important because it's roughly where MDRX formed a double bottom around $16 in recent weeks and was an area where the stock consolidated during the summer of 2009 before surging higher into the fall.The most recent bullish catalyst was apparently an upgrade by Auriga U.S.A., which caused the shares to gap higher on July 8.Overall options volume in the stock was seven times greater than average in yesterday's session.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."]], "Title": ["First Week of July 17th Options Trading For Cerner", ["Ex-Dividend Reminder: Cerner, C.H.
