Slightly before noon EDT, the index was up just over half a percent, as was the Nasdaq 100 Index of top stocks on the exchange. There's been rising enthusiasm lately about the prospects for the U.S. economy to escape the full brunt of what many economists have feared from the fallout from coronavirus-inspired shutdowns. Today's move continued the upward momentum from that newfound optimism.Also helping to keep stocks moving forward was good news from several individual stocks. Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ALXN) rose for different reasons, but their gains were among the leaders in the Nasdaq 100 and showed the broad-based support that the rally has had recently.END", "Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. \tFor the  ETF (Symbol: IUS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $27.20 per unit.\n\n\nWith IUS trading at a recent price near $24.73 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.97% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of IUS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Amgen Inc (Symbol: AMGN), Lilly (Eli) & Co (Symbol: LLY), and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (Symbol: BMY). Although AMGN has traded at a recent price of $222.40/share, the average analyst target is 11.79% higher at $248.63/share. Similarly, LLY has 11.63% upside from the recent share price of $147.96 if the average analyst target price of $165.17/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BMY to reach a target price of $66.44/share, which is 10.15% above the recent price of $60.32.
