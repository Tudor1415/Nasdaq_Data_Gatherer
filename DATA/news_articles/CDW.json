One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 256 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDW options chain for the new December 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.00.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $90.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $79.00 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDW, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $91.99/share today.\n\nBecause the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.

Not all criteria in the below table receive equal weighting or are independent, but the table provides a brief overview of the strong and weak points of the security in the context of the strategy's criteria.END", "In recent trading, shares of CDW Corp (Symbol: CDW) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $97.00, changing hands for $97.82/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 5 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CDW Corp, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $89.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $100.00. The standard deviation is $4.795.But the whole reason to look at the average CDW price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CDW crossing above that average target price of $97.00/share, investors in CDW have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $97.00 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover CDW Corp:\n\n\n\nRecent CDW Analyst Ratings Breakdown\n\nCurrent\n1 Month Ago\n2 Month Ago\n3 Month Ago\nStrong buy ratings:\n3\n3\n3\n3\nBuy ratings:\n1\n1\n1\n1\nHold ratings:\n2\n2\n3\n3\nSell ratings:\n0\n0\n0\n0\nStrong sell ratings:\n0\n0\n0\n0\nAverage rating:\n1.83\n1.83\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\nEND", "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when CDW (CDW) reports results for the quarter ended December 2018. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  earnings call , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis information technology company is expected to pos t quarterly earnings of $1.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +21.2%.END"]}
