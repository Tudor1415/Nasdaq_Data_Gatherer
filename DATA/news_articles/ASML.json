And so with ASML crossing above that average target price of $316.60/share, investors in ASML have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $316.60 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $280.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $263.70 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ASML, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $287.66/share today.\n\nBecause the $280.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.

The company is the sole technology provider of extreme ultraviolet lithography technology (EUV), which is key in producing leading-edge semiconductors. In the future, EUV might also be used to produce DRAM memory.During the coronavirus outbreak, the tech world has been unsure as to how semiconductors, and therefore the producers of semiconductor production equipment, might be affected. On the one hand, lower gross domestic product (GDP) from a recession should cause a downturn in consumer demand. However, the stay-at-home economy has also led to a demand spike in chip-heavy data center, gaming, and PCs.ASML is one of the first tech companies to report earnings, which it did on Wednesday, April 15. At first glance, ASML's Q1 results came in much worse than it had initially guided for. However, a further look under the hood showed that this was due to supply delays and revenue recognition, not a decrease in demand, which appears to be going full steam ahead.
