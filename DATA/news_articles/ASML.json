At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ASML options chain for the new June 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $280.00 strike price has a current bid of $16.30.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $280.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $263.70 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ASML, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $287.66/share today.\n\nBecause the $280.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.82% return on the cash commitment, or 37.94% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for ASML Holding NV, and highlighting in green where the $280.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $290.00 strike price has a current bid of $18.00.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ASML stock at the current price level of $287.66/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $290.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.07% if the stock gets called away at the June 19th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ASML shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for ASML Holding NV, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ASML's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $290.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $290.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.26% boost of extra return to the investor, or 40.78% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 52%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 47%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $287.66) to be 46%.

The company is the sole technology provider of extreme ultraviolet lithography technology (EUV), which is key in producing leading-edge semiconductors. In the future, EUV might also be used to produce DRAM memory.During the coronavirus outbreak, the tech world has been unsure as to how semiconductors, and therefore the producers of semiconductor production equipment, might be affected. On the one hand, lower gross domestic product (GDP) from a recession should cause a downturn in consumer demand. However, the stay-at-home economy has also led to a demand spike in chip-heavy data center, gaming, and PCs.ASML is one of the first tech companies to report earnings, which it did on Wednesday, April 15. At first glance, ASML's Q1 results came in much worse than it had initially guided for. However, a further look under the hood showed that this was due to supply delays and revenue recognition, not a decrease in demand, which appears to be going full steam ahead. That makes ASML a compelling pick today.Image source: ASML.In Q1, ASML only made 2.4 billion euros, well below its initial guidance of 3.1 billion euros to 3.4 billion euros. At first, that might seem like a huge miss and a danger sign. However, management stressed the delay was entirely due to supply side delays, but not a lack of demand.ASML couldn't ship some traditional deep ultraviolet machines (DUV) to Wuhan, China in the quarter -- for obvious reasons. ASML also had some trouble securing all of the parts it needed to build some EUV machines due to lockdown orders in certain geographies. However, those delays have since been resolved.Finally, some customers asked for expedited shipping before factory acceptance tests could be implemented because they feared for supply chain issues. Though ASML shipped these extra machines, it prevented revenue recognition until the tests are done, which will occur in Q2 and Q3.While some are still worried about ASML's growth prospects amid coronavirus, CEO Peter Wennink confidently said that the company had seen no letup in demand and ASML's order intake remains strong, up 28% versus the fourth quarter. Management even suggested second-quarter shipments could increase 50% over Q1 as orders fell from the first to the second quarter.How is ASML's demand holding up so well? Chalk it up to ASML serving production of the most advanced, fastest chips, which are still in demand for data centers, gaming, and 5G rollouts. Meanwhile, lagging nodes for things like consumer electronics and smartphones could decline. Still, it doesn't appear that chipmakers are altering their technology roadmaps, as ASML's machines -- especially EUV -- are  From the :[M]ost customers are still indicating that they are continuing relatively normal fab operations so far. Logic customers are currently continuing to ramp their 7 nanometer and 5 nanometer node in support of end market applications like 5G, AI and high-performance compute. There are also some positive signs being reported on data center demand as well as demand for notebook and communication infrastructure driven by the significant increase in work from home and virtual learning activities. These applications drive the demand for both Logic and Memory. However, it can also be expected that consumer related electronics demand, for example, smartphones may be under stress, in addition to the potential negative impact the COVID-19 crisis will have on GDP.ASML also had some commentary on how its company is adapting to travel restrictions and social distancing. Obviously, ASML's research and development (R&D) teams still need to collaborate and work together, and service employees need to be able to access the advanced machines set up at customer fabrication plants.ASML has gotten creative on that front. First, Wennink said he was \"pleasantly surprised\" at the productivity of the R&D teams working remotely, saying they even logged longer hours today while working from home. The company even has virtual cocktail hours on Friday nights with its team members.Finally -- and this is pretty cool -- the company has begun using augmented and virtual reality, along with , to execute service calls on its machines for clients. Service calls on advanced machines are very technically intensive, usually requiring hands-on engineering and years of training. However, ASML has accelerated the pace of virtual and remote tools with great effect, it seems. That could make the company more efficient in the future:[W]e have now over the shoulder 3D augmented reality support that service engineers with six months of training that would normally have to do this after two to three year training, were now operating and doing service actions with the support of experts that were sitting 6,000 kilometers away and basically providing them with 3D images, how they should do the service actions and it works. So this is also something that amazed us also.The main takeaway is that ASML's equipment, which is necessary for making the most advanced chips coming out today, doesn't seem to be that affected as much by the coronavirus pandemic, despite the lower headline first-quarter results. Companies are still in need of the most advanced and fastest chips to remain competitive, as the stay-at-home economy needs lightning-fast connections, low latency, and dependability more than ever.As such, the chipmakers and equipment makers that serve these markets are likely to survive, if not thrive through the crisis, while other more broad-based chip stocks could be left behind. That makes stock picking within the  more important than ever today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Welcome to ASML 2020 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on April 15th, 2020. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to open the question-and-answer queue. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Skip Miller. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone. This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today on the call is ASML's CEO, Peter Wennink; and our CFO, Roger Dassen. The subject of today's call is ASML's 2020 first quarter results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes and questions will be taken in the order they are received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. The transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call.Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's report on Form 20-F and other documents that's filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction. -- Thank you, Skip. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Q1 2020 results conference call. I hope all of you and your families are healthy and safe. And before we start our normal quarterly results review, I would like to first talk about the topic on everybody's mind, which is the COVID-19 pandemic and the situation.These are unprecedented and challenging times, and the COVID-19 pandemic affects all of us. Our primary goal at ASML continues to be to ensure, as best as we can, that our colleagues and their families stay safe. Our second goal is to ensure that we continue to serve our customers and to secure the delivery of our product roadmap, including the continuity of our supply.We have been taking, and continue to take, precautionary measures to limit the risks. Most of our non-manufacturing employees now work from home and travel is restricted. In China, our colleagues are returning to the office but also there we remain vigilant.In our own facilities, we have implemented restricted access to our manufacturing facilities worldwide, and in particular our cleanrooms, to ensure our colleagues can work safely. We put in place measures to help ensure isolation between shifts. We have also implemented additional safety and cleaning protocols to minimize contamination risks. We work closely with our customers, suppliers and partners to share information and determine best practices.We see a lot of creativity, resilience and dedication at ASML and the industry in overall as we work to manage through this crisis. To date, we have experienced limited impact on ASML's manufacturing capability, although there have been additional challenges with absenteeism, transportation and support logistics that we have had to manage. Some of the quarantine requirements have had an impact on our efficiency, while travel restrictions have posed a challenge for installs and major upgrades. We are working with our customers to plan ahead and find creative solutions such as the use of remote monitoring, augmented reality solutions and diagnostic technologies to aid in the service and repair of systems.With regard to our supply chain, some of our suppliers have experienced temporary closures resulting from governmental lock down and shelter in place orders. At this stage, we have either been able to work around these temporary disruptions or the closure has been resolved. We are managing risk via alternative sourcing and again a lot of creativity. We are closely monitoring the status and will use safety stock as much as possible to ensure minimum interruption. At this point in time we have been able to find solutions for these challenges.Regarding customer demand, we have currently not seen a reduction in demand this year and we have seen a strong order intake. I will talk more on this later.On cash management, although we have a very healthy balance sheet as well as flexibility in our cost structure, we feel it is prudent to preserve cash, should this situation continue for an extended period of time. Not just for our own operation, but also in order to be able to support our suppliers as best we can in these extraordinary circumstances. And Roger will talk more on the detailed actions.You will all understand that in this environment, it is difficult to determine how things will develop, how long it will last and the impact this will have on the global GDP development that can affect our entire industry.We are taking the necessary steps in terms of safety, risk mitigation, and financial measures to best manage through these challenging times. It is very encouraging to see the creativity, resilience and dedication at ASML and the industry overall.Now, I would like to turn our normal quarterly results process. Before we begin the Q&A session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the first quarter. Roger will start with a review of our Q1 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and on our future business outlook. Well, thank you. Roger? -- Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I hope you are all safe and healthy. I will first review the first quarter financial results and then make some comments on the second quarter of 2020. I will also provide more detail around measures we are taking with regards to cash management.Net sales came in at EUR2.4 billion, below our original guidance of EUR3.1 billion to EUR3.3 billion, which was primarily related to COVID-19 impact. Net system sales of EUR1.6 billion was again heavily weighted toward Logic at 73%, with the remaining 27% from Memory, clearly showing the continued strength of Logic business. We actually shipped four EUV systems in Q1 but were only able to recognize revenue on two systems, which I will explain in more detail later.Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR857 million. This was around EUR100 million lower than guided due to lack of access to machine time as well as a delay in acceptance of upgrades, we expect these upgrades to translate to revenue in Q2.Let me provide a bit more detail on the items that occurred in the quarter that resulted in a system revenue shift of around EUR700 million, consisting of a Deep UV related revenue shift over EUR200 million and EUV related revenue shift of over EUR500 million, primarily related to COVID-19 impact.First, we experienced some delays in Deep UV shipments to customers in Wuhan, China, as well as other customers due to operational and travel restrictions regarding COVID-19. We are working with our customers to prepare for these shipments in the next quarters.Second, we experienced some issues in our supply chain as a result of a temporary disruption from EUV component suppliers that encountered operational restrictions due to COVID-19 regulations. These supply chain issues have been solved for now. Also, we experienced longer than initially planned EUV cycle times for the first NXE:3400C models in final configuration, primarily driven by the complex deployment of in-line tin refill as part of the modular vessel. Cycle time related to this aspect is now being reduced every week and we are on track to achieving the aspired cycle time reduction envisaged for the end of this year. As you know this is an important element in achieving the capability of 45 to 50 EUV tools in 2021 and beyond. As a result of the longer than expected cycle times, as well as COVID-19 related supply issues, we saw some delays in EUV shipments for the quarter resulting in fewer system shipments than originally planned.Third, due to concerns around the continued ability to ship systems in the current circumstances, some customers have asked us to expedite the delivery of EUV systems in the quarter by shipping the systems before the normal Factory Acceptance Tests. The implication of this is a delay in our revenue recognition as final acceptance will now take place after successful installation at the customer site.We expect the revenue that we were not able to recognize for Q1 as a result of the issues listed above to shift to Q2 and Q3 of this year. Gross margin for the quarter was 45.1%, also below our original guidance primarily due to a combination of delayed field upgrades as well as delayed Deep UV systems revenue, related to COVID-19 impact. Overall operating expenses came within guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR544 million and SG&A expenses at EUR130 million.Turning to the balance sheet, EUR507 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q1. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR4.1 billion.Moving to the order book, Q1 system bookings came in at a strong EUR3.1 billion, including EUR1.5 billion from eleven EUV systems. Logic order intake was 66% of the total value with the remaining 34% from Memory, again reflecting the continued strong Logic demand for leading edge lithography for this year and next year, but also indicating a recovery of the demand for Memory. Net income in Q1 was EUR391 million, representing 16% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR0.93.With that I would like to make some comments on Q2 of 2020. As Peter mentioned, we have not seen a reduction in demand this year and we continue to see a strong order intake, up around 28% from Q4. Based on current plans, without any COVID interruption, Q2 can be a strong shipment quarter with revenue up potentially over 50% from Q1, and a significant improvement of gross margin. We are still planning to execute to current plan. However, due to significant uncertainty in this COVID-19 environment, we decided it is prudent to refrain from giving formal guidance for Q2.Finally, on cash management, although we have a very healthy balance sheet as well as flexibility in our cost structure, we, like many of our peers and customers, are dependent on the short and longer-term implications of the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to these uncertainties, we feel it is prudent to preserve cash should this situation continue for an extended period of time. Not just for our own operations, but also in order to be able to support our suppliers as best we can in these extraordinary circumstances.We have decided not to execute any share buybacks in Q2 2020. This decision follows the pause in the execution of the program in the first quarter, after having already performed share buybacks under the new program for an amount of approximately EUR507 million. The previously announced three-year share buyback program of up to EUR6.0 billion to be executed 2020-2022, is still in place.We have also implemented measures to limit our growth in the workforce. Non-business critical vacancies have been put on hold. We continue to hire for business-critical positions. This way, our workforce will grow less than originally planned this year. We are also postponing any non-business critical opex and capex. However, we will continue to invest in the development of future technology roadmaps, including High-NA, at an unadjusted pace, in order to allow our customers the continuation of their roadmaps once the situation has been normalized.As communicated last quarter, ASML has submitted a proposal at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of shareholders to declare a total dividend for 2019 of EUR2.40 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR1.05 paid in November 2019, this leads to a final dividend payment of EUR1.35 to be paid in the second quarter. This is a 14% increase compared to the 2018 dividend. The 2020 Annual General Meeting of shareholders, will take place on April 22 in Veldhoven.With that I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter. -- Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, our order intake is strong and we have not yet seen any significant push-outs or cancellations this year. Many investments of our customers are strategic and support their technology roadmaps, a lifeline for our leading-edge customers. These strategic investments are therefore primarily related to leading edge equipment, such as EUV and high-end Immersion scanners, requiring longer lead times and qualification schedules. This was also confirmed recently by leading-edge customers that have also told us that they see an unabated demand for leading-edge devices, at least throughout this year. Keep in mind, the lead time and qualification of lithography systems are the longest in the fab and customers will not want to jeopardize any adjustments to their technology and capacity ramps that will negatively affect their ability to keep serving their leading-edge customers.As the current situation is very fluid, we are meeting with our customers on a more frequent basis to understand any changes they may be seeing regarding demand outlook. In general most customers are still indicating that they are continuing relatively normal fab operations so far. Logic customers are currently continuing to ramp their 7 nanometer and 5 nanometer node in support of end market applications like 5G, AI and high-performance compute. There are also some positive signs being reported on data center demand as well as demand for notebook and communication infrastructure driven by the significant increase in work from home and virtual learning activities. These applications drive the demand for both Logic and Memory. However, it can also be expected that consumer related electronics demand, for example, smartphones may be under stress, in addition to the potential negative impact the COVID-19 crisis will have on GDP.We expect Installed Base business to continue to scale with growing installed base numbers and we will also see EUV contribute to service revenue as these systems start running wafers in volume manufacturing. We currently have plans for upgrades at several customers however with the realization there is a supply and demand risk in the current environment.Our bookings show an increase in Memory over the prior quarter driven by Deep UV, while Logic continues to show a transition from Deep UV to EUV ordering as customer confidence in EUV increases, translating into more layers in Logic production.On EUV, along with the industry, ASML continues to make progress in ramping EUV technology in high volume manufacturing, as was recently showcased at the SPIE lithography conference in February. Our customers continue to adopt and ramp EUV in high volume manufacturing in both Logic and Memory. And one of our Memory customers recently announced that they have successfully shipped 1 million of the industry's first 10 nanometer class DRAM modules based on EUV technology. They also stated EUV will be fully deployed in future generations of DRAM, starting with its fourth-generation 10 nanometer D1a next year.We continue to target EUV revenue of around EUR4.5 billion from 35 systems this year, thereby assuming that we will not face any significant supply/demand risks as mentioned before. On margins for EUV, we continue to drive profitability in both the systems as well as the service business. We are still on track to achieve at least 40% system gross margin this year and break even with our EUV service business by the end of year.Increased customer confidence in EUV technology is translating to strong EUV demand in both Logic and Memory. This is reflected in the strong order flow in the first quarter in support of our 2021 output. As mentioned in earlier calls, we are currently working toward a capacity of 45 to 50 systems in 2021, which we feel can be achieved through reductions in cycle time. We continue to make progress on our next generation EUV technology, High-NA, and are on track to ship the initial development systems in 2022.Now, regarding our outlook on the quarter and on the year. Based on current customer demand plans and without any COVID interruption, Q2 can be a strong shipment quarter, with significant improvement of gross margin, as Roger mentioned. We are currently in execution of this plan.On the full year, customer demand is currently strong as well and the current shipment plans would position us well for another year of growth. However, there is a significant uncertainty about how the current COVID-19 crisis will impact the global GDP development, end markets, our manufacturing capability and supply chain. In light of these risks and uncertainties we decided it is prudent to refrain from giving formal guidance for Q2 and for the full year 2020.Again, these are unprecedented and challenging times, but we will get through it. The world looks a lot different today than it did three months ago. So it is hard to make predictions and we are certainly not adding opinions. We continue to look at the facts, day by day and act accordingly. We are taking the necessary steps for the safety of our employees, the community and our customers, as well as the necessary risk mitigation and financial steps.I would like also to take the opportunity to thank the entire ASML team and their families, as well as our many partners, who have stepped up in these demanding times in support of our Company and our stakeholders. I have seen great examples of teamwork and incredible creativity to make sure that we can continue our work, serving our customers while keeping our people and partners safe.Despite the fact that the current environment provides clearly near-term challenges and uncertainties, the positive industry momentum around innovation and expanding new markets further strengthens our confidence in our future growth scenarios.With that we would be happy to take your questions. -- Thank you, Peter and Roger. The operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]Operator, could we have your final instructions and then the first question please?Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande. Please state your company name, followed by your question. -- Yeah. Hi. Sandeep Deshpande, JP Morgan. Thanks for having me on the call. My first question to you Peter is that you've seen very great order strength in the first quarter. Is this order strength essentially what -- if you remember, in January you've said that you were hoping the Memory orders would come in through the year. It was these Memory orders coming in, which caused this order strength or was it something else like customers were worried that they could -- you've been -- they may not get tools from you and so they expedited their orders to -- and brought them forward from later in the year, which is what caused this order strength?And my second question which is a follow -- not a follow-up, but with regard to your 40% gross margin indications in EUV for the year is, I mean, given the social distancing, etc. associated with -- which you may be implementing even in manufacturing, will that not have an impact on the cycle times and thus the gross margin? Thank you. -- Okay. Let me answer this first question. I think the order strength, and I think Roger said it, about two-thirds of the order intake was Logic and one-third was Memory. So I don't think it is an acceleration of it. It is something that we would -- that we expected, also driven by, I think what we observe as a continued increase in utilization in the memory space of our machines. So that actually fits in quite nicely.I don't think they were pull-ins either. These orders are there to support our outlook for 2021. And this was planned. So basically you could say it's more a confirmation of the technology roadmap that our customers have in front of them. So in that sense good. Only gross margin indication of 40%. The cycle time impact, we've been able to manage. I mentioned it, we did see an increase in absenteeism in the factories, because of the guidelines that people followed by the government, the health authorities, basically saying, if you have symptoms like some of the COVID-19 symptoms, you should stay at home, which people did, even when they had a cold, which actually meant that we did have indeed some shortages in the factory. But we've been able to reorder shift patterns and also what we're seeing is that people that are eligible to work in the factory, for instance from R&D environment, they are now also working in the factory to make sure that we can do the output. So I think we can manage, and I don't think it will have an impact on the 40% gross margin indication that we gave you. -- Thank you, Peter.The next question is from Mr. David Mulholland. Please state your company name, followed by your question. -- Hi, it's David from UBS. Just following up on one of the comments that Roger made in terms of how you're looking to I guess in some respects support your supplier base. Can you just give us a little bit more detail about what you're considering there? And are there any particular suppliers that you might be worried about where a particular other part of their business might be, I guess, heavily or it was exposed that we've seen a very sudden downturn just a little bit more color on how you're planning to support your supplier base. -- Yeah, let me answer that. I think, we are managing our supplier base almost on a day-to-day basis. And most of what we see in the supply chain currently are delays in delivery of modules and as a result of those, let's say, lock down situations or shelter in place situation where we need to find different solutions, leading to a delay of parts. However, as you pointed out, when this situation last longer, we also could see that some of our suppliers that are also exposed to other industries that currently are not in the, perhaps some of our enviable position where we are, there might be -- they are looking for help from our side. And that help would largely be requests for prepayments.Now, we don't see that yet, but I would expect if this last longer that it would come and they want some prepayments on orders when our demand profile stays as strong as it is. Having said that, you have to look at the -- at our integral supply chain, which includes our customers. I mean, what is true for our supplier is also true for us. So we are of course also in discussion with our customers to say, listen, we need to look at the continuity of the supply chain from an integral point of view. So if we need to prepay suppliers, I need prepayments from our customers. So it is almost, you could say, it's a back-to-back link in terms of potential financing requests.I'm pretty sure that some of them will come, yeah, and especially in those areas where, as you pointed out some of our suppliers are losing significant business in other industries. So this is what we are -- we don't see it yet, but I mean it's been around long enough and also in some other crisis, going back to the -- to the internet bubble burst and then the financial crisis and 9/11 that will in their supply chain, some potential issues will pop up, that will just happen. But again, we need to look at this from an integral point of view, from an integral supply chain point of view and our customers play a significant role there also, which by the way, we are in discussion with them and I think these are good discussions. So I'm pretty positive that we can help those areas in our supply chain, which could become critical going forward. -- Great. Thanks. And just one follow-up on the R&D side of the business was you said, as many as can are working from home. I presume you haven't closed down R&D facilities, because I guess a lot of the work you do still needs to be, I guess, physical test, particularly in the case of High-NA and work is going on there. -- Yeah. I think, if you really talk about the physical tests, I mean, that is done in cleanrooms and we build modules. So that's an agreement [Phonetic] and we talked about this. I mean, we have very strict regulations there now almost for, I would say, almost for two months. And they are effective on the R&D side itself. It is -- when we look at the latest productivity numbers, which we follow on a day-to-day basis, I think 90% of our R&D engineers they work from home. But with the current possibilities that we have in creating virtual teams they are working off-site, I can say that I'm pleasantly surprised with the productivity numbers that I see, whether it's the number of design sign-offs, whether it's the number of software builds, the software calculations, our IT infrastructure is holding up very well, which we prepared by the way. So that's going well. And when we look at those productivity numbers, they actually are very similar to the productivity numbers that we saw before starting to work at home, which I think is very good, which is also a tribute to the flexibility of our people.You see also in the log-on numbers that people make much longer hours. I mean, they log-on the same time, but they log-off much later. So there's a lot of working in the evening. And we check very regularly with our managers across the Company of how we are doing and there's a lot of virtual teamwork going on even leading to virtual drinks in Friday afternoon, where they all sit together in front of the camera with a glass of beer. -- Yeah. Thanks, guys.Your next question is from Mr. Joe Quatrochi. Please state your company name, followed by your question. -- Yeah. Thanks. It's Wells Fargo. I was hoping you could kind of give us some more color on the strong Memory bookings that you reported. Can you help us understand, are you starting to see demand largely driven by NAND or DRAM and then to the extent that you can help us understand what was EUV in terms of the Memory bookings, was that also a driver this quarter? -- Yeah, EUV, the last question is, it's really Logic. So we have very few EUV orders, that will come. Sorry, very few EUV orders for Memory, and that will come. So it is predominantly Logic. And the strong Memory bookings are -- and I actually said it earlier, they are also the result of what, at least, we are seeing in terms of utilization of our systems in the memory space both in DRAM and in NAND, the trend we -- the cautious trend that we saw at the end of Q4 of last year has continued in terms of increased utilization throughout Q1 until very recently, until last week. So the trends are upwards, so that explains why Memory bookings are going up also, because customer see this also. -- Thanks. That's helpful. And then, you talked a lot about what ASML is doing in terms of services to meet your customers need. Is there any kind of updated thoughts you can give us on, I think, you talked about EUR3.4 billion for revenue for 2020 for services. And should we think about like the first quarter or March quarter being kind of the low point for services this year? -- Yeah. I think, we mentioned why Q1 was about EUR100 million below our guidance and we gave you the reason for that. It is the lack of machine time that we had on particular upgrades that we were doing and as a result of that will fall into Q2. Other than that in the installed base business still looks good. So the number that we talked about in the past is a number that has still relevance with all the caveats that we talk about in the entire call around the current uncertainty. -- Thank you. -- Indeed a EUR3.4 billion is the number that we talked about on the Q4 call. So that's a good recollection of what we mentioned there.The next question is from Mr. C.J. Muse. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yeah, Evercore ISI. Good afternoon, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Peter, first question just to follow up on the Memory side of things, it looks like ex EUV your orders were up like 80% Q-on-Q. And so curious on that front, is that more NAND versus DRAM? And then, on the last call you talked about optionality to stronger DRAM recovery into the second half of the year. I'm curious what your thoughts are as it relates to that potential reality. -- Yeah. I think, when I answer you have to take into consideration that customers for instance do do relocations. So we might be shipping to a DRAM fab, a leading-edge machine that is replacing a machine that was on a pedestal that now goes to NAND. So there is some relocation there, but I would say that the Memory intake is driven by DRAM. And then with the caveat that we do also see some relocation out of DRAM into the NAND. But I would say if you would have to answer and say, where does the -- what's the emphasis, the emphasis is on DRAM. -- Okay. Great. Very helpful. My follow-up, can you speak directly to how you're thinking about cycle time improvements on EUV? And as part of that, what will it take to get the ability for you to have double-digit shipments on a quarterly basis, which it looks like you need to do to hit that 35 unit forecast. And I guess, as part of that, should we be thinking about the potential for customers to expedite again in the coming quarters and therefore perhaps maybe revenue on one or two tools gets delayed into '21? Thank you. -- Well, on the last point, I mean it's April 15. So I don't know what's going to happen in the December. So that's not what our customers tell us today. Our customers tell us today that they want the 35 systems. On the cycle time improvement and our ability to ship double-digit numbers, we are planning. And without any supply chain or capacity disruptions because of COVID, we will ship double-digit numbers in this quarter in Q2 of 2020. So we have that capability.And when you look at this and let's say customers have a number of 36 units that they want, it's not nine, nine, nine, nine every quarter. It is not how it works and it works when the customers need it, because it's their ramp schedule that is going to determine when we ship. For instance, in Q1, we only shipped four systems, but what we planned before the COVID-19 impact, six in Q1. Not that we couldn't make more, it just -- it also has to do with when the customers need the machines. So we will do double-digit in this quarter and actually means that we have the capability, which is of course very important to get to the 35 numbers. I think the cycle time reductions, and it was one earlier comment, we have some absenteeism in the factory we are dealing with that. I think we will get to the cycle time reductions as planned and we will have the capability to do 35 system this year. -- Thank you. -- Okay.Your next question is from Mr. Krish Sankar. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yeah. Hi. It's Krish from Cowen. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, Peter, to the extent you can answer this, what do you think you would ship in terms of DUV units this year in absolute unit numbers or relative to 2019? -- Relative to 2019, you will see -- that's just a general comment. I'm not going to guide you on a specific Deep UV number, but as we said before and have said for some time now that when you look at EUV, EUV is cannibalizing you could say some multiple patterning layers. So there will be a reduction of Deep UV systems in 2020 and that will be more than compensated by the sales number in EUV, and that's logical, that's what we've always said, you know, EUV is there to cannibalize multiple patterning layers.Now, how much of that in the end will be, is going to be somewhat now lower, it's not going to be significant, but that is the trend. It's a trend going forward. As you can also see from our 2025 Capital Markets Day information where you also see that in 2025, the Deep UV numbers are lower than what they used to be. And that's because EUV is going to replace those. -- Got it, got it. That's helpful, Peter. And then, as my follow-up, if I look at your -- for the last two quarters, if I look at your Memory shipments and compare, it is very similar to the sales into China. So A, is most of your Memory shipment in the last two quarters coming mainly from China? And B, how do you expect that to trend over the next couple of quarters? -- Well, it's -- as you know and I said, we actually mentioned that, the shipments in Q1 were impacted by the COVID-19 price in China, especially Wuhan, where there's a Memory customer there, yeah. Well, you can imagine, we didn't ship anything to that customer. The other customer took a few tools according to plan. But the majority, of course, of everything that we ship was outside China. -- Thank you. Thanks a lot, Peter. And good to hear you and everyone in the ASML family is fine. -- Thank you. Thank you.Your next question comes from Mr. Pierre Ferragu. Please state your company name, followed by your question. -- Hi, thank you for taking my question. It's Pierre at New Street. So Peter and Roger, from your prepared remarks, I understand like the near term of COVID-19 played out clearly not so bad for you and your value chain and that you're managing very well logistics disruption and all like the supply side of the story. Now, of course, my next concern is, what happens next. And I hear you that we have very little visibility. So it's very -- it's impossible to make like a near-term forecast. But my question would be like a what-if question. So let's assume that in the second half of the year, given for PC, servers and smartphones are down 20%, 25% year-on-year, if that happens at a high level, how do you see your clients impacted and how do you see that's impacting ASML?And I had two specific like question marks in mind. One is, in that kind of scenario would your clients push out EUV orders or do you think they need to take orders anyway, because they need to secure supply of the technology. And then the second one I had in mind was, what about of a very steep decline risk in DUV, because I imagine that if volumes are not where they where expected when rollout plans were made six months ago, I would expect a lot of free use of the EUV tools as node migrations continue. -- Let me first answer your question, how does it impact ASML on a certain scenario. Basically, I couldn't answer that. I mean, I could be a bit mean and say that's your work, not mine, yeah. But, so... -- Point taken. Point taken. -- Yes. So, but what I would answer is that if you don't know where you're going, you better be flexible, yeah. And this is what we are organizing. We're organizing for flexibility in the supply chain. As you know, 80% or 80% plus is in the supply chain. That means that we very like with every crisis we hardly ever saw cancellations we saw push-outs. So it basically means you would be looking at, in the supply chain, financing of working capital, which is also particularly important in the context of the answer I gave to a question earlier, what do you want to do in the supply chain, which I think is an integral supply chain problem, which includes our customers. I mean, they cannot do without supply in the end, either. So it's working capital issue, which I think is manageable. I think from a flexibility point of view, we have a lot of cost flexibility here with our variable cost on labor, that was a lot of variable cost, like variable income to our people, which of course when the business goes down, that will go down also.I don't think there will be a lot of push-outs for EUV orders. What our customers are telling us now when I listen well to them, they are not blind, they see that the impact on GDP will be recessionary. And that will very likely have an impact on consumer spending and on the consumer electronics. What they do notice is that the customers, our customers are not blind either, that the demand on the leading-edge Logic, which includes 5 nanometer and 7 nanometer is still strong. I mean, our customers tell us every time, every week that we talk to them, please stay on target with your shipments of your leading-edge machines.Now, if data centers would require 25% less a service, which by the way, if you think about, it is probably that it's -- and then something very bad has actually happened, because we need more data center capacity and not less. And then, that's where the high compute goes. So I think push-out of EUV orders, it can always happen. I don't think it's going to be significant. We are not planning for an armageddon scenario where the entire world economy crumbles into an abyss, we're not planning that. I don't think it's going to happen either. I think it's a low likelihood. So all in all, I think we are flexible enough, I think EUV, with the -- with key focus on leading-edge solutions that our customers need is going to be relatively safe.And I think reuse of Deep UV tools, the story of reuse of Deep UV tools has always been very prominent in every cycle. But you need to realize that when you look at leading-edge, it's not only EUV, it's leading-edge Deep UV, but you need Deep UV not so much for the geometrical shrink, you need it for overlay. Yeah. And that is very important for those new leading-edge devices. So the overlay requirements for an NXE 2050, which will be our leading-edge immersion tool is significantly different than an 1980, because the 1980 will not be able to do what the 2050 should be doing to make sure that they can support our leading-edge nodes. So reuse will be limited, simply has to do with the fact that the requirements that are needed for leading-edge nodes for Deep UV tools are different and they are also more difficult for the older generations to achieve. -- Great. Thanks a lot. So we have our homework to do, but you give us a lot of hint. Thanks for that. -- Okay, Pierre. Good. Thank you.The next question is from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, going back to the topic of where we're going to, I'm still confused. You talked about the improvement in the supply chain, you talked about sequential revenue growth that could exceed 50%, but you are not providing the guide, not even for Q2. What is it out there -- we are halfway through April, what is it out there that makes you uncomfortable given what you see in the next two months. I'm not asking for the second half. I'm asking about just the Q2 and I have a follow-up. -- Yeah, no, I fully understand your question, Mehdi, because we always say where we have very long lead times in the supply chain, which is true for the critical suppliers like, for instance, ZEISS. We have, in the end, if you take tier 2 also, thousands of suppliers with some of them have lead times which are a lot shorter. We've had the delays in EUV in Q1 of a couple of weeks, because one particular supplier couldn't provide rings, floor rings, which is not a most advanced part that we need, but if you don't have it, you don't have it. So this is where our concern comes from.It's the tiered supply chain, which is not always that visible to us. We have tiered suppliers coming from Malaysia [Technical Issues] Mexico, you name it, and they are supplying to our tier 2 and tier 1 suppliers. And if that supply basically stops, then even a part that has a relatively short lead time doesn't arrive on time, we get a delay. I think ultimately we get those parts, it's just a delay. And if we tell you -- we give you a number, yeah, and we get a significant delay in some of those short lead time parts, we cannot ship tools and that can be significant. You may remember that a 3400C now is on a EUR30 million tool, that's a big number. And I don't want to give you a range from x billion to y billion, it doesn't make sense.So this is where it comes from. And I think it is really based on the experience that we've had, in Q1, we were able to manage it, but we did see some delays and it seems we cannot judge what the impact will be of these governmental orders in different parts of the world, we cannot assess what that risk is, but it's there, because we've seen it. We've been able to manage it with a lot of creativity, it doesn't give me any assurance or certainty that we will be able to manage it going forward always. So this is where it comes from. -- Very clear. Thank you. And if you could, give us an update on Hermes multi-beam shipment. I think, the beta tool was supposed to be shipped to the customer in Q1. And what's the update there? -- Yeah, I think it was good [Phonetic], it was ready. It was in packing, and then the shelter in place in the Bay Area, because that's where it comes from, it comes from San Jose just stopped the tool. So it was -- that the trucks were pulling up and they had to return. -- Well, do you see the trucks are going to resume their destination in Q2 or is it going to be [Speech Overlap]. -- No, I think, listen, I mean, what we are doing now, we are assessing whether we and this particular tool falls under the definition of a critical business and actually we are looking into what the possibilities are to actually ship the tool. And I would love to ship the tool ASAP, because it's ready and the customer wants it. So, let's see how things go. -- Okay. Great. Thank you.Your next question is from Mr. Mitch Steves. Please state your company name, followed by your question. -- Yeah. This is Mitch Steves from RBC. I just had a question on the services business. I'm trying to understand a little bit better. So I'm guessing you guys were able to do some of this remotely. Could you maybe walk us through how much revenue you guys think will come back, how much revenue you may have lost in Q1 and then how it would work if like we get out of the shelter in place, say earlier? Would that be a lot of pent-up demand, where you see a snap up or does the services business kind of actually just get hit and some of the revenues are lost? -- I think, the revenue, Mitch, that we lost in Q1, as we mentioned, is around EUR100 million and it's primarily related to certain upgrades. I would say, it's not even related to COVID-19 in particular, it was related to the fact that we didn't get sufficient machine time from customers, so that revenue we missed for Q1, we'll get it in Q2. There's hardly any doubt in my mind, we will get that in Q2.And other than that, I don't think there is going -- as far as we can see right now, we don't see any anomalies. So at this stage, still on track for the EUR3.4 billion in IBM revenue that we talked about in the previous quarter. As we also mentioned in the video and as Peter talked about in the introduction, we are deploying new technologies, right, so of course, we're less able than we were in the past to have people go from Veldhoven from Wilton, etc., and go to the customer locations for obvious reasons for the travel restriction and what have you. But by using artificial -- by using virtual reality, augmented reality type technology, we are able to support the huge local support teams that we have with very specialized knowledge that we have at the different hubs. And in that way so far we think we're still well-positioned to keep up providing the service and the upgrade work that we need to do. -- One additional comment here, it's more anecdotal. That's actually we were preparing as a kind of a prototype project somewhere deep in the organization, how can we support remotely through augmented reality and hollow lenses, basically people sitting 6,000 kilometers from the actual service action. And then we have now over the shoulder 3D augmented reality support that service engineers with six months of training that would normally have to do this after two to three year training were now operating and doing service actions with the support of experts that were sitting 6,000 kilometers away and basically providing them with 3D images, how they should do the service actions and it works. So this is also something that amazed us also. And actually our service levels, we keep up all our service levels up in terms of maintenance and servicing of our tools, which I think is a really good achievement.Your next question is from Mr. Achal Sultania. Please state your company name, followed by your question. -- Hi. Good morning. It's Credit Suisse. Yeah, Peter, maybe one question from my side. On the services, you mentioned that so far you've tried to do a lot of remote working and local team assisting to get maintenance and upgrades done. How should we think about the EUV installation part? Do you have teams in place, if customer fabs are at customer locations to make sure that EUV installation can still go ahead as per plan at least during Q2... -- Yeah, it's a very... -- If current restrictions are not lifted? -- Yeah, that's a very good question. Luckily, we have three main sites where we do EUV and that's also the sites where we have most of our service engineers. I mean, we have to think of 1,000 plus. So there is a lot of experience there and this is exactly where this remote support comes in. We do send people across the globe, but that's where we have hundreds of people, hundreds of people traveling, it's now probably not more than 50, 60. They have to go into two weeks of quarantine, they have to get a special travel visa. So we need to plan and prepare this much more rigorously than we did in the past. And this is where we do send experts.But I think, lot of these service actions that are not of the really top notch expert level are being trained and being done with the kind of novel remote support technologies that I just mentioned. So it's a combination of both. And I think we'll be able to do all the installations. We have been able to actually do that and we are. So yes, we still do travel, it's not going back to zero, but it's a fraction of what we were able to do. -- Thanks, Peter. And maybe one follow-up for Roger. Roger, on the services side, you mentioned EUR3.4 billion is still in sight for the full year. Can you help us understand like how much of that -- within that will be EUV specifically and also how much of losses for EUV services can we expect? I know you mentioned breakeven hopefully by the end of the year. Because, the thing that I'm trying to understand is how much of a drag on services gross margin has EUV been last year or maybe this year just to help us get to what the number should be going forward? -- Yeah, let me be very short on that. So, for this year, I think quarter-over-quarter what -- so if you compared the last quarter, so Q4 to today, that would probably account for 0.5% in gross margin. So the improvement in EUV this year is going to account for about 0.5% in gross margin for the year. So that's an answer to that question.In general, if you look at the EUR3.4 billion, it's about 50-50 in terms of regular serve as a maintenance, if you like, and upgrades, and the regular service and maintenance EUV is still a fairly small number given of course, the installed base for Deep UV is so much larger. But the impact on the gross margin percentage, about 0.5%. -- Okay. Thank you, Roger. -- All right. We have time for one last question. If you were unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations department with your question. Now, operator, may we have the last caller please?And our last question is from Mr. Andrew Gardiner. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Hi, it's Andrew from Barclays. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Just a follow-up really on the comments you guys have been making on the Memory tool utilization. Peter, you said you've seen it improve sort of from late fourth quarter into first quarter and just out this quarter. I'm just wondering how much flex do you think the industry still has to continue to grow bit output by raising utilization, when are they going to get close to full utilization, again based on the current trends. Obviously, I know we've got the global caveats, but just this, if trends were to continue, how close are we to that full utilization where they need to start adding capacity again? -- I think, that will be this quarter. When I look at the trend it's going to be, it's pretty close. They still have a bit of -- and the utilization to go, but it will be this quarter. -- Thank you. -- Sorry to be short, Andrew, but you know, it is what it is. -- That's just fine. The best answer. -- Thanks. -- Do you have second question, Andrew? -- No, I'll let you close quickly then. -- All right. Thank you. Now, on behalf of ASML, I would like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it.

Semiconductor equipment company   offers investors just that.Lam reported its first-quarter earnings last night on April 22. Like other semi equipment companies that have recently reported, Lam continues to see the strong demand it had projected earlier in the year, before the virus hit, according to its management. But is it sustainable?Image source: Lam Research.For the quarter, Lam reported revenue of $2.5 billion, a growth of 2.6% year over year. Diluted earnings per share grew 11.8% as margins expanded and Lam's share count came down due to buybacks. Still, these results were below the initial $2.8 billion revenue guidance given on the January . Yet unlike other industries seeing demand plummet amid the coronavirus pandemic, Lam's lower results were completely due to supply constraints. Lam experienced delays in getting parts for its machines from certain affected areas in east Asia during the quarter, and strict social distancing policies in its factories meant Lam was a bit slower getting its machines made and out the door. In fact, management divulged that Lam had a record backlog at the end of the last quarter, and characterized demand for its machines as \"strong.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lam's strength can be attributed to the same factors that gave  a \u00a0-- its machines are critical to the production of  needed for 5G and artificial intelligence. In addition, Lam's machines are crucial for technology transitions in the memory market.2019 saw a \"memory recession\" in which investment in equipment fell 40%. That means the memory market supply and demand dynamics were already favorable entering the year, with memory supply already trailing long-term demand growth.\u00a0Therefore, memory spending won't likely decline in 2020, even if a recession hits.On the conference call with analysts, CEO Doug Bettinger said:Semiconductors have become so embedded into nearly every industry that we expect broad portfolio semiconductor equipment companies, such as Lam, to see offsetting areas of strength and weakness to help support results. This was our experience through the trough of the recent industry cycle, where we saw increased foundry and logic spending offset memory weakness. ... As we assess the potential future impact of COVID-19 on our business, recent customer commentary points to cloud and enterprise strength as an offset, at least in part, to the weakness that may be seen in more consumer-oriented end markets like smartphones and auto. Even with a COVID-19 related slowdown, memory companies will have to start buying Lam's equipment just to keep up with demand growth and stay on par with competitors. Even though parts of the economy are likely to decline, 5G, cloud computing, and PCs are all booming right now, which management believes will somewhat offset declines in consumer electronics, phones, auto, and industrial.Despite the strong results, Lam drew down part of its revolving credit facility and has suspended buybacks as a precaution. CEO Doug Bettinger said that some consumer-facing companies are now seeing lower demand, but orders for Lam's equipment haven't yet been affected. So, management struck a cautious tone, even though sales aren't slowing at all.\u00a0Investors seem cautious too. Despite Lam seeing no letup in demand, its stock trades roughly 20% below its February high. Recessions have not been kind to semiconductor companies in the past, but this recession is leading to an increased dependence on technology.Therefore, even if the economy contracts, semis may not see as severe a contraction as in prior recessions, before smartphones and cloud computing were as ubiquitous. With companies and countries looking to keep their technological edge more than ever, the companies producing the most advanced semiconductors and memory should be in decent shape, at least for now.Though many stay-at-home tech stocks are now relatively expensive, investors should focus on the parts of the  that haven't yet fully recovered from the first quarter sell-off. That means Lam and other select semiconductor equipment stocks look like solid values today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

These stocks might not have the highest payout today, but they're still growing, meaning that both their share prices and their dividends are likely to increase over the long-term.\u00a0In fact, with the average life expectancy rising to almost 79 years old as of 2018, even those just entering retirement could benefit from adding dividend growth companies to their portfolios today. For those closing in on retirement, it's especially important to focus on such dividend-growth companies with wide , or competitive advantages over rivals, that ensures their staying power. In addition, you want to make sure these companies are in strong growth industries.The following three stocks check all these boxes in spades.\u00a0\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.  has been one of the top stocks to buy and hold over the past decade. Under CEO Satya Nadella, who took over in 2014, the software and operating system specialist has either built or bought its way into several new emerging growth markets such as cloud computing, social networking, video games, cybersecurity, and more. While typically known for its core Windows operating system and Office software, Microsoft is now a tech conglomerate with several profitable and growing businesses, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Dynamics 365 enterprise software, the LinkedIn social network, the Xbox gaming platform, and the GitHub coding repository.Microsoft's products are not only benefiting from the growth in digital transformation going on at enterprises large and small, but they're also extremely profitable as well. Last quarter, Microsoft grew revenue 13.7%, impressive for such a large company, and with several of its best businesses growing much faster than that.But the real story is the massive operating leverage Microsoft is achieving, leading to even bigger profit growth. While revenue is only growing in the mid-teens, operating profits grew 35.4% last quarter and earnings per share grew a stunning 38.3%! That's because Microsoft is now able to grow its top line , and the company's operating margins have expanded to a whopping 36.7%. Currently, Microsoft's dividend yield is just 1.25%, which may not sound like much. However, considering the stock's incredible 165% total return over the last three years, I don't think investors would complain. And with just a 33% payout ratio, Microsoft's dividend has ample room to grow by double-digits on an annual basis for the foreseeable future. One name of which many Americans might be aware is European semiconductor equipment specialist  . ASML makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment for both memory and logic and foundry chips. Its main products are its deep ultraviolet lithography tools, which help etch extremely fine patterns on a surface, without disturbing the remaining material. These lasers are absolutely critical to manufacturing finer and finer transistors, which make for smaller yet denser and more powerful chips. Recently, chip sizes have been getting so small that the amount of etching required has begun to overwhelm even these advanced traditional tools. Fortunately, ASML has developed a new technology over many years called extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), in which an even more powerful laser etches even tinier patterns on a semiconductor wafer than previously possible, and in a shorter amount of time.EUV was developed by ASML just in time for the recent 7nm chips coming out of today's leading foundries such as  , for which EUV has been a critical enabler. Basically, EUV is now a core technology required to make today's leading-edge semiconductors as the industry moves on to 5nm chips, then 3nm, and beyond.In addition, South Korean tech giant   recently announced its first DRAM modules shipped with EUV technology in late March. So beyond just logic and foundry chips, the DRAM industry is just beginning its first adoption of EUV technology. The best part? ASML is the  of EUV technology.Image source: Getty Images.Having a monopoly for a mission-critical technology is why ASML's stock , and currently trades around 40 times earnings. However, with a long runway for growth and expanding profits from EUV adoption over the next decade (at least), that price appears more than justified.ASML pays out a dividend that yields just 1.1%, but that dividend has  over the past decade. While the dividend may not grow quite as fast over the coming decade, it will certainly be much higher five or 10 years from now, meaning ASML is a fine choice for those looking at retirement in the next decade or two. ASML recently announced some shipment delays in the first quarter due to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, with a huge backlog and the need for smaller, faster chips only accelerating, those dollars should be made up in subsequent quarters, not lost. That makes the recent sell-off a nice opportunity to pick up some ASML for the long-term. Finally, another stock that's given up a lot of its share price in the coronavirus downturn is  , although it has also recouped a good amount of those losses in recent days. Most know Starbucks and its terrific track record of wealth creation. Currently, the stock yields 2.3% and trades at around 24 times earnings. No doubt, those earnings are going to fall hard over the next quarter and maybe even the entire year. The company just revealed that its same store sales plunged 60-70% in the last week of March in the U.S. However, in China, same store sales improved to negative 42% in the last week of March, over the negative 90% at the height of the Chinese lockdown in early to mid-February. In these uncertain times, Starbucks' brand and digital capabilities should allow it to weather the coronavirus storm and thrive once the crisis is resolved. The company's best-in-class app and loyalty program had yielded strong performance in the quarter before COVID-19 struck, with U.S. same-store sales up a whopping 8% prior to the outbreak on March 11. Starbucks also said that it has $2.5 billion in cash, which should be enough to weather a couple bad quarters, as well as another $3.5 billion in revolving credit facilities if need be. Importantly, management doesn't plan on cutting the company's dividend.Starbucks' stock has had a nice bounce-back so far, but the long-term picture in both the U.S. and especially China appears bright. In fact, Starbucks' main rival in China,  , recently found itself  in which management was caught fabricating sales. That seems to indicate Luckin is either not a very strong competitor, or at least its reputation may be sullied for the foreseeable future. Thus, Starbucks' brand strength in both the U.S. and China makes it a compelling long-term buy, especially if the stock pulls back to the $60s or $50s.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ASML options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $270.00 strike price has a current bid of $18.10.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $270.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $251.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ASML, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $290.22/share today.\n\nBecause the $270.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 68%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.70% return on the cash commitment, or 10.50% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for ASML Holding NV, and highlighting in green where the $270.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $300.00 strike price has a current bid of $23.50.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ASML stock at the current price level of $290.22/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $300.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.47% if the stock gets called away at the October 16th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ASML shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for ASML Holding NV, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ASML's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $300.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $300.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.10% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.69% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 33%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 30%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $290.22) to be 27%.

There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $270.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $327.00.  The standard deviation is $22.842.\n\n\nBut the whole reason to look at the average ASML price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with ASML crossing above that average target price of $309.40/share, investors in ASML have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $309.40 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

However, EUV's 13.5-nm light is so small that it can reduce the process steps in leading-edge chipmaking by 67% to 75%, by some estimates Since ASML is the  of this crucial technology, the company was able to grow revenue by 8% in 2019, which was essentially a deep recession year in the memory market.  Fortunately, the logic and foundry market held up, and that's the sector that's currently using EUV machines to great effect.ASML has a wide spectrum of semicap equipment products, and EUV made up only 31% of sales in 2019. However, that's up from 23% in 2018, as ASML increased EUV machine sales -- which can go for $125 million per unit -- from 18 in 2018 to 26 in 2019. More exciting, the company ended the year with a 43.5% growth in net bookings, which should point to strong growth in 2020. Eventually, EUV could be used in DRAM memory manufacturing, whereas today it's pretty much used only in logic chips today. If that happens, ASML's growth could kick into another gear. Meanwhile, the company continues to return cash to shareholders in the form of rising dividends and buybacks. The key point is that ASML has sole position of a key technology that will be important for the future of the semiconductor and memory markets. As such, ASML shares seem well worth their high price today.Newly public  aims to disrupt the Brazilian financial industry, and recent numbers suggest it may just do it.

Founded in 2007, MongoDB's founders sought to engineer a new kind of database technology that didn't go by the traditional row-and-column format. They came up with a , which stores data in a format that can connect elements outside of two-dimensional rows and columns. The architecture is much more appropriate for today's diverse types of unstructured data.While other non-relational databases have attempted to come to market, MongoDB's leading position in document databases is turning the company into a juggernaut. Management has been quite adept at adding more and more enterprise-ready features to its document database since going public, satisfying the security needs of organizations large and small and .The company has also adapted its technology for the cloud, so that clients can consume MongoDB as a , instead of a subscription offering on a company's own data center.  That cloud-based product, called MongoDB Atlas, grew a stunning 185% last quarter. And it's no small business; in the most recent quarter, Atlas made up 40% of MongoDB's revenue. Thus, the Atlas surge should keep MongoDB's overall growth rate of 52% fairly high. Despite MongoDB's success to date, there's still plenty of room for growth. The company made only $383 million in revenue over the past 12 months, yet the global database market is $64 billion and growing in the high single-digits, according to research firm IDC. That means there's a long way to run for this mid-cap disruptor. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Throughout today's introductions, all participants will be in listen-only mode. After ASML's introduction, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.I would now like to open the question-and-answer queue. [Operator Instructions].I would now like to turn the conference call over to Skip Miller. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, operator. Welcome everyone. This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from ASML's headquarters in Veldhoven, The Netherlands, is our ASML CEO, Peter Wennink; and our CFO, Roger Dassen.The subject of today's call is ASML's 2019 fourth quarter and full year results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order they are received. The call is also broadcasting live over the internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and replay of the call will be available on our website shortly, following the conclusion of this call.Before we begin,I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call, will include forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release, and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's Annual Report on Form 20-F and other documents, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink, for a brief introduction. -- Thank you, Skip. Welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Q4 and full year 2019 end year results conference call. Before we begin the Q&A session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the fourth quarter and the full year 2019. As well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of our Q4 and full year 2019 financial performance, with other comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and on our future business outlook. Thank you.Roger? -- Thank you, Peter, and welcome everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments, and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2020.Q4 results were basically in line with our guidance. Net sales came in at EUR4 billion. Net system sales of EUR3.1 billion was heavily weighted toward Logic, at 83%, with the remaining 17% from Memory, clearly showing the continued strength of Logic business, as well as the ongoing digestion phase of the Memory business. We reported EUV system sales of EUR922 million from eight shipments.Installed Base management sales for the quarter came in at EUR906 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 48.1%.Overall, operating expenses came in above our guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR516 million and SG&A expenses at EUR148 million.High end guided SG&A is due to additional employee benefit costs and costs related to our IT implementation. Turning to the balance sheet; EUR186 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q4. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR4.7 billion. This amount is significantly higher than anticipated with most of the cash coming in the December period.Moving to the order book; Q4 system bookings came in at EUR2.4 billion including EUR1.1 billion for nine EUV systems. Logic order intake was 79% of the total value, with the remaining 21% from Memory, again reflecting the continued strong Logic demand for leading edge lithography.Net income in Q4 was EUR1.134 billion representing 28.1% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR2.17. For the full year, net sales grew 8% to EUR11.8 billion. The installed base management sales was EUR2.8 billion, which was a small increase compared to previous year.In 2019, we booked EUR6.2 billion of EUV orders, which is more than 50% of the total bookings value for the year, reflecting customer's strong demand for EUV technology. We continue to invest in the future of ASML and increased R&D spend to EUR2 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the acceleration of our EUV roadmap, low and High NA program, overall R&D investments as a percentage of 2019 sales was about 17%, SG&A was about 4% of sales.In addition, ASML invested EUR886 million in CapEx, supporting our long-term growth opportunities, primarily around High NA capacity and infrastructure. Net income for the full year was EUR2.6 billion, resulting in 21% of net sales and an EPS of EUR6.16.With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2020. We expect Q1 total net sales between EUR3.1 billion and EUR3.3 billion. We expect our Q1 installed base management sales to be around EUR950 million driven by a strong demand for field upgrades, especially EUV.Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 46% and 47%. The lower gross margin relative to the strong Q4 number is primarily due to the EUV mix effect, fewer immersion and more drive systems with some positive EUV mix effect.The expected R&D expenses for Q1 are around EUR550 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR140 million. Our estimated 2020 annualized effective tax rate is around 13%.Regarding our capital return, ASML paid total dividends of EUR1.3 billion, made up of the 2018 dividend and 2019 interim dividend, and purchased EUR410 million worth of shares in 2019. Through December 31st, 2019, ASML acquired 9 million shares of the 2018-2019 program for a total amount of EUR1.6 billion.Buoyed by our long-term business plan, ASML will submit a proposal at the 2020 annual general meeting of shareholders, to declare a dividend for 2019 of EUR2.40 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR1.05 paid in November 2019, this leads to a final dividend of EUR1.35 to be paid in the second quarter. This is a 14% increase compared to the 2018 dividend. The 2020 Annual General Meeting of shareholders will take place on April 22 in Veldhoven.ASML announced a three year share buyback program of up to EUR6 billion to be executed in 2020 through 2022. ASML intends to cancel these shares after we purchase, with the exception of up to 0.4 million shares, which will be used to cover employee share plans.With that I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter. -- Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had a very strong quarter, resulting in another solid year of growth, driven by Logic and EUV. We were able to achieve an 8% top line growth, despite an overall industry decline of around 10% due to a weak Memory market. There is always a reflection of our Logic customers drive, to continue to innovate and invest in technology for future nodes. For 2020, we currently expect the year of double-digit growth in both sales and profitability, primarily driven by EUV and installed base business.Major innovation drivers, such as artificial intelligence, 5G, high performance compute, is driving a big data, creating new end user applications. And these applications require more high-performance Logic, fueling increased demand for leading edge nodes, and this is evident in several customer announcements regarding ramp plans with the 7 and 5-nanometer nodes, which will drive another strong Logic year and an increased demand for EUV.In the memory market, customers have indicated they're seeing signs of demand recovery in some market channels and improvements in memory chip pricing, also support this view.As customers have lowered a little tool utilization to reduce wafer output throughout the weak Memory demand periods, they will first use this underutilization to return to normal supply levels, which will take some time. Subsequently, this will also trigger equipment demand, albeit a bit later than the supply demand recovery for memory devices. Taking the slope of the recovery of our litho equipment utilization as a proxy, it seems likely that we will see stronger litho equipment demand for Memory in the second half of the year.We expect significant growth in our installed base business, service business will continue to scale, as our installed base grows, and we will also see EUV contribute to service revenue, as these systems start running wafers and volume manufacturing now. We expect significant demand for upgrades, particularly in EUV, as customers utilize upgrades as a quick way to increase capacity.In EUV, it was a breakthrough year, with the technology now starting in high volume production and producing consumer products that are already available in the market. As we continue to execute on our accelerated EUV roadmap, we were able to ship our first NXE:3400C in 2019, which provides higher productivity, translating to increased customer value, delivering higher ASPs and improved gross margins.We shipped six 3400C systems in Q4, of the eight EUV systems total we shipped in the quarter, bringing the total to 26 EUV systems and the full year sales of around EUR2.8 billion in 2019. Increase in customer confidence in EUV is translating to more layers in Logic production, as well as expanding to new markets, with the adoption in Memory.For full year 2020, we plan for EUV sales of around EUR4.5 billion on 35 systems. We continue to see demand building for next year shipments and expect a healthy order flow to continue.In order to fulfill the expected strong demand increase, we're working on the cycle time reduction to enable the capacity of 45 to 50 systems next year. 2021 is shaping up to be a very busy year.Regarding our current outlook for the year, we expect 2020 to be another growth year as mentioned before. Although it's too early to provide quantitative expectations, let me make a few qualitative comments. Major innovation drives and applications that require high performance Logic, are driving increased demand at the advanced nodes.Logic demand is currently strong and we expect this demand to remain healthy, primarily driven by EUV. As previously communicated, we expect sales of EUR4.5 million on 35 systems this year, which translates to EUV sales growth of approximately 60%.Memory is showing early signs of recovery, and although there is still uncertainty around exact timing of the recovery, it is likely we will see stronger demand for the second half of the year, and taking this into account, we expect stronger second half with strengthening sales throughout the year.Certainly 2019 was another great year, with continued positive momentum in EUV, as well as solid demand across our entire product portfolio. We expect another growth year supported by healthy Logic demand, the likely recovery of the Memory market, with increased sales from our installed base business, as well as demand for EUV.The positive industry momentum around innovation and expanding new markets further strengthens our confidence in 2021 outlook, and our 2025 growth scenarios.With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. -- Thank you, Peter and Roger. The operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. Beforehand, I would like to ask that you kindly limit yourself to one question, with one short follow-up if necessary. This will allow us to get to as many callers as possible. Now operator, could we have your final instructions and then the first question please?Yes, thank you. At this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yes sir. Thanks for taking my question. My question has to do with your comment regarding EUV manufacturing capacity of 50 systems by 2021. Peter, do you think your backlog would reflect that capacity, as we progress through the year? In other words, would you be able to have a full commitment from your customer for full capacity. And my short follow-up has to do with your -- the multi-beam EUV wafer inspection. Are we still on target for the first shipment in the first half, and how should we think about -- the time it would take for your customers to evaluate the tool? -- Okay Mehdi, thanks. On the EUV capacity, yes, I think the backlog will reflect this. I think the order intake on the EUV is looking very healthy. So I have little doubt that we will have the backlog filled this year to support the capacity that we have lined out now for 2021.I think the issue here is really, we need to reduce the cycle time, which we have good plans for. I mean we see progress. I think the focus is on cycle time reduction in this case.And the multi-beam inspection. Yes, we will ship in the first half and I think the customers will probably take throughout this year to evaluate too, so that we can start shipping next year in higher volume. -- Great, thank you.The next question is from Mr. David Mulholland. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Hi, it is Dave Mulholland from UBS. Just to follow-up some of the comments you made around Memory. Obviously, there are some indicators, things are improving. I think some of the checks we've been doing through the supply chain are certainly pointing to improved capacity plans, particularly potentially from Q2. When do you think you could start seeing that in orders? And I guess in some respects, why haven't we already seen some of that in Q4? And then I'll come back with a follow-up. -- Yeah, thanks David. It's a good question. I wish I had a definite answer, because that would make things easier. So I am basically saying, we are -- what I said in my prepared remarks, that we see the utilization of our tools going up and we just extrapolate the slope of utilization increase.And I think it would mean that, in the first half of this year, we will see likely a return to a normal supply demand balance with our customers. Now they see that also, and taking into account the order delivery times, the order lead times. Then I would expect orders have to come in somewhere in Q2, in order for us to make sure that in the second half of the year, we could see an increase of our Memory business.Again, we're in this business for quite a long time and and in my experience, Memory always comes back with a vengeance. When it comes, it always comes quick. So we'll just have to wait. So I think it makes a big difference, whether they come back in Q2 or they come back in Q1 or in early Q3, I mean, it makes a big difference for the year.So we have to wait and see, and I wish I had a final and definite answer. -- And just once again, a follow-up on the installed base management business, obviously very strong run rate in Q1, at EUR950 million. How do you think about this on a full year basis? In the the past, you'd had a target I think of EUR3.7 billion, but been slightly more conservative run rate through the last couple of years. What's driving the pickup in Q1? How should we think about it on a full year basis? -- David, I think the, if you look at the Q1 and also if you look at Q4, you see that the momentum was already building up in Q4, where we already were slightly over EUR900 million, EUR950 million for the quarter. We expect that we will not be able to sustain it at this level for the entire year. I think the goal would be to say, that we're probably going to see a 20% increase over last year annualized. So that would, that would get to approximately EUR3.4 billion for the year. That's where we would see it for the full year. -- That's great. Thanks very much.The next question comes from Mr C.J. Muse. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I was hoping to hit on gross margins. Can you walk through where we exited on EUV in the fourth quarter, and that how you're seeing the trajectory for overall gross margins through the year increase EUV shipments, as well as likely higher immersion shipments in the back half for DRAM? -- Yeah. Thank you, C.J. So let me first talk about gross margin for EUV, and then give you the the wider picture on gross margin. -- So on EUV, what we said, as you know last year on the systems side, systems gross margin for EUV, we're looking at about 30%. This year, we're looking at about about 40%, four zero. So that's what, that's what we had in the plan, and that's what we're executing for and that's also in our models for this year.On the wider picture for gross margin and I know that many of you are looking at the Capital Markets Day. At the Capital Markets Day, we mentioned 50%. So let me start there, let me start at a 50% and let's look at what the circumstances were at the time, what the circumstances are today, and then we will start talking about how we see this further unfold, and what the potential is that we see for this year.So back in November at the Capital Markets Day in November 2018, I think there are three things that we should bear in mind. First off at that stage, what we modeled at that stage for you and that had the 50% in there, was what we called a mid-market growth scenario. And I think in all likelihood, if you look at the circumstances today, if we look at the circumstances of the the memory market today, then I think it will be hard to say that for the full year, we're looking at a mid-market scenario. It's definitely not what we're looking at today, depending on when it's going to come back and as Peter said, how it's going to come back, you could still on average, see a mid-market scenario. But at this stage, I think it's hard to say that we're looking at a mid-market scenario for that. At this stage, the memory market in these months is fairly flat. So that's one important circumstance I think to recognize.The second thing that I think changed from November 2018, and I think Peter already responded to that in the first question, is the multi-beam. So the delay in the multi-beam where -- I think we're going to see commercial application and commercial sales of multi-beam, only in 2021, where at the Capital Markets Day as you know, and as we already told you so last year, we are still looking for 2020, as commercial application of multi-beam. So that's in essence shifted with a little under one year. So that's the second circumstance to bear in mind.The third thing that deviates a little bit from what we told you in the Capital Markets Day in November 2018 is a bit of accounting issue and that has to do with the High-NA. We are preparing for High-NA, not just on the R&D side, but we're also preparing for High-NA on the manufacturing side and on the supply chain side. And we are incurring costs there that we cannot capitalize and have to run through cost of sales, which is a bit weird, because we're not selling High-NA. But nonetheless, that's for the accounting rules dictate you to do. And that represents a little short of 1% alone in gross margins.So those are three things to bear in mind that might be different from the perspective and the model that existed in November 2018.So now let's look at this year and let's look into 46% to 47% that we have for Q1, and let's look at the potential for the rest of the year. And I think there is a number of drivers in there, that I think could further drive the gross margin up. The first one obviously is related to the situation in the memory market, and that is pretty important, not just for the top line, but it's also very important for gross margin, because if we see a solid recovery in the second half of the memory market, that will have a significant impact on the sale of immersion tools, which as all of you know, comes with pretty high gross margin. And also with a good recovery in our voltage contrast business, which as you know, is also very much tied to the Memory business. And again, that is a very high margin product that we have.So if we get the recovery in the memory market, that will also have a significant impact on the gross margin on those two elements alone.The second element that will -- that is expected to further drive up the gross margin throughout the year, is the EUV service. EUV service for the full year is still expected to be -- to have negative gross margin. But over -- quarter-over-quarter, you will see a sustained improvement in the gross margin that we have on EUV service. For two reasons; first off, because as you know, with the number of customers we have the paper wafer model, and to the extent that EUV continues to go into a high volume manufacturing, obviously we got more revenue. And secondly, the costs that we have per EUV machine goes down, because we get, we get more efficient in doing it and we also get scale effects as a result of that.So quarter-over-quarter, you will see that the EUV service margin will improve. For the full year, it's still negative, but at least in Q4, maybe even a little before that, we will see it starts to become positive.A third improvement that we expect to occur in the course of this year will be the introduction of our new immersion tool. The NXT:2050, which again comes with a good improvement of our gross margin. So those are three significant drivers that we have that we believe give us, give us a good shot at achieving a significant improvement of our gross margin, particularly in the second half, and a good shot at the 50%.And then this 50%, we will be able to then sustain further into 2021, which as Peter already alluded to, we think is going to be a very busy year and a very busy year at that stage, would also come with a number of scale benefits in our gross margin and better fixed cost coverage. And also in 2021, we would see the introduction of a successor to EUV, that would also again come with gross margin improvement. So then we think the momentum that would be created in the second half around reaching the 50% would then be further sustained and elaborated on into 2021 time frame. -- Very, very helpful. If I may follow-up, I think the buyback announcement as we're moving into high volume manufacturing EUV, seems to be a bit of an inflection here for ASML moving into cash cow mode. So curious if there are metrics that we should be looking at, whether it's free cash flow margins or working on working capital or perhaps CapEx intensity coming down as you've invested in EUV capacity, High-NA, multi-beam. So curious if there is kind of metrics we should be looking at, to gauge free cash flow in the coming years? -- Yeah. And so -- in the short term, you will see that with the increase in EUV and EUV becoming increasingly important for the company, given the cycle time of EUV is significantly longer than Deep UV. In the short-term you may expect that inventory levels will continue to go up a little bit, that's a dynamic on the one hand. And also in the short term as you, as I think we've said before, you might expect that the CapEx level that you've seen for 2019, that will be above the CapEx level that you might expect for this year and for next year. So around EUR900 million to EUR1 billion is a CapEx number that we think is likely for this year and for next year. So those are dynamics in I would say the short-term.In the years thereafter. I expect CapEx level to level off and actually go down, because then the significant preparation for our future I think CapEx wise, I think will have been done and we'll be able to go down. Also, I would expect that in a one to two year timeframe, you might expect inventory levels to go down for a number of reasons. First off, at that stage we talk about 2021; there is a significant buildup of our capacity for EUV. But once you are there and once you are at those levels, then the further build up of inventory will no longer have an impact on your inventory levels. And secondly, as we mentioned before, the way we believe we will be able to get an increase in our capacity from the 35%-ish that we have for this year to the 45%, 50%, that we talked about for 2021, will primarily be the reduction of cycle time, and of course the reduction of cycle time will then kick in and further reduce working capital requirement.So in the short term, I think the burden on working capital will still there. In the longer run, so let's say 1.5, two years you will see that we will be able to get it under control better.One final dynamic as far as that is concerned, we talked to you in previous calls on the introduction of down payments for EUV, which we're pushing and where we have the initial accomplishments on that in 2019, and will continue to drive that, and that will also be a mitigating factor, if you like, in our working capital burden.So long winding answer, just to tell you that in spite of all of that, in spite of this preparation for the growth, we're still looking at a pretty healthy free cash flow development both this year and next year, and then the years thereafter, I think the free cash flow that we generate will further increase substantially. And all of that taken together gives us more than enough comfort to introduce this EUR6 billion program for the next three years.Okay, next question, Krish Sankar. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Hi, it's Krish Sankar from Cowen. And Roger thanks for the detailed comments on gross margin. I had two questions, first one on EUV. So Peter, it looks like your commentary on 2020 EUV of 35 systems at EUR4.5 billion revenue next year, about 45 to 50 systems capacity, is similar to about three months ago. I was in the impression that over the last three months at the margin, there was more incremental demand from DRAM for EUV. So I'm just wondering, is that an issue that you are still capacity-constrained and that's why you cannot ship more, are you being conservative? And then my second question is, how do to think about DUV units this year relative to 2019? Would it be similar levels, lower or higher, any color would be helpful? -- Yeah, on your first question, actually I tried to answer that in an earlier question that, the issue with 2021 is to make sure that we can reduce the cycle time so much that we can create capacity between 45 and 50 units, which is a capacity issue, not a demand issue. So yes, DRAM will be there. I would just have to make sure that we can squeeze as many EUV systems out of our available square meters, so that we can fulfill the customer demand. Its not a demand issue, its a capacity issue. So in that sense, that's why the commentary is similar to what we did last quarter, because the capacity lead time unfortunately is a lot longer than just the customer order lead time.Now on the DUV units, good question. Very much changes on and Roger said on the recovery of the memory market. Yeah so Memory is still very much driven by immersion. Of course, we are seeing with the increased number of EUV systems in Logic, some cannibalization because of multiple patterning schemes that will actually move on to single patterning EUV schemes. Now so it would not see a recovery of the Memory business, which I do not expect, because we do expect a recovery. Clearly, these regions would be down, but it's really the timing of the of the Memory recovery that will determine how much of the deep UV units we're going to see this year. As I said, it is really hinging on the timing of the Memory recovery. -- Got it. Thank you very much, Peter.The next question, Alexander Duval. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yes, hi there. Alex from Goldman Sachs. Just wanted to ask or clarify on the extra R&D and SG&A for the first quarter, that you've guided to versus where the Street was, and just wondered if you could help decompose a bit, the most important drivers and sort of what underpins them? For example, to what extent is this more about investing in faster cycle times for those 50 or 45 to 50 units of 2021? To what extent is it about increasing functionality of future EUV versions, as we move beyond the 3400C? And to what extent does it hinge on any other key factors? Many thanks. -- So on R&D, last quarter, we were at EUR516 million this quarter, we're guiding EUR550 million, and I think that the vast majority of that increase is labor cost increase. As we mentioned before, at this stage, we have a broader capacity that we think we need, in order to accomplish the R&D objectives that we have, which are all of the things that you just mentioned, that primarily focused on the low-NA, high-NA roadmap, multi-beam, but also a number of developments in Deep UV obviously.So we think we have the capacity that we need in order to get that done, and that's why we said on previous calls, expect the going-out rate for for the fourth quarter to be the basis and then obviously it needs to be, what we call inflation-adjusted, which is obviously linked to wage increases for that. And that's what you see. So the 6% increase increase from EUR516 million EUR550 million really is primarily the wage increase on the R&D department.N terms of SG&A SG&A I think is modeled at EUR140 million, which is I think very much in line with with what you saw in previous quarters. Q4 had a little bit of a spike, and there were some accounting adjustments in there, in Q4 that had a little impact. And also in the process of implementing a new IT system, which has some impact on the SG&A number, but those are small things. But the guidance of EUR140 million I think is pretty much in line with what we were in previous quarters, and obviously there to the wage impact. -- On the wage impact, I don't think we give our people 10% wage increase, because that will probably raise a lot of questions and when people start listening to this call, it's the combination of the normally inflationary wage increase and the fact that, of course, we added people in 2019. So you see the full year effect now of that growth in R&D in 2020, which actually happened throughout 2019, but now you see the full year wage effect. -- Very clear. Many thanks.Next question is from Joe Quatrochi. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yeah, thanks. It's Wells Fargo. I had a question on the Memory side. I know that ASML has historically been more tied to DRAM than NAND. So I was hoping you could kind of help us kind of parse out the comments that you've made in terms of the recovery and seeing potentially improved bookings kind of looking into 2Q. Is that more of a NAND flash comment, or should we think about that from a DRAM perspective? -- Yeah, I think if you split the DRAM and NAND, and only, like I said the proxy [Phonetic] that we have is, basically looking at some utilization data. I think it is first noticeable in 3D NAND. I also think the slope of the recovery is a bit more aggressive in NAND than in DRAM. But they are both there. Having said that, I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that customers were creating underutilization, in order to make sure that they could rebalance supply and the demand in the memory space sooner, That underutilization correction was also deeper in 3D NAND. So that was also not a big surprise that of course the return slope back up is also a little bit steeper.But that's where we are. I think as we had started a bit earlier, its a bit steeper slope, but both are trending in the upper direction. -- Okay, that's helpful. And then just for the March quarter guide. I was wondering in the past, you guys have given us kind of the EUV shipment and revenue expectation for the quarter. So I was curious if you could give us that for the March quarter, because I know there's four shipments systems rather that are included from 2019, and then maybe just any thoughts on the cadence for 2020, just now given that the 3400C is available for the full year? -- Yeah, I think we've indicated in the past that, as soon as we really see that EUV is in essence going into high volume manufacturer, and also at a point where we can take revenue upon shipment, that would be the time we are no longer going to give separate guidance on EUV shipments. So that is clearly the case by now. So that's the reason why starting this year, we no longer do that.What we do however, is continue to indicate at least for 2020 for the full year, we gave you an indication of the euro value and also the number of units for EUV for the full year. And of course we will report quarter by quarter, we will report to you what the euro number and the unit number of that will be.As it relates to your second question on how is it distributed over the year, it's not completely evenly distributed. Its a little bit tilted toward the second half, but only -- but modestly so. So it's not as exacerbated, if you like, as we had it in 2019. There's a better balance, but it is still, a little bit tilted toward the second to half of 2020. -- Thank you.Next question, Janardan Menon. Please state company name followed by your question. -- Hi, good afternoon. It's Janardan Menon from Liberum. I just had two follow-ups on the Logic side, especially on the EUV front -- sorry on the DUV front. So if I take your your growth number for this year, just calculating EUV revenues alone, you're going from EUR2.8 billion to EUR4.5 billion. I'm assuming that much of that is going to be Logic shipments. And so, if I put that EUR1.7 billion of additional revenue, which on the Logic revenue of EUR6.6 billion last year, that's about 25% of additional growth in Logic for this year. I'm just wondering, given that DUV shipments will probably come down during the year, what kind of a decline in DUV are we looking at? Is it three or four units, in which case you will still be growing your Logic revenues at about 20% or higher? Or will the DUV drop be a bit more than that, and you could be sort of in that 10% to 20% range of growth on your Logic side?And a short follow-up on the EUV capacity, given that you're seeing so much of demand for EUV right now, and you're saying that in 2020, it's more a capacity issue, otherwise, you probably could ship 50 units. What can you do to add capacity further into 2022, if this kind of strength, and especially if the memory market, the DRAM market comes in more strongly for EUV in 2022 and the Logic strength continues. Is there scope to further reduce cycle time to take your unit shipments above 50%, or can you use some of the base in your High-NA, new facility for low-NA systems, if that were to be required? Is there ways you can go above 50 units by 2022? -- Let me take the first question and then Peter can go into the second question. If you piece together the data points that we gave you, I think you can find sort of an answer to your first question. So as Peter said in the video, we're looking at a double-digit growth. So if you do that math, and you have a number that you arrive at and then we gave you two other important components; on the one hand, indeed as you mentioned EUR4.5 billion for EUV. And also on this call, we gave you the 20% increase over the installed base, which would get you to approximately EUR3.4 billion. So then you can sort of calculate where DUV and apps [Phonetic] combined, where they would land for the year. And I think that's what you're looking at. And of course, as Peter said, it will be dependent upon the the timing and the extent of the of the recovery. But we believe that the number that you derive in that way is a safe number to go by, with some potential obviously, if the Memory recovery is significant and timely. -- Peter second question on the... -- Second question on the -- when you look at the EUV capacity that we currently have and like I said, it will be driven by cycle time reduction, because the lead time reduction for capacity adds is longer. Yes, for 2020 -- beyond 2021, we are looking to bring the output capability above 50%. Now, which is what we're doing today, is really looking at how much should that be. If we have to go over 60%, we probably need to extend square meters of production capacity at ASML and add suppliers, which could be, like you said, using production facilities that we're currently building for High-NA, use that temporary use in low-NA. Although we'd like to prevent that, because you have been here Janardan. I mean, these days are different, the High-NA days are different than the low-NA base. So it would mean some extra costs. But if push comes to shove, you could probably do that. But I think we can -- with our [Indecipherable] probably we can go over 50%. But I think it will be very difficult to go over 60%. And so, if we have to go over 60%, then we probably need to quickly add some manufacturing capacity, at ASML and the supply chain. -- Understood. Thank you very much.Next question is Amit Harchandani. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Hello, everyone. Amit Harchandani from Citi and thanks for letting me on. A couple if I may? The first question goes back to the demand for EUV. You've talked about obviously the capacity for 2021. In terms of the drivers of demand from your customers, what really do you think is changing or accelerating from a customer standpoint? Is it the number of layers of adoption? Is it the pace of cadence down the nodes. Is it dead end customers push? Could you give us a sense for what really do you think is driving this optimism and acceleration toward the number that you've talked about for 2021, from a customer standpoint? And then I have a follow-up. -- Yeah, Amit, I mean, the easy answer is, all of the above. So yes, we are seeing increase of layer count. The fact that EUV is worse [Phonetic] also, gives the customer the confidence on their roadmap, and when they get confidence on the roadmap, you see a cadence change. There's a push, basically a pull-in. But also I think the discussion we're having with customers and customers having with us, although without going into very specific customer details, they will never do that. It's very clear that the number of tape-outs and the requests from their customers, our customers' customers on different types of end applications is going up.So it is basically the combination of those three things, I mean, you've mentioned them all. And that's what it is, and I think we are responding to what our customers are asking us, based on those three drivers, and this is why we come to the problem of more the capacity issue in 2021 than, you know a demand issue. -- Thank you, Peter. And secondly, if I may, could you maybe give us your latest thoughts on how you're thinking about demand from indigenous customers in China? There is obviously news flow around the EUV tool and you've commented on that very clearly. But more more broadly, as you think of your 2020 guidance and 2021, things have changed a bit since November 2018. Any clarity on demand from indigenous China, the various end markets, and what are baked into your assumptions right now? -- Yeah, I think things of course changed -- the markets changed since November 2018. But I would say on China, we're pretty much on target in terms of the strategic roll out, especially in the memory space, in Logic, and it's not so much a leading edge Logic, it's more the mature Logic systems. I think our current assessment of the market is a bit higher than it was at 2018. So if anything, at leading edge, we're on plan. On the trailing edge, in a more mature technology, I do see -- we see an upside, but no downside. -- Okay. Thank you.Next question, Achal Sultania. Please state your company name followed by your questions. -- Hi, good afternoon. It's Achal from Credit Suisse. Roger, maybe on EUV services gross margins. Just trying to understand, like how much of a headwind it has been on -- at a group level in 2019? Obviously, you made a comment that it will get to -- it will still be loss making this year. But basically, we have improvement through the year. So I'm just trying to understand, how much of it has been already a headwind in '19? And then how quickly can that business ramp up toward 40, 45 services gross margins, like you have, most likely in DUV? Does it take two years, three years? Any color around that would be helpful? And then secondly on the mix, when you talk about this 45 to 50 capacity for EUV in 2021, can you help us understand like, obviously Logic is -- foundry is a big part of that number, but what are you hearing from Logic and DRAM customers, in terms of the unit breakdown of that 45 to 50 unit number? Thank you. -- Thank you. So on the gross margin impact of EUV service, that was around 2% for 2019. So that's the gross margin impact of that in 2019. As I mentioned to you, we do see it coming to a positive number in the course of this year. I expect it to be at least Q4 -- maybe even before that, that it will turn positive.Before we have EUV service gross margin and the corporate gross margin level. I think we're probably two, three years away from that. But the aspiration clearly is there to have it at that stage and the timeframe. -- And on the split, the 45 to 50 unit split. The math -- I am not going to give you any details, but the majority, I mean the -- it's above the 50% is going to go to the Logic space. So we are still dominated by Logic. But clearly, the 2021 numbers for DRAM will go up. It is logical. I mean we have -- in the Logic space we have several customers. In the DRAM space, we still have one. So that's also an issue that will drive the division between Logic and between DRAM. But it is going to be significantly -- above 50% is going to be Logic. -- Okay. Thank you, Peter and Roger.Next question, Adithya Metuku. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Its Bank of America. I had two questions. Firstly, just thinking about the Memory demand as we go through this year and into next year? Obviously, when we look at the last few years going into 2018, we had a very strong increase. We had a doubling in '17 and then another 50% increase in revenues from Memory customers in '18. Now when you look at the next two years. Obviously, things may be a little different and I know it's very difficult to give a pinpoint number. But I just wondered what do you have in your scenarios internally, and then where do you see -- if Memory was to come back in 1Q, where do you see memory revenues for this year, and if it were to come back in 3Q, where do you see that coming? Any color that you can give us to help us get a rough sense of where we might end up, would be very helpful? And then secondly, just a question for Roger, just on the OpEx. I just wondered if you could confirm whether the OpEx annualizing 1Q number would be a good proxy for the full year or whether there was anything else we need to think about? Thank you. -- Yeah, well, I think on the question on the Memory demand, I guess I did give you some indication. I can repeat myself. But when I look at it -- the best proxy we have, is to just look at how our machines are being used. And that's why I said, I do believe that in the first half, and it is a bit difficult to understand like the exact timing or to gauge the exact timing; because they will be -- in the first half, I think our customers will come back to this, more healthy supply demand balance, and they will see this coming, so they will place order. So for us, it's going to be -- likely going to be a second half event. But having said that, I mean 2019 was of course a weak memory market for us and also in the first half of 2020, could be not very strong. As Roger indicated, and but when it come back the second half, will have an impact on our business, also on our financial performance.But whether memory goes, comes back, then I think you need to look into 2021. I think I said it earlier, 2021, we do see strong EUV demand. I see no reason why the demand of our customers for leading edge products in the memory space, 5-nanometer will kick in, then, will go down. But when the Memory recovery started in the second half of the year for us, is it will extend into 2021. So you then have had effectively a year and a half of a Memory downturn, which I think historically is not long, but not short either. So we just thought it all seems to fit. This is the kind of color that I can give you, based on top of what I already said. -- And Adithya, on your questions on OpEx. Indeed, I can confirm that what we have, so the EUR550 million for R&D and the EUR140 million for SG&A, those are good run rates for the quarters in this year. -- Thank you, guys.Next question, Sandeep Deshpande. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yeah hi. Sandeep Deshpande at JP Morgan. Most of my questions have been answered. But just actually a clarification, Peter. Firstly on -- whenever this Memory recovery occurs, I mean you can see how the customer utilization is doing. Your exposure to NAND is lower than your exposure in DRAM. But do you see that NAND utilization is rising faster than DRAM or vice-versa at this point, because that will determine the timing of when your orders come in? And then secondly, regarding these -- the multi-beam tools that you're working on, you think at this point, is the view that these will begin shipping in 2021, and thus be -- that there could be even further accretion to the margin in 2021? Thank you. -- I think I will do the recovery. Like I said earlier, with the slope of the utilization recovery, its a bit faster, bit steeper for 3D NAND. But they also come from a deeper point. So in that sense -- and yes, we have, as you mentioned, less exposure to the 3D NAND market. But the 3D NAND market needs a lot of exposure. So I mean this is what we are counting and this is what we're seeing.So I think NAND, probably rising a bit faster. I think that could be the conclusion. Sorry, your second part was? -- The second part was on the gross margin and multi-beam tools. -- Oh, the multi-beam tools. Okay. Yeah. -- Sandeep, multi-beam as I mentioned; multi-beam is expected to be a high-margin product. So to the extent that when it will go into into commercial application, and that is expected for 2021. We do believe that it will be accretive to our gross margin. -- Because it is not always, if you look at the multi -- as you look at the leading tool. It's a machine that is very much -- it is compute power. So there's a lot of software also. That's why margins are generally higher in e-beam space than in the lithography space. -- Understood. Thank you.Next question, Aleksander Peterc. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. This is Alex from SocGen. I'd just like to understand, as you now contemplate 45 to 50 EUV units in '21, does this in any meaningful way, accelerate your path to higher gross margins, more closer to DUV for your EUV business overall? Or there is nothing changed in terms of your gross margin scenario for this business unit? And then, just briefly, your comments regarding the timing of free cash flow generation. It looks like over the next three years, you will have an acceleration of free cash flow generation? -- Yeah. So let's first talk about the gross margin for EUV. I do believe a further increase in numbers will improve our gross margin, for three reasons. One is obvious right, to the extent that -- given the capacity that we have, we have a higher output of course, your fixed cost coverage will improve. And as we mentioned, the increase in capacity will be achieved by reducing cycle time. Will not be achieved by further CapEx. So that's why, more units will result in gross margin improvement. That's one element.The second element is, to the extent that we have more of these tools in the field, that also means that our surface margin will in all likelihood improve, because the number of -- the more tools we have in one location, the more efficiency we have in having our service crews there. So then the efficiency per tool will further increase. And thirdly, not necessarily related to the number of units, but since you talk specifically to 2021, as I mention that, we will also see the introduction of the successor to the 3400C, which again we are hopeful will bring such value to our customers that the gross margin will benefit from that. So yeah, number of reasons why I think -- why we believe, gross margin for EUV will continue to further improve through 2021 and beyond.On the free cash flow question, I think that is right as well. So I mentioned to you in the very short term, the working capital burden that we have from further growing to let's say, this capacity level that we talked about, will be there; because you know, given the cycle time, it will mean that we have to take significantly more inventory on board to get it done. But then at a certain stage, you will see the offsetting factor the fact that cycle times get reduced. So I think in this one-year window, you will see a spike and then a leveling off, as a result of the reduction of the cycle time. And as I also mentioned, we do want to get down payments more as the default in our commercial model, and that should also -- at some stage, lead to an offset in the working capital burden. -- We have time for one last question. If you were unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations department. Now, operator, may we have the last caller, please.Yes sir. Mitch Steves, please state your company name, followed by your question. -- Hey, it's RBC Capital Markets. Most of my questions are answered, but I just want to clarify a couple small points. So first of all, based on the tone of this call, it sounds like 2021, probably being a accelerated growth year relative to 2020. I want to make sure that that's a reasonable assumption? Then secondly, I realize you guys can't time the exact recovery of Memory, but from a historical perspective, when you look at when the memory market recovers, what type of sequential growth do you expect from the initial initial first batch of recovery, if I look at your Q-over-Q number? -- Well, I think the second question is almost impossible to answer. I mean you could say -- the Memory business is quite different than it was a couple of years ago. I mean six players in 3D NAND, three in DRAM. So those patterns will also be a function of the composition of that market, and individual position of those companies in that market. So, it is really difficult to use historical rates as a proxy for what's going to happen now. I think I'm yes, potentially what could be an accelerated growth here. However, Roger said it, I mean, even without the assumption on the recovery of the memory market and the growth of the memory market, where we see a double-digit growth is -- this year based on Logic and on the the installed base management, on top of that we could see a recovery of the memory market. So I think you could see an acceleration this year also.Now that's not for the full year, granted, because we do expect that in this second half. So, but it will definitely continue like I said earlier, once this memory market recovers, it doesn't recover for two quarters. I mean it recovers a longer period, like it always does. On top of the Logic market. So yeah, I think we are looking forward to some acceleration. -- All right, thanks. Now, on behalf of ASML, I'd like to thank you for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.[Operator Closing Remarks]. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Usually, stocks that nearly double within one year -- especially ones as large as ASML, at a $126 billion market capitalization -- need to have everything go right for them. That was the case in 2019, as the  and semiconductor sectors rebounded, ASML executed extremely well, and investor sentiment surged. Specifically, ASML is the sole provider of a unique technology that should be very important to the chip industry for years to come.Image source: ASML.Of course, one reason ASML had such a banner year was because it had come into the year with such low expectations. In late 2018, the entire chip sector was in a tailspin, as rising interest rates and the intensifying U.S.-China trade war sparked fears of a coming recession.However, during 2019, the Federal Reserve stopped hiking interest rates and even began lowering them, and U.S.-China relations, while bumpy, thawed throughout the back half of the year. But the real boost to ASML and its semiconductor equipment peers came from much-stronger-than-expected demand for leading-edge chips for 5G handsets and base stations. In response,  , the largest global foundry for leading-edge chips,  compared with expectations at the beginning of the year.That means many more purchases of ASML's equipment, especially its extreme ultraviolet deposition (EUV) machines.  helps foundries produce smaller and smaller chips, with the ability to etch semiconductor wafers with extremely thin light, thereby cutting out many steps of traditional DUV etching. Because of the difficulty in bringing this technology to market, ASML is the only provider of this technology, and sells its EUV machines for roughly $125 million per unit. Customers are clamoring for 7nm chips, as well as 5nm chips to come in 2020. Given the hot competition among vendors to make the best 5G phones, as well as increasing adoption of high-performance computing for artificial intelligence applications, it seems like the good times should continue for ASML -- though perhaps not quite as good as the banner 2019.Memory companies are also exploring EUV for DRAM production, though that is currently in the test phase.

Instead of focusing on the positives, many reported that September\u2019s sales were down 0.3% from August. But, year-over-year, September\u2019s numbers were up 4.1%.True, auto sales and receipts at service stations both fell. But McCall points out that the service station figure most likely reflects cheaper gasoline. Plus, the core retail sales figure doesn\u2019t count those categories due to their historical volatility. On the brighter side, clothing and furniture sales were both up, as were sales from restaurants and bars.

The subject of today's call is ASML's 2019 third quarter results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes and questions will be taken in the order that they are received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call.Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's Annual Report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction. -- Thank you, Skip. Welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 results conference call. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the third quarter, as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of our third quarter financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook.So, Roger, if you want. -- Thank you, Peter. Welcome everyone. I will first highlight some of the third quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2019. Q3 net sales came in at EUR3 billion as guided. Net system sales of EUR2.3 billion was heavily weighted toward Logic at 79%, with the remaining 21% from Memory, clearly showing the current strength of Logic business and the digestion mode of Memory business. We reported EUV system sales of EUR743 million from seven shipments as guided.Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR661 million, which was a bit lower than guided. We expect this will be captured in a higher Q4 Installed Base sales. Gross margin for the quarter was 43.7%, nicely within the range we guided. Overall R&D and SG&A expenses came in as guided, with R&D expenses at EUR493 million and SG&A expenses at EUR129 million.Turning to the balance sheet. EUR154 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q3. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR2.1 billion.Moving to the order book. Q3 system bookings came in at a record EUR5.1 billion, mainly driven by EUV, where we received 23 new orders in the quarter, both from Logic and Memory customers. Logic order intake was 73% of the total value, with the remaining 27% from Memory, again reflecting the strong Logic demand. Net income in Q3 was EUR627 million, representing 21% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR1.49.With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect Q4 total net sales of around EUR3.9 billion, which would represent another record year with approximately EUR11.7 billion of sales. Our total net sales forecast for Q4 includes around EUR950 million of EUV system sales from eight planned shipments. Four systems originally planned in Q4 will now ship in early 2020 due to temporary supply constraints in the NXE:3400C ramp.We expect our Q4 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR850 million, which is almost EUR200 million higher than Q3, driven by strong demand for field upgrades. Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be between 48% and 49%, which is significantly higher than Q3. The expected improvement in margin is due to higher system volume, higher ASP for NXE:3400C model, Deep UV product mix, higher EUV service sales and higher field upgrade sales. The expected R&D expenses for Q4 are around EUR500 million and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR135 million. Our estimated 2019 annualized effective tax rate is around 7% due to several tax benefits in 2019. We still expect our long-term effective tax rate to be 14%.Regarding our capital return. ASML announces that it has revised its capital return policy to provide for dividend payments on a semi-annual basis. ASML dividend proposals will continue to be subject to the availability of distributable profits or retained earnings and other factors, such as future liquidity requirements. The interim dividend over 2019 will be EUR1.05 per ordinary share. The ex-dividend date as well as the fixing date for the Euro-US dollar conversion will be November 4, 2019, and the record date will be November 5, 2019. The dividend will be made payable on November 15, 2019.In January 2018, ASML announced its intention to purchase up to EUR2.5 billion worth of shares to be executed within the 2018-2019 timeframe. ASML intends to cancel these shares after repurchase, with the exception of up to 2.4 million shares, which will be used to cover employee share plans.Through September 29, 2019, ASML has acquired 8.2 million shares under this program for a total consideration of EUR1.4 billion. ASML does not expect to purchase the full EUR2.5 billion worth of shares within the 2018-2019 time frame. In line with our policy to return excess cash to shareholders through growing annualized dividends and regularly timed share buybacks, we will decide on a new share buyback program next year.With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter. -- Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, it was a good quarter and provided another clear signal on the increasing customer confidence in EUV technology, as witnessed by the strong EUV order volume for both Logic and Memory manufacturing. We expect a very strong fourth quarter in both sales and profitability, again driven by Logic demand for both EUV and Deep UV. And this further confirms 2019 to be a Logic driven year as we indicated at the start of the year, fueled by end-market applications requiring high performance compute, such as 5G and AI, which drives demand for leading-edge Logic. This in turn translates to demand for both EUV and Deep UV in support of the most advanced nodes as customers accelerate their ramp plans for 7-nanometer and beyond.In Memory, as the market continues to digest inventory in the supply chain and operate with reduced wafer output as they work to reach a more normalized supply demand balance. And this translates into a weak demand from our Memory customers and we see a significant reduction in our Memory business this year as indicated in earlier conference calls. We expect this weaker demand environment to continue through Q4 of this year, whereby the timing of the recovery still remains uncertain. We continue to expect low-single digit percentage increase in our Installed Base sales this year.Let me now turn to the ASML's product side and update you on our EUV business. In EUV, our customers continue to ramp this technology in volume manufacturing and have publicly announced some of their first EUV manufactured devices. We continue to make solid progress and shipped our first NXE:3400C systems this quarter for use in volume manufacturing. The NXE:3400C will deliver an increased and -- will deliver an increase in productivity of over 35%, which will provide significant customer value and bring profitability in our EUV business more in line with the rest of the business. The higher productivity of the 3400C demonstrated the required capability for Memory insertion as evidenced by the system orders, as well as a potential increase of layer adoption in Logic. Of the seven EUV system shipped this quarter, three were NXE: 3400C systems and we plan to ship another six 3400C systems next quarter of the total eight systems planned in Q4.As Roger mentioned, there were some temporary challenges in the supply chain as we ramp our output capability and transition to a new fully configured 3400C model. These supply constraints resulted in a movement of a few systems originally planned to ship in Q4, into early next year. Customers are aggressively bringing new technology to the market and with increased customer confidence around EUV technology, we're seeing strong demand for our EUV systems as witnessed by the strong order intake of 23 systems in Q3. These systems are planned for the ramp of 7-nanometer Logic and beyond, as well as insertion in 1z and 1a DRAM production. To meet strong customer demand for our 3400C systems, we have a production plan in place for 35 EUV systems next year, which includes the systems original planned in 2019.To summarize 2019, we see a strong fourth quarter in both sales and profitability. Logic has been the primary driver of growth this year and demand has strengthened as customers accelerate the ramp of their advanced nodes. Memory demand remains weak as customers work to reduce inventory and improve fab utilization. Our overall view for the year remains largely unchanged and we confirm 2019 to be another year of growth.Regarding our outlook for next year, it's too early to provide quantitative expectations but will make a few qualitative comments. Major innovation drivers in applications like Artificial Intelligence, 5G, Autonomous Driving and Big Data are driving a clear secular growth path in high performance Logic at the advanced nodes. Logic demand is currently strong and although different Logic customers are at different phases of accelerating their roadmap. We expect this demand to remain healthy, primarily driven by EUV as we look into next year.As customers transition to the 7-nanometer node and beyond, with increasing EUV layers, it is also driving strong demand for our EUV systems. As all systems are expected to be NXE:3400C systems next year, we expect to not only see an increase in unit volume, but also expect to see significant growth in EUV sales next year. These new applications -- these new application drivers not only require high performance Logic but also require high performance Memory to maximize value. Memory demand is more critical in nature -- sorry, Memory demand is more cyclical -- it's more cyclical in nature and the Memory market conditions today do not yet reflect what we would call moderate market conditions per the scenario that we used to model 2020 as we -- as was shown during our Investor Day last year. Although the Memory market is widely expected to recover next year, there is uncertainty on the timing and when it will trigger the demand for wafer fab equipment, and more specifically, demand for our Deep UV and Applications products. When the Memory market recovers, history has shown that the demand can change quickly and it likely will be the case again this time.The timing and the degree of this memory -- of this memory recovery in combination with the current outlook for the Logic demand will determine the ultimate 2020 product mix between EUV, Deep UV and Applications products. This not only forms the basis for another year of growth, but depending on this mix, we will also determine the margin profile for the year as our EUV margin improvement is well under way but not yet at the Deep UV levels.Regarding Installed Base business next year, we expect the service portion of this business to grow nicely as our Installed Base grows. As our customer start running EUV in high volume production, we therefore expect to see more EUV service sales next year. There are also a large number of upgrades planned next year that we expect will drive significant growth in our upgrade business.In summary, the positive momentum in EUV is reflected in the increasing confidence of our customers as they accelerate the adoption of EUV technology in volume manufacturing. Although there is still some short-term uncertainty around timing and the degree of the memory recovery, we are optimistic on the medium to long-term secular trend which underpins the confidence we have in our 2025 growth scenarios.With that, we will be happy to take your questions. -- The operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. Beforehand, I would like to ask you that you kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up if necessary. This will allow us to get to as many callers as possible.Now, operator, could we have your final instructions and then the first question please.Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Joe Quatrochi, Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. -- Hi. If you could help us with your 2020 EUV guide. The 35 systems that you're shipping, correct me, I think I've heard you correctly that those include the four tools that slipped from 2019. I was wondering if you could help us understand how do we think about the EUV revenue growth to your expectations entering 2020? -- Sure, Joe. So, you're right, the 35 systems for 2020 they do include the -- they do include four that slipped from 2019 into 2020. The systems that we're looking at for 2020 will be 3400C systems, and importantly, there will be 3400C systems in final configuration which is important, and therefore, the average sales price of those systems will reflect the -- about 30% increase over the 3400B system. So that's the way to calculate the revenue for 2020. -- Okay. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, those systems being the full 3400C systems have an impact on the number of systems that ultimately you plan to ship in 2020, I guess, just given the higher throughput? -- No, the calculation of 35 is reflective of the total throughput that the 3400C and final configuration will bring. -- Okay. Thank you.Next question is from Mr. David Mulholland. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Hi, it's David Mulholland from UBS. Just following-up on planning for next year, because obviously previously we've been talking about anywhere between 30 and 35 systems to ship next year, and obviously in theory that have become 39 unit capacity for next year at the high end. Do you still have optionality to do that into next year?And then just as a follow-up. On HMI, I just wonder if you could give us an update on where we are with the progress on that, because the revenue run rate still been quite low in the last few quarters compared to what your aspirations where when you closed the deal. So it would be helpful just to get some thoughts on what progress we're seeing on that business into 2020? -- Yeah. Okay. Thank you, David. On the 30 to 35 systems that's what we said before, and indeed, you are correct unless as Roger had mentioned that we have four systems that we planned to ship in 2019 move into 2020, so we put them on top. But as you also know that in 2019 we were back end loaded this year, so we already said that at the beginning of the year, and with the introduction of the C, we experienced a few weeks delay on certain modules that are part of the final configuration of the C. So that's why it moved into 2020. So just to be on the safe side, we are -- we could argue without the four systems that moved from 2019 to 2020, we're on the lower side of this 30 to 35 range and that is correct. So plus four, that's why we say at 31 plus 4 is about 35 systems. Does that mean that we don't have more capability? No. We do have more capability, but I think we're just more on the conservative side also given what happened this year back end loaded that could mean that you always have a risk of moving some systems in to 2021. So you should look at it in this context.Now on HMI, as you know HMI shipments were largely focused on the Memory business. It's focused contrast applications in the 3D NAND space, that of course has been lackluster as we all know, and especially for 2019. So yes, you know that recovery of that sales number will of course happen when the Memory market and especially the 3D NAND market comes back. -- Roger, Can you just help, how do you feel on the axial technology programs, first, multi-beam and kind of the big steps that you were hoping to see in the business? -- Yeah, I think we are -- the first pilot system will ship early Q1 of next year and that means that -- and as I mentioned on earlier calls, we had a six month to nine month delay on the program as compared to the timing that we discussed with you at the time of the acquisition as it has to do with the fact that we -- that we focused on partnering up with one of our key suppliers for the optics. Now for well-known reasons and good reasons that particular participation of that partner could not happen and that actually meant we had to do it ourselves, which created the six month to nine month delay. So that means that the first pilot systems are going out in Q1 next year, but you have to add about a year before we go into HVM. So the anti multi-beam HVM ramp will be about 12 months, they will later move into 2021. -- Excellent. Thank you very much.Next question is from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yes, thank you. Just a follow-up Peter to the last question. Would it be fair to say that as you ship this first multi-beam, e-beam system early next year you gain more momentum. Then, by the time you have your next Capital Market Day, you would be able to discuss more holistic lithography part of the story is going to be scaled? I'm asking you this because e-beam was supposed to be part of it, it was delayed and now it's back on track. And I think now that the EUV is in high volume manufacturing, it will be great to get an update on how holistic and part of it, how multi-beam, e-beam inspection going to play out throughout 2020? And I have a short follow-up. -- Well, in 2020, if you refer to my answer to the last question, I think in 2020 we're going to ship pilot systems. I think the HVM will be in 2021. So I don't think that is a major issue for 2020. I think when you referenced to Capital Markets Day of next year, which of course we will talk about a bit later, but we definitely have one. We will talk about the holistic strategy of the Company as an integral part of our entire product strategy and it will be a growth area. But you know you say, EUV being there, yes, it is ramping in HVM in 2020 definitely, but it's just the beginning. I mean, the growth of the Company does not depend on the growth in our holistic business. That's going to be an integral part of our growth profile.EUV, as you may remember from the previous Analyst Day, is the significant part of our business by 2025 with a significant growth profile. So I think it is both holistic applications. You need to remember, our holistic strategy is a combination of our application business, our EUV and Deep UV business. Yeah. So I think all will contribute to the growth profile of the Company and specifically to multi-beam, you see the first pilot shipments in 2020 in HVM after that in 2020. -- Great. And then a follow-up to your comment from last earning conference call. You talked about a $1 billion of investment, you referred to that, a strategic investment from China and EUV insertions for DRAM. How do you see the $1 billion which you characterized as having very minimum downside risk are trending into 2020? -- Well, nothing changed in my mind. Absent any major geopolitical movements, the plans are still there. Chinese customers are taking the tools and they are more or less ramping according to plan. So it also means that there expansion plans for 2020 and beyond remains very much in tact. -- But perhaps where does the $1 billion go. How do you see that growth trending? -- Are you mean -- beyond 2019 into 2020 and beyond. Yeah, I think the medium-term trend that is and it could be -- yeah, that -- it all depends on how the ramp profile of those customers really look like, but if you look at it, overall, let's say, two, three-year period, it's going to be at least at that level. Now it could be one year, it could be a little bit more, one-year could be a little bit less, but it's going to be at least at that level. And I think medium-term, if we follow the road maps of our customers and their investment plans, it will grow. -- Thank you.Next question is from Mr. Krish Sankar. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yeah, hi. It's Cowen & Co. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Peter or Roger. When I look at your Memory shipments last quarter, it's almost of a three year low, but you have a pretty high bookings run rate. Is there a way to split up the Memory bookings by EUV and non-EUV? And along the same path, Peter at some point next year if and when Memory recovers, do you think it's going to be NAND or DRAM that would drive the recovery? And then I also have a follow up. -- Well, I think on the booking side, it's predominantly EUV. So the non-EUV bookings are really light. So as I -- like I said, it is predominantly EUV. On the -- and that is a strategic investment. Like I said, it's the -- it's the 1z and the 1a preparations. Whether NAND or DRAM is going to recover, you tell me is -- what we really need to watch has always been the case is that the pricing levels, you know what is the pricing trend. When the pricing trend turns for both, we just need to see how sustainable it is. So you really need to be kind of objective from one or two weeks, maybe we have to look at it from a little bit longer period and then look at that trend.And then you need to remember, when that trend turns that our Memory customers still have some idle capacity that they are going to use first before they start to add more wafer fab equipment. And so, this is a general trend both through for NAND and for DRAM. So I would advise all of us to just keep looking at the pricing trends. -- Got it, got it. That's very helpful, Peter. And then just as a follow-up for Roger, I don't want to split hairs on the EUV units for next year, but -- whether it's 32 or 34 higher, how do we think about the gross margin for EUV? Does it still fit in with your prior plan and we're going to have a 40% exit run rate next year for EUV gross margin? -- Yeah, I think -- I think that's right. For next year we are looking at a 40% plus gross margin for EUV systems. That's still the plan, not just to exit the year, but in fact for the full year. -- Yeah. Thank you.The next question is from Achal Sultania. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Hi, good afternoon. It's Achal from Credit Suisse. Maybe a question on again on margins on EUV, like obviously Roger, you're saying it's 40% or north of 40% for whole of 2020. Like just looking at -- like a long-term view, your DUV margins are much higher, probably 50%, even higher than 50%, what's the -- is there any specific reason why EUV shouldn't go up toward DUV levels not in the next one or two years, but let's say over the next three years to five years. Like, can it actually happen or there is some structural issues which prevent EUV margins reaching those levels? -- No, I would agree that is definitely our ambition and more than our ambition that is our plan to get the EUV to -- not just to, I would say, the overall gross margin that we see for Deep UV, but to get EUV to the margin level where we currently have immersion, which is our leading lithography tool in terms of the gross margin. That is the ambition. And we have to plans to get there and that will of course fully depend on the value that we bring to our customers. Well, we're confident that with the roadmap that we have in front of us that we are going to get there. So that is what we're driving on the system side.And then the other dimension that we're driving is EUV service which obviously this year has a gross margin that we talked about, which is -- which is not favorable and -- but we do have plans in place in the next couple of years to get also the EUV service margin to a level that will significantly contribute to -- I think there is a bit of background noise that it might be confusing.I think it's on the line from Mr. Sultania sir. -- Yeah, yeah. Can you hear me now? -- Yeah, yeah. -- Yeah, thanks, Roger. And then maybe just a follow-up on the DRAM market. Obviously, we've now seen one of your customer starting to use EUV for 1z and then 1 alpha ramp. Like how are the talks going on with other DRAM customers, is it still early days to figure out what their ambitions are or you're making decent progress with the other two lead customers there? Thank you. -- Yeah, I think there is no doubt in my mind that all DRAM customers are going to use EUV. Now the question is, different customers have different roadmaps and different timings when roadmaps will lead to insertion of EUV. Clearly, there is a major customer that has started to do that, which means that the others will follow. And -- but they follow in different time schedules. One is much closer than the other, that's the way that I would like to explain it. -- Okay. Thank you, Peter.Next question is from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yeah, hi. Peter, can I understand in terms of what development needs to happen in terms of manufacturing to ramp-up your capacity in EUV now that for 2020 you have on the book more orders than you have capacity. What you need to do to ramp up your capacity? And then secondly, with regards to Memory usage of -- or DRAM usage of EUV, how the progress is on that front and how you see -- how you see that ramping up? Are we seeing this TSMC started it, but then next year it does seem to be very, very strong Logic orders. So do you expect that Memory will follow in that sort of way when Memory adopts EUV? -- Yes to answer your last question. I think Memory will follow, but I think that the insertion timing of EUV for Logic customers is much closer to each other, where you could say that difference of insertion is a year, year and half max, whereby I think with DRAM, it could be a bit longer. And so I think, yes, you will see this trend, but it will be -- but it will definitely be, let's say, more spread out over time where I -- just like I said on the answer of the previous call of the previous question that one of those other Memory makers or DRAM makers is closer to the leader and other one is following at more distance. So it will take more time before all players in the DRAM market are EUV users as opposed to the Logic market where that all happens within let's say a 12-month time frame.So on the manufacturing capacity, what needs to happen, I don't think -- our current plan is that, with the focus of cycle time reduction, that's what it is, we can probably push our capacity in the supply chain and at ASML to run 50 systems. Now I'm not going to say that is going to be there next year, but next year we will be over 40. And our final plan is that with the cycle time reduction and production efficiencies, we should be able to push with the current square meters that we have and then perhaps a few more people, then we can push it to 50 units. -- Thank you.Next question is from Mr. Adithya Metuku. Please state your company name followed by your questions. -- Yes. It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. First question is really on the EUV gross profit margin in the quarter. I just wondered if you could give us some color on what the margin was in 3Q and what you expect this to do into 4Q. And then just any color on the ramp into 2020 as well? I know you've given the number for the full year, but then how should we think about the cadence? And my follow-up is on the capex, you previously said that annualizing the 1Q number would be a good proxy for capex for this year. Is that still true and how should we think about that into next year? Thank you. -- So on the gross margin for EUV in Q3, I think we said that for the full year, you would look at the full year around 30%. For Q3, you are looking at slightly under 30%, for Q4, you're looking at slightly over 30%. That's the way to look at it. Again, we should bear in mind that in Q4, we don't get the full benefit of the pricing of the 3400C because of what we discussed earlier on, which is that they are not yet in final configuration, so you will see for 2020, that there is more potential bare. And that added to what Peter was discussing which is a reduction of cycle time all those are the factors that will ultimately drive EUV system sales to the 40% then -- and above that that we've discussed earlier on.In terms of -- in terms of capex, I think the capex number that you've seen for the first -- for the first quarters, I think you will see a slight increase in that for the fourth quarter. So -- and so for the full year, you're going to see approximately EUR800 million to EUR900 million of capex. For the next -- for one or two years thereafter, you might see similar levels of capex, because as we have pointed out before, we are at a point where we are reaccelerating the development of our High NA and of course that will lead to building of clean rooms that will lead to significant investments that we're making together with Zeiss. We're building a logistics center, so we have. We're really preparing for sort of the ramp of both Low NA EUV, but also for High NA. So we will see that for, let's say, another two years. And then gradually you will see that the capex levels as a percentage of sales will develop to the kind of 3% that we've modeled for 2025. So I think that's the way to look at it. So a few years of significant investment and then getting to a more steady state into 3% that we've indicated for 2025. -- Thank you.Next question is from Mr. Robert Sanders. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yeah, Deutsche Bank. Yes, I had a question on the DUV sales in 2020. How are you thinking about your year-on-year growth rate in 2020 given the kind of ongoing uncertainty in Memory and the substitution of immersion for EUV -- and your Logic customers? -- Yeah, well, I think on -- that substitution has happened with the intake of the orders, but that's our plan. So that was not a big surprise. And I think the DPV sales has always -- it will not be driven by Logic, because Logic is pretty strong. DPV sales and the trend of DPV sales will be driven by the timing of the recovery of the Memory market. So I think what we will see in DPV sales is a -- it's a bit of -- it will happen. I'm pretty confident that the Memory rebound will happen in 2020. It's just a matter of when. But if that's the case, then I would see a improvement of the DPV sales profile throughout 2020. To what level really depends on the timing of the recovery. -- Got it. And just one follow-up for Roger. What is the actual gross margin you're going to be getting on the per wafer services model for EUV when those two get in production. I mean, excluding any pro bono structure doing for early stage customers, I mean, just the per wafer margin on the services revenue, the EUR5 million to EUR6 million plateau? Thanks. -- Rob, we're looking at for the end of 2020. We're looking at -- at breaking even on the gross margin for EUV services as you know and as we've talked about before. This year we have a mismatch, because on the one hand we have significant costs of helping our customers prepare for high volume manufacturing whereas the service revenue is based on wafer output, which of course is only kicking in gradually this quarter and the last quarter at a very low -- at a very low pace. Of course, that will -- that will rebalance itself in the course of 2020. So at that stage we will -- we will -- we will get an imbalance and then from 2021 onwards we will see a significant positive development in the gross margin development of EUV service sales. -- Great. Thanks a lot.Next question is from Mr. Pierre Ferragu. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Hey, thank you. It's Pierre, New Street Research. So I do like to maybe check with you where we stand in the ramp of EUV in Logic in terms of penetration in the node that are rolling -- being ramped up now and the next generation that is going to be ramping up, maybe in one years or two years from now. And my question is, if you said like x number of tools or x number of layers in the 7-nanometer -- 7 plus node, what kind of number of tools or what kind of number of layer should we expect in the next generation models of 5-nanometer or 5-node? -- Yeah, thank you. When you look at the 7-nanometer node, I mean, we said this before, on average, there is about 10 layers here, that's on average and with different customers we have different names. But the average, if you take 10, you're probably right. When you go to the next node, which would be the 5-nanometer node, you should look at doubling it, yeah. So it -- this is about the main rule that you can use. But again, it depends on the customer architecture. Some could be a bit lower, other could be a bit higher, but exact 10 and then double it to 20, then you're probably on the safe side. -- Okay, right. Thank you. And then if you think about anything in terms of how you transform -- translate that into the outlook for revenue for you sales, then we need to take into account the improvement of your productivity in tools and then increase in prices, but is that safe to assume that very roughly the revenue you get, let's say, on the per-layer basis, very, very rough, is about the same between the first 10 layers and the next 10 layers you're producing -- in 5-nanometer or would you have like an increase in terms of value per layer for you? -- Yeah, I think, you know it is not simply a function of volume. It's also a function of the value. So when we look at our roadmap, the roadmap is really driven by the productivity of our tools and we are still focusing on improving the next-generation points you see in NA EUV tools in terms of productivity, so that will be a higher value. And then also, it's not only that, it is also the more stringent and more -- let's say, more aggressive on product overlaid numbers that are also going to provide a lot of value to our customers. So it is a combination of those two. So the growth of the sales that will not only be a function of the volume, but definitely also volume times the value increase and the value increase will be driven by the things I just said, it's productivity and overlay. -- And just clear the way to look at it, if you want to model it, at the current technology and the current throughput numbers that we have typically one layer, it translates 45 -- wafer start translate into one tool. That's the way to look at it. But then exactly as Peter said, to the extent that you got throughput improvements, then obviously you need to do the math, how that translates into a reduction of that. -- And the -- you have to realize it's all about cost. So if you have a machine that has a higher throughput and that throughput is recognized by the customer, that also means that the breakeven point between the multiple patterning layer and the new UV layer comes closer and closer, yeah. So we will see with higher productivity, higher uptime, the better non-maturity of the tool, the better overlay, then I think you're all right to just basically transfer most of the flattening layers into UV. That's also a thing to consider and that's something we will figure out in the next two to three-ish. -- Okay. Very clear. Thank you so much.Next question is from Mr. C.J. Muse. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yes, thanks for taking the question. C.J with Evercore ISI. I guess, first question, if I go back to your commentary in early September of Memory, you were talking about an increase in utilization and giving some comfort to a recovery, whereas I think the language here seems a little bit more, I don't know, conservative, and so I guess would love to hear if anything has changed in your Memory outlook over the last month or two. And then, as you think about a recovery into 2020, if you could parse how you're thinking about NAND versus DRAM given that your intensity on the NAND side is so much less than the DRAM side? -- Yeah, I think you're absolutely right on the last point. I mean, it depends -- and I think it was an earlier question, what do we think is going to rebound first in NAND or DRAM and I answer that by saying, we don't know. But it's true, if NAND ramps first, the little intensity in NAND is lower than in DRAM. At the other hand, you know it's very difficult to predict which one will go first.On the increase in utilization, we have actually said -- in terms of the utilization, what we have seen is that -- that the utilization numbers have stabilized and it's just a matter of to see how DRAM pricing will recover, how inventories that are in -- that are in the chain, how inventories will be eaten up and will be absorbed over what time period, then customers will start to utilize the tools even at the higher level before they start putting in orders for the wafer fab equipment.I think it's the -- it's the utilization leveling that we have seen, which is always good, and we talked about it in that context, but then it doesn't tell you anything about the end market yet. So that is a matter of people buying more bits. And with reference to what I said earlier in our 2020 model, which was the scenario modeling that we did, we assume for 2020 a 20% bit growth in DRAM and 40% in NAND, this is not where we are today. Now that doesn't tell us anything about next year, because it could change and it probably will and it very likely will. But to what extent will it then grow in 2020, that's something we just have to wait and see.And like I said, even I would suggest we all look at it at the pricing levels of those devices and take that as an early indicator of what's going to happen. -- That's very helpful. My follow-up, you talked about not achieving your target at least on the near-term buyback plan. I guess, is the reasoning there that investing in High NA and multi-beam and that's the reason why for the push? And then as a follow-up to that, your target model for 2020 was 410 million shares and we're sitting here today at 422 million. Do you think the buybacks that you have planned into 2020 can get us to that target model level? Thank you. -- C.J., a couple of reasons for the -- for the share buyback program are under delay in execution thereof, if you like. So one, we should not forget that we also introduced an interim dividend and of course we can only distribute the euros once, right. So that is -- that is one -- a key element. You're right, capex, and we talked about capex is significant, that's another driver. And also the further ramping of EUV and also the fact that we're pretty back loaded this year in terms of sales, I mean, all of that contributes to a free cash flow pattern this year, which is a bit of an anomaly and that's -- that's combined with the interim dividend, I think that created the circumstance that we just described. Tempting, what you do, to ask us to make any projections on the share buyback program in the 2020, we're going to do that in 2020, and in 2020 we will announce what the share buyback program will look like at that point. -- Thank you.The next question is from Mr. Andrew Gardiner. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Thank you. It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. A bit of a -- if I could start with a follow-up actually to one of the earlier questions on layer count. Peter, in your prepared comments as well you sort of referenced the performance of 3400C and sort of talked about your customers being -- having greater conviction in the tools operation and therefore layer count going up. So when you talk about sort of 10 layers on average at 7-nanometer, doubling to 20 at 5-nanometer, can -- that has been a moving target higher, 7-nanometers relatively fixed at this point. But as we look at the 5-nanometer, is there still the opportunity for that to go higher? What are you hearing from the customers in terms of those trend? -- Yeah, I think it's a good question. Of course, our planning of the number of layers that we'll use in EUV is also based on the assumption that we share with our customers, our customer share with us. And you should not forget that there is always a level of conservatism in there. You have to -- when you have a tool, let's say, two years back and we talked about layers of 7-nanometer and of course they looked at those layers as the absolute necessary layers that needed EUV. And over time, when we got more confident and customers got more confidence on the EUV as a production technology, the layer count went up. It gradually went up and it is logical, because you get more confidence and that manage your level of risk taking is also different, which I think will also be true for 5.When you go to 5-nanometer and we would -- and we will execute on our productivity improvement plans, we will execute on our uptime plans, we will execute on the plans that we have for the improvement along product overlays. When you look at that and we do this and customers will gain more confidence over time and obviously in 2020 on the use of EUV in high volume production and we execute on our plans, I see a trend, similar to what we saw on the 7-nanometer is that the number of layers might go up. And that would be quite logical, because all are net of cost. So, yes, there is definitely upside opportunity. -- Okay. Thank you. And Roger, if I can follow-up just on OpEx. So it's been creeping higher through the course of the year for a number of reasons, but we still got those 2020 targets that you set out around this time last year is looking increasingly harder with each passing quarter to get in particular on the R&D side the sort of 14% of sales number. Can you just give us a better sense as to how we should be thinking about your OpEx plans into next year relative to that? Thank you. -- Sure. So on the SG&A side, I think the 4% that we've modeled that -- I think that's still what we're targeting for. So I think that's probably still the right fair number to go for. In terms of R&D, I guess, the way to look at it is, this year we're probably going to end approximately $2 billion, that's the R&D number that we're looking at for this year. I think if we look at the capacity -- capacity that we have today after the significant increase in capacity in terms of number of people that we have in the R&D department, I think we're now at a stage where we say that's the right capacity to have for the -- at least for the near-term development plants that we have. We talked about the acceleration for Low NA, we talked about High NA, we talk about multi-beam, we've talked to you before about, for instance, the people that we hired as a result of the Mapper transaction for multi-multi-beam.So I think at this stage, we're comfortable with the people that we have. So for the foreseeable future, I think what you're looking at is that the capacity is OK and therefore for the years to come, you will primarily see an increase, that is, let's call it inflation related, but the capacity that we have today, we think will do it for the foreseeable future. -- Okay. Thank you both.The next question is from Mr. Alexander Peterc. Go ahead please. -- Yes, hi. This is Alex Peterc from SocGen. Just a few follow-up questions. Could you be more specific on what the knot [Phonetic] final configuration of C machine that you're currently shipping means exactly in terms of throughput. And I suppose it will be later upgrade within this sort of [Phonetic] payments from customers. That's the first one.And the second question is really more on the DRAM layer side. I understand that in 1z that there is only one EUV layer for now being planned, but I guess the 1 alpha generation will be -- will it be more fruitful for you. So how many layers do you plan for the next generation DRAM? Thank you. -- Yes, so on the throughput for the 3400C, as we said before, for the machine, it's 170 the throughput, which again is more than 30% uptick from the 125 that we had on the B machines. The changes that we're going to make to the machines that are -- that are out in the field now both for this quarter and for next quarter, and that's not really related to throughput, they're more related on the availability of the tool, so -- because it's all related primarily to the modular vessel and that is not so much a factor. If you like in throughput, it's a factor in the availability. Now we expect that that will be done -- that will be done next year.In terms of upgrades for the 3400B machines, we do have number of upgrades available for 3400Bs. It do not exactly get into the same throughput level for 3400C, because that would mean swapping of LANs, which wouldn't make economic sense. But we do have a number of upgrades available to customers that they can choose from that would -- that would substantially drive up the performance over 3400B machine. -- A 20%? -- Yeah, about 20%. -- Yes on the -- on the DRAM layer account yes, I mean, on 1z is one layer, on 1 alpha -- also what is true for Logic is also true for DRAM. I think it's -- throughput is in -- and you know DRAM is more cost sensitive in a sense, so higher throughput to more attractive. It could be to replace with multiple patterning layers with UV. So that is one thing. And the other -- and also what we are seeing is that device performance in DRAM is also very much favorable when it comes to these critical layers for EUV. So now, 1 alpha is not in HVM yet as you know. So they're still in, you could say, that is still in the development phase. But currently, we are looking at three to four layers. So I mean, we've been surprised getting some feedback on the reasons why customers want to move with DRAM in -- with EUV in DRAM. And one of the reasons, there is not so much the current productivity, but it is the device performance that you get when you use EUV as compared to Deep UV. So currently three to four layers. But like I said, it's in the development stage. So we don't know what is still in there when we really get to a maturity level. So let's wait and see, but I think that would be a safe bet. -- Very clear. Thank you very much. -- We have time for one last question. So if you are unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact ASML Investor Relations department. Now, operator, may we have the last caller, please.The last question is from Mr. Amit Harchandani. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Thank you. Good afternoon all. Amit Harchandani from Citi and thanks for letting me on. Two questions if I may. Firstly, maybe for Roger. When we look at -- you touched upon the free cash flow development earlier, and when we look at the change in assets and liabilities over the first nine months, it does seem significantly more negative than in previous year. I would assume that has to do with the EUV ramp, but could you give us a sense for how you think free cash flow development might shape up going into next year. So any thoughts in terms of how we should model that would be appreciated.And secondly, if I may, going back to the 23 orders. I just wanted to understand the thought process in terms of customer discussions, clearly a large number. Do you think the customer has gone ahead and placed this order because they are worried that EUV is accelerating and they might fall behind in the queue. You think it's a one-off, is it a sign of maturity. Just trying to understand what's led to the customer go ahead and place such a large order at this stage? Thank you. -- Amit, thank you. I'll take the free cash flow question, and Peter will take the customer question. So on the free cash flow, I think it's actually a combination of things. I think rightfully you point at the continued EUV ramp, that's definitely the case. I mean, the way EUV is ramping and it does lead to a free cash flow anomaly as I called it. So therefore, you would expect at some stage for that to -- for that to normalize. And also given where we are today, we are talking to our customers to look at different models and also in terms of prepayment there and down payments there. So that's what we're addressing and I think given the level of maturity that we currently have on the products, I think that is -- that's the right way for us to go.Secondly, as we've all seen, this year is very much back-loaded in terms of sales and obviously that also results in a situation where free cash flow is following in an ominous pattern. So if both of those issues are addressed, I would expect that next year you're going to see a cash conversion which is much more natural than what you've seen in this -- end of year this year. -- Yes, on the question for -- on the customer orders and why so large now. And you mentioned, is it fair that they are they going to end up in the back of the queue, I think customers are -- the way we interact with our customers and the transparency that we give them on our manufacturing capability on our manufacturing plans, I don't -- I don't think that give rise to a lot of fear. It is really driven by the fact that the customers have figured out that in the devices that they want to make, with the 7-nanometer or what is DRAM 1z products that the performance of EUV layers and the productivity that they can now count on gives them the confidence that this is the way to go.And so this is -- this is the first question that they will internally answer and they will share that with us. And then they come to the next question say, and then how much do we need and what is available. Yeah, and then of course, it's a -- almost a public knowledge where that -- what our capacity is. It's -- and EUV is very complex technology and they also know that we are ramping supply chain that from time to time might be a bit later, a couple of weeks late as we have seen at the end of this year. So this is the order.Why do they come? They come because they know that EUV will provide with the solutions that they need and is going to provide a significant value. And if you listen to customer statements, then you can actually get confirmation of that. And then of course, they come to us and we're very transparent on our capacity and say, fine, this is the EUV performance, this is our wafer start ramp plan and this is the number of tools that we need. Yes, your capacity limited, let's put the order. It's in that order and not the other way around. -- That's very helpful, Peter. And thank you, Roger. -- You're welcome. -- Now, on behalf of ASML, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

Although both sides of the U.S.-China trade war demonstrated some signs of thawing relations, recent developments suggest that this economic conflict has devolved to the worst point ever.As reported by multiple news agencies, the Trump administration earlier this week . Human rights concerns over Chinese treatment of the Uighur and other mostly Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region catapulted this decision. While the front-facing issue of protecting human rights is a noble one, it invariably complicates U.S.-China relations.Obviously, one of the worst impacted assets are semiconductor stocks. Following the announcement, the exchange-traded fund  (NYSEARCA:) took a sizable hit. As you know, several U.S. companies have robust relations with Chinese tech firms. China also represents a critical revenue pathway for American semis.Despite the ugliness, a contrarian opportunity exists for those seeking semiconductor stocks to buy. No matter what happens with the global economy, semiconductors represent progress. By its very definition, progress moves forward, not backward.Granted, this sector features many threats which we\u2019ll discuss. Therefore, waiting for some of these names to come down would be an ideal move. But stay away altogether? I believe these five semiconductor stocks to buy have enough critical catalysts to survive this present onslaught.Source: Shutterstock\n\tTypically, major semiconductor firms specialize in specific product categories, such as graphics processers. What makes  (NASDAQ:) stand out among other semiconductor stocks is its versatility and indispensability. Lam specializes in wafer fabrication equipment and services. According to the company\u2019s website, \u201c is built with Lam technology.\u201d Of course, this fact alone represents a long-term catalyst for LRCX stock.Moreover, this massive demand for the company\u2019s products and services is well reflected in the LRCX stock price. On a year-to-date basis, shares have gained over 73%. Better yet, this is a balanced rally. In the first half of this year, LRCX stock gained 42%. And in the second half so far, shares have increased in value by nearly 20%.While arguably most semiconductor stocks face incoming turmoil from the trade war mess, Lam may get a reprieve. Simply put, the company is too valuable for the global semi industry.Source: Shutterstock\n\tWhenever individual investors face uncertainty, most financial advisors suggest portfolio diversity. Based on simple probabilities, you\u2019re more likely to have at least a few winners if you spread out your exposure. And among semiconductor stocks,  (NASDAQ:) has its hands occupied with multiple industry subsegments, services, and products.But what really makes me excited about QRVO stock is its expertise in the connected auto segment. Several months ago, I upgraded my ride to a very modern variant. For me, the most distinct change in the driving experience had to be its connectivity. The modern dashboard is no longer merely an information conduit but a genuine computer. With Qorvo taking the lead in this arena, I have high hopes for QRVO stock.Additionally, the tech firm specializes in radar, communications, and electronic warfare systems for the defense and aerospace industries. Given the rapidly devolving nature of our foreign policy, I\u2019d say QRVO stock is a relevant pick.Source: Shutterstock\n\tIn life, there are two guarantees: death and taxes. With semiconductor stocks, we also have dual inevitabilities. Computer chips will decrease in size yet increase in performance. How this amazing trend continues to evolve year in and year out underlines the case for  (NASDAQ:) and ASML stock.Specializing in a process called semiconductor lithography, ASML utilizes proprietary technologies to print distinct patterns on a silicon substrate. Another word for silicon substrate is wafer. What makes ASML stock indispensable in the broader computing industry is the above reference trend. Chips are getting increasingly smaller, which requires unthinkably acute and precise machinery for lithography.Therefore, I\u2019m not at all surprised that ASML stock has a similar price trend to Lam Research shares. On a YTD basis, ASML has gained over 58%. Furthermore, ASML, like LRCX, has printed a balanced rally in 2019.Source: Shutterstock\n\tShares of  (NASDAQ:) have technically undergone what you might expect from semiconductor stocks. While SWKS stock enjoyed a mercurial lift starting in 2014, by the spring of the following year, the equity started to stall. Over the trailing four-year period, Skyworks hasn\u2019t moved much.Interestingly, though, SWKS stock has formed what I perceive to be a . Starting from mid-April of this year to the present, SWKS has charted a series of lower highs but higher lows. Technical analysts believe that at the apex of this formation, the target equity will either break out or break down.I believe the former is the more likely outcome. SWKS stock is all about the 5G rollout. Specifically, the company\u2019s next-generation transmitters are crucial for delivering 5G services to both residences and commercial buildings. Because this rollout will continue for several years throughout the world, you should keep Skyworks on your short list of semiconductor stocks to buy.Source: Shutterstock\n\tWithin this list of semiconductor stocks to buy,  (NASDAQ:) is easily the riskiest. Due to the heightened tensions in U.S.-China relations, AMBA stock has unfortunately taken the brunt of the damage. In the Oct. 8 session \u2013 a day after the White House blacklisted 28 Chinese companies \u2013 shares tanked almost 10%.That one move immediately dropped AMBA stock below its 50-day moving average, a common barometer of nearer-term strength (or weakness). However, it\u2019s important to note that Ambarella shares are still inside a longer-term bullish trend channel. Fundamentally, the current volatility should prove to be a viable buying opportunity because of Ambarella\u2019s specialty: vision processors armed with artificial intelligence.These AI processors offer multiple applications. In my opinion, the most important is security. As this technology advances, operators will be able to identify and respond to threats before they strike. Anything that can prevent a 9/11-style attack is a worthwhile endeavor. Thus, I have zero issue backing AMBA stock among my semiconductor picks.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["utch    reported mixed third-quarter results on Wednesday morning. While revenue was up, driven by system sales to logic customers, a weak memory chip market continued to weigh on the company's results. Uncertainty still reigns supreme in the memory business, although ASML does expect to grow total revenue this year.During , ASML's system sales declined while its net service and field option sales rose. That was flipped on its head during Q3, driving overall revenue higher.Data source: ASML. YOY = year over year.System sales were up 11.8% year over year to 2.33 billion euros, compared to an 11.3% decline in the second quarter. Net service and field option sales came in at 660.9 million euros, down 5% from the year-ago period. In the second quarter, net service and field option sales soared 9.7% year over year.ASML's business shifted toward logic in the third quarter, with 79% of system sales going to logic customers. That's up from 61% in the second quarter. System sales to memory customers accounted for the remaining 21%.The memory chip industry is still plagued with uncertainty, and ASML is unable to predict the timing of a recovery. The company said that its memory customers are still digesting capacity additions in a weak demand environment, which is being partly driven by the current macroeconomic environment.A silicon wafer. Image source: ASML.The logic business is another story, with logic customers accelerating their ramps of advanced nodes. Through the first nine months of 2019, ASML has already generated more sales from the logic business than in all of 2018.ASML reported net bookings of 5.1 billion euros in the third quarter, nearly doubling its bookings in the second quarter. The split between logic and memory was similar to the sales split, with 73% of bookings going to logic customers and 27% going to memory customers.Along with its third-quarter results, ASML announced a change in its dividend policy. The company will now pay dividends on a semiannual basis, instead of just once per year. An interim per-share dividend of 1.05 euros will be paid on Nov. 15 to shareholders of record on Nov. 5.ASML continued repurchasing shares during the third quarter as part of its 2.5 billion euro program, but it now says that it doesn't expect to use the entire authorization before the end of 2019. Through the end of the third quarter, the company has spent 1.4 billion euros to buy back 8.2 million shares.With ASML stock up substantially since the start of the year, a lofty valuation may be the reason the company is slowing down share repurchases.\"Our overall view for 2019 is essentially unchanged as we continue to see 2019 as a growth year,\" said CEO Peter Wennick in prepared remarks included in the earnings release. Despite the weakness in the memory business, strong logic sales are expected to drive total revenue higher this year.For the fourth quarter, ASML expects to produce roughly 3.9 billion euros in sales, along with a gross margin between 48% and 49%. That's far higher than the 43.7% gross margin the company reported for the third quarter. If ASML hits its guidance, full-year sales will total nearly 11.7 billion euros, up from 10.9 billion euros in 2018.The memory business could start to recover sometime next year, although that likely depends on global economic conditions not worsening. Expectations are high: Shares of ASML trade for nearly 40 times the average analyst estimate for 2019 earnings. This lofty valuation leaves little room for error.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Semiconductors play an increasingly important role in the world, as new technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, the , self-driving vehicles, and especially  take hold in the market. Yet at the same time, the ongoing U.S.-China trade war has sapped business confidence, leading to extreme caution on the part of chip buyers worldwide. A downturn in demand can wreak havoc on semiconductor stocks, which have oversupplied the market over the past year, leading to many negative-earnings surprises.This has set up an interesting dynamic where big secular trends are running headlong into a cyclical downturn. Yet starting in the second half of 2019, it appears that one secular trend -- the buildout of 5G networks -- is beginning to overwhelm these macroeconomic fears, sending certain semiconductor-related stocks soaring.5G is benefiting semi-cap equipment stocks, despite the trade war. Image source: Getty Images.One would think the global slowdown would absolutely kill the stocks of semiconductor equipment manufacturers, who make the machines needed to produce leading-edge chips. However, the opposite has been true, with many such stocks hitting 52-week and/or all-time highs in recent weeks.These include  , , , and . In addition,  , the world's largest foundry and buyer of this equipment, is also up nicely. As you can see, all of these stocks are crushing the market over the past year -- and that's in spite of the sharp December sell-off and ongoing trade war. data by .Interestingly, as U.S. and China relations continue to get more acrimonious, it seems both countries are stepping on the gas to become the leader in 5G technology. In particular, Taiwan Semi's management, which just had its third-quarter earnings release and conference call, gave some amazing numbers regarding the 5G buildout.In its earnings release, Taiwan Semiconductor revealed that it would again be boosting its capital expenditures for the year by a whopping 40%. Remember, the company is the world's largest outsourced semiconductor foundry and makes chips for most of the leading fabless semiconductor designers. Though Taiwan Semi had initially anticipated spending $10 billion to $11 billion on capex this year, management is now boosting that figure to $14 billion to $15 billion, with a similar forecast for 2020.Why such an increase? Taiwan Semi is seeing huge demand for leading-edge chips, which are the high-performance chips that will go into 5G handsets and base stations, well beyond what it had initially anticipated. According to management, about $1.5 billion of the capex increase is for the company's 7-nanometer chips that are just hitting the market, and the other $2.5 billion is to get an early jump on 5-nanometer chips for next year. In semiconductors, the nanometer distance signifies the distance between transistors; the smaller the space, the more transistors can be packed into a chip, making the chip more powerful. Management said, \"Since the middle of this year, we've been seeing an acceleration in the worldwide 5G development. This will speed up the introduction and deployment of 5G network in smartphone in several major markets around the world.\"The company now expects 5G penetration to ramp even faster than 4G, with 5G phones reaching a mid-teens smartphone market share next year, up from Taiwan Semi's previous expectations of just mid-single-digit penetration in 2020. Increased 5G demand is thus causing increased demand for smaller chips, yet smaller chips are becoming harder to produce. The smaller the chip, the more manufacturing process steps it must go through, which is why all of these semi-cap equipment makers are seeing such strong demand. In particular, ASML Holding's EUV technology is crucial for the ability to produce 7-nanometer and lower chips. That's why ASML's stock has gone up so much in the past year, and why it trades at a higher multiple than its peers. data by .Another favorite is KLA-Tencor, which has a competitive advantage in , which tests wafers and masks for imperfections. This diagnostic tool becomes increasingly important as die sizes shrink, because of the exactness required to produce high-density chips at scale.Though semi-cap equipment stocks have all had good runs over the past year, these big technological trends don't appear to be slowing down anytime soon. While a global recession may delay the growth of these companies, macroeconomic conditions probably won't hold them back forever. Therefore, investors should look to snap up these winning tech leaders on any big pullbacks. And if trade tensions ever ease up, so much the better.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

ASML's second-quarter report was better than expected, beating analyst estimates for earnings, but the company sees the memory business struggling for the rest of the year.ASML managed to grow revenue in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, largely due to an increase in revenue from installed base management, which includes service and field option sales. Installed base management sales also increased on a year-over-year basis, but that wasn't enough to prevent a decline in overall revenue from the prior-year period:YOY = year over year. Data source: ASML.Net system sales tumbled 11.3% year over year to 1.85 billion euros, while net service and field option sales rose 9.7% to 717 million euros.Sales of systems for memory-chip production accounted for 39% of total system sales during the second quarter. Through the first six months of 2019, ASML generated 1.41 billion euros of revenue from memory system sales, tracking well below the pace set in 2018. The company sold 4.55 billion worth of memory systems last year.ASML sees two headwinds hurting the memory business. First, the current macroeconomic environment is creating end-market volatility and industry uncertainty. Second, memory customers are digesting capacity additions in a weak demand environment, which is leading to less demand for new equipment.While the memory business is struggling, the logic business is picking up most of the slack.

Despite the memory weakness, the company hasn't changed its full-year expectations. \"Our 2019 total sales view remains unchanged and we continue to see 2019 as a growth year,\" said Wennink.With growth expected to return in the second half of the year, driven by strong demand from logic customers, shares of ASML were closing in on their 52-week high Wednesday morning.

For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at ASML.com and in ASML's Annual Report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction. -- Thank you, Skip. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our Q2 2019 results conference call. And before we begin the question and answer session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the second quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. And Roger will start with a review of our second quarter financial performance with some added comments and our short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook.Roger, if you will. -- Thank you, Peter. And welcome everyone. I will first highlight some of the second quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the third quarter of 2019. Q2 net sales came in at EUR2.57 billion within our guidance. Net system sales of EUR1.85 billion was more weighted toward Logic at 61% with the remaining 39% from Memory, representing a similar split as the previous quarter.We reported EUV systems revenue of EUR764 million on seven shipments, which was one more than guided. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR717 million, which was a bit higher than guided. Gross margin for the quarter was 43%, which was above guidance due to better EUV manufacturing results and higher field upgrade sales more than compensating the negative mix effect in comparison to Q1.Overall R&D and SG&A expenses came in as guided, with R&D expenses at EUR487 million and SG&A expenses at EUR123 million.Turning to the balance sheet, EUR884 million was paid as dividends and EUR15 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q2. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR2.34 billion.Moving to the order book Q2 system bookings came in at EUR2.83 billion, which is 100% up from Q1 bookings, mainly driven by EUV, where we took 10 new orders in the quarter. Logic order intake was 67% of total value with the remaining 33% from Memory, again, reflecting the strong Logic demand expected this year.Net income in Q2 was EUR476 million, representing 18.5% of net sales and an EPS of EUR1.13. This was positively impacted by higher gross margin and a one-time tax benefit.With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter 2019. We expect Q3 total net sales of around EUR3.0 billion. Our total net sales forecast for Q3 includes around EUR750 million of EUV systems revenue on seven planned shipments. We expect our Q3 Installed Base Management revenue to be around EUR700 million.Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be between 43% and 44%, which is slightly higher than Q2. The expected improvement in margin due to expected higher volume will be partially offset by customer configuration mix. We continue to expect significant improvements in gross margin in the fourth quarter, driven by higher system sales, improved product mix, increased field upgrades, shipment of higher margin, NXE:3400C systems as well as contribution of EUV service revenue. This will enable us to achieve a gross margin for Q4 which approaches our 2020 target of over 50%.The expected R&D expenses for Q3 are around EUR495 million and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR125 million. Our estimated 2019 annualized effective tax rate is around 9% because of a one-time tax benefit in 2019. We still expect our long-term effective tax rate to be 14%.With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter. -- Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, although, it was another modest but decent quarter, results came in at or above guidance, and we expect further strengthening in the coming quarters. The macroeconomic environment continues to provide market volatility, which translates to a level of uncertainty in the semiconductor industry.The demand for Memory remains soft, while excess inventories are being -- were down in the supply chain and some of the second half Memory demand risk, as we discussed last quarter, has meanwhile materialized and resulted in system pushouts of this year into 2020. As Memory weakness has been compensated by strengthening of Logic demand, such that our view of 2019 total sales remains unchanged. As such we expect 2019 to be a growth year with sales and profitability increasing throughout 2019.In Memory, the market continues to digest the high level of capacity additions that are put in place over the past few years. The digested started last year was exuberated by the -- by decelerating macroeconomic growth, this will likely extend throughout most of this year. Based on lower demands from our Memory customers, we now see our Memory sales down around 30% year-on-year versus 20% indicated last quarter.As discussed last quarter, we see two contributing components of Memory demand this year. We have characterized one as strategic, which we expect will happen largely independent of market conditions. This includes both early Chinese domestic Memory ramp and EUV for DRAM. This component is valued at approximately EUR1 billion, which we believe has low risk of pushouts. The second is the bit supply component which we previously indicated as having a higher risk. And if you remove the strategic component from our estimated 2019 Memory demand, we get a lithography spend on memory bit supply of around EUR2.1 billion, which is around 45% lower than the comparable spend in 2018. And as we have already shipped around EUR1.2 billion to memory bit supply in the first half of the year. This leaves around EUR900 million in the second half of the year, targeted for memory bit supply, which has an inherently higher risk profile than the strategic investments in Memory. On the positive side though, our Memory customers continue to indicate they are making significant reductions in wafer output to an extent we haven't seen in previous downturns. This reduction in spend and lower wafer output will help in reaching a more normalized supply demand balance.Logic will clearly be our growth driver in 2019, with the majority of the demand linked to new technology transitions and advanced node additions. We are seeing increased demand from our customers, driven by accelerated ramp of 7 nanometer node and beyond, supporting among others, the introduction of 5G technology. With this strengthening, we now expect our Logic business to be up around 65% for the year, relative to last year, which is 15 percentage points up from the 50% that we communicated last quarter. Along with increased system demand in the second half, we also expect stronger demand for field upgrades which translates to low-single digit percentage growth of Installed Base Management revenue.Now let me turn to the ASML product side and I'll update you on our EUV business. In EUV, we recently demonstrated more than 170 wafers per hour on our first NXE:3400C system. We have also run more than 2000 wafers per day in the customer memory production conditions. And this is a significant milestone, and as it confirms the required capability for Memory production, which means that our focus will be on stability and uptime to secure our customers ramp plans. We plan to ship the first NXE:3400C system in Q3. The higher number of C systems planned in Q4. As Roger mentioned, we shipped seven systems in Q2, one more than guided and received 10 orders.As a confirmation of the potential of the NXE:3400C for cost effective, high volume Memory production, we received a number of EUV orders this quarter for systems slated for use in Memory. The customers are aggressively bringing new technology to the market, which reflects on the solid demand for 30 systems this year. Demand for NXE:3400C systems has proven to be high. Our 2019 shipment plan is significantly skewed toward the second half of the year and to Q4 specifically.Next to the backloaded plan, we're also transitioning to a new scanner model, like I said earlier, the 3400C which suppliers need to ramp their production. Taking both of these into account, there is a risk of a few systems planned for Q4 moving into the first weeks of 2020. However, this risk has been taken into account in our comments regarding our full year 2019 sales outlook. In any case, strong demand for NXE:3400C as well as the continued progress and the ramp of our production capacity is clear.In summary, despite uncertainty in the current environment, we continue to see a stronger second half with the strengthening of both sales and profitability quarter-on-quarter. Logic will be the primary driver of growth this year, and demand has further strengthened from last quarter, as customers accelerate the ramp of their advanced nodes. Memory demand has more uncertainty and has further weakened since last quarter. However, as I mentioned before, the stronger Logic demand compensates for the weaker Memory demand. And in total, our overall sales outlook for the year, as I mentioned before, remains unchanged, and we expect 2019 be another year of growth.With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. -- Thank you, Roger and Peter. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. Beforehand, I'd like to ask that you kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up if necessary. This will allow us to get in -- to get to as many callers as possible.Now operator, could you have your final instructions and then the first question please. -- [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Mr. Mitch Steves, RBC Capital Markets. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Hey, Mitch Steves, RBC. Just two quick ones. First one just on EUV, you guys talked about 33 to 35 units for 2020. I'm just curious as to how much that is memory-related EUV and is that still on track? And then secondly on the Memory side, I think you guys said it to be down 30% versus 20%, was that Memory in general? Was that ASML-related revenue? I'm just trying to be clear with that. -- Yeah. On the last one, it's 19 -- the 38% down is the total Memory sales of ASML into the Memory segment as compared to 2018. And so that's what the 30% meant. On EUV 30% to 35%, yeah, that's our shipment capacity next year. Memory-related interesting question, that is, like I said in earlier calls, Memory, it is clearly giving us a kind of a -- as a breakeven point where they can move into EUV as it relates to DRAM production and it has to do with the productivity and we gave a target of 2000 wafers per day. Now we have shown in our factory under Memory production conditions that we can get over 2000 wafers per day. So it's really about the uptime and the availability of the system.Now we're shipping the first C system this quarter, we will install it. So by the end of the year, we will be able to see really some -- let's say, you could say more Marathon evidence of that 2000 wafer per day, that will drive the demand for EUV next year. Having said that, I strongly believe that 2020 will be dominated by Logic in terms of EUV. I mean, 3400C and I think currently when we talked to our Logic customers, has a very clear roadmap back into 2024, 7 nanometer and beyond. So no matter how you look at it, it's clearly an upside DRAM for next year, but the majority will still be driven by the Logic demand from our customers. -- Yeah, that's a good quarter. Thanks, guys. -- Next question comes from Mr. David Mulholland. Please state your company name, followed by your question. -- Hi, thanks. It's David from UBS. Just two quick ones. Firstly, on the EUV bookings in the quarter, I'm kind of following off on the last question. But can you possibly help us understand how that breaks time between Memory and Logic and in terms of what you're seeing so far. And is it fair to presume, those are all 3400C? And then just secondly, I think last quarter you commented EUV bookings this year would be quite backend loaded, so what you're seeing through [Indecipherable] in Q2 was quite solid. But is it fair to say that we shouldn't expect too much in Q3 that it will take that 3400C to be in the field to then get more bookings in Q4? Or how should we think about the phasing? -- So just a clarification question, David, you are really talking about the bookings. Now the -- let's say, the booking sequence in Q3 and Q4 going forward, that's what you mean? Is that correct? -- Yes. -- Okay. Yeah, on the EUV bookings. I think the majority of the bookings that we received in Q2 are for Logic, whereas there is a -- there are a few systems which are slated for Memory production, which is understandable because you won't -- given the current state of the capability performance, it's logical that you would see some of our systems being ship to go into a DRAM pilot low production, so the majority will be for our Logic customers. We had a good order intake in Q2. It's my expectation that that will continue in Q3 and Q4, because like I said, we have a production capacity actually between 30 and 35 units. And I think by the end of the year, we'll be fully booked for those tools, because I do believe also that by the end of the year, we'll be able to actually show in longer test -- Marathon test that that the DRAM conditions that we were able to show here at ASML were not a unique event that we'll be able to basically replicate that.So I don't think there will be a order low. I think it will be a gradual intake of orders toward the end of the year. Like we saw last year, last year we said the same thing, by the end of 2018, we'll have 2019 booked. It's my expectation that we'll see the same thing by the end of this year. -- That's all right. Thank you. -- The next question comes from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini. Please state your company name, followed by your question. -- Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just two follow-ups, Peter regarding your confidence on the Q4. I'm just curious, it seems to me that your confidence comes from the scenarios that you have contemplated for instance, if the supply chain causes some delay in the shipment of 3400C, I assume that you have immersion tools that you can ship and therefore is that what gives you the confidence for Q4 shipment? And I have a follow-up. -- Yes. I mean, you can ask the follow-up because you're right, I mean you gave the answer, and it was indeed, that's what it is. -- Sure. And then if there is, if there are few systems that are pushed to 2020, then is that going to increase the 30 to 35 system planned to be shipped next year? Or how should we think about the targets for next year? -- Yeah, I think we have this -- when we look at the production capacity 30 to 35, that is basically on a 12-month period. So if we have to shift a few of the systems into January of 2020. There are -- naturally, it would come on top of those 30 to 35 under the assumption that we cannot have that same kind of supply chain risk at the end of 2020, which you could argue, there is a lot more learning curve, so we should be able to keep the production schedule or the supply chain schedule better than we could in 2019 because we're introducing a new machine there. So yes, normally, it will be on top, but like I said, 30 to 35 is still a range of [Indecipherable], so I would stick to the 30 to 35. -- Okay. Now in terms of the supply and demand for Memory, it has continued to weaken, what if it remains weak into 2020, I remember from the November Analyst Day, you guided to 15%, 20% DRAM bit production growth and NAND bit production growth of 35% to 40%. But what is -- we started 2020 very far from those targets. Would -- is there also a sensitivity to your 2020 revenue target, where if DRAM -- I'm sorry, if Memory were to remain weak, there will be other areas that would help offset that? -- Yeah, I think it's a lot of questions in one question. But let me answer this, I mean, 2020 when we gave you the 2020 number, it was basically a mid-market scenario that we gave you. Yeah? And mid-market scenario, like you said, had a certain percentage growth on Memory, as mentioned, 20% and 35%. And that is a muted case. But what we're seeing today is also that Logic is a bit stronger than we anticipated, so that could be a compensating factor. But all in all, I think it's too early to make an educated guess on whether 2020 will be a moderate market or will be a low market, I think it's too early. I can only say that where we see Memory is today with indeed significantly lower growth -- bit growth numbers than ones that you mentioned and the fact that our customers are cutting 45% of their, at least, litho purchases for bit capacity and they are lowering their wafer starts. I mean there -- something will happen, and so this is -- so it's too early, but I think the trends are clearly such that I believe customers are doing everything try to rebalance the supply and the demand and whether that will be at the end of the year, early 2020, it's simply too early to say. -- Thank you, Peter. -- Next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Hey, good morning, Evercore ISI. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Peter, very encouraging to see the DRAM EUV orders in the quarter. Curious if you could speak a little bit about what the total cost of ownership requirements are as we move to one Z and then one alpha. Timeline of hitting those requirements that as you see? And if you're able to hit them, what are you thinking about layer count as we transition to one alpha? Thank you. -- Yeah, I think interesting question, I mean, we're really looking at the introduction time of EUV in DRAM and this is driven by, I think, it's just the economics, and like I said previous quarters, it's not only the economics, I think we also get very clear feedback that the device performance using EUV is also significantly better, so it's a combination of the two. And it will be an introduction time whether it's one Z or it's another alphabetical letter, it doesn't matter. At that moment in time, EUV is there to stay. And as you pointed out, going forward, with those next generations after the introduction node, there will be more layers added to EUV. And we currently think about we could -- whether it's alpha or it's gamma, whether it's 3 to 4 even 5 could -- is something that could happen. -- Very helpful. And then if you could speak to Bluebird business, you're seeing from Logic in the second half. How sustainable is that beyond Q4? And then as part of that considering you're likely building immersion tools from Memory and then having to build for Logic. Are there any negative gross margin implications from that changeover? -- So could you elaborate a bit on your last part of the question? -- Obviously, Logic immersion tools, higher ASP, better gross margins but-- -- Okay. -- Considering, I presume you were building initially immersion for Memory and now retrofitting to Logic. Are there any negative implications to gross margins because of that? -- No. That's question on the -- well the answer to the last question is indeed, no, there are no real implications. Is Logic sustainable in Q4? Well to be honest, I think the way that we look at it after having discussions with our customers. I think it is -- that demand that we're currently seeing in the second half of the year is incremental. I don't think it's a pull-in. I think there -- the majority of what we're seeing is incremental. These are not borrowing for -- from 2020. So in that sense, I think it's much more sustainable. -- Very helpful. Thank you. -- The next question comes from Mr. Janardan Menon. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Hi, it's Janardan from Liberum. I just want to dive in a bit with the gross margins, you said your gross margins in Q3 were affected by some customization work. Would you be able to give us any number as to, in percentage terms as to what that hit is and you're also suggesting that your gross margin in Q4 is likely to be quite close to sort of the 50% rate into the high 40s. Would you be shipping any 3400Bs in that quarter or would that shipment be entirely 3400Cs? And one small one, if I might push through is, if DRAM were to improve, I mean, DRAM were to start adopting EUV after the first -- around the 3400C and they do come in with orders, would you be able to accommodate more than 35 machines for next year or is that sort of an upper limit or what are you going to do with your current capacity? Thank you. -- Couple of comments on the gross margins. So in terms of composition, Q3 resembles Q2 quite a bit. So in terms of sales mix, so that's why the basic point of departure there is kind of similar. It will be higher, right, so the total volume will be higher and therefore factory loading will be higher, so there's an uptick in gross margin. And then we also said that that in the mix, the configuration mix, Q3 is a little less favorable, if you like than Q2 is, but that's minimal and just based on the configuration of the specific systems that we provide. And that's the reason why Q3 is a little bit higher than Q2, but not dramatically sold.If we then move to Q4, I think you will see that the company is really going to run, as it's going to fire on all cylinders, so then you really have the impact of a number of structural developments that are going to occur. First, the 3400C, to your point, Q4 will be -- still be a mix of B and C models, but the C model will be dominant in that total mix. But -- so you will have the increased benefit of the 3400C pricing and margin. At that point in time, we will also see that the service revenue on EUV will go up and services margin will go up.For Q4, we also predict better field upgrades, which is business that has a solid gross margin. We will also see higher factory loading as a result of the significantly higher volume that we have there. And Q4 as a result of all of the things that we just discussed also has a very significant portion of immersion in there. So at that stage, we have five very significant developments that indeed will position us such that we are going to approach the over 50% guidance or indication that we've given for gross margin in 2020. Peter, I think there was one question on the-- -- Yeah, I think on the capacity. And I think we'll be very hard stretched to get up more than 35 systems. I think this 30 to 35 is a little bit depending on the speed of the ramp and the issues that we are encountering on the new model, the C. We'll just stick to 30 to 35, I think 35 is the max what we can do next year. -- Got it. Thank you very much. -- The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Gardiner. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Good afternoon. It's Andrew from Barclays. Thanks for taking the question. Peter, if I could just go back to some of the comments you were making on Logic in particular around fourth quarter and into 2020. I can understand visibility is less so on the Memory side, but it seems much greater in terms of Logic, if that 4Q increase is indeed incremental rather than pull forward. How are you thinking about Logic demand into 2020, given the continued move down the process node laddered by foundry and microprocessors? And any further insight there would be helpful. Thank you. -- Yeah, I think answering that question. I also want to go back to last year, we basically said EUV has turned the corner. And I said, if I think on the earlier occasions is, I believe 2018 was a very significant year for us, a simple fact that the confidence that our customers had in the EUV as the key enabler for next-generation device innovations that confidence got to a much higher level.Now with the 3400C and the results that we're seeing now. I think that has only strengthened. So when you look at the roadmaps that our customers are now presenting to us, very clearly see an acceleration, and you can imagine that -- you can imagine that there are -- If you look at the end markets which is not only high-power computing, the mobile market, but it's much -- it is much wide [Technical Difficulty] are actually increasing looking at a competitive edge in a growing market, there's much wider application space. And I think this is what drives the roadmaps of our customers and actually the roadmaps of our customers are more aggressive because of EUV and because that it works. I mean, they see their results today. So this is why I believe that what we're currently seeing, I mean, is incremental and I think it has basically a runway. Now this is -- and it makes sense. If you look at where they have a production technology that they can apply in terms of the innovation of the next generation nodes that their customers need. So it is the -- I think it is the more aggressive roadmaps that our customers are showing us are underpinning why I believe this is more sustainable. -- Thanks very much. -- The next question comes from Mr. Joe Quatrochi. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Thanks. It's Wells Fargo. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the demand you're seeing in China? And maybe can you help us understand as part of the -- in the Memory side $1 billion of strategic revenue that you expect to recognize this year, how much of that has been recognized this year? And then how do we think about the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China may be impacting the timing of equipment installations there? -- Yeah. I guess, this may work on some -- just writing down your questions. Yeah, so I think on the Memory side and especially China, I mean you have to realize that these are greenfield companies creating greenfield fabs ramping their first nodes, their first device generations, and they need a certain level of output capacity that they need to put in place, that's happening this year, that's very strategic, that will happen. And of the $1 billion, I mean -- have is the China EUV roughly and it doesn't matter that much or how it's spread over the year, but that's roughly what it is, and that is just happening. I mean it's -- we're not -- that's not waning, that's not increasing, it's just execution are going to plan, like we said last quarter. And I think the trade negotiations, they are what they are. And currently, there is no limit on what we can ship to China, which is basically [Indecipherable]. This is 15-year-old technology and we've been shipping that for the long time, more than 10 years to China and as well we still do. So I don't know where trade negotiations will end up and I think we are in a stage where we know what's going on, the business as usual, the customers want the machines, we are able and capable and we are allowed to ship those system, so we will. -- Okay, that's helpful. And then just quick follow up. Could you give us your thoughts on how we should think about free cash flow for the remainder of the year? -- Free cash flow clearly is very backloaded, I mean if you look at the way sales are composed this year, the sales are backloaded, and therefore, free cash flow is also very much backloaded. That is also the result of the fact that on EUV we have a payment schedule with our customers, which is, very backloaded. And as a result of that, you really will see that the second half and in particular Q4, it will be very, very cash rich and there will be a very significant generation of free cash flow. But all of it will be very backloaded in this year. -- Thank you. -- The next question comes from Mr. Stephane Houri. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yes, good afternoon. So this is Stephane Houri from ODDO. I have a question about EUV again, I'd like to -- just a bit about your lead times and to understand on EUV specifically and understand what is the limit that you need to receive the orders from your customer to make sure that you will be in the range of 30 to 35 machines in 2020? And the short follow-up is about the OpEx that keep on rising. Do you think you will continue on that trend going forward for the rest of the year and also for 2020? Thank you. -- Yeah, I will answer the question on EUV lead time and Roger will answer the question on the OpEx. On the lead time, there is a order lead time which we give our customers of about 18 months. And now having said that, we are negotiating with our customers from time to time, and they don't always hold to the 18 months, that sometimes depends on some terms and conditions that are not that significant, but we only have a deal when you have a signature. So but at -- the lead time is 18 months, it was 24 where we're driving it down, we have to because you have to realize that it's pretty difficult also for our customers to guess what they need in terms of capacity ramp and the size of the capacity ramp 18 or 24 months out, nobody knows.So it is essential that we keep reducing the cycle time in the supply chain and the cycle time in our factory, so we make sure that we can deal with that flexibility. We don't put a limit to it. It's not that if you don't give an 18-month order you won't get the slot because we have other ways to secure the shipment and it's basically knowing that we do the installation inspections when the factory is built, when the factory is finished. We work together with suppliers of the equipment that is attached to our tools, we work together with the suppliers in actually making all the facilities and all the piping and then -- and everything that goes with a semiconductor fab. So we know the customers are realistic and it's real that we are planning those EUV tools. And that gives us a confidence that while some customers might not adhere to the 18 months for all kinds of commercial reasons, and that they signed the orders a bit later. The tool will ship and that's how it works. -- On OpEx, as you know, two main components in there. SG&A, SG&A as you would have seen is fairly consistent over the quarters, if you look at 2018, 2019, it's fairly consistent and the guidance that we've given for next quarter, EUR125 million and that's the number that I'm pretty comfortable with that we're -- that we'll be able to keep at that level for a little while.And as it relates to R&D you're absolutely right, we've pushed down the accelerator last year on R&D, we've indicated, why? So this is on the pulling in of the low NA program really accelerating that program, again the fact that we're now talking about the EUV. The first EUV, 3400C shipments in this quarter and the fact that we've been able to in essence pull that in with the year, I think is the result of that effort, and we'll continue to speed up in that process in the low NA developments. High NA is a big-ticket item, obviously in our R&D and also the continued development of Multibeam. So those are the three main categories as a result of which we told you last year we're pushing down the accelerator.What we've guided for next quarter EUR495 million, I think it's reasonable to assume that that's a number that you will also see in Q4. And then gradually you will see with -- and expect a development of our business, I would expect that, let's say, at the second half of 2020 that you will see us get back gradually to the 14% that we've guided at the Capital Markets Day, that's the current plan. -- Okay. Thank you. That's very clear. -- The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yeah, hi. My first question is on the EUV tools. Peter, I mean I wanted to slightly look longer-term rather than 2020 where everybody is focused on. How do you see, I mean you've talked about this in your Capital Markets Day, but do you see TSMC and the foundry market coming back in the following year as they begin to add more capacity in 2021 and what do you think is going to be a long-term capacity for EUV tools post this 2020 which is the big initial ramp-up of EUV?And then secondly, when we -- Roger my question to you on the gross margin, can you just -- in your opening remarks, you said that your gross margin in the fourth quarter is going to be higher than 50% or is it going be close to 50%? I just was trying to clarify on that one. Thank you. -- Okay. Let me say, I think on the longer-term EUV tools. What -- EUV tools will be first used, let's say, at the industry 7 nanometer node. As I said, layers ranging anywhere from between 7, 8 to 12, it depends on what customers are actually doing and with a tendency to go up. But then the next node which industry 5, that's a significant increase. I think you'll see likely more than 20 EUV layers. So yes that will of course the -- to create a demand for more EUV tools. However, we also have a productivity increased roadmap that should deal with part of it. But it cannot only be taken up by productivity improvements so we need more EUV tools. This is why we have the capacity around 45 units in our factory. If you look at our Capital Markets Day presentation then with our mid-market scenario that -- this is probably what we would need taking into account the higher productivity. Now, if it turns out that the end demand, when I talk about the customer, customer end, the demand is even stronger. Then there are scenarios where we have to go over 45. We are not planning that yet. I think we have some time in terms of square meters that we need to build in because then we need to just extend the factories. We're not at that point yet, but we will watch that closely. But currently, I would say 45 units for a system with higher productivity capability, that should be sufficient for next couple of years. -- Thank you, Peter. -- And Sandeep on your question on the gross margin. What I said in the introductory comments was that the Q4 gross margin approaches our 2020 target of greater than 50%. So the 2020 target is greater than 50%. It will approach that in Q4, which you should read as high 40%s therefore. -- Thank you. -- The next question comes from Krish Sankar. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Hi. It's Krish from Cowen. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one both in 2020, First one for Roger, if you look at next year, it looks like you're going to do EUR4.2 billion to EUR4.4 billion or so in EUV revenue, is it -- should I assume that whole revenue stream should come in at a 40% gross margin or is 40% more the exit run rate for next year ? And then a question for -- a follow-up for Peter, if your customer mix and demand is similar in 2020 as in 2019 and your shipping more EUV units, should we assumed DUV units start coming down in 2020 because of more EUV or you think that transition is still further down the road? -- Yeah. So to answer that question, I think it's further down the road. I mean next year, you will still see a very clear mix. Don't forget, let's take an example, there are Logic makers that have said, we're going to ramp a 7-nanometer product in 2021, which means they need the tools in 2020. But still they're ramping capacity of the previous nodes, which is real capacity that you need to ship. So there'll be a bit of a mix next year. I -- at the 2020, I don't think I said at the 2020 EUV mix is going to be similar to 2019 because that is dependent on, I think, the success you could call it or the demand for DRAM, it will be next year, which is a bit still needs to be proven, like I tried to explain earlier. -- But the margin that we've given for EUV for 2020 is 40%, that's the margin that we've indicated and that we're comfortable that we'll get there in 2020. -- Thanks, folks. -- Next caller? -- The next question comes from Mr. John Pitzer. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- Yeah, it's Credit Suisse. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Peter, as always, appreciate all the detail. I'm just kind of curious, you talked about in your prepared comments that the non-EUV Memory revenue for the back half of the year, it needs to be about EUR900 million. I'm kind of curious if you could help us understand the profile between Q3 and Q4, i.e., how important is the Memory pick up to kind of your Q4 implied outlook? And do you think the current run rate is kind of -- for better or worse bouncing along the bottom run rate and the risk is timing for an upturn? Or could you actually envision the scenario where Memory would actually go lower from these levels? -- Yeah, it's a good question. So John, well to answer the last one I need a crystal ball because I don't know whether it can be lower or not, I mean it is at the bottom run rate, well EUR900 million annualized EUR1.8 billion of capacity in an industry that is growing and also looking at where Logic is going, it's pretty tough to see that much lower than it is. Now, I think the spread of the EUR900 million, I don't have the exact details here, but I think it's about half-half, I mean, it's not that much different, I'm looking at-- -- Yeah. -- I think it's about half-half. So it's not skewed to one of -- to Q3 or Q4, but by any means EUR900 million for six months or EUR1.8 billion on an annualized basis for capacity, for bit capacity in litho is not a very large number, if you annualize it. So that's actually, that's a low, let's say, relatively low number. Now is that a bottom, I don't know, I don't know what is going to happen. But like I said earlier on the positive side, customers are also changing their wafer output plans to the downside. So all these things will of course help, it's like with every Memory cycle you have to grind through it and lowering capex and, in this particular case, which is different than previous cycle is, as you know, turning -- closing the faucets here basically slowing down on the wafer starts. That is something that we haven't seen before, all these things will help. So I'm not that pessimistic on the length of this downturn, this memory downturn. It will turn whether it's the end of the year or beginning of next year, I mean, I don't think it's going to last hell of lot longer. -- That's helpful, Peter. For my follow-up, I just wanted to go back to the impact of improving productivity on EUV tool shipments. It's pretty obvious that in the memory space, DRAM space, there should be a pretty high correlation as productivity goes up, economics make more sense and event intra-node insertion of more layers seems like very plausible for DRAM, I'm kind of curious on the Logic foundry side, given that there is sort of a design cycle time for 5 and 7 nanometers. If you start to exceed productivity targets, does that actually drive more tool units or fewer tool units? Because my guess is intra-node insertion would be a much more difficult timely, costly thing for your customer -- customers got through. And are we still focused on units because if productivity is going up, I'm assuming to really get better ASP, so should we be more focused on revenue target for litho instead of unit target -- for EUV instead of unit target? -- Yeah, I'll let Roger to comment on the last part. Yes, I think when you look at customers and the EUV uncertainty that they have seen over the last couple of years, that the fact that they actually have changed layer adoption of EUV as we went. As they gained more confidence and got more information out of the R&D, they actually changed the layer counts, it wasn't stable, I mean it actually changed. And actually, there's a tendency to go up. So that proves that customers do take -- they have alternatives not that they're completely developing two separate techs. I think there is some interchangeability there, where they can swap certain layers to EUV if the economics makes sense. I think it's taken into account in their design process. I mean that's what we've seen and otherwise, this trend that we've seen by adding more layers could not have happened and we're seeing it. So it means that they're taking account of it and then they're designing probably in a manner where they have some flexibility to either to do -- either or. -- And John, as it relates to your last comment, that was music to my ears, because you're absolutely spot on. I think more and more we need to look at the EUV business not in terms of units but in terms of the euro value that is attributed to that, because you're absolutely right. The number of units is meaningless to the extent that you see the very significant uptick that we've been able to demonstrate in productivity and then translates into higher ASPs. So that's why on a go-forward basis I do believe that we all need to think much more in terms of EUV revenue rather than EUV units. -- Thanks guys. -- The next question will come from Mr. Dominik Olszewski. Go ahead please and please state your company name. -- Hi, I'm from Morgan Stanley, and good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As you mentioned that Q4 will be a larger quarter with key focus on execution along supply chain, I appreciate that obviously building the tools requires a lot of complicated steps, but just curious whether there is any particular color on specific aspects of execution that have greater risk than others in Q4 that we should watch for? And then I have just a quick follow-up. -- Yeah, I think we are introducing several new features on the 3400C which includes -- it ranges from optics to laser alignment systems to the module vessel which we're using to create EUV plasma. And It's all of the above and then all needs to come together at the right time. So when you have one of these components a few weeks later than few weeks behind the shipment schedule. So this is what -- and it is normal when you introduce a new system which has quite a significant number -- a higher number of new parts in it.So this is what it is. It is -- it can be all of the above and we just need to make sure that the suppliers which we know, I just mentioned them, source related, laser related, optics, they're all ramping as fast as they can. They are at their maximum capacity and of course when -- with a new product, things don't go as planned because it takes a little bit longer to ship to us and we have a delay. And that's pretty normal with this complex technology, but we're pushing them. We're sitting on top but you have to take into account, there is a level of risk there that we will -- might lose -- there's a few systems that we need to push into January 2020. -- Okay, understood. So nice specific kind of milestones, just broader kind of [Indecipherable] down a little bit. -- Yeah. -- And then secondly, from your advantage point. I'm curious whether you have thoughts on DRAM and specifically whether you've quantified your perspective on DRAM utilization rates. Whether you've seen anything and have you quantified them? -- Well, whereas we're seeing certain things, but we're not in customer fabs although we have some level of information and I don't think we should have mentioned on this call any utilization rates or our assessment of utilization rates of our customer that's pretty confidential. But it's in their statements also that they say basically they have lowered their wafer starts, so and which is true. I mean we can -- our data that we see actually perform this. So that's what it is and I think that's a good sign. But how much it is, I don't think we should discuss this in this call. -- Okay, understood. -- Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you are unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact ASML Investor Relations department with your question. Now operator, may we have the last caller, please. -- Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, the last question will come from Mr. Amit Harchandani. Please state your company name followed by your question. -- And thanks for letting me on. Two if I may from my side. Firstly, since -- it would be helpful to get an update from your side on how the E-beam side of business is coming along in terms of its trajectory into the second half of the year and into 2020? And then I have another question please. -- Yeah, I think not much different, as we said last quarter, I mean we are on track to ship the first systems to R&D sites of our customers, and I talk about the multibeam systems, which actually means we should ship multibeam systems next year in volume to the market. In that sense, it's an update and update is what we said last quarter, there is no change there. The plan is still intact. -- Okay. And secondly, if I may, we obviously have a macroeconomic backdrop with the trade wars between U.S. and China, you clearly did not design a company to be supplying separately to U.S. and China. But given in terms of the opportunity going forward from China longer term, is there anything strategically or conceptually you need to think of in terms of how you're structured as an organization or as a supply chain to ensure you can keep on supplying both of these key geographies going forward, I guess it's a bit hypothetical but certainly something to consider given what you've seen over the past one year. -- I think, I would say, I mean that's a very good question because one, the answer is, it's too early. I mean, we don't know how this is going to pan out. This is -- overall, it is a concern, it's more a strategic concern that we need to start thinking of just like you said, and aye it's absolutely not the time to take drastic decisions because I don't know how this is going to pan out, but we'll follow it very closely. And you are right, it is our intention to service our customers and our customers they are wanting to place orders and we're wanting to -- we are completely willing and wanting to ship those orders. And unless, there are legal boundaries that we cannot cross and we will not, then we will keep doing what we are doing. But you are right, speculating where this might end up is a bit dangerous because it's definitely too early to start thinking of any big strategic organizational moves into another direction to make sure that we can ship to our customers. It's a bit of a wait and see. -- Thank you, Peter. -- Now on behalf of ASML, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call. I would appreciate it.

However, that may be because they fell the  last fall, with most still below the highs set back in the early part of 2018.In fact, most companies across the semiconductor space are  in both revenue and earnings this year. Cautious demand from end customers is filtering down to bare-bones purchases of memory and semiconductors, and these companies are thus pulling back on equipment purchases.However, despite near-term industry headwinds, one semiconductor equipment company is actually predicting  in the coming year:  (NASDAQ: ASML) . How is this company from the Netherlands outperforming its semi-equipment peers?Image source: ASML.ASML makes many of the types of machines used in the memory and semiconductor manufacturing process. Its machines include:It also provides services for the installed base of machines.Roughly 70% of ASML sales came from its various DUV machine offerings. But as we'll see, it's really the EUV sales -- which made up only 24% of sales in Q4 -- that will power ASML to its unique growth this year and beyond.ASML recently reported its full-year 2018 quarter results, and they were impressive. Revenue grew a strong 22.1% over the prior year, with earnings per share up an even greater 26.8%, on the backs of both expanding gross margin and significant buybacks.In fact, results were so strong that ASML hiked its annual dividend by 50% in 2018, to 2.10 euros per share, up from 1.40 euros per share. The longer-term track record is even better, as the company has increased its dividend from 0.20 euros in 2009 to 2.10 today, a more-than-tenfold increase in 10 years.While most equipment makers are forecasting declines in 2019, ASML management is forecasting \"another sales growth year in 2019.\" Growth will be centered on the foundry and logic segments, and especially EUV machines, which enable production of today's leading-node chips.Of note: ASML is the  of EUV technology.You heard that right. This new technology, which enables a breakthrough in production of next-generation chips, is the sole property of ASML. Even more exciting? EUV use is only just starting to be used in commercial mass production.Why is ASML the sole provider of EUV? For one thing, the technology is extremely difficult to get right. EUV has been under development for over 20 years and has been hugely expensive, and there was no certainty it would ever work. But just in time for 7 nm chip production, which greatly benefits from EUV, the technology finally became cost-effective for commercial use.Traditional DUV tools use 193 nm light to etch patterns onto photosensitive silicon wafers, but 193 nm is quite large compared with the tiny transistors on today's leading-edge chips. Producers have gotten around this by running chips through many, many rounds of lithography tools, doing a tiny bit at a time.EUV, however, uses 13.5 nm light to etch even tinier patterns on wafers. This EUV production can thus cut out many DUV lithography steps, potentially reducing DUV steps in certain parts of the process by 67% to 75%.How much savings does this yield for semiconductor manufacturers? Well, new EUV machines currently go for over $125 million a pop -- not bad for 20 years' research and development.The combined effect of the semiconductor downturn and adoption of EUV means that ASML should continue to grow even while its DUV competitors, including  (NASDAQ: LRCX) and  (NASDAQ: AMAT) , encounter headwinds -- not only from the semi downturn, but also from reduced shipments of DUV tools.This is also why ASML has a  that's more than twice those of its DUV-focused competitors: data by  .Is ASML overly expensive? Well, it depends. After selling 11 EUV tools in 2017 for early production, and 18 machines in 2018, management expects to sell 30 EUV tools in 2019, powering its overall growth.If EUV continues to take off not only for leading-edge chips, but also some types of memory production -- currently in a test phase -- ASML's run could just be getting started.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Therefore, its earnings releases usually give investors a high-level overview of the state of the semiconductor industry.Unfortunately, this exciting sector is putting up some not-so-exciting numbers right now. The overhang from the U.S.-China trade war is wreaking havoc on memory and semiconductor companies, as end customers continue to be cautious in buying next-generation chips. As Applied Materials makes the machines these chip manufacturers use, the uncertainty is affecting Applied's results as well.The company's recent  shed some light on Applied's current challenges, but also on how the company plans to grow out of the down cycle. Here's what management had to say about the recent downturn and its prescription for a turnaround.Applied Materials is undergoing revenue declines. Image source: Applied Materials.We are currently in a down cycle in semiconductors, especially in the memory market, where Applied earned 56% of its systems revenue last quarter. As a result, Applied's revenue, margins, and earnings have decreased compared with fiscal 2018, which was a banner year for semiconductor equipment sales.\n  \nData source: Applied Materials Q1 Fiscal 2019 press release. YOY = year over year. EPS = earnings per share.Not only were last quarter's numbers down, but management projected more declines for the current quarter. Revenue guidance was in a range of $3.33 billion to $3.63 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $0.62 and $0.70. Both figures were below analyst estimates of $3.66 billion and $0.77, respectively.Management now projects 2019 results could fall below those of 2017, whereas on its  , Applied executives said that 2019 results would be close to even with 2017 figures.What's to blame for the worse-than-expected outlook? Management noted that since the November call, \"we've seen pre-announcements by end customers -- one company in the smartphones space, another one in the GPU -- and cryptocurrency continues to be weak. So we've taken customer spending down in semi and display.\" Management had the politeness not to name the end customers in question, but they're most probably  and  . Both are key chipmakers in the industry, and both came out with terrible  for the recent quarter.To top it off, Applied is also facing a headwind due to the recent industry adoption of extreme ultraviolet lithography. EUV lithography is solely provided by Applied's rival,  (NASDAQ: ASML) . The adoption of the technology is supposed to displace some of the Applied's etch and deposition machines, which were in high demand to produce leading-edge node chips.Despite the ongoing headwinds to its business, Applied's stock has appreciated in the last few months along with the industry, on hopes of a second-half recovery for the year. Management said it expects the recovery to be \"slow and gradual,\" but also that it was not yet ready to \"call the bottom,\" as inventory levels remain high.On the EUV question, management admitted that it would add a near-term headwind, but that the impact would be relatively minimal. Currently, EUV is mostly being used for logic and foundry chips, not memory, and only on leading-edge nodes. Thus, management claimed that EUV only threatens a portion of the 25% of Applied's business that serves leading-edge foundry customers.Management also pointed out that many growth industries, such as Internet of Things sensors, will operate on trailing nodes, and won't need EUV lithography. Another example cited by management is a new artificial intelligence chip designed on the 28-nanometer node, which is several generations behind the leading 7-nanometer nodes that need EUV.When confronted with questions on these tough cyclical and competitive challenges, CEO Gary Dickerson has usually responded by looking even further out, claiming the industry needs \"a new playbook,\" involving, \"new architectures, new 3D techniques, novel materials, new ways to shrink transistors, and advanced packaging techniques.\" In other words, Applied will counter these threats with really cool new stuff that hasn't been invented or released yet.That's quite a leap of faith Dickerson expects investors to take on Applied's future. While Applied has grown to become the leading semiconductor equipment manufacturer, investors have to believe the current downturn will eventually ease, and that Applied will be able to innovate its way to the next big thing -- something it didn't do with EUV.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At the end of last year, when the market was in bad shape, semiconductor stocks were some of the worst performing equities in the entire market. The  (NASDAQ:  ) plunged as a variety of economic issues took hold. But year-to-date is another story. The SOXX and chip stocks are on a roll.Why the sudden change?First off, the Federal Reserve has taken its foot off the brake and paused on raising interest rates. That's left the flow of easy money going. With that, investors have flooded growth stocks once again - with technology equities getting a huge piece of that pie. Semiconductor stocks couldn't help but rally.At the same time, the global economic backdrop has been better. With the predicted end of the U.S.-China trade war, demand for the chips is expected to skyrocket over the next few years as growth returns. With prices depressed at the end of last year, the semis were a huge value compared to many other sectors. Add in a ton of recent M&A deals and you have a recipe for success.The best part is that there is still time for the SOXX and semiconductor stocks to keep the mojo going.For investors, despite its recent hotness, the semiconductor stocks could be a great buy going forward. But which ones? Here are five of the best chip makers around. Source: ShutterstockI'll admit it,  (NASDAQ:  ) seems like the easy lay-up when it comes to the semiconductor stocks. But that's only because NVDA continues to find more ways to win. While graphics-processing units (GPUs) have long been the staple in video game and gaming PCs, the chip stock has been finding plenty of new ways to use its technology. That includes a hefty amount of self-driving automobiles, A.I. and even bitcoin mining.Even better is that GPUs are quickly becoming standard equipment in cloud computing and data center management. The reason is that GPUs benefit from so-called parallel computing in that they can perform multiple, complex mathematical calculations rather quickly. That makes them perfect for A.I. and other data center applications. And NVDA has benefited tremendously.Datacenter revenue jumped  from 2018 to the fiscal-year 2019 for NVIDIA. That's very strong growth and its only poised to continue rising as firm's take advantage of the chip makers lighting fast GPU processers. And its recent buyout of  (NASDAQ:  ) only adds to this. MLNX specializes in chips, networking gear, and interconnects that speed up the exchange of data. These are also all major components in cloud computing. Given their already standing partnership, the buyout now gives NVDA an all-in-one play on powering cloud computing.Meanwhile, the tech wreck of last year still has NVDA trading for a forward P/E of just 25. That's not super expensive, given its long-term runway for growth. Source: ShutterstockThere's a good chance you've never heard of  (NASDAQ  ). But the firm could overthrow NVDA as the king of the semiconductor stocks over the long haul. That's because of the type of chip it specializes in.XLNX makes something called a field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and various forms of the semiconductor. The beauty of FPGAs is that their logic programming can be changed continuously. This means that they can adapt to changing requirements and are perfect for machine learning/artificial intelligence. That's a huge advantage over GPUs.The firm has seen plenty of robust revenues - with sales growing by  in the last reported quarter - as more data center and device manufacturers look towards FPGAs. That in of itself is the reason to consider the semiconductor stock.The other is that, right now, XLNX is only one of two - the other is  (NASDAQ:  ) - producers of FPGA chipsets. For Xilinx, this is where it gets interesting. INTC had to buy its way into the market for these chips and spent a pretty penny to do so. As the only other player in the market - and a pure player at that - anyone else looking to do so, will have to snag XLNX. A couple more quarters of rising revenues and real buyout premium will exist. Source: ShutterstockThose chip stocks that have been able to make some big moves and tilt towards hot trends have been rewarded by investors. That includes  (NASDAQ:  ). Once the king of NAND Flash and other memory chips, CY has continued to pivot towards two very big trends. That would be the Internet of Things (IoT) and self-driving cars.For starters, CY has become an  with the firm's company's portfolio consisting of micro-controllers, semiconductors for wireless connectivity, USB-C chips and touchscreen controllers. However, the bell of the ball could be its specialized computer memory called NOR flash. According to Cypress, NOR Flash chips offer high performance and are fail-safe storage systems. That sort of need is critical when you have a computer making decisions such as driving a car for you. Already, about half of all automatic driving systems use NOR Flash to function. With driverless car demand/growth assured, CY should be able to profit from this trend. Already, it controls 68% of NOR Flash market.Secondly, Cypress is dominating IoT. The firm's programmable  chips offer advantages in power consumption, security and programmability over other rivals IoT offerings. Meanwhile, CY sells plenty of wireless/Bluetooth controllers needed to connect devices to the internet. As a result, the firm has seen its IoT revenues surge more than 39% over the last two years.With these two tailwinds propelling it along, Cypress could be the semiconductor stock to beat. Source: ShutterstockLike CY,  (NASDAQ:  ) is making its turnaround work. Historically, ON was a maker of strictly low-margined, high-comedized memory chips. That was fine, but memory chips aren't exactly a booming business. To counteract its low growth state, ON's management decided to move into higher-margined chips. Starting in 2016, the semiconductor firm made some strategic moves - including a big buyout - to enter new markets. That includes automotive power management and high-tech sensor market.New end-users in medicine, lighting and industrial IoT have managed to boost revenues and profits at ON. ON recorded more than  . That's a 51% jump in sales over what it made in 2016. Moreover, profits have more than doubled as these newer chips come with higher margins.Clearly, ON's turnaround and newfound focus is working. And with demand for advanced chips in automobiles, equipment and power management solutions in data centers only growing, the firm has long runway for future revenue growth. Management is calling for the stock to pull in around $7.1 billion in sales by 2020.However, shares of ON can be had for a dirt-cheap P/E of just 14. That makes ON one of the biggest values among the semiconductor stocks. Source: Shutterstock (NASDAQ:  ) is a bit different than the other semiconductor stocks on this list. That's because it doesn't actually make chips itself, but makes the machines that enable other firms to make chips. But the key is that ASML's technology is what has allowed many semiconductor stocks to really apply Moore's Law and shrink chips to fit more computing power into the same space or less.ASML lithography tools are needed to apply serious scale to cutting-edge chips. The best part is that ASML is only provider of  - a very specialized version of these machines. Each of these machines cost more than $100 million and absolutely necessary for all the firms on this list need it to make their potential happen. With demand surging for all sorts of specialized semis, ASML expects to sell  of these machines this year.With such a wide moat, rising sales and plenty of profits, ASML is one of the most shareholder-friendly semiconductor stocks out there. Last year alone, ASML managed to increase its payout by 50%. Over the last five years, that payout has grown by over 200%. Meanwhile, ASML has conducted several lucrative buyback programs.With demand rising for a variety of technologically advanced chips, ASML will be in the driver's seat for a long time.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:  ,  ,  ,  and  .There are signs that the semiconductor cycle has peaked driven by softening in smartphone and PC demand. The next wave of growth for semiconductors will come from things like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, smart cities, IoT, 5G and auto. Some of the current demand is already aligned with expansion in these markets, but we're just beginning to scratch the surface of that potential.Whether the demand from these markets can offset the cyclical slowdown is an open question and the answer will unfold through this year and the next. In the meantime, the current slate o  shows that there are few safe bets with Xilinx being an outlier.Revenue of $18.657 billion was short of the estimated $19.01 billion. EPS of 1.28 was ahead of the estimated $1.22. By segment: CCG up 9.7% (52.6% revenue share), DCG up 8.7% (32.5%), IOTG down 7.2% (4.4%), NSG up 24.5% (5.9%), PSG up 7.7% (3.3%), other up 27.6% (1.2%).The revenue miss, weaker-than-expected DCG revenue, cautious tone and disappointing guidance were concerns. The lower-than-expected revenue was attributed to weaker orders coming out of China because of a slowing economy. But management also said that macro issues including the trade war with China, the government shutdown and Brexit made them incrementally cautious for the rest of the year although a relative improvement should be expected in the back half when new products including the first 10nm chips are scheduled to ship.CCG wasn't in the spotlight but the business which accounts for more than half of Intel's revenue, benefited from stronger ASPs that more than offset the impact of softer volumes.Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are down 4 cents (9.4%) and 4 cents (3.8%), respectively.Texas Instruments topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line while slightly missing on the top line. Management attributed the miss to slowing demand for semiconductors overall (not unexpected given waning demand for smartphones and PCs and ongoing trade tensions with China).The earnings beat was mainly because the high-margin analog business remained strong, helped by 5G deployments at telecom customers. Industrial and auto were also good. Plus the company continues to transition from 200mm to 300mm, which helped it lower cost. An offsetting factor was lower factory utilization to maintain optimal use of cash in the softening demand environment.One of the more popular measures management takes is returning 100% of FCF to shareholders. In 2018, FCF jumped 30% to $6.1 billion and management returned $7.7 billion in share repurchases and dividend.Guidance disappointed, sending the Zacks Consensus Estimate down 10 cents (8.1%) and 9 cents (7.1%) for the March and June quarters, respectively.Xilinx beat the Zacks Consensus on both top and bottom lines helped by double-digit growth across business segments. In Data Center, The FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS) model is gaining momentum with AWS, Huawei and Alibaba. New design wins for its FPGA products included Samsung. In Communications, 5G related spending helped revenue across Korea, China and North America.SoC revenue is benefiting from the Zync platform that offers ARM technology (software programmability), Xilinx FPGA (hardware programmability) and I/O programmability. Strength in Advanced Products came from 28nm and 20nm categories. What's more, it also guided better than expected. Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are up 12 cents (14.6%) and 8 cents (9.6), respectively.The reasons for particular optimism around Xilinx that will continue in quarters ahead are first, with Intel snapping up Altera, the only other major FPGA player, all rivals feel affinity to Xilinx; second, the company has a solid strategy based on some compelling products that will drive continued expansion in its revenue and profits, even in a difficult market such as this.The recently announced 7nm Versal, for instance, is the first product in its adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP), which is a highly integrated multi-core heterogeneous compute platform enabling hardware-level flexibility suitable for machine learning, big data applications, cloud computing and more.On the discrete level, its recently-launched Alveo enables acceleration in industry standard servers. Throw in the Zync platform and wrap it up with the FaaS model, and it's clear that this company is going places.Lam's reported revenue and earnings of $2.52 billion (in-line with the Zacks Consensus) and adjusted earnings of $3.87 (beat by 5.5%) are illustrative of a slowing semiconductor cycle. New CEO Tim Archer's commentary supports the view: \"While near-term market trends reflect adjustments after a period of tremendous growth in semiconductor demand, I am confident that our focus on Deposition and Etch technology leadership as well as growth in our installed-base business positions us well for the long term.\"Memory, which accounts for more than half its revenue, will be meaningfully lower this year, as Chinese spending tapers off after a period of strong builds. The memory business will be driven by the need to lower cost: DRAM shifting to lower nodes, NAND shifting to 96-layer devices. Foundry and logic, weighted to the first half, will be stronger.The Board of Directors approved a $5 billion share repurchase program, and given its low valuation both with respect to the S&P 500 and peer group, this might be a good time to buy back some shares.Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for March and June quarters are down 21 cents (6.2%) and 65 cents (16.5%), respectively.This European maker of advanced lighting systems used in the semiconductor manufacturing process beat on both the top and bottom lines. The good news is that demand out of China remains strong according to management. The bad news is that some customers pushed back orders from the first half into the second because of end market softness. Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the March and June quarters are down $1.47 (73.1%) and $1.00 (49.0%), respectively.While management expressed confidence in its growth in 2020 and said that 2019 would also be a growth year albeit backend loaded, order pushouts due to end market softness is never a good thing. There could be more pushouts, who knows? That said, the company has some pretty big customers in Intel, Samsung, TSMC and the like; management said that the first DRAM customers would be using its systems this year; and China is very unlikely to ramp down its semiconductor capacity builds. So let's see how the year shapes up.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

Its biggest clients are Samsung, TSMC and Intel.Wennink said mainland Chinese manufacturers wanted to build leading-edge chips at volume, but that remained an ambition more than a reality.He said no company in China had yet installed one of ASML's most advanced EUV machines, which cost around 100 million euros ($114 million) apiece.\"They don't have an EUV machine, they have an order for an EUV machine,\" he said, referring to a customer whose identity ASML has not disclosed but is widely believed in the industry to be Semiconductor Manufacturing International.Wennink said a number of Chinese chipmakers were trying to scale up production to commercially viable levels.\"That will start to accelerate from 2020,\" he said, adding ASML needed to be there \"now\" to start the process of delivering and installing its machines, which are one of the largest pieces of equipment in a fabrication plant.Wennink said so far the trade dispute between the United States and China had not impacted ASML, which is based in the Netherlands.It faces no limitations on shipping its machines to China, as they are built with fewer than 25 percent American parts - but it must obtain licences from Dutch authorities, which have until now been granted.But Wennink said he was concerned about the possibility the trade war could escalate.He noted the entire chain of semiconductor production was global and both its supply chains and end customers of electronics devices were located in all parts of Europe, the United States and Asia.\"It's up to the politicians to use their senses and say 'let's make sure that we don't kill this ecosystem that's providing so much value for the entire world',\" he said.($1 = 0.8797 euros)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["merican depositary receipts of European stocks were trading 0.45% lower at 122.80 on the Bank of New York Mellon Europe ADR Index on Thursday.In continental Europe, the gainers were led by semiconductor company STMicroelectronics (  ), and biopharmaceutical firm DBV Technologies (  ), which climbed 11.3% and 4.5% respectively.

But the company has a multiyear plan in place for supplying chips to the automotive market which is already reaping benefits.Fortunately, management led the company's foray in the fast-growing auto market while waiting for the QCOM-NXPI approval. Its investments over the years will result in strong end-market positioning, especially for electric vehicles and self-driving vehicles.In the third quarter, NXP reported strong numbers in automotive. The unit brought in $990 million in revenue, up 4% from last year, offset by slower growth in Secured Connected Devices and Secure Identification Solutions.Investors do not appreciate NXP's transformation.

The activist fund is bearish on the smartphone chip giant because it doubts the firm will come out ahead in its trial against the Federal Trade Commission.With QCOM stock 33% below its yearly high, the company needs a strong quarterly earnings report, scheduled for Jan. 30 after market close, to reverse the stock's fall. It also needs to beat  (NASDAQ:  ) in the courtroom. Markets value the company as if it is monopolizing its IP and royalty rates, yet Apple depended on Qualcomm's 4G technology a few years ago. The firm has a high-performing Snapdragon processor that Android suppliers want to use for powering devices.QCOM claims it is owed at least $7 billion from Apple, but even after reaching a settlement, Apple will still be behind in 5G.Without Apple, Qualcomm still has an exceptionally strong business. The wireless modem industry has plenty of competition from  (NASDAQ:  ) and MediaTek. When it comes to preference, Qualcomm has the best wireless solutions, so devices makers who want superior technology will need to work out a deal with them.17 analysts covering QCOM stock have an average $67  . A  , which assumes single-digit revenue growth and one weak year, suggests a fair value of at least $70 a share.Source: ShutterstockThe climb in  (NASDAQ:  ) from the single-digit share price in 2016 to over $60 in 2018, came to an end ahead of the escalation of the U.S.-China trade war. In its first-quarter earnings report posted on Dec. 18, 2018, Micron posted sharply lower revenue guidance - it expects Q2 revenue to be in the range of $5.7 billion-$6.3 billion. Analysts at the time had forecast revenue of $7.2 billion. Weaker demand for both NAND and DRAM is the primary reason for the disappointing outlook.Investors now know that an absurdly low P/E is not a good enough reason to expect shares to resume an uptrend. At a $37 stock price, MU stock is valued at a trailing P/E of just 3X. Its forward P/E is just above 5X. Why should anyone bet on a chip cycle returning to high growth again?The trade war between two giant nations created a temporary but noticeable dip in demand. The market now has excess supply, pressuring prices. However, fundamentals continue to improve. Micron bought out Intel's holdings in the 3D XPoint joint venture. And the growth in AI applications will not slow down, which creates heavy demand for very-high-density memory.Developing 3D XPoint takes lots of time but demand will pick up when it is ready and the product works with operating systems and software. Fortunately for value investors, markets are impatient and only value Micron on NAND and DRAM dynamics.With tax-loss selling in December now out of the way, patient investors may accumulate Micron and hold it for a few years.Source: ShutterstockIn the Semiconductor-Integrated Circuits space,  (NYSE:  ) strong fourth-quarter results are positive developments for the sector. The firm reported an EPS of 63 cents a share on revenue of $9.4 billion. More importantly, gross margin and net revenue met guidance. Revenue, gross margin (of 47.7%) and net income all rose from last year.Communications made up 64% of revenue for the quarter. Computer brought in 11% of the total but as the 7nm manufacturer for AMD, expect the PC market to add nicely to sales in 2019.TSMC forecast revenue of between $7.3 billion and $7.4 billion. Gross profit margin will be in the range of 43%-45%. The sequential dip is not a concern because the smartphone industry needs to work off the inventory in high-end units. Demand for smartphones is seasonally weak at this time. By the second half of this year, new devices will renew demand for TSMC's components.TSMC could benefit if high-end smartphone manufacturers recognize that the high-demand elasticity favors lowering prices. Consumers are not willing to pay for expensive devices only to get useless features they will never use. Needless to say, TSMC and other smartphone chip suppliers would benefit from higher unit sales driven by lower average sales prices.Source: ShutterstockWith a market cap of around $73 billion,  (NASDAQ:  ) is a little larger than Qualcomm and more than twice as big as NXPI.

It attributed the light forecast on customers delaying orders. Similar to what other chip firms are saying, ASML said that sales will pick up in the second half of this year.The CEO said:\"We have customer demand for 30 EUV systems in 2019 and these shipments will include the first volume production systems to DRAM memory customers. We expect that chips produced on our EUV scanners will start to become available to consumers and enterprises in 2019.\"ASML's near-term weakness is temporary. Slow demand in its end markets is due to delayed deliveries for its litho systems. For the full year 2019, the Logic segment will drive ASML's growth. Customers are demanding advanced nodes, driving demand for its immersion systems and EUV.The CEO's positive outlook for DRAM, plus expectations for strong demand from China despite the U.S.-imposed trade restrictions, are good reasons investors should consider buying ASML stock.ASML will declare a dividend of EUR 2.10 a share ($2.39 USD), up from EUR 1.40 (USD $1.59) last year. The 1.5% dividend yield is small but would suit income investors looking for exposure to semi technology stocks.Source: ShutterstockConsidered a \"jack of all trades\" in the semiconductor space,  (NASDAQ:  ) has a diverse business in multiple sectors. For this reason, the company delivered double-digit growth in 2018 despite a challenging second half.

Sales will start to add meaningfully to results, so investors may expect good revenue momentum. But even though revenue may fall in absolute terms, the company is setting the foundation for innovative materials to maintain its competitive edge.Applied forecast a second-half recovery. Management is probably anticipating trade relations improving. More significant would be the U.S. and China agreeing on a trade deal that sees lower tariffs and fewer barriers to trade. Suppliers collectively cut orders or bought goods months in advance of the tariff war. And that is contributing to the near-term weakness.AMAT ended the year 2018 with $5.6 billion in cash and investments. It returned $946 million to shareholders and bought back $751 million in shares. It still has a massive $4.3 billion remaining in its buyback authorization.If shares fall again, maybe even to the sub-$30 levels, management could take advantage of the weak share price by buying back shares.Source: shutterstockIn the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials sub-sector, Lam Research Corporation's strong second-quarter report is a bright spot for the chip sector.

By segment: CCG up 9.7% (52.6% revenue share), DCG up 8.7% (32.5%), IOTG down 7.2% (4.4%), NSG up 24.5% (5.9%), PSG up 7.7% (3.3%), other up 27.6% (1.2%).The revenue miss, weaker-than-expected DCG revenue, cautious tone and disappointing guidance were concerns. The lower-than-expected revenue was attributed to weaker orders coming out of China because of a slowing economy. But management also said that macro issues including the trade war with China, the government shutdown and Brexit made them incrementally cautious for the rest of the year although a relative improvement should be expected in the back half when new products including the first 10nm chips are scheduled to ship.CCG wasn't in the spotlight but the business which accounts for more than half of Intel's revenue, benefited from stronger ASPs that more than offset the impact of softer volumes.Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are down 4 cents (9.4%) and 4 cents (3.8%), respectively.Texas Instruments topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line while slightly missing on the top line. Management attributed the miss to slowing demand for semiconductors overall (not unexpected given waning demand for smartphones and PCs and ongoing trade tensions with China).The earnings beat was mainly because the high-margin analog business remained strong, helped by 5G deployments at telecom customers. Industrial and auto were also good. Plus the company continues to transition from 200mm to 300mm, which helped it lower cost. An offsetting factor was lower factory utilization to maintain optimal use of cash in the softening demand environment.One of the more popular measures management takes is returning 100% of FCF to shareholders. In 2018, FCF jumped 30% to $6.1 billion and management returned $7.7 billion in share repurchases and dividend.Guidance disappointed, sending the Zacks Consensus Estimate down 10 cents (8.1%) and 9 cents (7.1%) for the March and June quarters, respectively.Xilinx beat the Zacks Consensus on both top and bottom lines helped by double-digit growth across business segments. In Data Center, The FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS) model is gaining momentum with AWS, Huawei and Alibaba. New design wins for its FPGA products included Samsung. In Communications, 5G related spending helped revenue across Korea, China and North America.SoC revenue is benefiting from the Zync platform that offers ARM technology (software programmability), Xilinx FPGA (hardware programmability) and I/O programmability. Strength in Advanced Products came from 28nm and 20nm categories. What's more, it also guided better than expected. Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are up 12 cents (14.6%) and 8 cents (9.6), respectively.The reasons for particular optimism around Xilinx that will continue in quarters ahead are first, with Intel snapping up Altera, the only other major FPGA player, all rivals feel affinity to Xilinx; second, the company has a solid strategy based on some compelling products that will drive continued expansion in its revenue and profits, even in a difficult market such as this.The recently announced 7nm Versal, for instance, is the first product in its adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP), which is a highly integrated multi-core heterogeneous compute platform enabling hardware-level flexibility suitable for machine learning, big data applications, cloud computing and more.On the discrete level, its recently-launched Alveo enables acceleration in industry standard servers. Throw in the Zync platform and wrap it up with the FaaS model, and it's clear that this company is going places.Lam's reported revenue and earnings of $2.52 billion (in-line with the Zacks Consensus) and adjusted earnings of $3.87 (beat by 5.5%) are illustrative of a slowing semiconductor cycle. New CEO Tim Archer's commentary supports the view: \"While near-term market trends reflect adjustments after a period of tremendous growth in semiconductor demand, I am confident that our focus on Deposition and Etch technology leadership as well as growth in our installed-base business positions us well for the long term.\"Memory, which accounts for more than half its revenue, will be meaningfully lower this year, as Chinese spending tapers off after a period of strong builds. The memory business will be driven by the need to lower cost: DRAM shifting to lower nodes, NAND shifting to 96-layer devices. Foundry and logic, weighted to the first half, will be stronger.The Board of Directors approved a $5 billion share repurchase program, and given its low valuation both with respect to the S&P 500 and peer group, this might be a good time to buy back some shares.Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for March and June quarters are down 21 cents (6.2%) and 65 cents (16.5%), respectively.This European maker of advanced lighting systems used in the semiconductor manufacturing process beat on both the top and bottom lines. The good news is that demand out of China remains strong according to management. The bad news is that some customers pushed back orders from the first half into the second because of end market softness. Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the March and June quarters are down $1.47 (73.1%) and $1.00 (49.0%), respectively.While management expressed confidence in its growth in 2020 and said that 2019 would also be a growth year albeit backend loaded, order pushouts due to end market softness is never a good thing. There could be more pushouts, who knows? That said, the company has some pretty big customers in Intel, Samsung, TSMC and the like; management said that the first DRAM customers would be using its systems this year; and China is very unlikely to ramp down its semiconductor capacity builds. So let's see how the year shapes up.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

Here are the details-Intel reported a solid quarter with revenue and earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Both its data centric (current focus area) and PC centric (area of traditional strength) contributed to the performance. Most importantly, both businesses garnered improvement in volumes and prices.The PC business gained from upgrades by businesses, spurred by Microsoft ending support for older versions of Windows in developed countries and increased buying by gamers. Apple's  modem business also helped no doubt. Guidance was also better than expected. China tensions aren't bothering the company as of now, but could be a factor in the long term if trade tensions with the U.S. continue. Read more:  .Micron announced that it was taking full control of the Intel-Micron Flash Technologies (IMFT) JV, months after the companies said they would be taking their 3D Xpoint technology development in separate directions. Intel was first to market, although there's nothing to suggest that Micron won't catch up.3D Xpoint is basically a cross between the DRAM and NAND technologies offering non-volatile storage at significantly higher speeds than NAND and significantly lower cost than DRAM, making it suitable for a range of functions, but most notably in gaming and data center.The deal terms reportedly require Micron to pay Intel $1.5 billion in cash and assume its $1 billion debt to the JV. Prior agreements require Micron to sell Intel 3D XPoint wafers up to a year after the deal's closing. Its Dalian fab will probably shift into gear after that. In its latest quarter, Intel took a $290 million charge as a result of Micron's decision to buy out its portion of a memory fabrication plant in UtahIntel however says that the announcement had come too soon, its written statement reads: \"They can't officially make the call until January 1, 2019,\" and \"The operation of the IMFT factory would not change until after the close of the call, which is at Intel's discretion for up to one year.\"Intel has announced the 9 th generation of its Core desktop processors for gaming enthusiasts and content creators in particular, to ship in November. The X series as it's being called is still built on its 14nm process but includes support for Optane-based memory sticks, quad DDR4 memory channels modifications to deal with the Spectre and Meltdown attacks and more.The greater number of threads and cores should help it take on Advanced Micro Devices'  recent chip advancements although it's worth keeping in mind that AMD's 7 nm chips are around the corner. So Intel will probably have to do more to contain AMD. The smaller company doesn't have its own manufacturing facilities however and also has a significantly smaller R&D budget, so Intel may still have the last laugh after all.Softbank-owned ARM and Intel have finally found some common ground, i.e. that they both have something to gain from the proliferation of IoT devices.ARM gains from the number of devices themselves because they require processors built on its low-power designs by companies like NXP, Renesas and Microchip's Atmel. Himagiri Mukkamala, an ARM senior vice president and general manager for its IoT Cloud Services, expects 100 billion ARM-based IoT devices in the next four to five years with the number going up to a trillion over the next two decades.Intel gains from the number crunching that goes on with respect to the data captured by ARM-based IoT devices.Both gain when the devices operate in a secure environment. And that's why ARM's Pelion IoT management platform will use Intel's Secure Device Onboard specifications for automation and management of IoT devices, network connections and data transfers.Intel is helping Rolls Royce take the autonomous car concept to ships, with the goal of helping cargo ships operate more safely, efficiently and cost effectively by minimizing crew members and using the extra space for more cargo.So the ships will come equipped with similar technology, including Rolls-Royce's Intelligent Awareness System (IAS) that uses sensor fusion for enhanced decision making, combining data from LiDAR, radar, thermal cameras, HD cameras, satellite data and weather forecasts.Each vessel can capture up to 1 TB of data per day that is then captured and stored using Intel's Xeon Scalable processor-based servers so that it can be downloaded and analyzed for additional insights once the ship has docked.\"This collaboration is helping us to develop technology that supports ship owners in the automation of their navigation and operations, reducing the opportunity for human error and allowing crews to focus on more valuable tasks,\" said Kevin Daffey, director, engineering and technology and ship intelligence at Rolls-Royce.Intel along with other chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co  had purchased stakes in ASML Holding N.V.  back in 2012 when the company was trying to fund the development of its advanced lithography systems. The stake has been reduced over the years and with the latest sale, is now at just under 3%, according to Reuters.Intel shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ifetime Brands, Inc.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 429 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ASML options chain for the new December 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $170.00 strike price has a current bid of $12.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $170.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $157.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ASML, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $186.59/share today.Because the $170.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 69%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of ASML stock at the current price level of $186.59/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $195.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 16.03% if the stock gets called away at the December 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ASML shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for ASML Holding NV, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ASML's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $195.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $195.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Thankfully, stocks didn't have another epic pullback like we saw last Wednesday and Thursday.The Dow bounced all over the place on Monday. The last hour alone saw the index drop from a nearly 150-point gain to a loss of practically 90 points, which is where it closed. It still had the best performance on a percentage basis with decline of 0.35% to 25,250.55.The S&P finally broke a six-session losing skid on Friday, but it was back in negative territory after the weekend with a slide of 0.59% to 2750.79. Like the Dow, it chopped around and stretched into the green momentarily a few times during the day.Another weak session for tech helped complicate things for the S&P, but it really took a toll on the NASDAQ. The index spent all its time in the red and finished with a slump of 0.88% to 7430.74. As you'd expect, it was another rough session for the FANGs as Apple dipped more than 2%. Facebook had the best day with a decline of only 0.14%, but all others slipped by more than 1%.Only one of the FANGs is scheduled to report this week, and that's Netflix tomorrow. The streaming giant has been under pressure more than its counterparts recently, which explains why it is now a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) due to a few downward revisions from analysts. The market will be watching this report with a lot of interest tomorrow.For the moment, stocks seem rather directionless. They remain unnerved by last week's sharp selloff, yet we're still dealing with a strong economy. Unfortunately, we're also still dealing with the same problems that led to last week's plunge, namely rising rates, trade issues, tech concerns and earnings skepticism. Let's hope that another positive season, which  expected, can improve the market's mood.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["urco Companies, Inc.

Various cross-currents pushed shares higher and lower throughout the day, including the potential for a breakthrough on the trade front, and nervousness about the directions of interest rates and monetary policy both in the U.S. and internationally. Weighing on sentiment was bad news from some key individual companies that sent their respective stocks lower.

The social media company behind Snapchat has had to deal with several issues that have weighed on its performance, and today, a number of analyst companies reduced their price targets for the stock. Analysts at BTIG were the most skeptical, cutting their rating from neutral to sell and predicting the stock could drop to as little as $5 per share. With its poorly received redesign last year contributing to slowing growth, Snap hasn't proven that it can pull out of its tailspin, and the departure of yet another key executive this week showed a lack of commitment within the company's leadership ranks.Image source: Snap.Fitbit declined 6% after competing wearable-device maker  (NASDAQ: AAPL) released details about the next version of its popular wearable device. The new Apple Watch 4 will be the first device to come with clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to operate as an over-the-counter heart monitor with its electrocardiogram feature. Apple is pushing hard to emphasize the health benefits of its wearable device, and those following Fitbit fear that consumers will be less likely to buy that company's offerings during the holiday season given that they lack similar FDA credentials. With  even before this news, investors are more nervous than ever about the smaller company's future.Finally, ASML Holding was down 5%. The maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment had to deal with broadly negative comments from analysts at  , who said that they no longer see the industry as particularly attractive. Goldman's comments were largely directed at ASML competitor  , but the analysts also pointed to excess capacity throughout the memory manufacturing space as being a bearish sign for the companies that provide the equipment semiconductor manufacturers utilize in the production of memory chips.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of ASML Holding NV (Symbol: ASML) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 23.7, after changing hands as low as $184.18 per share.

SEMI however sees 11.7% growth this year to $50.8 billion, with the front end growing stronger than the back-end.Wafer fabrication is a process during which a silicon wafer (usually 200mm or 300mm in size) is treated with successive layers of conductive and semiconductive material using stencil-like structures called reticles. After each deposition of material on the surface, the excess material is etched away and the wafer exposed to a light source to implant the design. This is the front end process. The back end process is involved in cutting up the individual die, packaging for protection and use, attaching of electrical leads and sorting.So wafer fab equipment demand is dependent on the level of the demand for semiconductors themselves on the one hand and the level of installed capacity on the other.The last few years have seen the proliferation of smartphones and other consumer electronics gadgets, as well as cloud infrastructure buildouts. With smartphone demand moderating and IoT demand accelerating, both these segments are likely to be the most important drivers of semiconductor demand along with artificial intelligence, HPC and automotive. Communications infrastructure (5G) will jump on the bandwagon soon.As far as installed capacity is concerned, memory manufacturers are likely to remain the biggest spenders although foundries are also expected to remain strong. Technology transitions, an important consideration for equipment purchases are also expected to remain a driver due to the move toward larger wafer sizes (fab upgrades to 300mm, continued demnd for 20mm and development starting for 300mm in 2018-19 according to Technavio), shrinking nodes (10nm and 7nm), memory chip advancements (3D NAND processes are maturing, driving down cost), denser packaging (MEMS) and so forth. Materials research, device complexities, the need for greater manufacturing integration and new applications are other drivers.The  , which is a stock group within the broader  , has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.So we see that the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 23.0% over the past year, while the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer and Technology Sector have rallied 15.6% and 17.9%, respectively.While the industry is small, players like KLA-Tencor, Applied Materials, Lam Research and ASML Holding NV are very important players.The strong run in share prices over the past year have however led to a relatively rich valuation.Since the industry is made up of relatively mature companies, earnings flow is usually steady. So the industry's 1.04X  (PEG) is well below the 1.76X for the S&P 500. At the moment, it also happens to be below the annual high of 1.17X as well as the 1.06X median.Similar is the case when compared to the sector's 1.78X.But it probably makes more sense to value the industry based on sales and book value because this is a highly capital intensive business and success depends on the ability to provide the most advanced equipment and related customer service.The industry currently has a  ratio of 5.48X, which is below the annual high of 7.39X and the median level of 6.39X, suggesting the possibility of some upside. Comparing this with the S&P 500, we see that it is however ahead of its 3.40X (median 3.31X).Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of , we see that the industry's 5.48X is ahead of the sector's 3.72X.Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of  , we see that the industry's 5.48X is ahead of the sector's 3.72X.Comparing with the S&P 500 on the basis of  , we see that the industry's 9.28X is just short of its annual high of 9.75X but ahead of the median 8.76X. It's also ahead of the S&P 500's 3.94X.It is also ahead of the sector's 4.29X.So while there appears to be some risk based on valuation, there may also be some opportunities as well.With semiconductor demand remaining strong on account of cloud computing, big data, IoT, auto and other mass market adoption, costs coming down for NAND makers (where demand is more elastic) coupled with increased supply from improved yields and foundries racing to meet customer demand amid stiff competition, the demand scenario appears robust.However, the nature of the business necessitates heavy investments on the development of new technology as device complexities increase. The cost of development is so high that customers may at times finance development directly or through an equity purchase (as Intel, Samsung and TSM did in ASML).The above ratio analysis shows that while there could be some risks, there may be some opportunities as well. A quarter-to-quarter analysis is not really meaningful for the industry. At the same time, investors will continue to question whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry's prospects for a solid price performance going forward is the industry's earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.This becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $1.61 'EPS' estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up dollar EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks WFE industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the dollar earnings of $1.61 'per share' of the industry for 2018, but how this dollar number has evolved recently.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks WFE industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #37, which places it at the top 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows significant fluctuation but ultimate improvement in the industry's rank over the past five weeks.While near-term issues could bring varying results to investors, the estimated long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth for the Zacks WFE segment is attractive. Despite correction over the past year, the group's mean estimated long-term EPS growth rate of 14.88% compares favorably with the 9.82% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.The long-term growth is a continuation of strong performance over the past few years. Take revenue for example, which has gained momentum since 2016.The net income before non-recurring items tells the same story.While the debt level spiked in the beginning of 2017, the debt cap remains reasonable.As evident, the market is expected to get a bit worse before it gets better, as in all cyclical industries that go through periods of relative weakness. But underlying drivers are extremely strong, so for investors looking to invest for the longer term will make attractive gains.Here's a list of stocks that display the above characteristics- (KLAC): The stock has gained 27.4% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is up 4.7% in the last 30 days. (AMAT): The stock has gained 11.2% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is down 3 cents in the last 60 days, of which the decline in the last 30 days was a cent. (ASML): The stock has gained 34.7% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is up a couple of cents in the last 60 days.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let's take a closer look at them.TSMC CFO Lora Ho said that the first factor that drove the capital expenditure reduction was a \"delay of payment to 2019\" as a result of a \"schedule adjustment.\"Ho made sure to explain that \"the planned capacity remains unchanged.\"This schedule push-out, Ho said, was good for a $700 million reduction in TSMC's 2018 capital expenditures. However, since this is a push out and since TSMC's capacity plans here remain unchanged as a result, the company will still have to lay out that cash (unless, of course, its plans change), but that spending should now be part of TSMC's 2019 capital expenditure plans instead.The second driver of the reduced capital expenditures for 2018, Ho said, was a $600 million reduction due to \"efficiency gains\" that will allow TSMC to \"spend less on tools.\"During the question-and-answer session, Ho offered a more detailed explanation of those \"efficiency gains.\"The first thing she attributed those reductions to was \"process simplifications.\"The steps required to manufacture a chip is known as a \"process\" and a given generation of chip manufacturing technology is also known as a \"process technology.\"\"If you have a simpler process, you don't need to buy that much tools,\" Ho explained.She then said that TSMC \"share tools between [research and development] and operations.\"\"If we can find more opportunities to share, we don't have to buy that much tool,\" Ho added.TSMC CEO C.C. Wei also chimed in, indicating that because the company has made improvements to its cycle times (that is, the time it takes to go from a blank wafer to a fully processed wafer with chips on it), it doesn't need to buy equipment as early to meet its desired production schedule.The third major factor that led to a reduction in TSMC's capital expenditure budget for the year was from the U.S. dollar appreciating against the euro and the Japanese yen.TSMC buys tools from  (NASDAQ: ASML) and Tokyo Electron. ASML is based in the Netherlands and reports its results in euros, so it's likely that it does business in euros as well. Tokyo Electron is Japanese and likely does business using the Japanese yen.Since the U.S. dollar apparently strengthened against the yen and the euro, this means that each dollar converts into more yen and euros than it did before. Therefore if ASML and Tokyo Electron price their equipment in euro and yen, respectively, TSMC will need to spend fewer U.S. dollars to buy the same equipment that it would've needed to otherwise as a result of the currency movements.TSMC attributed $200 million of its capital expenditure reduction to these  .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 5 different analyst targets contributing to that average for ASML Holding NV, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $175.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $236.00. The standard deviation is $25.859.But the whole reason to look at the  ASML price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ASML crossing above that average target price of $213.20/share, investors in ASML have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $213.20 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["op Tech StocksMSFT -0.65%AAPL -0.56%IBM +0.54%CSCO -0.11%GOOG +0.13%Technology stocks as a group were finishing with a slim decline on Wednesday, with shares of tech companies in the S&P 500 index slipping just under 0.1% in late trading although the Philadelphia Semiconductor index was rising almost 0.8% ahead of today's closing bell.Among technology stocks moving on news:- Mellanox Technologies (  ) declined Wednesday, sinking as much as 2.5% and erasing an early 3% rise that followed the semiconductor manufacturer reporting above-consensus Q2 financial results and also forecasting Q3 and FY18 revenue also exceeding analyst estimates.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 4 different analyst targets contributing to that average for ASML Holding NV, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $175.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $236.00. The standard deviation is $26.335.But the whole reason to look at the  ASML price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ASML crossing above that average target price of $207.75/share, investors in ASML have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $207.75 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover ASML Holding NV:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

However, the chipmaking equipment power posted strong overall results, and the stock looks like a great value at the moment.Applied Materials reported adjusted Q2 earnings of $1.22 per share, which not only topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents but also marked a 54% surge from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company's revenues climbed by 29% to $4.57 billion, also beating our consensus estimate.Investors reacted poorly to Applied Materials third-quarter guidance. The company now expects to post adjusted earnings in the range of $1.13 to $1.21 per share, which, at the time, came in at the low end of our Zacks estimate of $1.14 per share. The firm also called for revenues to fall between $4.33 billion and $4.53 billion, which came in line with our $4.45 billion estimate.Applied Materials' updated Q3 guidance is not devastatingly low. And the recent stock price dip, coupled with strong overall growth projections has made AMAT stock look rather attractive.Shares of Applied Materials are up roughly 11.7% over the last year, while the \"Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication\" industry has surged nearly 30%. Year to date, AMAT stock has dipped 1.8% against its industry's average climb of 8.6%. Applied Materials stock closed Monday at $50.00 per share or almost 20% below its 52-week high of $62.40 per share.With that said, AMAT stock is cheap at the moment based on its price alone, and also has a long way to go before it must face the added burden of having to jump into a new range. Furthermore, if we go back farther, investors will see that Applied Materials stock is on a stellar run.Applied Materials stock has traded as high as 17.4X over the past two years, with its median resting at 13.7X. The company is also currently trading almost directly in line with its two-year low, which it touched briefly last week. Over the last five years, the lowest AMAT stock has ever traded at was 10.6X forward 12-months earnings estimates-a figure it hit in late September of 2015.Therefore, looking back over the last several years, investors can say with some degree of confidence that AMAT stock is attractive at its current valuation, if not downright cheap.And a major reason that Applied Materials stock currently presents investors great value, on top of its recently declining stock price, is the company's earnings outlook. Applied Materials is projected to see its adjusted earnings surge by nearly 35% this quarter, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by nearly 41%.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["runswick Corporation (  ) will begin trading ex-dividend on May 21, 2018.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoExpected Earnings Release: 04/18/2018, PremarketAvg.

This Silicon Valley giant is one of the top suppliers of equipment to the global semiconductor business, and with the rise in demand for high-end chips throughout the world, AMAT has seen its client activity pick up significantly.In its most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year.It is not often that companies with AMAT's size and legacy see such rapid expansion. And investors have certainly noticed this growth, sending the stock soaring more than 50% over the past year. Still, there appears to be plenty of room left for Applied to run higher.One catalyst for a continued surge could be the company's improving outlook. Within the past 60 days, we have seen seven positive revisions for AMAT's full-year earnings estimates, bringing our Zacks Consensus Estimate a whopping 31 cents higher over that timeframe. We now expect to see the company witness full-year earnings growth of 35%.Even with the stock's recent surge, AMAT's positive outlook makes its forward-looking guidance extremely attractive for value investors. What's more, the stock is also trading at a discount to its most comparable peers.Here's Applied's Forward P/E trend compared to that of its peer group:AMAT's peer group includes ASML Holding  , Lam Research  , KLA-Tencor  , and Advanced Energy Industries  . Not all of these companies are direct competitors to AMAT, but they do function as suppliers to semiconductor manufacturers. Comparing AMAT to these stocks helps us show how investors tend to value this niche market.When we break it down like this, we can really see that AMAT is an interesting value option. However, we should note that the stock is only sporting a \"C\" grade for Value in our Style Scores system. In contrast to its attractive P/E, AMAT's P/S of 4.1 is less appealing than the broader market. Applied might also raise eyebrows from a cash-flow perspective, as it is only generating about $3.69 in cash per share right now-about 40% less than its industry's average.Still, the foundation of AMAT's is only getting stronger right now, and the stock's Forward P/E implies that investors are getting a great price for that strength.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

However, the figure came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 cent. Increase in total operating expenses, on account of rise in selling, general and administrative, as well as research and development costs, put pressure on the bottom line.The company reported a GAAP loss of 8 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2017, which is in sharp contrast to earnings of 5 cents per share reported in the prior-year quarter.For full-year 2017, 3D Systems incurred an adjusted loss of 2 cents per share against adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share in 2016.The 3D printer maker reported revenues of $177.3 million in the quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6.9%.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hares of  rallied to a new 52-week high of $61.76, eventually closing a tad bit lower at $61.61 on Mar 9.The momentum can be attributed to the company's impressive first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.

This Silicon Valley giant is one of the top suppliers of equipment to the global semiconductor business, and with the rise in demand for high-end chips throughout the world, AMAT has seen its client activity pick up significantly.In its most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year.It is not often that companies with AMAT's size and legacy see such rapid expansion. And investors have certainly noticed this growth, sending the stock soaring more than 60% over the past year. Still, there appears to be plenty of room left for Applied to run higher.One catalyst for a continued surge could be the company's improving outlook. Within the past 60 days, we have seen seven positive revisions for AMAT's full-year earnings estimates, bringing our Zacks Consensus Estimate a whopping 31 cents higher over that timeframe. We now expect to see the company witness full-year earnings growth of 35%.Even with the stock's recent surge, AMAT's positive outlook makes its forward-looking guidance extremely attractive for value investors. What's more, the stock is also trading at a discount to its most comparable peers.Here's Applied's Forward P/E trend compared to that of its peer group:AMAT's peer group includes ASML Holding  , Lam Research  , KLA-Tencor  , and Advanced Energy Industries  . Not all of these companies are direct competitors to AMAT, but they do function as suppliers to semiconductor manufacturers. Comparing AMAT to these stocks helps us show how investors tend to value this niche market.When we break it down like this, we can really see that AMAT is an interesting value option. However, we should note that the stock is only sporting a \"C\" grade for Value in our Style Scores system. In contrast to its attractive P/E, AMAT's P/S of 3.9 is less appealing than the broader market. Applied might also raise eyebrows from a cash-flow perspective, as it is only generating about $3.69 in cash per share right now-about 40% less than its industry's average.Still, the foundation of AMAT's is only getting stronger right now, and the stock's Forward P/E implies that investors are getting a great price for that strength.The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ibbey, Inc.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ennant Company (  ) will begin trading ex-dividend on February 27, 2018.

Traders are looking for cues to an overall direction after a swift week-long correction hit.The history of corrections shows: There is usually more price action pain before any enduring gain.We have seen the \"It's Still a Bull Market\" optimists \"buy the dip.\" That may mean traders have to grind prices down to wring out that excess optimism before stock markets move higher\u2026 in an  manner. Traders in corrections usually need to see capitulation. We haven't seen that - at all.For this Global Week Ahead, let's look into Reuters' five biggest world market themes.Whether world markets settle down now - or suffer a fresh volatility shockwave - may be determined by this week's consumer and producer price inflation readings in the United States.They are expected to show U.S. consumer prices rising at the +2.1% year-on-year rate they grew at in December. But any stronger and it would feed bets on faster Fed rate hikes, potentially triggering another dump in stocks and bonds. Don't forget: this whole blowout whipped up after Feb 2nd U.S. jobs data showed the strongest year-on-year wage growth since 2009.If U.S. inflation does accelerate, markets could see Treasury yields get above the 3.0% level that several investment banks had set as their year-end target.U.S. inflation is not the only game in town, though. British January data (due Tuesday) will be in focus after the Bank of England's recent hawkish comments. Finally, we get German numbers (Wednesday). These should show price growth still subdued, though wage deals and a new coalition government will likely lift future inflation.Market volatility is back. With a bang. After months anchored at historically low levels, U.S. stock market volatility exploded last week. The rise in the VIX index on Tuesday was the biggest in its history.Trillions of dollars were wiped off of global equity market cap and, according to Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's near -10% drawdown was steeper and faster than the historical average of all corrections and bear markets going back to the Second World War.Have we now moved to a \"high vol\" regime from a \"low vol\" regime, and will equity volatility serious infect other markets? Investors will be seeking clues.Above 30, the VIX is on track for its highest weekly close in over six years. Investors will want to see that come down to 20 or lower, while so far at least, contagion to FX, rates and credit markets has been limited. That may change if the VIX stays where it is.Another heavy week coming up on the European earnings front and with the recent volume jitters wiping 0.8 trillion euros from the region's stocks, company updates are going to be key if there is any chance of the bulls coming back.So, will the results stem a downward trend in forecasts? Recent weeks have seen analysts' predictions for fourth-quarter STOXX 600 earnings downgraded to 11%, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, from 18 percent a few weeks ago.What's more, the earnings \"beats\" in Europe are currently 48.2% - compare that to 78% for the S&P 500 index. In Europe, \"beat\" levels in an average quarter run at 50%.Companies due to report this week include:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  and  .One saving grace is that recent selloff has cheapened share valuations. So, in theory at least, that takes some pressure off those that fall short of expectations. In the end, though, it might just be the moves of the might S&P 500 and Dow across the pond that have the most influence on proceedings.It's a tradition Chinese authorities are keeping alive even at a time when they are cracking down heavily to try and wean the economy off debt: keeping the money markets amply supplied and stable during the week-long Chinese new year holidays.Even though the People's Bank of China has refrained from injecting cash through money market operations for nearly two weeks, repo rates are soft and interbank funding has been smooth.It is expected to stay that way next week even as consumers and companies withdraw huge amounts of cash to spend and distribute over Chinese New Year - and banks fund their books for the Feb 15 - 21 holiday week.That is partly because of some longer tenor repos the central bank did at the beginning of the year and a generous cut made to some banks' cash reserve ratios which has given them more room to play with.Longer-term Chinese government bond yields are down too since January, and haven't kept pace with the rise in yields elsewhere in the Western world. Analysts suspect that is deliberate from Beijing, to keep Chinese markets insulated from a global bout of monetary tightening.Red packets are traditionally given at Chinese New Year to symbolize good luck and ward off evil spirits. This could be the PBOC's gift.Emerging market shares may have shared the pain, but bonds and currencies have outperformed for the most past during the global February freak-out, leaving investors wondering how long this traditional volatile asset class can keep it up.EM dollar debt spreads - the premiums investors demand to hold these bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries - have been rising but not earthshaking, and they are still lower on average than at any point in 2015, 2016 and 2017.That is probably due to the sleepy dollar as much as anything, but if it gets shaken awake or global markets take another serious lurch, the resistance could be broken.One of the long-running EM issues - Jacob Zuma's departure from South Africa's Presidency could also come to a head, while another hotspot, Turkey, will publish its latest inflation numbers. It has been rising fast and the central bank wants it down. The catch is the government doesn't want interest rates to go up.(1) Boeing  : When one looks into the rise in the DJIA, a lot is attributed to this 198 billion market-cap stock.

Semiconductor stocks were battered by the recent market sell-off, but with several interesting trends like the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence on the rise, it is still an exciting time to be investing in this corner of the technology sector.While tech behemoths like Microsoft and Apple may hog all the headlines, it has really been the companies powering their technologies-the semiconductor manufacturers-that have been garnering the attention of Wall Street.Indeed, as our \"  \" sector has gained nearly 19.3% over the past year, semiconductor companies have been a driving factor behind its growth. The aforementioned emerging tech trends have created new consumer demand, and the semiconductor makers are delivering.Luckily, the proven Zacks stock picking methods are effective across all industries.

That leaves MU with very attractive valuation metrics right now.

More recently, analyst sentiment has improved, lifting our consensus estimate for the company's full-year earnings by nearly $1.00 within the past 60 days.The stock is currently trading at about 25x forward earnings, meaning that is not the cheapest option in this bunch.

The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business (down 6%). Decline in recurring revenue streams, partially mitigated by solid performance of the new SendPro C-Series product proved to be a drag on the North American Mailing business. In addition, lower equipment sales had an adverse impact on the International Mailing Business. (\"EBS\") revenues increased 9.9% year over year to $255.9 million. Decent performance form Presort Services (up 8%) and the Enterprise business (up 10%) drove top-line growth of this segment. Higher equipment sales driven by higher print and sorter equipment placements bolstered performance of the production mail business. reported a whopping 86% year-over-year growth in sales to $351.6 million, on the back of strong Global e-commerce (up 169%). Impressive performance in both cross border retail and marketplace volumes along with domestic shipping acted as tailwinds for the Global e-commerce business.Notably, revenues in the Global e-commerce business included revenues from Newgistics. However, soft performance from the Software Solutions business(down 3%)due tolower license and service revenues partially offset top-line growth of this segment Exiting the quarter on Dec 31, 2017, free cash flow was $145.5 million compared with $164.2 million as of Dec 31, 2016.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,009 million compared with $764.5 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016.

Moreover, the company continues to enhance and optimize new enterprise business platform to boost profitability which bodes well, going forward.Further, the Global Ecommerce business continues to be one of the strongest catalysts of the company.

The stock was a standout performer in 2017, up 62% compared with a 19.4% gain for the S&P 500. After a period of soft sales in 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, sales growth has accelerated for two quarters, from 13% to 33%.The online broker was trading tightly near the  after an impressive breakout in late July over a 39.78 buy point. It's a possible candidate for a call-option trade due to support at the 10-week line, although the stock was borderline extended late in the week.IBD's option strategy is a way to minimize risk around earnings. Rather than buy a stock outright ahead of earnings and run the risk of getting hurt by a bearish gap down in price, a call-option contract allows you to participate in a stock's advance post-earnings without risking a lot of capital. Ideally on a bullish earnings report, you can exercise the option, take control of the shares and hold them for an extended advance.Remember that call options should only be used with technically healthy stocks that are near buy points. Extended stocks too far past proper buy points should be avoided. Call options are bullish bets on a stock; put options are bearish bets.Let's see what a call-option trade recently looked like for Interactive Brokers. When shares were trading around 62.25, a monthly call option with an out-of-the-money strike price of 65 was selling for around 0.45, offering a trade with paltry downside risk of less than 1% (0.45/62.25). Keep in mind that the stock would have to rally over 65.45 just for the trade to start making money.In the above scenario, the contract gave the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of Interactive Brokers at 65 for a cost of 45 bucks, excluding commission. The maximum amount that could be lost on this trade was $45, the amount paid for the contract.While slightly out-of-the-money strike prices should be targeted, where the strike price is just above the underlying stock price, sometimes in-the-money strikes can be OK. In this case, the 60 strike price offered a pricey premium of $2.80, presenting a trade with elevated downside risk of 4.5%. Always look for trades with downside risk of 4% or less.Interactive Brokers is a good example of how option strike prices can, at times, be too far apart for a trade to makes sense. That's why in-the-money strike prices are OK, so long as the premium is reasonably priced. Software leader  (  ) reports Thursday after the close. It's near highs as it works on a cup-shaped base with a 53.55 entry, although it could try to form a handle that would give an earlier entry.Atlassian's situation is like Interactive Brokers' due to strike prices that are spread out. When shares were trading around 51.75, a slightly out-of-the-money monthly call option with a 55 strike price (Jan. 19 expiration) came with a premium of around $1.25, offering a trade with manageable downside risk of 2.4%. But again, Atlassian would have to rally over 56.25 for the trade to start making money, a potentially tall order.Chip-equipment firm  (  ) plans to report Wednesday before the open. Leadership is broad in the group, which includes other top-rated names like  (  ) and  (  ), although both names are struggling at their 50-day moving averages after signs of institutional selling started to appear in late November.In the latest week,  (DAL) offered up a tempting trade ahead of its earnings report Thursday before the open. Late Wednesday, when shares were trading around 55.50, a weekly call option with a 56 strike price (Jan. 12 expiration) came with a 0.75 premium, offering a trade with limited downside risk of 1.4%.

Shares of the company have gained approximately 46.2% compared with the  's growth of nearly 45.8% in the same time period.GoDaddy has a well-diversified product portfolio, which will continue to drive its revenue base. The most important among these is the growing demand for security products. Given that cybercrime is increasingly becoming a concern, GoDaddy has been continuously investing in security and compliance technology.Recently, the company announced the expansion of its security product portfolio with the launch of GoDaddy Website Security. Also, GoDaddy's new mobile-optimized website builder, GoCentral, has been gaining momentum and will be contributing to the company's top-line growth.GoDaddy's focus on international expansion keeps the growth prospects high. The company has more than 5 million customers outside of the United States, notably Canada, India and the United Kingdom. In 2016, GoDaddy derived approximately 28% of the total bookings from international sales compared with 25% and 26% in 2014 and 2015, respectively.In order to continue expanding its international presence, the company is investing in technology, marketing programs and customer care teams. Moreover, the acquisition of HEG will help the company in increasing its customer base by more than 40%, thus further expanding its international business.GoDaddy is quite active on the acquisition front. Last year, the company completed the acquisition of Host Europe Group (\"HEG\"), a European web hosting provider, for \u20ac1.69 billion (US$1.79 billion). The deal will strengthen GoDaddy's foothold in the European market. In 2016, the company acquired Serbia-based WordPress site management tool maker, ManageWP.

The stock has just started to look up in the past few months, with the company enjoying several robust growth catalysts and a favorable macroeconomic environment.The ViaSat-2, a project which the company started back in May 2013, is set to enter service next month. ViaSat's earnings have been hurt in recent times by the escalating research and development costs related to ViaSat-2 and ViaSat-3, and ramped-up expenses, ahead of offering subscribers service with its new high-speed satellite.Nevertheless, with ViaSat-2 set to commercialize soon, the pressure on earnings should lessen somewhat. Perhaps investors are optimistic on the upcoming earnings as well, as shares of the company have appreciated 17.7% over the past six months, ahead of the  's average gain of 5.5%.ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1 and has immense prospects.The above-mentioned service is anticipated to radically accelerate speeds, cut costs and expand the reach of broadband services across North America, Central America, the Caribbean, and a portion of northern South America as well. The ViaSat-2 satellite system is also anticipated to broaden its footprint in order to cover the primary aeronautical and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean between Europe and North America.Separately, ViaSat's Government Systems business has been outstanding in recent times and is gradually gaining even greater momentum. The segment's growth is being driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical data-link products, government mobility platforms, and secure networking products.In-flight connectivity is also sustaining robust growth momentum and remains another potential tailwind for ViaSat. The company also projects sound growth in in-flight connectivity, with a significant increase in shipments and installations projected early next fiscal. It anticipates considerable greater growth early in fiscal 2018. In fact, it expects to witness a significant ramp with Gen-2 installs later this fiscal, particularly on American Airlines and Qantas. The Commercial Air business will likely prove to be a key profit driver in the quarters to come.And this is not all. What investors should be most excited about are the ViaSat-3 satellites. The company asserted that these satellites are expected to individually boast as much bandwidth as all of the satellites currently in the world, combined.ViaSat expects to roll out three of these satellites next year, two for the Americas and one for Asia. This would triple the world's satellite capacity, per ViaSat's numbers. That would also mean that ViaSat would own roughly 75% of the world's bandwidth. And none of the company's competitors are anywhere near launching a satellite of that ability at present.It seems that ViaSat is on its way toward dominance in the satellite-data market, and eventually the huge costs of building and maintaining satellites will smoothen out.Thus, it may be a good time to reflect on the growth drivers of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader space include Comtech Telecommunications Corp.  , iRobot Corporation  and ASML Holding N.V.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Splendid growth in revenues drove strong year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA (up 30% year over year).Investors seem to be optimistic on the company as of now, as its shares have appreciated 17.7% over the past six months, ahead of the  's average gain of 5.5%.In recent quarters, ViaSat's earnings have suffered quite a lot due to R&D expenses, but per the company, total R&D investments look set to peak this fiscal year. The primary drivers are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, and commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs and line-fit activity. This indicates that we can see more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters. Also, the costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities and preparations for the large-scale in-flight Wi-Fi ramp are estimated to further burden the bottom line.However, strong backlog levels, bright prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight, and government markets are likely to accelerate the company's growth momentum.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of SMH, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SMH's low point in its 52 week range is $71.32 per share, with $105.83 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $98.89. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["tanley Black & Decker, Inc.

Further, it increased 35.7% sequentially but decreased 3.4% year over year.Moreover, revenues decreased 3.2% year over year but increased 17.9% sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily driven by major mobile product launches and a healthy demand environment. The company also witnessed strength in automotive, IoT and high-performance computing, resulting in cryptocurrency mining. However, customers' continued inventory management impacted third-quarter revenues.Notably, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor have returned approximately 42.9% year to date, underperforming the  's gain of 44.4%.North America accounted for 64% of total revenues. Asia Pacific, China, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and Japan accounted for 10%, 11%, 8%, and 7% of total revenues, respectively.By application, Communication, Computer, Consumer and Industrial/Standard increased 10%, 46%, 15% and 13%, respectively.By technology, 10-nanometer (nm) process technology contributed 10% of total wafer revenues. The combined 16/20-nm contribution was 24% of total wafer revenues.Advanced technologies (28-nm and below) accounted for 57% of total wafer revenues. The company has increased 28-nm capacity to meet customer demand.Management noted that the 7-nm product (including N7 and N7+ products) has gained significant traction within a short span of receiving technology qualification. Taiwan Semi expects to have more than 50 new N7 product tape-outs by the end of 2018. So far, N7 yield is wellahead of the company's plan. Moreover, it continues to expect 10-nm to contribute to about 10% of wafer revenues this year.Taiwan Semi expects to have a very fast and smooth N7 ramp-up in 2018, with its yield better than the 16-nm. Management also noted that N7+ would be the most advanced foundry process in 2018. It anticipates offering EUV in second-half 2018 on N7+ and then full insertion in first-quarter 2019.Per the press release, gross margin was 49.9%, down 90 basis points (bps) sequentially and 80 bps year over year. The decrease was due to margin dilution from higher 10nm contribution, partially offset by a higher level of capacity utilization.Operating margin was 38.9%, flat sequentially but down 190 bps year over year.For fourth-quarter 2017, Taiwan Semi expects revenues to be in the range of $9.10-$9.20 billion. The guidance implies 10.0% sequential growth in revenues, driven by fast increase in the availability of 10-nm mobile customer products, partially offset by continuous inventory adjustments.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 48.0% and 50.0%, while operating margin is expected to be in the range of 37- 39%.Currently, Taiwan Semiconductorcarries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ifetime Brands, Inc.

Therefore, if you haven't taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it's time you add the stock to your portfolio.The company has performed well so far this year and has the potential to carry on the momentum in the near term.Here are a few reasons why the stock is worth a buy.A look at the company's price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse year to date. On Semiconductor has gained 50.7%, significantly outperforming the  's gain of 24.0%.On Semiconductor currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the stock appears to be a convincing investment proposition at the moment.For the current year, eight estimates have moved north over the past 90 days against no southward revisions, reflecting analysts' confidence in the company. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 6.1%.The company's Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings of $1.39 reflects year-over-year growth of 75.95%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 13.73% growth in 2018. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 18.1%.On Semiconductor is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a wide range of discrete and embedded semiconductor components.Notably, the company's acquisition of Fairchild, which was completed on Sep 2016, has aided top-line growth. Management expects to witness further growth in Fairchild's revenue contribution in the near term, driven by the company's strong foothold in the power semiconductor market post the acquisition.Moreover, the Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) is growing at a steady pace and is expected to reach $42.4 billion by 2021, per MarketsandMarkets. We believe the accelerated growth of the ADAS market has increased the adoption rate of the related applications provided by On Semiconductor, thereby improving its growth opportunity in the automotive market.Further improving end markets, less customer and product concentration have aided the company's impressive performance. Growing demand for the company's CMOS image sensor is also a key catalyst. | Other top-ranked in the broader technology sector are Applied Materials, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and NVIDIA Corp.  and ASML Holding N.V.  , holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The market undervalues these companies and prices them as if their profits are going to significantly decline. The market is missing the structural shifts that will drive profit growth via increased demand and less cyclicality going forward.We recommended four stocks to investors in that initial report. Today we are digging deeper into one of those stocks: KLA-Tencor (  ), the most profitable company in the industry and this week's Long Idea.KLAC operates in the semiconductor process control segment, which is a subset of the semiconductor equipment sector. The company controls  or nearly five times its closest competitor.It's almost impossible to make a case against KLAC based on its current profitability. We analyzed the company's 10-K for fiscal year 2017 (which ran through June 30) on Monday, and the results were impressive. The company has a 54% return on invested capital (  ), which puts in the top 2% of all the companies we cover, and it grew revenue by 17% in 2017.Investors are clearly discounting KLAC's impressive 2017 due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry. Figure 1 shows that this fear has some merit but is likely exaggerated. KLAC's after-tax profits (  ) and margins have been cyclical, but have consistently trended upwards over the past 20 years.Since 2007, a major cyclical peak, KLAC's NOPAT has increased by 7% compounded annually while its NOPAT margin has expanded from 25% in 2007 to 37% over the last 12 months. Over the last five years, KLAC has generated a cumulative $3.7 billion (26% of market cap) in  . Going forward, analysts expect the semiconductor process control market to grow by 11% compounded annually until 2020. No matter where we are in the cycle, the long-term growth trend for KLAC looks strong.In addition to the long-term growth trend, there have been structural shifts in the semiconductor industry over the past few years that should make cycles less volatile going forward. We covered these changes in our original report, but we'll recap them briefly here:This last point is especially crucial for KLAC and other process control management companies. As computers take on more complicated and crucial tasks, the tolerance for error goes to near zero. If a chip in your cellphone malfunctions, that's an inconvenience. If a chip in your car malfunctions, it could cause a fatal accident. That means automotive semiconductors require more sophisticated and rigorous testing, increasing demand for KLAC.As discussed above, KLAC has a dominant market share in the process control industry, and there's nothing to suggest it will lose that position going forward. On top of its market share advantage, KLAC dominates its competitors, which include Nova Measuring Instruments (  ), Applied Materials (  ), and ASML Holdings (  ) in terms of ROIC and NOPAT margin, per Figure 2.Importantly, KLAC's impressive margins don't come at the expense of investing in its future. The company spends ~15% of revenue on research and development, which is right around the industry average.KLAC's superior ROIC and margins should give the company the ability to withstand pricing pressure if competitors try to cut into its market share. Meanwhile, the company's strong free cash flow and $2.9 billion in excess cash give it the resources to invest in new production and strategic acquisitions to maintain its industry position.Aside from the cyclical nature of the industry discussed above, it's hard to find a strong bear case for KLAC. Most major threats to the business would require an unforeseen technological development, such as chipmakers running up against a wall in their efforts to make smaller and more complex chips, or some drastic change to the semiconductor manufacturing process.Aside from these unforeseeable developments, KLAC acknowledges one of the biggest risks in the \"Risk Factors\" section of its 2017 10-K. Among the listed risks is:In short, if one of the companies that provides equipment used in the manufacture and assembly of semiconductors could integrate those products with some of the testing and measuring products that compete with KLAC, that bundle could draw customers away.Lam Research (  ) tried to acquire KLAC last year in a combination that could have led to such integrated products, but the deal was  . Given the antitrust ruling, a firm would have to invest significantly to develop the measuring products in house. At the moment, this risk remains hypothetical, but investors should continue to watch developments in this area.KLAC had been on a year-long tear until it peaked at ~$110/share on June 8. Since then, the stock has pulled back by ~10%, creating a buying opportunity. Investors have a chance to snap up this great company at a bargain price. In fact, the stock is cheap by almost any metric. Its price to economic book value (  ) of 0.8 implies that the market expects a permanent 20% decline in NOPAT. The company also looks cheap on conventional valuation metrics, as it has a P/E of just 17x.As we wrote in our original report, KLAC is valued similarly to its peers in the semiconductor equipment sector based on its ROIC. However, the stock is  , and Figure 3 shows that it trades at a discount to the tech sector as well. ROIC explains 46% of the difference in valuations for companies in the tech sector, and KLAC's enterprise value divided by  (a cleaner version of price to book) is roughly half of what it should be based on the regression analysis below.According to Figure 3, if the market valued KLAC's cash flows on par with the rest of the tech sector, it would have an enterprise value divided by invested capital of 13.95. This valuation would equate to a stock price of $172/share, 74% above its current valuation.As optimistic as that valuation may sound, our DCF model reaffirms $172/share as a plausible valuation for the stock. In order to justify a valuation of $172/share, KLAC must  . As mentioned above, KLAC grew NOPAT by 7% compounded annually over the past decade. Even if investors expect a slowdown in growth, this stock has significant upside.Over the past 12 months, KLAC insiders have acquired 384,000 shares and sold 252,000 for a net addition of 133,000 shares (40% of executive compensation at KLAC comes from short-term cash bonuses tied to operating margin, and 25% comes from long-term share awards tied to free-cash flow margin. These are reasonable metrics as they encourage cost control and discourage wasteful investments. We especially like the fact that KLAC's operating margin calculation still includes stock compensation expense, so executives can't exclude their own compensation when calculating their bonuses.Nonetheless, the company would benefit from tying at least a part of executive compensation to ROIC, as improving ROIC is  . Operating margin is important, but so is capital turnover. Tying long-term bonuses only to free cash flow could at times discourage the investment necessary to maintain market share and grow the business. Fortunately, the lack of focus on ROIC has not led to executives getting paid while destroying shareholder value. Since 2007, economic earnings have grown from $445 million to $907 million in 2017.Even with its impressive profit growth, KLAC has been able to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. The stock currently has a dividend yield of 2.3%.Due to the uncertainty over the LRCX acquisition, KLAC only repurchased $25 million of stock in 2017, but it repurchased $182 million worth of shares in 2016 and $609 million in 2015. Under its current authorization, KLAC can repurchase up to 5.7 million shares, which at current prices would equate to $521 million.If KLAC were to average 2016 and 2015 repurchase activity ($393 million), the firm's existing authorization would last just over one year. A repurchase of this size is 2.5% of the current market cap. When combined, KLAC's possible 2.5% repurchase yield and 2.3% dividend yield offer investors a total potential yield of 4.8%. These buybacks and dividends should provide some support to cushion any further decline in the stock price.Despite the recent pullback in the stock, there looks to be plenty of positive news that could boost shares in the near future. KLAC ended 2017 with a record backlog of $1.8 billion and revised its forecast for the next six months upward by nearly 20%. This indicates strong demand for the company's products. In particular, the company expects to double its Chinese business during calendar year 2017. News for the semiconductor industry overall has been bullish as well, with Q2 semiconductor sales up 24% year over year to  .

But in 2016, the shares started widening this lead, a trend that has continued through 2017.The company's technological prowess is a given, which can generate solid growth. But given the sharp rise in prices (evident in the charts above), it makes sense to see if the shares are overvalued.One thing to keep in mind in this respect is the general valuation of shares. The charts below illustrate that both the S&P 500 and the industry are trading close to their respective 52-week highs. So LRCX trading in the same range isn't an anomaly.The forward 12 months price-to-earnings ratio for LRCX is currently 13.04 compared to the S&P 500 average of 18.24 and the X industry average of 16.91. Highs and lows are also lower. The median P/E is also lower at 13.73. Moreover, the trend lines indicate that LRCX is clearly undervalued both with respect to the S&P 500 and the industry.The trailing 12 months price to sales ratio tells a slightly different story. The P/S ratio for LRCX is currently 3.86, which is higher than the S&P 500's 3.15 but much lower than the X industry's 6.25. The median of 3.34 is slightly ahead of the S&P 500's 3.04 but well below the industry's 5.78. The highs and lows also indicate that LRCX is overvalued with respect to the S&P 500 but undervalued with respect to the industry.Lam Research's closest competitor is Applied Materials  so let's consider that first. Historically, AMAT has traded well below its 52-week high, but the current level of demand has changed that. So it is also trading at around its 52-week high. AMAT's current P/E is lower than LRCX but the median is same. Both the high of 16.50 and the low of 12.37 exceed Lam's. This indicates a similar valuation for the two peers.LRCX also compares favorably with ASML Holding NV  , another semiconductor equipment maker. ASML, which is also trading very close to its 52-week high, has a current P/E of 26.68 and median P/E of 26.63, both of which are significantly higher than LRCX. The price to sales ratio tells a similar tale.From the above, we can conclude that Lam Research, which carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is undervalued. You can see the  . Applied Materials also has a Zacks Rank #1 while ASML is ranked #2 (Buy).It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

And we all look at them eventually.Whether you're a small individual investor or a large institutional portfolio manager (or somewhere in between), who doesn't like it when a stock gets an upgraded rating or sees a new analyst jumping in with coverage? We all do. (Although I should note that, in general, the change in the average broker recommendation is a better indicator than the actual recommendation itself.)Anyway, today I want to talk about companies that receive new analyst coverage.One of the things that generates analyst coverage is investor interest. How else can you explain the increased analyst coverage for Facebook (a company that's only been public for 2 1/2 yrs.) in comparison to a company like GE (public for more than 40 yrs.)?And as new coverage is initiated, it becomes more visible, which in turn means potentially more demand (read higher prices).This is often the case because analysts almost always initiate coverage with a positive recommendation. (Why write a research report on a company not widely followed only to say it stinks?)And when it comes to companies with little to no analyst coverage, that one new recommendation can sometimes give portfolio managers the validation they need to build a position. (And the more money they can invest, the more they can potentially influence prices.)The best way to use this information is to look for companies with analyst coverage that has increased over the last 4 weeks.Simply look at the number of analyst recommendations now in comparison to the number of analyst recommendations 4 weeks ago. An increase in coverage is bullish whereas a decrease in coverage is bearish.It's typically more bullish if the increase went from none to one or if the coverage was minimal to begin with. (Going from 25 to 26 isn't going to have the same impact because that 26th analyst isn't discovering something 'new'.) But increased coverage is better than decreased coverage -- assuming the coverage is positive of course.Here's a screen to try:\u2022 (This shows stocks where new coverage has recently been added.)\u2022 (By 'less than', I mean 'better than' four weeks ago.)\u2022 And I'm applying all of the above parameters to stocks with  (most money managers won't even look at a stock under $5) and  (if there's not enough volume, even individual investors won't want it).Here are 5 stocks from this week's screen:(Nasdaq:  -  ) LivaNova(from 2 analysts four weeks ago to 5)(NYSE:  -  ) Chatham Lodging Trust(from 3 analysts four weeks ago to 5)(Nasdaq:  -  ) ASML Holding(from 6 analysts four weeks ago to 8)(NYSE:  -  ) Heico, Corp.(from 7 analysts four weeks ago to 9)(Nasdaq:  -  ) Etsy, Inc.(from 8 analysts four weeks ago to 10)Many screeners won't let you search for the number of analysts covering a stock, let alone comparing the amount of coverage they had weeks or even months ago.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 4 different analyst targets contributing to that average for ASML Holding NV, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $135.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $182.00. The standard deviation is $19.399.But the whole reason to look at the  ASML price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ASML crossing above that average target price of $158.50/share, investors in ASML have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $158.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover ASML Holding NV:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["esa Laboratories, Inc.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ASML options chain for the new April 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $145.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $145.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $137.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ASML, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $152.83/share today.Because the $145.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of ASML stock at the current price level of $152.83/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $155.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.42% if the stock gets called away at the April 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ASML shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for ASML Holding NV, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ASML's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $155.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ne stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is  .

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because ASML Holding is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ASML in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.10 per share for ASML, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ASML, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 10% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that ASML has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 5 different analyst targets contributing to that average for ASML Holding NV, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $110.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $182.00. The standard deviation is $29.063.But the whole reason to look at the  ASML price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["LIR Systems, Inc.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 186 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ASML options chain for the new December 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $118.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ASML, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $126.81/share today.Because the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of ASML stock at the current price level of $126.81/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $130.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.04% if the stock gets called away at the December 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ASML shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for ASML Holding NV, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ASML's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $130.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $130.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

In the semiconductor fabrication equipment space where it competes, the company's focus on strong research and development has put Applied Materials in a dominant position -- and there are no signs of that letting up.Image source: Getty Images.As the leading supplier of chip manufacturing equipment to companies around the world, Applied Materials has a lot of equipment design experience that its competitors simply don't have. Not only that, but the company spends a lot of money -- $1.5 billion last year -- to research and develop new equipment.The company brought in $10.8 billion in sales in fiscal 2016, which means that Applied Materials spent about 13.8% of its revenues on R&D last year. To put that into context, Applied Materials has significantly outspent two of its biggest competitors --  and  -- over the past few years,  has been more consistent in its R&D spending than either company. Here's a look at each of the companies' R&D spending over the past few years:Image source: .Image source:  .While ASML's spending came close to Applied's last year, ASML has been very inconsistent in its spending amounts over the past several years, which gives Applied Materials' consistent -- and higher -- spending the advantage. And while Lam Research grew its R&D spending consistently since 2012, it still falls well below Applied' Materials' spending.Applied Materials' ability to outspend, and with more stability, its competitors has already helped the company to keep up with two key chip trends right now: 3D NAND and fin field-effect transistors (FinFET is a more efficient design for semiconductors). According to a recent Morningstar  , \"... these segments have grown faster than the broader market in recent years and firms such as Applied Materials have directly benefited, as it can outspend smaller chip equipment firms in R&D to develop relevant solutions.\"Applied Materials has mentioned this advantage as well. CEO Gary Dickerson said on the first-quarter 2017  that the company's expansion into 3D NAND (a type of memory chip process) increased the company's total available market \"by a factor of three.\"Applied Materials' ability to invest in new chip trends and provide new equipment for its customers becomes even more evident when you consider that 40% of the its current revenue comes from products that were introduced over the past  years. The company's smart R&D spending has help Applied Materials to amass 19.1% market share in the wafer-level manufacturing equipment segment.Along with its dominance in this space, the company is also one of the leading semiconductor equipment and display suppliers in China. That's important because the country is expected to see a massive ramp-up in technology spending in 2018 and beyond.On its most recent , Dickerson said that China will be one of the key drivers for long-term growth in both its semiconductor and display segments. Between 2015 and 2017, Applied Materials increased its semiconductor revenue two times over in China, and it expects that those revenues will be \"up a significant amount\" between 2017 and 2019.Applied Materials focus on R&D spending in growing markets and its flourishing position in China's expanding semiconductor and display space are clearly giving the company an advantage over its competitors.But Applied Materials also dominates the display and semiconductor manufacturing segment because it sells equipment for nearly every step of the fabrication process. This means that it's able to develop strong relationships with its customers for many of their important equipment needs and leaves little room for competitors to nuzzle their way in. If the company continues to spend on R&D and keep up with shifting semiconductor trends, then Applied Materials's optimistic future outlook may end up becoming a reality.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is up 7.63 to 5,175.59.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because ASML Holding is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ASML in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.07 per share for ASML, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ASML, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 0.94 % heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that ASML has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see  .Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for ASML Holding, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Well, I've got good news and bad news for you.The good news: There are a small handful of companies exploring graphene technologies today, and some of them are publicly traded such that you can invest in them. But there's bad news, too: Most companies that focus their business on graphene aren't worth investing in, while those few companies that may be worth investing in don't actually do a lot of work with graphene -- at least not yet.But let's back up a minute, and first review what graphene At its most basic level, graphene is a sheet of hexagonally bonded carbon atoms (as illustrated above) just one atom thick.This is what graphene looks like at the molecular level -- the 2-dimensional molecular level. Image source: Getty Images.But let's back up a minute, and first review what graphene  At its most basic level, graphene is a sheet of hexagonally bonded carbon atoms (as illustrated above) just one atom thick.Advocates of graphene technology argue that it can be used to create materials 200 times stronger than steel, better at conducting both heat and electricity than copper, and sufficiently flexible that they can be used to form super-strength \"tubes\" for use in construction, for example. These properties have some people thinking graphene will become  , and point to the huge number of graphene patents being taken out by companies such as Samsung,  , and  as evidence of the material's potential.But how much potential is there for investors to profit from graphene stocks?It seems reasonable to me to assume that, if graphene is a big enough part of a company's business to affect its fortunes, this fact should be reflected in the company's filings with the SEC. Following that logic, I searched through SEC filings for the past couple of years, seeking out name-brand companies that mention the use of graphene in their SEC filings.Surprisingly, though, very few companies make any mention of graphene whatsoever. Oh, the SEC files are full of companies with names like \"Carbon Sciences,\" \"HK Graphene Technology,\" and \"China Carbon Graphite Group\" that sound like they  be big into graphene. But most such companies are little more than Potemkin businesses. They have no revenues, no profits, and little market capitalization to speak of. They barely exist, even on paper.What's more, those few companies that  mention graphene have little to say about it. Here are a few of the more substantial companies that appear in the SEC filings and are doing work related to graphene.Nokia is one of several high-tech companies that have made the news in recent years for  . Nokia also appears to be putting this patent knowledge into practice. In a 2015  , Nokia reported that \"Nokia Technologies developed a proof-of-concept flexible printed graphene circuit, demonstrating continued progress solving many of the technical challenges related to the practical application of the ultra-thin, transparent, flexible material.\"Germany-based Aixtron has even more to say about graphene. In one recent  with the SEC, it wrote: \"One focus of AIXTRON's [research] involves researching processes and systems technology for the deposition of optically active 2D semiconductor materials such as ... graphene ... AIXTRON offers a Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Phase Deposition ('PECVD') technology ... employed for the deposition of complex Carbon Nanostructures (Carbon Nanotubes, Nanowires or Graphene).\"Aixtron's primary business is selling equipment that semiconductor manufacturers use to produce computer chips, LEDs, and similar high-tech stuff. As such, it behooves Aixtron to perform R&D into how to manufacture graphene products at scale. But even so, Aixtron notes that the \"development of applications using Carbon Nanostructures (Carbon Nanotubes, Carbon Nanowires, Graphene) [will] possibly have a positive effect on future business,\" but only over the \"mid- to long-term.\"Netherlands-based ASML is in a similar line of business to Aixtron's, but is even less enthusiastic about graphene's potential to disrupt the semiconductor industry. In a filing describing its  , ASML noted that: \"with respect to graphene as a possible replacement for silicon ... even in the event graphene would be used as material, lithography will be required to be able to manufacture semiconductors.\"Shifting gears slightly, Cabot Corporation is more of a specialty chemicals and performance materials company than a dedicated electronics specialist. In a  , Cabot Corp noted that its products include \"rubber and specialty carbons ... graphenes, inkjet colorants and inks, and masterbatches and conductive compounds.\"Such language suggests that graphene may have wide-scale application in industry, but there's just one problem: That single line quoted up above is all that Cabot has to say on the subject of graphene. There's literally no further mention in the company's filing of graphene's use in its business. Clearly, graphene is not an important source of revenues to Cabot -- at least not yet.So what's the big takeaway from all of the above? Investing in graphene may have potential at some time in the future. But as Aixtron notes, graphene's potential will not be fulfilled anytime soon. It lies far off in the medium term, or even the long term.Given the dearth of companies discussing graphene these days, I fear the right question to ask is not \"how can I invest in graphene technologies?\" or \"who are the best graphene companies to invest in?\" The better question is whether, at this early date, you should even be trying to invest in graphene at all. And it seems to me that the answer to that question is: \"No.\"When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

They rarely see news-making variation quarter to quarter and the direction of their results can be predicted in advance. That's because major equipment buyers (their customers) offer capex estimates which in combination with market research data on new fabs coming to market leave little to imagination.But that just means they are suitable for longer-term calls on whether to buy or sell.A negative sentiment follows when individual memory and logic makers and specialized foundries have equipped their fabs and will only make moderate purchases to supplement existing equipment. They will try to make their fabs as efficient as possible to continue without major investment for as long as possible because building fresh capacity is extremely expensive.But things turn positive when there's good reason for customers to upgrade existing equipment either due to technology inflections like shrinking geometries, 3D NAND, etc or due to increasing demand. So that's when we need to take a look at the markets driving the demand for such technologies, whether such demand is likely to sustain and for how long.Since foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor  , logic makers like Intel  , memory makers like Samsung and Micron  are all trying to bring to market products based on new technologies and China is trying to get a number of fabs and foundries online both this year and the next, the spending environment remains positive.Add to this the fact that concepts like cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence are greatly increasing the need for computational efficiency in data centers while the concept of IoT and the resultant data that is generated is raising demand for a humongous number of chips that must be manufactured. Besides, industries that have thus far stayed away from automation and technology (mining is an example) are beginning to consider the investment to drive efficiency in operations.Unlike semiconductor makers, semiconductor equipment makers still aren't too many and it's still a handful of companies that rake in most of the revenue and profits. Because semiconductor equipment is extremely expensive to develop, this concentration of capabilities is not likely to go away any time soon.Of course, China does have a semiconductor focus, but current efforts are focused on internal production of its huge chip consumption. So it remains a buyer of equipment and will remain so for a few years.With that backdrop, let's jump to the stocks-Three semiconductor equipment companies have reported September-quarter results and there's a couple more left to round out the top five. Of the companies that reported, Lam Research  and KLA-Tencor  beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while ASML Holding  missed.Lam has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (you can see  )and VGM score \"A.\" Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved up 21.6% since it reported results last week. The March quarter estimate is up 12.0%. | KLA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and VGM score \"A.\" Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved up 10.3%. Since it reported results last week, estimates for fiscal 2017 and 2018 are up 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively. | ASML may have missed estimates and seen moderate correction in forward estimates, but the company has received a number of orders for EUV machines that will be a positive going forward. Growth can be a challenge however since EUV machines generate lower margins, so can result in a negative mix if legacy products see weaker sales.The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and VGM score \"F.\" Growth can be a challenge, however, since EUV machines generate lower margins, so can result in a negative mix.Investors should note that the Zacks Rank is a short-term recommendation covering the next 1-3 months although today's picks also look good as long-term investments.This week, Zacks researchers have named 7 other stocks that look to break out even sooner than today's Bull of the Day.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

The company raised about \u20ac750 million ($839 million) through the IPO, per a Bloomberg report.This price implies a market capitalization of about \u20ac3 billion for the 125 year old lighting division.The Dutch electronics giant sold 25% or 37.5 million of Philips Lighting shares in the float, after failing to find a buyer for the same. Shares in Philips Lighting will commence trading under the ticker \"LIGHT\" on Euronext Amsterdam from Friday. The IPO is one of the largest listings in Europe year to date.Philips first revealed its intention to offload the lighting unit in Sep 2014. The IPO brings to an end the 18-month long, unproductive search by Philips for a buyer for its lighting division.The sale marks the final step in a multi-year restructuring initiative spearheaded by CEO Frans van Houten. The IPO also ends Philips' era as a conglomerate that made everything from lightbulbs and television sets to medical scanners and coffee machines.Philips' lighting business dates back to 1891, when Frederik Philips and his son started selling carbon filament lamps. The business now covers a moribund conventional lamps operation and the fast-growing LED luminaires systems and services unit. It generated sales of about \u20ac7.4 billion last year, making it one of the world's largest lighting manufacturers.The Dutch conglomerate's decision to spin off its iconic lighting division is rooted in the low margins and limited growth prospects of the business, especially in comparison with its more lucrative and fast-growing health technology business, which competes with Siemens AG and General Electric Company  .Philips' management is confident that Philips and Philips Lighting will be better-equipped to unlock long-term growth as separately listed companies. Philips boasts an impressive record when it comes to spinning off assets. ASML Holding NV  and NXP Semiconductors NV  were both spun off from Philips in the 1990s and 2000s, and now they have a greater market value than their former parent company.Philips is committed to restructuring its entire portfolio so that it can focus its resources on the profitable health and consumer products businesses. Its healthcare business is gaining rapid momentum with the rising demand for technology that enables hospitals to analyze clinical data and allow patients to monitor their health on smartphones.However, the company has been facing tough times recently, with escalating taxes and restructuring charges burdening earnings.

Earnings per share are projected to be $1.63 (+/- 10 cents) on a share count of nearly 173 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.47 per share, so guidance was stronger than expected.Lam Research delivered mixed fiscal third quarter 2016 results with earnings outperforming our estimates but revenues lagging behind.So far, 2016 has been pretty good for the company as it continues to see strong success in the areas of device architecture, process flow and technology inflections.In the quarter just ended, Lam delivered revenues and shipments above the midpoints of the guidance. Gross margin, operating income and non-GAAP EPS were above the high-end of the guidance range.Lam Research has high hopes from KLA-Tencor Corporation  which it has acquired recently. Management expects that the combined company will contribute significantly toward sustainable growth, generating cash and creating value.Going forward, in 2016, the company sees increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. It is likely to continue as the market leader in dielectric etch as Flex F and G Series dielectrics have been extremely successful products thus far. The company anticipates strong demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market, driven by the long-term move to the cloud, storage and competition applications.However, concerns persist in the form of volatility and lower growth expectations globally, with slow but steady improvement in some developed markets balancing the weakness in certain emerging economies.The company believes that its strong position, combined with its commitment to customers and value-enhancing collaborations will help drive performance over the next several years.Other stocks worth considering in the technology sector are ASML Holding NV  and FEI Company  each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .At its  last week, the focus was on quarterly estimates, which Intel (  ) beat as usual with a little help from a stronger mix of high-ASP devices and a lower tax rate. The top line guidance wasn't too bad considering the ongoing transition in the business and the bottom line guidance was also okay after taking out one-time items.The computing pressures and weakness in mobile devices were as expected. Some analysts commented on the data center weakness, which didn't however explain the plunging share price because revenues were in line with its revised expectations.My sense is that investors are concerned about competitive pressures in mobile, IoT and data center. They are also uncertain about Intel maintaining its process lead and fear the end of Moore's Law, which says that the number of transistors per square inch in integrated circuits doubles every two years.Since all these issues are tied together, let's take a step-by-step approach to understand the situation.First we need to perhaps refresh our memory as to the benefits of Moore's Law. When more compute power is captured in less area, there are advantages for sellers/manufacturers, buyers/OEMs and end users.For manufacturers, the overall cost comes down because a larger number of chips can be fabricated in a single batch with the benefit further increasing when wafer sizes increase. Lower cost in turn makes the company more profitable and also enables it to find broader application for its chips.The buyer/OEM is also interested in this cost shrink because it's understood that the manufacturer will pass on some of the profit to it in the hopes of volume business.The end user is benefited because the increased compute power of chips improves the performance of end devices like PCs while enabling the design of sleeker, lighter mobile devices. Power-efficiency of devices also improves.Now, since we are talking about Intel, let's jump to the manufacturing side.A McKinsey report from 2013 perfectly sums up the cost angle: \"shrinking nodes from 32nm to 22nm on 300mm wafers causes fabrication costs to rise 40%, process development costs by 45% with chip design costs up 50%.\" We are now talking about a couple of shrinks ahead of this, so you can just see how costs must be accelerating.If the purpose of Moore's Law is to reduce cost while increasing functionality, chipmakers are in something of a dilemma because the benefits of cramming compute power onto a chip is increasingly lost in the rising cost of manufacturing it.That's not the end of the problem. The report further says that \"there could be a situation where cost improvements end but performance enhancements continue,\" meaning that companies would have to pay more for increased compute power. Naturally, this will limit their usage to only high-end applications in the data center. Here too, the constantly rising cost of hardware will lead companies to look for alternatives, ultimately leading to the death of Moore's Law anyway.The McKinsey report goes as far as to say that \"the industry's ability to capture value would be at risk because of the disruption of demand.\"Intel is not moving away from Moore's Law. Far from it. But it is extending its tick-tock cadence a bit to glean a little more out of its equipment.The market has been bemoaning the fact that Intel lowered 2016 capex to $9.5 billion from its previously estimated $10 billion, reading weaker demand and a loss of process lead into these numbers. The fact that Taiwan Semiconductor (  ) management stated on its  that it would ramp up 10nm production this year and grow volumes in 2017 added fuel to this fire because Intel isn't expected to ramp up 10nm production until the second half of next year.Another tidbit was that 7nm is still in the distant past because Intel was planning on extending 10nm to 2020, allowing competitors to get even further ahead of it. So Intel's future started looking pretty bleak.But there's something investors probably overlooked. Intel's depreciation is estimated to drop $1.3 billion in 2016 despite the fact that its capex estimate as it stands now will increase by over $2 billion. So Intel is doing some pretty smart cost management right here.One may point out that cost-cutting alone is not the solution because if Intel doesn't remain in the process lead, its chips won't deliver the best performance, allowing competitors to eat into its high-end customer base. But this is where Altera will likely play a big role.Intel was heavily criticized for paying $16.7 billion to buy out Altera and most analysts said it overpaid. But Altera will enable hardware acceleration that will likely boost the performance of Intel silicon even before it moves to the next node. Intel had previous working experience with Altera (the two collaborated in hardware acceleration and Intel was already in a foundry relationship with it).As Intel has said repeatedly, Altera will help in both its data center and IoT businesses. In the data center, this strategy will very likely enable Intel to deliver competitive performance and greater flexibility at lower cost thus protecting its market share. While in IoT, the strategy can help it take major share.Intel has already said that Kaby Lake, its next processor architecture while remaining a 14nm chip would bring \"key performance enhancements\" to Sky Lake.As far as 7nm is concerned, there is reason to believe that Intel took delivery of some EUV equipment from ASML Holding (  ) late last year. Management has said in the past that while EUV will greatly help the 7nm shrink, Intel was working on a way to move ahead without it if it was further delayed. Intel has a 20% stake in ASML, compared to much smaller holdings by TSM and Samsung. There could also be material innovation at 7nm, but Intel isn't talking about it now.Intel appears to be doing the right thing for investors as far as manufacturing strategy is concerned.The fact that both 3D NAND and 3D XPoint are entering production this year is also positive.But this doesn't mean we should take the China market softness lightly. Intel appears to have adjusted expectations for 2016 already while maintaining its cautious stance on China. The China concerns were echoed by other semiconductor companies like TSM and Advanced Micro Devices (  ) that have reported December-quarter results.Intel shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The top line guidance wasn't too bad considering the ongoing transition in the business and the bottom line guidance was also okay after taking out one-time items.The computing pressures and weakness in mobile devices were as expected. Some analysts commented on the data center weakness, which didn't however explain the plunging share price because revenues were in line with its revised expectations.My sense is that investors are concerned about competitive pressures in mobile, IoT and data center. They are also uncertain about Intel maintaining its process lead and fear the end of Moore's Law, which says that the number of transistors per square inch in integrated circuits doubles every two years.Since all these issues are tied together, let's take a step-by-step approach to understand the situation.First we need to perhaps refresh our memory as to the benefits of Moore's Law. When more compute power is captured in less area, there are advantages for sellers/manufacturers, buyers/OEMs and end users.For manufacturers, the overall cost comes down because a larger number of chips can be fabricated in a single batch with the benefit further increasing when wafer sizes increase. Lower cost in turn makes the company more profitable and also enables it to find broader application for its chips.The buyer/OEM is also interested in this cost shrink because it's understood that the manufacturer will pass on some of the profit to it in the hopes of volume business.The end user is benefited because the increased compute power of chips improves the performance of end devices like PCs while enabling the design of sleeker, lighter mobile devices. Power-efficiency of devices also improves.Now, since we are talking about Intel, let's jump to the manufacturing side.A McKinsey report from 2013 perfectly sums up the cost angle: \"shrinking nodes from 32nm to 22nm on 300mm wafers causes fabrication costs to rise 40%, process development costs by 45% with chip design costs up 50%.\" We are now talking about a couple of shrinks ahead of this, so you can just see how costs must be accelerating.If the purpose of Moore's Law is to reduce cost while increasing functionality, chipmakers are in something of a dilemma because the benefits of cramming compute power onto a chip is increasingly lost in the rising cost of manufacturing it.That's not the end of the problem. The report further says that \"there could be a situation where cost improvements end but performance enhancements continue,\" meaning that companies would have to pay more for increased compute power. Naturally, this will limit their usage to only high-end applications in the data center. Here too, the constantly rising cost of hardware will lead companies to look for alternatives, ultimately leading to the death of Moore's Law anyway.The McKinsey report goes as far as to say that \"the industry's ability to capture value would be at risk because of the disruption of demand.\"Intel is not moving away from Moore's Law. Far from it. But it is extending its tick-tock cadence a bit to glean a little more out of its equipment.The market has been bemoaning the fact that Intel lowered 2016 capex to $9.5 billion from its previously estimated $10 billion, reading weaker demand and a loss of process lead into these numbers. The fact that Taiwan Semiconductor  management stated on its  that it would ramp up 10nm production this year and grow volumes in 2017 added fuel to this fire because Intel isn't expected to ramp up 10nm production until the second half of next year.Another tidbit was that 7nm is still in the distant past because Intel was planning on extending 10nm to 2020, allowing competitors to get even further ahead of it. So Intel's future started looking pretty bleak.But there's something investors probably overlooked. Intel's depreciation is estimated to drop $1.3 billion in 2016 despite the fact that its capex estimate as it stands now will increase by over $2 billion. So Intel is doing some pretty smart cost management right here.One may point out that cost-cutting alone is not the solution because if Intel doesn't remain in the process lead, its chips won't deliver the best performance, allowing competitors to eat into its high-end customer base. But this is where Altera will likely play a big role.Intel was heavily criticized for paying $16.7 billion to buy out Altera and most analysts said it overpaid.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is down -10.77 to 4,555.6.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 231 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ASML options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $97.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ASML, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $107.46/share today.Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of ASML stock at the current price level of $107.46/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.97% if the stock gets called away at the October 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ASML shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for ASML Holding NV, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ASML's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Even now, Intel's 2.7% dividend yield is greater than Apple's and similar to Microsoft's, and that incorporates Intel's recent share-price surge. Moreover, consistent growth in the value of its plant and equipment assets shows how Intel is reinvesting in its own growth, and that makes its balance sheet look a lot more normal than the cash-rich balance sheets of several other tech companies.Along the same lines, Intel hasn't hesitated to put cash into long-term investments. As of the third quarter of 2014, Intel had a total of $12.1 billion listed as long-term investments, and $9.2 billion considered trading asset securities.For some companies, long-term investments would largely consistent of bonds and other income-producing securities held mostly as placeholders for cash. Indeed, Intel had roughly $16.9 billion in marketable debt securities at the end of the third quarter, some of which likely qualified as short-term investments and others as long-term. But Intel also holds a substantial portion of its money in equity securities, with $6.5 billion in marketable equities and equity derivatives as of the third quarter. Almost that entire amount was invested in  , but Intel has also made other equity investments in the past, such as the stake in  that it divested last year.Long-term investments have better growth potential that in some cases can make measurable differences on a balance sheet. They also carry greater risk than other types of assets, but in some cases, that trade-off can be favorable for the company -- and Intel hopes that its expertise in identifying promising new tech companies can be an asset.Just as many companies have done lately, Intel has increased its borrowing in recent years. After having just $1.2 billion in long-term debt in 2008, Intel has systematically ramped up its leverage levels and now sports $13.2 billion, including the current portion of its long-term debt. As you can see below, the increase is noticeable, although Intel is far from the largest user of leverage in the industry. data by Much of that debt has helped Intel finance massive repurchases of stock, with the most obvious example being its buyback activity going from $1.7 billion in 2010 to $14.3 billion in 2011. Given the low interest rates and its relatively high dividend yield, Intel has been able to make cash-flow positive moves simply by retiring dividend-paying stock in favor of taking on interest obligations.Going forward, danger will only arise if financing rates rise. At that point, Intel will need to have the cash on hand to pay down its debt if it wants to avoid higher interest costs in the future. Skeptics worry that Intel's recent improvement is a one-time effect from a temporary increase in PC demand that will quickly flare out. But strategically, Intel has put initiatives in place to drive growth and stability for years to come, and right now, Intel has the foundation it needs to build a solid future.Apple recently revealed the product of its secret-development \"dream team\" -- Apple Watch.

Rumors recently swirled that Apple had already begun the production of the A9 semiconductor that is supposed to power next year's editions of the iPhone and iPad. This story not only affects Apple and the smartphone OEMs Apple influences. It also holds significant financial implications for the downstream companies like  and  that produce the innards of Apple's iDevices.To be clear, I'm raising an eyebrow at these reports, and I think you should too. Originally broken by a publication called  , a South Korean tech news site, the story gained more traction when  also reported it late last week.Although I have little personal experience with  or knowledge of its journalistic standards, the publication cites unspecified \"industry insiders\" as the source. We've seen this kind of unsubstantiated industry gossip come from other, more established rumor mills like the Taiwanese  as well. More often than not, these reports prove false, so the sourcing alone makes me inclined to dismiss the storyline. However, the sourcing isn't the only problem.The companies most likely to build the Apple A9 probably don't even have all the necessary equipment on hand to fabricate the chip right now. In a recent research note, boutique semiconductor research firm, Semiwatch Advisors, created a reverse production timeline for the Apple A9.The idea was to connect two things: 1) when Apple will likely need to have the A9 under production to meet its own iPhone release schedule and 2) Apple's downstream partners and their suppliers to get a sense of the likely revenue cycle for those downstream companies. This allows us to understand not only how the next 12 months' sales might unfold at Apple fabrication partners, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, but also how the upcoming financial performance of the fab companies might unfold, including lesser-known names like  and  . Take a look.According to this timeline, Apple's fabrication partners for the A9, be they Samsung or Taiwan Semiconductor, will only begin taking delivery for some of the advanced equipment they'll need to manufacture the A9 around the beginning of the first quarter. So even if you moved the possible delivery date up by a month, Apple's chipmakers would only have just recently received their newest equipment -- having Apple's A9 well into production is so unlikely as to be virtually impossible. I'm calling this rumor patently false.However, this does bring attention to anther important aspect of Apple's upcoming chip cycle. Which company will fabricate them?Apple's utter disdain for Samsung is well documented by now. As the two compete head-to-head in the smartphone market, Apple has shifted much of its component production away from Samsung over the past several years. Taiwan Semiconductor has been  from Apple's corporate hardball, so much so that it was estimated to have produced roughly 60% of the A8 chips for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.Rest assured, Apple will once again keep as much of its A9 business away from Samsung as possible in the upcoming production cycle. That being said, Samsung will likely receive some portion of Apple's A9 fab business for one key reason: Apple is widely expected to incorporate a cutting-edge semiconductor technology into the A9 known as FinFET. Without delving too deeply into the technical side of things, this new design and manufacturing process will hopefully enable Apple and other leading smartphone chipmakers to continue to pack more performance into increasingly smaller chipsets. Sounds pretty good, right?Things grow more opaque, though, when taking into account recent rumors that the FinFET production process yields (an important measure of quality) have been abysmal at virtually all major chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, and even  . This has led many to argue that Apple will likely take a more \"hedged\" approach than it might prefer in awarding its A9 production business. The company will likely spread its bets among several large fabrication partners, Taiwan Semiconductor  Samsung in this case, in order to maximize its ability to procure enough A9 chips for its late-2015 iPhone and iPad refresh cycle. So although I'm confident Apple's A9 has not yet entered production, the exact details regarding the rollout are far from certain as we head into the New Year.Apple recently revealed the product of its secret-development \"dream team\" -- Apple Watch.

Its customers include chipmakers that produce everything from memory to microprocessors, for use in electronics.The stock has surged this year; since Lam Research reported quarterly earnings April 23, shares have risen about 27% to trade around 67. Jefferies Group analysts initiated coverage this month with a \"buy\" rating and a 75 stock-price target.Lam Research should see rising product-pricing power, Jefferies analysts say, as chipmaking customers reach a peak in terms of reducing costs and bolstering performance by minimizing the size of transistors. The thinking goes that customers such asIntel (  ) and Samsung will seek advancements from suppliers such as Lam Research to fill a performance-improvement void, via alternative materials and manufacturing process enhancements.Lam Research is forecast to nearly double its annual earnings per share this year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average expect $4.40, up from $2.22 last year.For its third quarter of fiscal 2014 ended March 30, Lam Research logged $1.23 billion in revenue, up 45% year over year and atop analyst views for $1.22 billion.Profit came in at $216.4 million, or $1.26 a share, on an adjusted basis. That excluded some costs tied to the 2012 acquisition of Novellus Systems and some other special items. The result came in ahead of analyst estimates for $1.17, and compares with EPS of 44 cents a year earlier and $1.10 a quarter earlier.For the current quarter, the Fremont, Calif.-based firm expects revenue between $1.19 billion and $1.29 billion, and adjusted EPS of $1.14 to $1.28. Analysts in the Thomson Reuters poll anticipate EPS of $1.23 on revenue of $1.25 billion.Lam Research is the fourth company in size, by market cap, in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group, afterASML Holding (  ),Applied Materials (  ) andKLA Tencor (  ) . The group is currently ranked No. 72 of 197 that IBD tracks.SEMI, the global semiconductor industry association,  will jump 24% to $35.7 billion this year and another 11% in 2015. Such a development would follow double-digit percentage declines logged the last two years.SEMI's research chief Chris Dieseldorff says the rise of mobile devices, in lieu of PCs that require more semiconductor content, coupled with global economic uncertainty influenced the declines in investment levels the past two years.\"The overall sentiment had an impact on the semiconductor industry,\" Dieseldorff said in an interview. \"Companies just didn't have the confidence to invest.\"But now, Dieseldorff says, confidence in the economic vigor of the U.S. and Asia, along with belief in a European recovery, is mounting.The kind of companies Lam Research caters to are eager to capitalize on cutting-edge processes and willing to make investments in order to boost performance of a range of equipment used to outfit everything from computers to flat-screen televisions.\"We are in the right place at the right time,\" CFO Bettinger said in an interview.Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) equipment spending, for instance, is projected by SEMI to grow 40% this year. Lam Research has a strong position in the memory market. The company's memory segment accounted for about two-thirds of its shipments in the March quarter, and Bettinger says DRAM upgrades developed in collaboration with customers are driving new business.The DRAM example is just one of many, he says. Demand for tech upgrades is developing on \"multiple fronts.\" And it is coming from regions around the globe.SEMI predicts that, in 2014, fab equipment spending will surge 36% in the Americas, 69% in China, 79% in Europe and the Mideast, 23% in Korea, and 11% in both Taiwan and Japan.In its latest reported quarter, Lam Research generated 10% of its revenue in the U.S., 28% in Korea, 22% in China, 19% in Taiwan, 11% in Japan and 6% in Europe.For all the anticipated momentum, Ng of Morningstar notes that Lam Research is in a historically cyclical industry. Investors, he says, tend to push up stocks such as Lam Research when conditions are favorable and expectations are high.\"But when things are bad, everyone runs out the door,\" he said, noting that Lam Research traded around 35 a share just two years ago and around 25 in mid-2009.Bettinger says that Lam Research \"is not immune\" to cyclical shifts.\"The macroeconomic environment is always something we need to be monitoring,\" he added.But operating conditions globally range from stable to growing and, against that backdrop, there is likely to be strong and ongoing demand for new electronics, from smartphones to wearable devices, he says. And to satiate that demand, Lam Research's customers are likely to continue to invest in new equipment to develop more and better products for consumers.\"We have a very strong business,\" Bettinger said.In addition to a new stock buy-back program, he notes, Lam Research recently announced a 18-cent-per-share dividend slated for July 2. Bettinger calls it a show of confidence by the company's board.\"It will be an ongoing dividend,\" he said. \"It really does reflect confidence in our future business.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["anaher Corporation (  ) will begin trading ex-dividend on September 24, 2014.

Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth.The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.However, since innovation remains largely within the country, the sector is one of the biggest employers of labor, with a corresponding significant impact on the overall economy.As one of the leading enablers of technological progress, semiconductors are expected to play a key role in the growing interconnectedness of things. Two factors have driven this change. The first is the advent of the cloud that has made it feasible to store very large amounts of data to be transmitted to and received on wired or wireless devices. The second is the continued reduction in the cost of manufacturing semiconductors that makes it feasible to install them on a range of everyday devices that were previously unconnected.In its Internet of Things (IoT) 2013 to 2020 Market Analysis report, IDC estimates that spending on IoT technology and services will touch $8.9 trillion by 2020, or a 7.9% CAGR. IDC's estimates continue to rise, given the growing enthusiasm for IoT and its growing prospects. This should generate demand for billions of semiconductors. (  ) has promised to become a leading supplier of components and services for IoT and leading European producers, such as  (  ), Infineon and  (  ) have asked the European Commission to set up research centers dedicated to IoT. Many other players will undoubtedly join the party.The consumer and computing markets remain the most important traditional markets, but because of the gradual convergence of functionalities, it is growing increasingly difficult to identify which devices are computing and with which consumer. Semiconductors are spurring this change, facilitating the convergence.PC market growth will be moderate in the next few years, more than made up by growth in mobile devices. A lot of the growth in the next few years will come from price-sensitive emerging markets, which is an added negative. Innovation in the mobile segment will be focused on improving functionality and experience by getting semiconductors to operate at higher speeds and by consuming less power.ARM is a significant beneficiary of the trend favoring mobile computing, since its simpler processor architecture consumes less power. As a result, companies like  (  ),  (  ) and others have based their products on ARM cores. Intel appears to have fallen behind in the race, but 2014 could see a reversal in its fortunes.At the same time, dumber terminals mean increasing demand for cloud services, which is pushing demand for servers and data centers and thereby helping Intel, which is the dominant player in the segment. While ARM is likely to enter this turf just like Intel is entering mobile, Intel remains very strongly positioned here.Other than tablets, the consumer electronics market also includes gadgets like LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The Consumer Electronics Association (\"CEA\") expects U.S. consumer electronics sales to be up 2.4% this year, following a sharp drop-off in 2013. The CEA expects global spending on technology to decline 1% this year to $1.06 trillion.However, spending on tablets and smartphones is expected to remain strong at roughly 43% of all tech spending. Smartphone prices will take a tumble however. The new category of smartwatches will do around 1.5 million units. HD TVs, while remaining a very small percentage of total TV units, will grow from 60K units to 485K units.The wireless infrastructure segment of the communications market has been stronger than the wireline segment in the last few years. This segment is expected to remain consistent with 2013 levels, as transition to 3G and 4G infrastructure continues. Increasing data volumes across the world and infrastructure build-outs to support these volumes and deal with connectivity issues (network congestion, power reliability, privacy and security) will continue to drive semiconductor sales.In addition, enterprise and data center networks are undergoing a huge change because of greater demand for data storage, security and privacy (cloud computing, IoT). This should generate significant demand for semiconductors over the next few years.New concepts like software defined networking (SDN) are based on more intelligent network control and are therefore new markets for semiconductors. Spending on smart grids and intelligent metering applications is expected to see particularly strong growth (19% CAGR through 2016 according to IC Insights).The automotive end-market has been growing in importance, as the consumption of electronic components for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continues to increase. As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years.Industrial consumption of semiconductors is linked to GDP growth, which according to the UN economic growth forecast for 2014 is not too exciting. The GDPs of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan are expected to grow 2.5%, 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively.Emerging economies like Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa are expected to grow 3%, 2.9%, 5%, 7.5% and 4.7%, respectively. Medical Devices (normally included in this segment), lighting solutions and residential construction markets are likely to be stronger. As a result, semiconductor devices that have enabled increased automation and efficiencies are likely to see modest demand.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) is looking up. Production increases should be slightly positive for the semiconductor industry this year.Defense spending remains uncertain, although electronic weaponry, intelligence systems and basic weaponry remain important. So semiconductor manufacturers serving this market likely continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.The most significant trends for 2014 include the stabilization in the PC market, continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones and the emergence of the new category of wearable devices. The strength in these markets and continued innovation within them should lead to strengthening demand for semiconductors through the year. Additionally, channel inventories remain lean overall, which means that strengthening demand will drive sales.IC Insights estimates that a modest recovery in the PC market will help drive a 3% increase in microprocessor sales for PC/server embedded markets in 2014 after two years of decline. On the other hand, cell phone application processors will grow 19% this year with total microprocessor sales growing 9%.DRAM supply is likely to be short of demand this year because of its application in mobile devices like tablets and smartphones on the one hand and the limited investment in manufacturing facilities on the other. This is expected to strengthen prices significantly.NAND demand is expected to remain very strong again this year, but considering the fire at Hynix that diverted some capacity to DRAM, there could be some supply constraints. But NAND manufacturers are gearing up for the second half of the year when there should be some additional capacity as well. So prices may be expected to remain strong this year. SSD demand will also spike, as will its supply.iSuppli expects the standard logic market to start growing this year and considering the slight recovery in the PC market (which uses the most standard logic), this may be correct. Stronger automotive and industrial sales, which while being much smaller than the PC market, will also continue to push consumption of standard logic components.According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) data, there should be positive worldwide semiconductor sales growth of 4.1% in 2014, followed by 3.4% growth in 2015. All products and categories are expected to grow in both years, although wireless and automotive are expected to grow the strongest with consumer and computing staying relatively stable.The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs -- whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries. The market positions described below refer to latest available data.According to estimates from IHS iSuppli, Intel and Samsung remained the top two semiconductor suppliers in 2013. Qualcomm retained the third position, followed by Micron, Hynix and Toshiba. Texas Instruments didn't have a very good year, slipping from number four to number seven, and was followed by  (BRCM), STMicroelectronics and Renesas.The pureplay Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years although the top five positions have not changed much, according to research from IC Insights.  (  ) remains the leader by far, followed by GlobalFoundries and then Taiwan-based  (  ).Chinese foundry  (  ) remains at number four, with Powerchip moving to the fifth position. Additionally, Intel and Samsung are strong players with leading edge capabilities. IC Insights says that the pure-play foundries grew 16% in 2013 and will grow another 14% this year to touch $41.2 billion.Increased investment in capital equipment bodes well for equipment suppliers this year. SEMI data shows strong positive growth across most geographies, leading to a 23.2% increase in sales.Gartner estimates that  (  ) remained the largest equipment maker in 2013 driven by stronger demand for its deposition and process control products.  (  ), retained the second position and was followed by  (  ), Tokyo Electron and  (  ).The semiconductor industry is made up of 11 sub-sectors within the Technology sector, which is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors.

Both the revenue beat ratio of 60.0% and earnings beat ratio of 74.5% are solid (so far). The sector performed significantly better than the S&P 500 on both counts.Total earnings for the sector were up 3.8% year over year, compared to an increase of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Total revenues were up 2.8% from last year compared to a 4.2% increase in the fourth quarter.The Technology sector is expected to be up 2.2% in 2014 and 10.5% in 2015.Some of the best opportunities in the semiconductor industry are the memory players  (  ) and  (  ). That's because both these companies will benefit from the growth of mobile devices, both smartphones and tablets. These devices are big consumers of memory (both DRAM and NAND), which increase demand for memory makers.At the same time, the industry is capacity constrained, which makes for stronger pricing. Both companies have also increased focus on new technologies like SSDs, which along with integrated security will also enable them to target the enterprise segment.There are some major weaknesses at the moment, but a company worth highlighting is  (  ). The company is a developer of LED technology, which is a pretty hot market right now. But with LED backlighting becoming more mainstream, competition from several Asian companies like Samsung increased.Cree was unable to sustain prices and margins, backing off totally into lighting. But here it is up against even more competition from established players like Phillips. So it has to resort to aggressive pricing and heavy discounts, which are impacting its profitability even as revenue increases. Analysts have been lowering estimates for Cree, leading to increased caution about the shares.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is because ASML is now in overbought territory with an RSI value of 86.72.RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet ASML's high RSI value isn't the only reason for investors to be concerned, as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions in ASML Holding's stock as of late. This is especially true when investors dive into some of these revisions in order to get a better picture of ASML's prospects for the near term.Over the past two months, investors have witnessed 2 earnings estimate revision lower compared to none higher for the current year. The consensus estimate for ASML has also been on a downward trend over the same time period too, as the estimate has fallen from $3.97/share two months ago to just $3.81/share today.If this wasn't enough, ASML Holding also has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) which puts it into unfortunate company among its peers.

And you buy a put if you expect the market to go down.A straddle, however, is a strategy to use when you're not sure which way the market will go, but you believe something big will happen in either direction.And earnings season is a great time to do this because very few things can send a stock soaring or plummeting like an EPS surprise.For example: let's say a stock was trading at $100 a few days before their earnings announcement. So you decide to put on a straddle by buying:\u2022 the $100 strike call\u2022 and the $100 strike putBecause you only plan on being in the trade for a few days (to maybe a few weeks), you decide to get into the soon-to-expire options.But when playing both sides of the market simultaneously for an event you expect to take place in the near immediacy, the opposite is best. Why? Because at expiration, your profit is the difference between how much your options are in-the-money minus what you paid for them. So if you don't need a lot of time, this keeps the cost down and your profit potential up.If you paid $150 for an at-the-money call option that will expire shortly and another $150 for an at-the-money put option that will expire shortly, your cost to put on the trade was $300 (not including transaction costs).If that stock shot up $10 as a result of a positive earnings surprise, that call option that you paid $150 for would now be worth $1,000. And that put option would be worth zero ($0).So let's do the math: if the call, which is now $10 in-the-money, is worth $1,000; then subtract the $150 you paid, and that gives you an $850 profit on the call.The put, on the other hand, is out-of-the-money, and is worth nothing, which means you lost $150 on the put.Add it all together, and on a $300 investment, you just made a profit of $700. Pretty good - especially for not even knowing which way the stock would go.However, if you paid more for each side of the trade, those would be extra costs to overcome.But by keeping each side's cost as small as reasonably possible, that leaves more profit potential on the winning side and a smaller loss on the losing side.Moreover, if the stock stays flat (in other words, the big move you expect to see doesn't materialize, thus resulting in both sides of the trade expiring worthless), your cost of the trade was kept to a minimum.So buying a straddle by its very nature should be looked at as a short-term trade. If the outcome of the event that prompted you to get into the straddle in the first place now has you strongly believing that a continuation of the upmove or downmove is in order, you could then exit the straddle and move into the one-sided call or put and apply the in-the-money and more-time rules for those.Here are 5 optionable stocks due to report earnings over the following two weeks that could see some volatile price action one way or the other: ASML Holding(reports on 4/13/14) American Express(reports on 4/16/14) JPMorgan Chase(reports on 4/11/14) Schlumberger(reports on 4/17/14) St. Jude Medical(reports on 4/16/14)Whether they report a positive or negative surprise, a big move could be seen in either direction.

Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth.The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.However, since innovation remains largely within the country, the sector is one of the biggest employers of labor, with a corresponding significant impact on the overall economy.The consumer and computing markets remain the most important, but because of the gradual convergence of functionalities, it is growing increasingly difficult to identify which devices are computing and which consumer. Semiconductors are spurring this change, facilitating the convergence.PC market growth will be moderate in the next few years, more than made up by growth in mobile devices. A lot of the growth in the next few years will come from price-sensitive emerging markets, which is an added negative. Innovation in the mobile segment depends on the ability of semiconductors to provide greater functionality and better experience at higher speeds and by consuming less power. (  ) is a significant beneficiary of the trend favoring mobile computing, since its simpler processor architecture consumes less power. As a result, companies like  (  ),  (  ) and others have based their products on ARM cores.  (  ) appears to have fallen behind in the race, but its recently-announced Bay Trail processor based on the Silvermont microarchitecture could make up for lost time.At the same time, dumber terminals mean increasing demand for cloud services, which is pushing demand for servers and data centers and thereby helping Intel, which is the dominant player in the segment. While ARM is likely to enter this turf just like Intel is entering mobile, Intel's is very strongly positioned here.Other than tablets, the consumer electronics market also includes gadgets like LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The Consumer Electronics Association (\"CEA\") expects U.S. consumer electronics sales to be up 2.4% this year, following a sharp drop-off in 2013. The CEA expects global spending on technology to decline 1% this year to $1.06 trillion.However, spending on tablets and smartphones is expected to remain strong at roughly 43% of all tech spending. Smartphone prices will take a tumble however. The new category of smartwatches will do around 1.5 million units. HD TVs, while remaining a very small percentage of total TV units, will grow from 60K units to 485K units.The wireless infrastructure segment of the communications market has been stronger than the wireline segment in the last few years. This segment is expected to remain consistent with 2013 levels, as transition to 3G and 4G infrastructure continues. Increasing data volumes across the world and infrastructure build-outs to support these volumes and deal with connectivity issues (network congestion, power reliability, privacy and security) will continue to drive semiconductor sales.In addition, enterprise and data center networks are undergoing a huge change because of greater demand for data storage, security and privacy (cloud computing, Internet of Things). This should generate significant demand for semiconductors over the next few years.New concepts like software defined networking (SDN) are based on more intelligent network control and are therefore new markets for semiconductors. Spending on smart grids and intelligent metering applications is expected to see particularly strong growth (19% CAGR through 2016 according to IC Insights).The automotive end market has been growing in importance, as the consumption of electronic components for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continues to increase. As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years.Industrial consumption of semiconductors is linked to GDP growth, which according to the UN economic growth forecast for 2014 is not too exciting. The GDPs of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan are expected to grow 2.5%, 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively.Emerging economies like Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa are expected to grow 3%, 2.9%, 5%, 7.5% and 4.7%, respectively. Medical Devices (normally included in this segment), lighting solutions and residential construction markets are likely to be stronger. As a result, semiconductor devices that have enabled increased automation and efficiencies are likely to see modest demand.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) is looking up. Production increases should be slightly positive for the semiconductor industry this year.Defense spending remains uncertain, although electronic weaponry, intelligence systems and basic weaponry remain important. So semiconductor manufacturers serving this market continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.The most significant trends for 2014 include the stabilization in the PC market, continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones and the emergence of the new category of wearable devices. The strength in these markets and continued innovation within them should lead to strengthening demand for semiconductors through the year. Additionally, channel inventories remain lean overall, which means that strengthening demand will drive sales.IC Insights estimates that a modest recovery in the PC market will help drive a 3% increase in microprocessor sales for PC/server embedded markets in 2014 after two years of decline. On the other hand, cell phone application processors will grow 19% this year with total microprocessor sales growing 9%.DRAM supply is likely to be short of demand this year because of its application in mobile devices like tablets and smartphones on the one hand and the lack of investment in manufacturing facilities on the other. This is expected to strengthen prices significantly.NAND demand is expected to remain very strong again this year, but considering the fire at Hynix that diverted some capacity to DRAM, supply constraints could remain in the first half of the year. But NAND manufacturers are gearing up for the second half when there should be some additional capacity as well. So prices may be expected to remain strong this year. SSD demand will also spike, as will its supply.iSuppli expects the standard logic market to start growing this year and considering the slight recovery in the PC market (which uses the most standard logic), this may be correct. Stronger automotive and industrial sales, which while being much smaller than the PC market, will also continue to push consumption of standard logic components.According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) data, there should be positive worldwide semiconductor sales growth of 4.1% in 2014, followed by 3.4% growth in 2015. All products and categories are expected to grow in both years, although wireless and automotive are expected to grow the strongest and consumer and computing relatively stable.The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs -- whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers and foundries.

Additionally, Intel and Samsung are strong players with leading edge capabilities. IC Insights says that the pure-play foundries grew 16% in 2013 and will grow another 14% this year to touch $41.2 billion.Increased investment in capital equipment bodes well for equipment suppliers this year. SEMI data shows strong positive growth across most geographies, leading to a 23.2% increase in sales.Gartner estimates that  (  ) regained the number one position in 2012 driven by stronger demand for its deposition and process control products.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is down -6.46 to 3,604.83.

Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth.The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.However, since innovation remains largely within the country, the sector is one of the biggest employers of labor, with a corresponding significant impact on the overall economy.The consumer and computing markets remain the most important, but because of the gradual convergence of functionalities, it is growing increasingly difficult to identify which devices are computing and which consumer. Semiconductors are spurring this change, facilitating the convergence.PC market growth will be moderate in the next few years, more than made up by growth in mobile devices. A lot of the growth in the next few years will come from price-sensitive emerging markets, which is an added negative. Innovation in the mobile segment depends on the ability of semiconductors to provide greater functionality and better experience at higher speeds and by consuming less power. (  ) is a significant beneficiary of the trend favoring mobile computing, since its simpler processor architecture consumes less power. As a result, companies like  (  ),  (  ) and others have based their products on ARM cores.  (  ) appears to have fallen behind in the race, but its recently-announced Bay Trail processor based on the Silvermont microarchitecture could make up for lost time.At the same time, dumber terminals mean increasing demand for cloud services, which is pushing demand for servers and data centers and thereby helping Intel, which is the dominant player in the segment. While ARM is likely to enter this turf just like Intel is entering mobile, Intel's is very strongly positioned here.Other than tablets, the consumer electronics market also includes gadgets like LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The Consumer Electronics Association (\"CEA\") expects U.S. consumer electronics sales to be up 2.4% this year, following a sharp drop-off in 2013. The CEA expects global spending on technology to decline 1% this year to $1.06 trillion.However, spending on tablets and smartphones is expected to remain strong at roughly 43% of all tech spending. Smartphone prices will take a tumble however. The new category of smartwatches will do around 1.5 million units. HD TVs, while remaining a very small percentage of total TV units, will grow from 60K units to 485K units.The wireless infrastructure segment of the communications market has been stronger than the wireline segment in the last few years. This segment is expected to remain consistent with 2013 levels, as transition to 3G and 4G infrastructure continues. Increasing data volumes across the world and infrastructure build-outs to support these volumes and deal with connectivity issues (network congestion, power reliability, privacy and security) will continue to drive semiconductor sales.In addition, enterprise and data center networks are undergoing a huge change because of greater demand for data storage, security and privacy (cloud computing, Internet of Things). This should generate significant demand for semiconductors over the next few years.New concepts like software defined networking (SDN) are based on more intelligent network control and are therefore new markets for semiconductors. Spending on smart grids and intelligent metering applications is expected to see particularly strong growth (19% CAGR through 2016 according to IC Insights).The automotive end market has been growing in importance, as the consumption of electronic components for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continues to increase. As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years.Industrial consumption of semiconductors is linked to GDP growth, which according to the UN economic growth forecast for 2014 is not too exciting. The GDPs of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan are expected to grow 2.5%, 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively.Emerging economies like Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa are expected to grow 3%, 2.9%, 5%, 7.5% and 4.7%, respectively. Medical Devices (normally included in this segment), lighting solutions and residential construction markets are likely to be stronger. As a result, semiconductor devices that have enabled increased automation and efficiencies are likely to see modest demand.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) is looking up. Production increases should be slightly positive for the semiconductor industry this year.Defense spending remains uncertain, although electronic weaponry, intelligence systems and basic weaponry remain important. So semiconductor manufacturers serving this market continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.The most significant trends for 2014 include the stabilization in the PC market, continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones and the emergence of the new category of wearable devices. The strength in these markets and continued innovation within them should lead to strengthening demand for semiconductors through the year. Additionally, channel inventories remain lean overall, which means that strengthening demand will drive sales.IC Insights estimates that a modest recovery in the PC market will help drive a 3% increase in microprocessor sales for PC/server embedded markets in 2014 after two years of decline.

Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth.The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.However, since innovation remains largely within the country, the sector is one of the biggest employers of labor, with a corresponding significant impact on the overall economy.Traditionally, the consumer and computing markets have been the most significant drivers of semiconductor demand. These two markets together remain the most important, but because of the gradual convergence of functionalities, it is growing increasingly difficult to identify which devices are computing and which consumer. Semiconductors are spurring this change, facilitating the convergence.The PC market will decline this year and will remain in the doldrums for a couple more years. This softness will however be more than made up by growth in mobile devices, particularly tablets and smartphones. A lot of the growth in the next few years will come from price-sensitive emerging markets, which is an added negative.Innovation in the mobile segment depends on the ability of semiconductors to provide greater functionality and better experience at higher speeds and consuming less power. (  ) is a significant beneficiary of the trend favoring mobile computing, since its simpler processor architecture consumes less power. As a result, companies like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and others have based their products on ARM cores. Intel appears to have fallen behind in the race, but its recently-announced Bay Trail processor based on the Silvermont microarchitecture could make up for lost time.At the same time, dumber terminals mean increasing demand for cloud services, which is pushing demand for servers and data centers and thereby helping Intel, which is the dominant player in the segment. While ARM is likely to enter this turf just like Intel is entering mobile, Intel's position is far stronger here.Other than tablets, the consumer electronics market also includes gadgets like LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The Consumer Electronics Association (\"CEA\") expects global consumer electronics sales to be up 2.7% this year, following better-than-expected performance in 2012. Tablet units (up 45% from 2012), smartphone units (up 17%), notebooks (up 53%) are expected to be the strongest drivers. Other areas of strength include 3D-enabled displays (39%), networked-enabled TVs (34%) digital imaging 22% and set top boxes 13%.The wireless infrastructure segment of the communications market has been stronger than the wireline segment in the last few years. This segment is expected to remain strong, with Ericsson, Huawei, Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia Siemens remaining in control. Increasing data volumes across the world and infrastructure build-outs to support these volumes and deal with connectivity issues (network congestion, power reliability, privacy and security) will continue to drive semiconductor sales.In addition, enterprise and data center networks are undergoing a huge change because of greater demand for data storage, security and privacy (cloud computing, Internet of Things). This should generate significant demand for semiconductors over the next few years.New concepts like software defined networking (SDN) are based on more intelligent network control and are therefore new markets for semiconductors. Spending on smart grids and intelligent metering applications is expected to see particularly strong growth (19% CAGR through 2016 according to IC Insights).The automotive end market has been growing in importance, as the consumption of electronic components for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continues to increase. As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years.Industrial consumption of semiconductors is linked to GDP growth, which is expected to improve slightly in the U.S. and China while remaining flattish in Europe. Medical Devices (normally included in this segment), lighting solutions and residential construction markets are likely to be stronger. As a result, semiconductor devices that have enabled increased automation and efficiencies are likely to see modest demand.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) has started looking up. Production increases should be slightly positive for the semiconductor industry this year.Defense spending remains uncertain, although electronic weaponry, intelligence systems and basic weaponry remain important. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.Demand may be expected to pick up this year, as most OEMs and their channel partners have been reducing inventories and cutting utilization. PC and microprocessor inventory reduction has been significant, but should pick up this year driven by new product launches. Handset inventory declines were significant exiting 2012, driven by strong demand. Analog, discrete and storage inventories were also pretty lean, according to research firm iSuppli.DRAM supply is likely to be short of demand this year because of its application in mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. NAND demand is also accelerating, with most manufacturers already ramping production (IC Insights). Standard logic will however remain weak this year, but increase thereafter (iSuppli).The reason for the weakness is continued steep declines in the PC market, which uses the most standard logic. Demand will pick up slightly thereafter due to stronger automotive and industrial sales, which while being much smaller than the PC market, have seen increasing consumption of standard logic components.Another noticeable trend is the increased outsourcing of manufacturing to foundries, which along with significant acquisitions, is giving rise to more concentrated supply from a few companies. The stronger demand and more concentrated supply should result in firmer prices this year. IC Insights expects the stronger pricing to drive a 50% growth in tablet processor revenues, 28% growth in cell phone processor revenues, 13% in wired special purpose logic, 12% in NAND and 11% in application-specific analog devices.Demand at the wafer level is also expected to be strong, with  (  ) projecting a revenue increase of 6.8% in 2013. WFR is the primary wafer supplier to foundries and other semiconductor manufacturers.According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) data, there should be positive worldwide semiconductor sales growth of 4.5% in 2013, following the 3.2% decline in 2012. Gartner and IC Insights are close to this, with projections at 4.5% and 6.0%, respectively. iSuppli and IDC more optimistic, predicting sales growth of 8.2% and 6.9%, respectively.The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs-whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers and foundries.According to estimates from IHS iSuppli,  (  ) and Samsung remained the top two semiconductor suppliers in 2012.  (  ) slipped to number four, as  (  ) jumped from the sixth position in 2011 to the third in 2012.Toshiba, Renesas, Hynix,  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) made up the next few positions with only Hynix and Broadcom advancing slightly.  (  ) dropped to number 12, behind Sony, which advanced two positions.The pureplay Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years although the top five positions have not changed much, according to research from IC Insights.  (  ) remains the leader by far, followed by GlobalFoundries and then Taiwan-based  (  ). Chinese foundry  (  ) remains at number four, with specialty foundry  (  ) in the fifth position. Additionally, Intel and Samsung are strong players with leading edge capabilities.Leading edge investments remain very strong at market leaders TSM, GlobalFoundries, Intel and Samsung. TSM has recently increased its capex estimates for 2013 by $1.5 billion, making it the largest spender this year. Its agreement with Apple will likely spur investment at advanced technology nodes.GlobalFoundries is spending 18% more than last year, but the foundry expects to spend much more next year. Samsung also raised capex projections by a billion dollars. Intel was the only one lowering, although it will still spend enough to make it one of the top three spenders.Increased investment in capital equipment bodes well for equipment suppliers this year. However, while foundries and memory manufacturers take the lead, spending on the logic side will be slower. SEMI data shows positive bookings trends in the first few months of the year, although growth expectations remain modest at 0.4%. IC Insights is slightly more positive, projecting an increase of 1.8%.In a recent report, Gartner estimated a 5.5% decline for 2013, given first half weakness and continued improvement through the second half. Growth is expected to be a very strong 14.2% in 2014, followed by a 10.1% increase in 2015.Gartner estimates that  (  ) regained the number one position in 2012 driven by stronger demand for its deposition and process control products.  (  ), which had taken the lead in 2011 as a result of increased demand for EUV tools moved back into the second position.

The year-over-year improvement was driven by continued strength in the foundry segment at the 28-nanometer node.Revenue contribution from North America in the third quarter was 26.0%, up 6.3% from the prior quarter. Europe's contribution was 10.0%, up 22.7% sequentially. Korea saw the strongest growth among Asian countries, increasing 14.5%, followed by Japan, which was up 8.0%. Taiwan and other Asia, which Lam refers to as Asia-Pacific declined 1.9% and 36.2%, respectively. Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Asia-Pacific generated 11%, 14%, 26% and 13% of third quarter revenues, respectively.Shipments were roughly $896.0 million during the quarter, increasing 11.6% from $803.0 million in the prior quarter. Foundries accounted for 56% of total shipments, NAND 15%, DRAM 16.0%, with Logic and Others bringing in the balance.From a geographical perspective, North America contributed 21.0% of third quarter 2013 shipments (29.0% in the second quarter of 2013).

Lower revenues coupled with unfavorable customer mix were the main reasons for the gross margin contraction.Total operating expenses of $329.0 million were up 57.4% from $209.0 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 1.3%, down 754 bps from 8.8% recorded in the previous-year quarter.

Reported earnings per share were 11 cents, down from 38 cents in the prior-year quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at 61 cents.Lam Research delivered decent third quarter 2013 results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strengthening demand at Taiwan Semiconductor was encouraging.

Earnings are forecasted to be in the range of 28 cents to 42 cents on a share count of 170.0 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 53 cents.Lam Research delivered decent second quarter 2013 results with the bottom line meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Year-over-year revenue growth on the back of strong product demand was encouraging. However, the company's third quarter guidance was weak, reflecting continued uncertainty in semiconductor spending.Lam Research is well-positioned in the semiconductor equipment segment and its closest peers in the segment are  (  ),  and  (  ). It has further solidified its position with the addition of Novellus Systems thin-film deposition and surface preparation product lines.Lam Research has also entered into a strategic collaboration with  (  ).

Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth.The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.However, since innovation remains largely within the country, the sector is one of the biggest employers of labor, with a corresponding significant impact on the overall economy.The computing and consumer end markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have a significant influence on total sector performance.A number of factors, in combination, are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. The near-term outlook is bleak for semiconductor manufacturers, with IHS iSuppli expecting sales to decline 1.9% this year. The negatives (tablet cannibalization, weaker-than-expected spending by both consumers and enterprises) are outweighing the positives (cloud computing, Windows 8) for now but things are expected to get better next year.Emerging Markets, such as China, India, Brazil and Russia remain a positive for sector growth. However, this growth is coming at the cost of profits because of poorer purchasing power in these regions. Additionally, the macro weakness in developed regions is also impacting certain emerging markets.With ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing markets is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The Consumer Electronics Association (\"CEA\") expects global consumer electronics sales to be up 5.9% this year, driven by growth in tablets (up 83% from 2011), smartphones (up 24%), networked-enabled TVs (20%) and 3D-enabled displays (75%). A growing number of consumer electronic devices are now being sold into /factory-installed on automobiles.IHS iSuppli is very positive about semiconductor sales into the communications market and expects both the wireless and wireline segments to make a positive contribution. Wireless is expected to be the stronger of the two, increasing 10.4%, with wireline relatively flat at 0.7%. Increasing data volumes across the world and infrastructure build-outs in emerging regions are positive drivers.Industrial consumption of semiconductors is expected to be one of the strongest this year, driven by the need for production efficiencies, which in turn is increasing demand for power management semiconductor solutions. IHS iSuppli expects semiconductors for industrial applications to be up 7.7% this year, just slightly short of the 9.3% growth in 2011. Medical Devices (normally included in this segment) is an emerging area where semiconductor usage continues to increase.The automotive end market is an emerging area for semiconductors. The growing electronic content within this market is a secular trend, as demand for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continue to increase. As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years, although, we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow.While 2012 started off well, conditions deteriorated for suppliers somewhat because of the protracted weakness in Europe and sluggish recovery in the U.S. Therefore, IHS iSuppli expects the market to grow just 2.7% for the full year, down from the 10.0% growth recorded in 2011.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) has started looking up. Production increases should be slightly positive for the semiconductor industry this year.The outlook for defense spending on the other hand is not encouraging, with focus remaining on intelligence systems and basic weaponry. Electronic weaponry remains a bright spot. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.Semiconductor sales in the first half of 2012 remained below the level generated in the first half of 2011.Overall, Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) projections (based on WSTS data) places worldwide semiconductor sales growth at 0.4% in 2012 and 7.2% in 2013. The Americas region is expected to be up 3.2% in 2012, Japan 1.7%, Asia/Pacific 0.1% and Europe down 3.5%.IHS iSuppi is even more negative about growth this year, expecting the PC market slowdown to result in a 0.1% decline in global sales.The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs-whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers and foundries.According to estimates from IHS iSuppli,  (  ) and Samsung remained the top two semiconductor suppliers in 2011, while  (  ) overtook Toshiba Corp. to attain the number three position (helped by the National Semiconductor acquisition).Renesas remained at number 5, followed by  (  ), which moved up from the ninth position in 2010.  (  ) remained at number 7, with Hynix, Micron Technologies (  ) and  (  ) in the eighth, ninth and tenth positions, respectively.  (  ) crept up from number 12 to number 11.Gartner estimates that spending on semiconductor capital equipment increased 13.7% in 2011, on top of the 118.4% increase in 2010. The increase was almost totally driven by wafer fab equipment (\"WFE\"), with other segments declining mid-single-digits.However, the research firm expects the equipment market to decline 19.5% to around $52 billion in 2012, growing 19.2% the following year. The decline is expected to be across all segments, with WFE declining 22.9%, automated test equipment (\"ATE\") declining 16.5% and packaging assembly equipment (\"PAE\") declining 13.5%.SEMI estimates are slightly different. The research firm expects semiconductor equipment sales to decline 10.8% this year, following a 4.7% increase in 2011. The research firm expects all geographies except South Korea to decline in 2012 and rebound thereafter in 2013.The increased spending on technology upgrades during 2011 resulted in sufficient capacity for 2012 and 2013. However, the growing demand for semiconductors is likely to encourage the next wave of spending some time in 2013. At that time, we are likely to see some new fabs, spending on which was averted to an extent in the current cycle through the use of superior technology.Latest research from VLSI shows that  (  ) surpassed Applied Materials (  ) to attain the number one spot in 2011. This was possible because of increased spending on lithography tools during the year. Therefore, while the top 15 equipment suppliers grew just 13%, ASML and Nikkon (another supplier of lithography tools) together grew 27%. Tokyo Electron,  (  ) and  (  ) occupied the next three positions, respectively.However, the story could change again in 2012, because of consolidation in the market. This year, Applied will include Varian (number 13 from 10 months as an independent company in 2011), Lam will include Novellus (number 10 in 2011) and Advantest (number 8) will include a full year of Verigy.The pureplay Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years although the top five positions have not changed much, according to research from Gartner.  (  ) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based  (  ). GlobalFoundries remains at number three, with Chinese foundry  (  ) at number four. The only change was with respect to specialty foundry  (  ), which displaced Dongbu Hi-Tech to jump to the fifth position.A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment - Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments' foundries make them two strong contenders with leading edge capabilities.One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is  (  ), with its power-efficient, low-performance chip architecture. With new versions of ARM chips coming to market, it is likely that the chips will gradually spread to the server segment as well (not a 2012 phenomenon). Others would be  (  ), Samsung and Texas Instruments, all of which are big semiconductor manufacturers that use ARM architecture.Although we remain cautious about Intel's growth initiatives in mobile and believe that the macro situation remains a deterrent to Ultrabook sales, the company's market position, cash balance, technology lead, and management strategy and execution are positives.Analog companies with a focus on the communications, mobile and networking technologies such as  (  ) and  (  ) may be expected to hold up better than others in the next few months.The largest foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor is also likely to do well and valuation is attractive. Additionally, the patent war between  (  ) and Samsung may have Apple moving production to another foundry and Taiwan Semiconductor could be the beneficiary.We believe that inventory rebalancing and adjustment continue to date. Given the uncertainties in demand, we think that semiconductor manufacturers will curtail investment in capacity although technology purchases could continue. In this environment, we would avoid investment in equipment companies, such as Applied Materials, KLA-Tencor, Lam Research, etc.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.

The decline is expected to be across all segments, with WFE declining 22.9%, automated test equipment (\"ATE\") declining 16.5% and packaging assembly equipment (\"PAE\") declining 13.5%.SEMI estimates are slightly different. The research firm expects semiconductor equipment sales to decline 10.8% this year, following a 4.7% increase in 2011. The research firm expects all geographies except South Korea to decline in 2012 and rebound thereafter in 2013.The increased spending on technology upgrades during 2011 resulted in sufficient capacity for 2012 and 2013. However, the growing demand for semiconductors is likely to encourage the next wave of spending some time in 2013. At that time, we are likely to see some new fabs, spending on which was averted to an extent in the current cycle through the use of superior technology.Latest research from VLSI shows that  (  ) surpassed Applied Materials (  ) to attain the number one spot in 2011. This was possible because of increased spending on lithography tools during the year. Therefore, while the top 15 equipment suppliers grew just 13%, ASML and Nikkon (another supplier of lithography tools) together grew 27%. Tokyo Electron,  (  ) and  (  ) occupied the next three positions, respectively.However, the story could change again in 2012, because of consolidation in the market. This year, Applied will include Varian (number 13 from 10 months as an independent company in 2011), Lam will include Novellus (number 10 in 2011) and Advantest (number 8) will include a full year of Verigy.The pureplay Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years although the top five positions have not changed much, according to research from Gartner.  (  ) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based  (  ). GlobalFoundries remains at number three, with Chinese foundry  (  ) at number four. The only change was with respect to specialty foundry  (  ), which displaced Dongbu Hi-Tech to jump to the fifth position.A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment - Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments' foundries make them two strong contenders with leading edge capabilities.One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is  (  ), with its power-efficient, low-performance chip architecture. With new versions of ARM chips coming to market, it is likely that the chips will gradually spread to the server segment as well (not a 2012 phenomenon). Others would be  (  ), Samsung and Texas Instruments, all of which are big semiconductor manufacturers that use ARM architecture.Although we remain cautious about Intel's growth initiatives in mobile and believe that the macro situation remains a deterrent to Ultrabook sales, the company's market position, cash balance, technology lead, and management strategy and execution are positives.Analog companies with a focus on the communications, mobile and networking technologies such as  (  ) and  (  ) may be expected to hold up better than others in the next few months.The largest foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor is also likely to do well and valuation is attractive. Additionally, the patent war between  (  ) and Samsung may have Apple moving production to another foundry and Taiwan Semiconductor could be the beneficiary.We believe that inventory rebalancing and adjustment continue to date. Given the uncertainties in demand, we think that semiconductor manufacturers will curtail investment in capacity although technology purchases could continue. In this environment, we would avoid investment in equipment companies, such as Applied Materials, KLA-Tencor, Lam Research, etc.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ere are 5 stocks added to the Zacks Rank #5 (\"strong sell\") List today:View the entire  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is down -.45 to 2,736.28.

The beat, which could be attributed to strong revenue growth, led the share price to hike 1.0% in the after-hours.Lam Research's revenue of $906.9 million grew 22.3% sequentially and 33.3% from a year ago. The year-over-year improvement was aided by higher shipments, which indicated escalating demand for LRCX product suites.Revenue contribution from North America in the first quarter was 18.0%, up from 12.0% in the prior quarter. Europe's contribution remained flat sequentially at 7.0%, while contribution from Japan edged up from 7.0% in the prior quarter to 8.0%. Contribution from Korea was 24.0% of the total revenue, down from 39.0% in prior quarter, Asia Pacific was 15.0%, up from 10.0% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and Taiwan was 28.0%, climbed from 25.0% in the fourth quarter of 2012.Shipments were roughly $935.0 million during the quarter, increasing 14.6% from $816.0 million in the prior quarter. Foundry shipment accounted for 48.0% of total shipment to $448.8 million, NAND $205.7 million, DRAM $177.65 million, Logic $93.5 million and Others accounted for rest $9.35 million.From a geographical perspective, North America contributed 18.0% of first quarter fiscal 2013 shipments (14.0% in fourth quarter of 2012), Europe generated 7.0% (6.0% in the prior quarter), Japan brought in 8.0% (flat sequentially), Korea contributed 16.0% (32.0% in the previous quarter), Asia Pacific contributed 22.0% (12.0% in the prior quarter) and Taiwan accounted for 29.0% (28.0% in the previous quarter).The GAAP gross margin decreased 490 bps year over year to 36.8%. Lower volumes coupled with unfavorable product and customer mix were the main reasons for the gross margin contraction.Total operating expenses of $317.2 million were up 71.9% from the year-ago quarter's $184.5 million. The operating margin was 1.8%, down 1280 bps from 14.6% recorded in the previous-year quarter. Both research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales, and the lower gross margin was an offsetting factor.The GAAP net income was $2.8 million, or 0.3% of sales, compared with income of $71.8 million, or 10.6% in the year-ago quarter. Reported earnings per share were 2 cents, down from 58 cents in the prior year quarter. After adjusting for restructuring charges and impairment of long-lived assets on a tax-adjusted basis, the non-GAAP came to 2 cents in the quarter, compared with 58 cents in the year-ago quarter.Inventories declined 10.3% sequentially to $567.9 million in the first quarter. The company ended with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.7 billion, down from $2.9 billion in the previous quarter. Lam Research's long-term debt and capital lease balance was $1.3 billion in the first quarter. Day sales outstanding (DSO) were 64 days and inventory turns were 4.0X. The cash from operations were $249.3 million in the first quarter, up from $96.7 million in the previous quarter.Lam Research guided for a weak second quarter as some of its customers lowered their spending plans.For the second quarter 2013, Lam Research expects revenue in the range of $820.0-$880.0 million. Shipments are expected to be roughly in the range of $770.0-$830.0 million. The gross margin is expected to be in the range of 43.0%-45.0% and operating profit at 9.5%-12.5%. Earnings are forecasted to be in the range of 38 cents -52 cents on a share count of 172.0 million shares. Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is pegged at 50 cents.The company also lowered its wafer fabrication equipment-spending outlook for the remainder of 2012.Lam Research delivered impressive first quarter 2013 results with the bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Year over year revenue growth was encouraging, citing strong product demand. But the company's second quarter guidance was sequentially weak, reflecting uncertainty of semiconductor spending pattern.Lam Research is well-positioned in the semiconductor industry and is giving tough competition to the key players such as  (  ), Tokyo Electron and  (  ). It has further solidified its position with the addition of Novellus Systems Inc.'s thin-film deposition and surface preparation product lines.Despite its growth prospects, we assign the stock a Zacks #5 Rank, implying a short-term \"Strong Sell\" rating on the back of weak second quarter guidance and lackluster demand situation in the semiconductor market.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is down -6.49 to 2,659.34.

The Zacks Consensus dropped a penny since Intel lowered its revenue and gross margin expectations for the quarter.The 16.7% surprise was far better than the 5.3% it averaged in the four preceding quarters. The resultant 2.9% increase in share prices in after-hours trading nearly made up for the 3.3% decline during the day.Intel's reported revenue was $13.5 billion, at the high end of the revised guidance range of $$13.2 billion (+/-$300 million). This was down 0.3% sequentially and 5.5% year over year.Weaker-than-expected PC demand stemming from tablet cannibalization, restrained consumer buying both due to tighter budgets (in developed markets) and in anticipation of the Windows 8 Launch from  (  ) and softening enterprise demand combined to generate these results. Pricing pressure also played a part.The  segment generated 64% of revenue in the last quarter. The flattish sequential comparison was due to a slight increase in demand in September, compared with softer demand in the first two months of the quarter. The average selling price (ASP) was a negative, as traditional computing devices that are currently powered with Intel's chips were hurt by increasing cannibalization from tablets.Units and prices were down 4% each from the year-ago quarter, impacted by an 8% decline in ASPs for the notebook platform and a 6% decline in volumes for the desktop platform. Low penetration and a growing per capita income are increasing the popularity of computing devices in emerging markets, especially the BRIC countries, which is a longer term driver for Intel. was the second largest group with a 20% revenue share. Segment revenue was down 5.3% sequentially and up 5.7% year over year. The corporate segment was the dampener in the last quarter, with cloud-related purchases growing 50% from last year and storage growing 27%.The secular growth drivers here are increasing Internet usage by consumers all over the world, and the ongoing move towards virtualization and cloud computing. The high performance computing (HPC) segment is the fastest-growing segment within Intel's data center business.The  segment generated around 9% of Intel's revenue in the last quarter, growing 6.2% sequentially and declining 14.0% from last year.The  segment contributed a little more than 4% of total revenue (similar to the last quarter). Segment revenue was flat sequentially and up 8.7% year over year. In addition to discrete sales, Intel is taking an integrated approach to McAfee's storage solutions, with the intention of further differentiating its products.The  segment generated 3% of revenue, up 27.0% sequentially and 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.The Asia/Pacific region remained the largest in the last quarter, with a 57% contribution, with revenues declining 1.0% sequentially and 4.4% from a year ago. The Americas was the second largest region, with a 21% contribution, down 1.1% sequentially and 5.5% year over year.Europe came in third with a 13% revenue share, representing a sequential increase of 7.4% and decline of 2.1% from the third quarter of 2011. Japan stayed at number four, with an 8% contribution, representing sequential and year-over-year declines of 4.9% and 16.1%, respectively.The pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 64.3%, down 9 basis points (bps) sequentially and 2 bps year over year, better than the revised guidance of 62% at the mid-point. The sequential decline, although small, is not a good sign, as it is the result of lower capacity utilization and weaker pricing.Operating expenses of $4.6 billion were flat sequentially. The operating margin was 30.1%, up 13 bps sequentially and down 496 bps year over year. The sequential increase in R&D as a percentage of sales was small. However, it was up very significantly from last year. SG&A actually declined sequentially as a percentage of sales, while increasing slightly from last year.The operating margins by segment were as follows-PC Client 38.7% (down 68 bps sequentially), Data Center 45.7% (down 387 bps), Other Intel Architecture -20.0% (up 1,027 bps) and Software and Services 0.7% (down 171 bps). Operating margins declined significantly on a year-over-year basis across all segments.The pro forma net income was $3.1 billion, or 23.1% of sales, compared to $3.0 billion, or 22.0% in the previous quarter and $3.6 billion or 25.5% in the comparable prior-year quarter. One-time items included intangibles amortization expenses on a tax-adjusted basis. Accordingly, the fully diluted GAAP net income was $3.0 billion, or 58 cents a share compared to $2.8 billion, or 54 cents per share in the previous quarter and $3.5 billion, or 65 cents in the year-ago quarter.Inventories increased 8.5% sequentially and annualized inventory turns went down from 3.9X to 3.6X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 24 to around 27. The cash, marketable securities and fixed income trading asset balance at quarter-end was $10.5 billion, down $3.2 billion during the quarter due to its equity investment in  (  ).Intel has $7.1 billion in long-term debt and 56 million in short-term debt, resulting in a net cash balance of $6.5 billion. Cash flow from operations was around $3.3 billion. Important usages of cash in the last quarter included $2.89 billion on capex, $1.12 billion on dividends, $3.22 billion on acquisitions and $1.17 billion on share repurchases.Intel guided to revenue of around $13.6 billion (+/-$500 million), up 1.1% sequentially and down 2.1% from the December quarter of 2011 (better than consensus estimates of $13.2 billion). Gross margin on a GAAP basis is expected to be around 57% (+/-2 percentage points), while on a non-GAAP basis, it is expected to be 58% (+/- 2 percentage points).Total operating expenses are expected to come in at around $4.5 billion. Management also expects to provide for depreciation of around $1.6 billion and intangibles amortization of around $75 million. Other income/expense and equity investments are expected to be $75 million. Applying the guided annual tax rate of 27%, net income comes to around $2.5 billion or 18.6% of revenue, which would be down from both the previous and year-ago quarters.Intel expects to spend $11.3 billion (+/- $300 million) on capex in 2012.Intel's top line numbers for the quarter were below-seasonal, but not too bad considering market conditions. For now, the company remains the leading producer of microprocessors for the PC market. Its innovative prowess has ensured that Intel is well ahead of its closest rival  (  ).Therefore, what affects it mainly is the market itself. Intel's strategy has been correct here and the company has positioned itself strongly in emerging markets, from where most of the growth is expected to originate in the next few quarters. Whether Intel's success in these regions is able to offset share losses to tablets remains in question.Tablets, particularly from  (  ) are no longer limited to netbook cannibalization, but have progressed to notebooks, which have for long been taking share from desktops. Therefore, Intel's core computing business is now under real pressure. The new Ultrabooks from  (  ),  (  ), Lenovo and others may help and Wintel devices on mobile platforms may help, but both these are untested, so there will be an initial amount of uncertainty regarding adoption.The enterprise segment has for long been a savior for Intel, but growth rates have slowed down in this segment as well. Intel should continue to gain from the ongoing move to cloud computing, but in the immediate future, we see soft demand from the corporate sector.On the cost front, we see lower utilization rates and pricing pressure impacting gross margins. We also believe that R&D investments will remain significant, as Intel strives to maintain its technology lead.Therefore, despite its market position, technology lead and solid execution, we expect the shares to remain under pressure in the next couple of quarters. Intel shares therefore carry a Zacks Rank of #5, implying a short-term Strong Sell rating. Our long term (3-6 month) rating is also Underperform.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is down -1.77 to 2,785.15.

When ASML roped in  (  ), Samsung and  (  ) earlier this year by selling a 23% stake in the company, we did wonder how this cash would be used. Since Cymer has been collaborating closely with ASML over the past year, the deal appears to make sense.Except for the fact that ASML is paying a 60%+ premium to Cymer's closing price on Monday, which fixes the deal value at around $2.5 billion ($20 cash and 1.1502 ASML shares per Cymer share). ASML investors were concerned, sending shares down 6.6% yesterday, although they started to stabilize after-hours.ASML says that the deal would not be accretive for another two years, which coupled with the recent weakness in its results and outlook, also disappointed investors. However, it intends to run Cymer as a separate division based in the U.S., so we may be able to track the progress.Cymer shares shot up 49.4%.The chip industry has grown in accordance with Moore's Law (simply put, this means a doubling in chip performance every two years). The law is named after Intel founder Gordon E. Moore, who was the first to notice the trend. It is now expected that performance enhancements (number of transistors per integrated circuit and higher speeds of the transistors) will slow down in 2013 and chip performance will double in three years instead of two.This will slow down innovation, not only in the chip industry, but also many related industries, particularly computing and consumer electronics. With developed markets saturating and developing markets requiring lower price points, the only way to drive demand is by lowering costs.However, cost reduction at the component level will only be possible when devices become smaller and more efficient. A failure to do this will lead to an inevitable drop in demand, which will in turn affect the semiconductor and related industries.Semiconductor production has reached the stage where further innovation hinges on more advanced tools. This is the main reason that the companies are coming together to speed up research so these tools may be available at the earliest.ASML provided some details in its press release. The company currently has 6 EUV systems (NXE:  ) in beta, with satisfactory resolution performance at 22nm. However, the successor system, NXE: 3300B, which is intended for 14nm production currently requires closer integration with light sources to drive targeted levels of efficiency.Joint laboratory testing of the NXE: 3300B by Cymer and ASML shows ability to process 18 wafers per hour. The companies intend to take this to 69 wafers per hour for 2014 chip production.For this purpose, ASML intends to have 11 NXE: 3300B systems installed at customers for testing in 2013, with production-ready shipments at targeted efficiencies starting in 2014. The company has received four commitments so far and expects another four to eight in the next six months.The deal should be cleared by regulators, despite certain anti-competitive concerns related to Nikkon (an ASML competitor) because of the value it creates in innovation.We are currently neutral on the cyclical semiconductor sector, as enthusiasm for ongoing significant innovation for future growth is tempered by current low growth prospects.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["id-way through trading Wednesday, the Dow traded down 0.06 percent to 13,543.02 while the NASDAQ rose 0.31 percent to 3,110.91.

Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions, and so forth.The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.However, since innovation remains largely within the country, the sector is one of the biggest employers of labor, with a corresponding significant impact on the overall economy.Starting with the earthquake and Tsunami in Japan and moving on to the flooding in Thailand, the industry suffered huge setbacks in 2011. Additionally, the challenges came not just from natural disasters, but also from a generally weak global economy (especially in Europe) and sagging consumer confidence.Global sales of semiconductor devices touched $299.5 billion for the year, increasing 0.4% from 2010, when revenues were up 31.8%. The primary segments responsible for the slight increase from the prior year were optoelectronics (used to improve energy efficiency in mobile devices and cameras); sensors and actuators (used to improve safety and efficiency in consumer electronics, medical devices and automotive systems, as well as smartphones, tablets and other consumer electronic devices); and microprocessors (used predominantly in computing devices).These two end-markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have the ability to significantly influence total sector performance.A number of factors, in combination, are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. The near-term outlook is bleak for semiconductor manufacturers, with IHS iSuppli expecting sales to decline 1.9% this year.The enterprise side of the business is relatively stronger, as  (  ) Windows 7 continues to drive sales at enterprise customers, with Windows 8 expected to speed up adoption of mobile devices. Even with operating systems, such as  (  ) Macintosh platform gaining popularity, and cloud alternatives such as  (  ) Chrome coming to market, Windows 7 adoption rates have held up relatively well. New products, such as Ivy Bridge and Romley from  (  ) are also contributing to growth in the enterprise segment.Perhaps the biggest driver of business is the growth in the data center segment, which is currently being driven by the move to cloud computing. The segment has increased focus on servers, storage and networking equipment that consume semiconductors of the high-end variety. Cost advantages are encouraging many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as some large organizations to transfer either a part or the whole of their operations to the cloud. We expect this change to be a major driver of growth for the industry in the foreseeable future.Consumer spending on computing devices remains cautious however. Despite the host of less sophisticated and ultra-mobile devices (netbooks, tablets and ultrabooks), growth in the back half of 2012 is tracking below expectations.Emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and Russia remain a positive for sector growth. However, this growth is coming at the cost of profits because of poorer purchasing power in these regions. Additionally, the macro weakness in developed regions is also impacting certain emerging markets.With ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing markets is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.The Consumer Electronics Association (\"CEA\") expects global consumer electronics sales to be up 5.9% this year, driven by growth in tablets (up 83% from 2011), smartphones (up 24%), networked-enabled TVs (20%) and 3D-enabled displays (75%). A growing number of consumer electronic devices are now being sold into /factory-installed on automobiles.IHS iSuppli is very positive about semiconductor sales into the communications market and expects both the wireless and wireline segments to make a positive contribution. Wireless is expected to be the stronger of the two, increasing 10.4%, with wireline relatively flat at 0.7%. Increasing data volumes across the world and infrastructure build-outs in emerging regions are positive drivers.Industrial consumption of semiconductors is expected to be one of the strongest this year, driven by the need for production efficiencies, which in turn is increasing demand for power management semiconductor solutions. HIS iSuppli expects semiconductors for industrial applications to be up 7.7% this year, just slightly short of the 9.3% growth in 2011. Medical Devices (normally included in this segment) is an emerging area where semiconductor usage continues to increase.The automotive end market is an emerging area for semiconductors. The growing electronic content within this market is a secular trend, as demand for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continue to increase. As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years, although we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow.While 2012 started off well, conditions have deteriorated for suppliers somewhat because of the protracted weakness in Europe and sluggish recovery in the U.S. Therefore, IHS iSuppli expects the market to grow just 2.7% this year, down from the 10.0% growth recorded in 2011.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) has started looking up. Production increases should be slightly positive for the semiconductor industry this year.The outlook for defense spending, on the other hand, is not as bright. Moreover, the focus on terrorist activity remains, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry remains strong. A longer-term driver for semiconductor manufacturers is the growing importance of electronic weaponry. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.Semiconductor sales in the first half of 2012 remained below the level generated in the first half of 2011.Overall, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) projections (based on WSTS data) places worldwide semiconductor sales growth at 0.4% in 2012 and 7.2% in 2013. The Americas region is expected to be up 3.2% in 2012, Japan 1.7%, Asia/Pacific 0.1% and Europe down 3.5%. IHS iSuppi is even more negative about growth this year, expecting the PC market slowdown to result in a 0.1% decline in global sales.The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs, whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.According to estimates from IHS iSuppli, Intel and Samsung remained the top two semiconductor suppliers in 2011, while  (  ) overtook Toshiba Corp. to attain the number three position (helped by the National Semiconductor acquisition).Renesas remained at number 5, followed by  (  ), which moved up from the ninth position in 2010.  (  ) remained at number 7, with Hynix,  (  ) and  (  ) in the eighth, ninth and tenth positions, respectively.  (  ) crept up from number 12 to number 11.Gartner estimates that spending on semiconductor capital equipment increased 13.7% in 2011, on top of the 118.4% increase in 2010. The increase was almost totally driven by wafer fab equipment (\"WFE\"), with other segments declining mid-single-digits.However, the research firm expects the equipment market to decline 19.5% to around $52 billion in 2012, growing 19.2% the following year. The decline is expected to be across all segments, WFE declining 22.9%, automated test equipment (\"ATE\") declining 16.5% and packaging assembly equipment (\"PAE\") declining 13.5%.SEMI estimates are slightly different. The research firm expects semiconductor equipment sales to decline 10.8% this year, following a 4.7% increase in 2011. The research firm expects all geographies except South Korea to decline in 2012 and rebound thereafter in 2013.The increased spending on technology upgrades during 2011 resulted in sufficient capacity for 2012 and 2013. However, the growing demand for semiconductors is likely to encourage the next wave of spending some time in 2013. At that time, we are likely to see some new fabs, spending on which was averted to an extent in the current cycle through the use of superior technology.Latest research from VLSI shows that  (  ) surpassed  (  ) to attain the number one spot in 2011. This was possible because of increased spending on lithography tools during the year. Therefore, while the top 15 equipment suppliers grew just 13%, ASML and Nikkon (another supplier of lithography tools) together grew 27%. Tokyo Electron,  (  ) and  (  ) occupied the next three positions, respectively.However, the story could change again in 2012, because of consolidation in the market. This year, Applied will include Varian (number 13 from 10 months as an independent company in 2011), Lam will include Novellus (number 10 in 2011) and Advantest (number 8) will include a full year of Verigy.The pureplay Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years although the top five positions have not changed much, according to research from Gartner.  (  ) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based  (  ). GlobalFoundries remains in the third position that it obtained in 2010, pushing the Chinese foundry  (  ) to number four. The only change was with respect to specialty foundry  (  ), which displaced Dongbu Hi-Tech to jump to the fifth position.A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment -- Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments' foundries make them two strong contenders with leading-edge capabilities.One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is  (  ), with its power-efficient, low-performance chip architecture that dominates the growing mobile phone and tablet markets. With new versions of ARM chips coming to market, it is likely that the chips will gradually spread to the server segment as well (not a 2012 phenomenon).Others would be  (  ), Samsung and Texas Instruments, all of which are big semiconductor manufacturers that use ARM architecture. As such, we remain relatively positive about Samsung and Qualcomm in 2012.We are also optimistic about  (  ), given its successful new product ramps and focus on the data center segment. Although we remain cautious about  Intel's growth initiatives in mobile and believe that the macro situation remains a deterrent to Ultrabook sales, the company's market position, cash balance, technology lead, and management strategy and execution are positives in our opinion.Analog companies with a focus on the communications, industrial and automotive segments, such as Analog Devices,  (  ) and  (  ), as well as well-diversified companies such as  (  ) may be expected to hold up better than others in 2012.We believe that 2012 will be a transitional year, with inventory rebalancing and adjustment. Given the uncertainties in demand, we think that semiconductor manufacturers will curtail investment in capacity although technology purchases could continue. DRAM inventory remains in excess although the flash market is slightly better off.In this environment, we would avoid investment in equipment companies, such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ), etc. We particularly discourage investment in Applied Materials at this time because of its exposure to solar, where there is significant oversupply and resultant pricing pressure.The foundry segment will also have a moderate year, with the weaker-than-expected demand for mobile devices dampening growth prospects in the second half of the year. We therefore continue to believe that investors should treat foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor, United Microelectronics, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International with caution.Texas Instruments is also expected to have its own share of problems. The top line will continue to be impacted by the phasing out of the baseband business and it is now saddled with extra capacity that will most likely be under-utilized until demand increases significantly (not expected until 2013).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions, and so forth.The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.However, since innovation remains largely within the country, the sector is one of the biggest employers of labor, with a corresponding significant impact on the overall economy.Starting with the earthquake and Tsunami in Japan and moving on to the flooding in Thailand, the industry suffered huge setbacks in 2011. Additionally, the challenges came not just from natural disasters, but also from a generally weak global economy (especially in Europe) and sagging consumer confidence.Global sales of semiconductor devices touched $299.5 billion for the year, increasing 0.4% from 2010, when revenues were up 31.8%. The primary segments responsible for the slight increase from the prior year were optoelectronics (used to improve energy efficiency in mobile devices and cameras); sensors and actuators (used to improve safety and efficiency in consumer electronics, medical devices and automotive systems, as well as smartphones, tablets and other consumer electronic devices); and microprocessors (used predominantly in computing devices).These two end-markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have the ability to significantly influence total sector performance.A number of factors, in combination, are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. The near-term outlook is bleak for semiconductor manufacturers, with IHS iSuppli expecting sales to decline 1.9% this year.The enterprise side of the business is relatively stronger, as  (  ) Windows 7 continues to drive sales at enterprise customers, with Windows 8 expected to speed up adoption of mobile devices. Even with operating systems, such as  (  ) Macintosh platform gaining popularity, and cloud alternatives such as  (  ) Chrome coming to market, Windows 7 adoption rates have held up relatively well. New products, such as Ivy Bridge and Romley from  (  ) are also contributing to growth in the enterprise segment.Perhaps the biggest driver of business is the growth in the data center segment, which is currently being driven by the move to cloud computing. The segment has increased focus on servers, storage and networking equipment that consume semiconductors of the high-end variety. Cost advantages are encouraging many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as some large organizations to transfer either a part or the whole of their operations to the cloud. We expect this change to be a major driver of growth for the industry in the foreseeable future.Consumer spending on computing devices remains cautious however. Despite the host of less sophisticated and ultra-mobile devices (netbooks, tablets and ultrabooks), growth in the back half of 2012 is tracking below expectations.Emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and Russia remain a positive for sector growth. However, this growth is coming at the cost of profits because of poorer purchasing power in these regions. Additionally, the macro weakness in developed regions is also impacting certain emerging markets.With ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing markets is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.The Consumer Electronics Association (\"CEA\") expects global consumer electronics sales to be up 5.9% this year, driven by growth in tablets (up 83% from 2011), smartphones (up 24%), networked-enabled TVs (20%) and 3D-enabled displays (75%). A growing number of consumer electronic devices are now being sold into /factory-installed on automobiles.IHS iSuppli is very positive about semiconductor sales into the communications market and expects both the wireless and wireline segments to make a positive contribution. Wireless is expected to be the stronger of the two, increasing 10.4%, with wireline relatively flat at 0.7%. Increasing data volumes across the world and infrastructure build-outs in emerging regions are positive drivers.Industrial consumption of semiconductors is expected to be one of the strongest this year, driven by the need for production efficiencies, which in turn is increasing demand for power management semiconductor solutions. HIS iSuppli expects semiconductors for industrial applications to be up 7.7% this year, just slightly short of the 9.3% growth in 2011. Medical Devices (normally included in this segment) is an emerging area where semiconductor usage continues to increase.The automotive end market is an emerging area for semiconductors. The growing electronic content within this market is a secular trend, as demand for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continue to increase. As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years, although we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow.While 2012 started off well, conditions have deteriorated for suppliers somewhat because of the protracted weakness in Europe and sluggish recovery in the U.S. Therefore, IHS iSuppli expects the market to grow just 2.7% this year, down from the 10.0% growth recorded in 2011.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) has started looking up. Production increases should be slightly positive for the semiconductor industry this year.The outlook for defense spending, on the other hand, is not as bright. Moreover, the focus on terrorist activity remains, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry remains strong. A longer-term driver for semiconductor manufacturers is the growing importance of electronic weaponry. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.Semiconductor sales in the first half of 2012 remained below the level generated in the first half of 2011.Overall, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) projections (based on WSTS data) places worldwide semiconductor sales growth at 0.4% in 2012 and 7.2% in 2013. The Americas region is expected to be up 3.2% in 2012, Japan 1.7%, Asia/Pacific 0.1% and Europe down 3.5%. IHS iSuppi is even more negative about growth this year, expecting the PC market slowdown to result in a 0.1% decline in global sales.The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs, whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.According to estimates from IHS iSuppli, Intel and Samsung remained the top two semiconductor suppliers in 2011, while  (  ) overtook Toshiba Corp. to attain the number three position (helped by the National Semiconductor acquisition).Renesas remained at number 5, followed by  (  ), which moved up from the ninth position in 2010.  (  ) remained at number 7, with Hynix,  (  ) and  (  ) in the eighth, ninth and tenth positions, respectively.  (  ) crept up from number 12 to number 11.Gartner estimates that spending on semiconductor capital equipment increased 13.7% in 2011, on top of the 118.4% increase in 2010. The increase was almost totally driven by wafer fab equipment (\"WFE\"), with other segments declining mid-single-digits.However, the research firm expects the equipment market to decline 19.5% to around $52 billion in 2012, growing 19.2% the following year. The decline is expected to be across all segments, WFE declining 22.9%, automated test equipment (\"ATE\") declining 16.5% and packaging assembly equipment (\"PAE\") declining 13.5%.SEMI estimates are slightly different. The research firm expects semiconductor equipment sales to decline 10.8% this year, following a 4.7% increase in 2011. The research firm expects all geographies except South Korea to decline in 2012 and rebound thereafter in 2013.The increased spending on technology upgrades during 2011 resulted in sufficient capacity for 2012 and 2013. However, the growing demand for semiconductors is likely to encourage the next wave of spending some time in 2013. At that time, we are likely to see some new fabs, spending on which was averted to an extent in the current cycle through the use of superior technology.Latest research from VLSI shows that  (  ) surpassed  (  ) to attain the number one spot in 2011. This was possible because of increased spending on lithography tools during the year. Therefore, while the top 15 equipment suppliers grew just 13%, ASML and Nikkon (another supplier of lithography tools) together grew 27%. Tokyo Electron,  (  ) and  (  ) occupied the next three positions, respectively.However, the story could change again in 2012, because of consolidation in the market. This year, Applied will include Varian (number 13 from 10 months as an independent company in 2011), Lam will include Novellus (number 10 in 2011) and Advantest (number 8) will include a full year of Verigy.The pureplay Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years although the top five positions have not changed much, according to research from Gartner.  (  ) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based  (  ). GlobalFoundries remains in the third position that it obtained in 2010, pushing the Chinese foundry  (  ) to number four. The only change was with respect to specialty foundry  (  ), which displaced Dongbu Hi-Tech to jump to the fifth position.A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment -- Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments' foundries make them two strong contenders with leading-edge capabilities.One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is  (  ), with its power-efficient, low-performance chip architecture that dominates the growing mobile phone and tablet markets.

Additionally, the challenges came not just from natural disasters, but also from a generally weak global economy (especially in Europe) and sagging consumer confidence.Global sales of semiconductor devices touched $299.5 billion for the year, increasing 0.4% from 2010, when revenues were up 31.8%. The primary segments responsible for the slight increase from the prior year were optoelectronics (used to improve energy efficiency in mobile devices and cameras); sensors and actuators (used to improve safety and efficiency in consumer electronics, medical devices and automotive systems, as well as smartphones, tablets and other consumer electronic devices); and microprocessors (used predominantly in computing devices).These two end-markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have the ability to significantly influence total sector performance.A number of factors, in combination, are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. The near-term outlook is bleak for semiconductor manufacturers, with IHS iSuppli expecting sales to decline 1.9% this year.The enterprise side of the business is relatively stronger, as  (  ) Windows 7 continues to drive sales at enterprise customers, with Windows 8 expected to speed up adoption of mobile devices. Even with operating systems, such as  (  ) Macintosh platform gaining popularity, and cloud alternatives such as  (  ) Chrome coming to market, Windows 7 adoption rates have held up relatively well. New products, such as Ivy Bridge and Romley from  (  ) are also contributing to growth in the enterprise segment.Perhaps the biggest driver of business is the growth in the data center segment, which is currently being driven by the move to cloud computing. The segment has increased focus on servers, storage and networking equipment that consume semiconductors of the high-end variety. Cost advantages are encouraging many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as some large organizations to transfer either a part or the whole of their operations to the cloud. We expect this change to be a major driver of growth for the industry in the foreseeable future.Consumer spending on computing devices remains cautious however. Despite the host of less sophisticated and ultra-mobile devices (netbooks, tablets and ultrabooks), growth in the back half of 2012 is tracking below expectations.Emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and Russia remain a positive for sector growth. However, this growth is coming at the cost of profits because of poorer purchasing power in these regions. Additionally, the macro weakness in developed regions is also impacting certain emerging markets.With ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing markets is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.The Consumer Electronics Association (\"CEA\") expects global consumer electronics sales to be up 5.9% this year, driven by growth in tablets (up 83% from 2011), smartphones (up 24%), networked-enabled TVs (20%) and 3D-enabled displays (75%). A growing number of consumer electronic devices are now being sold into /factory-installed on automobiles.IHS iSuppli is very positive about semiconductor sales into the communications market and expects both the wireless and wireline segments to make a positive contribution. Wireless is expected to be the stronger of the two, increasing 10.4%, with wireline relatively flat at 0.7%. Increasing data volumes across the world and infrastructure build-outs in emerging regions are positive drivers.Industrial consumption of semiconductors is expected to be one of the strongest this year, driven by the need for production efficiencies, which in turn is increasing demand for power management semiconductor solutions. HIS iSuppli expects semiconductors for industrial applications to be up 7.7% this year, just slightly short of the 9.3% growth in 2011. Medical Devices (normally included in this segment) is an emerging area where semiconductor usage continues to increase.The automotive end market is an emerging area for semiconductors. The growing electronic content within this market is a secular trend, as demand for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continue to increase. As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years, although we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow.While 2012 started off well, conditions have deteriorated for suppliers somewhat because of the protracted weakness in Europe and sluggish recovery in the U.S. Therefore, IHS iSuppli expects the market to grow just 2.7% this year, down from the 10.0% growth recorded in 2011.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) has started looking up. Production increases should be slightly positive for the semiconductor industry this year.The outlook for defense spending, on the other hand, is not as bright. Moreover, the focus on terrorist activity remains, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry remains strong. A longer-term driver for semiconductor manufacturers is the growing importance of electronic weaponry. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.Semiconductor sales in the first half of 2012 remained below the level generated in the first half of 2011.Overall, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) projections (based on WSTS data) places worldwide semiconductor sales growth at 0.4% in 2012 and 7.2% in 2013. The Americas region is expected to be up 3.2% in 2012, Japan 1.7%, Asia/Pacific 0.1% and Europe down 3.5%. IHS iSuppi is even more negative about growth this year, expecting the PC market slowdown to result in a 0.1% decline in global sales.The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs, whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.According to estimates from IHS iSuppli, Intel and Samsung remained the top two semiconductor suppliers in 2011, while  (  ) overtook Toshiba Corp. to attain the number three position (helped by the National Semiconductor acquisition).Renesas remained at number 5, followed by  (  ), which moved up from the ninth position in 2010.  (  ) remained at number 7, with Hynix,  (  ) and  (  ) in the eighth, ninth and tenth positions, respectively.  (  ) crept up from number 12 to number 11.Gartner estimates that spending on semiconductor capital equipment increased 13.7% in 2011, on top of the 118.4% increase in 2010. The increase was almost totally driven by wafer fab equipment (\"WFE\"), with other segments declining mid-single-digits.However, the research firm expects the equipment market to decline 19.5% to around $52 billion in 2012, growing 19.2% the following year. The decline is expected to be across all segments, WFE declining 22.9%, automated test equipment (\"ATE\") declining 16.5% and packaging assembly equipment (\"PAE\") declining 13.5%.SEMI estimates are slightly different. The research firm expects semiconductor equipment sales to decline 10.8% this year, following a 4.7% increase in 2011. The research firm expects all geographies except South Korea to decline in 2012 and rebound thereafter in 2013.The increased spending on technology upgrades during 2011 resulted in sufficient capacity for 2012 and 2013. However, the growing demand for semiconductors is likely to encourage the next wave of spending some time in 2013. At that time, we are likely to see some new fabs, spending on which was averted to an extent in the current cycle through the use of superior technology.Latest research from VLSI shows that  (  ) surpassed  (  ) to attain the number one spot in 2011. This was possible because of increased spending on lithography tools during the year. Therefore, while the top 15 equipment suppliers grew just 13%, ASML and Nikkon (another supplier of lithography tools) together grew 27%. Tokyo Electron,  (  ) and  (  ) occupied the next three positions, respectively.However, the story could change again in 2012, because of consolidation in the market. This year, Applied will include Varian (number 13 from 10 months as an independent company in 2011), Lam will include Novellus (number 10 in 2011) and Advantest (number 8) will include a full year of Verigy.The pureplay Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years although the top five positions have not changed much, according to research from Gartner.  (  ) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based  (  ). GlobalFoundries remains in the third position that it obtained in 2010, pushing the Chinese foundry  (  ) to number four. The only change was with respect to specialty foundry  (  ), which displaced Dongbu Hi-Tech to jump to the fifth position.A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment -- Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments' foundries make them two strong contenders with leading-edge capabilities.One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is  (  ), with its power-efficient, low-performance chip architecture that dominates the growing mobile phone and tablet markets. With new versions of ARM chips coming to market, it is likely that the chips will gradually spread to the server segment as well (not a 2012 phenomenon).Others would be  (  ), Samsung and Texas Instruments, all of which are big semiconductor manufacturers that use ARM architecture. As such, we remain relatively positive about Samsung and Qualcomm in 2012.We are also optimistic about Intel, given its successful new product ramps and focus on the data center segment. Although we remain cautious about  (  ) growth initiatives in mobile and believe that the macro situation remains a deterrent to Ultrabook sales, the company's market position, cash balance, technology lead, and management strategy and execution are positives in our opinion.Analog companies with a focus on the communications, industrial and automotive segments, such as Analog Devices,  (  ) and  (  ), as well as well-diversified companies such as  (  ) may be expected to hold up better than others in 2012.We believe that 2012 will be a transitional year, with inventory rebalancing and adjustment. Given the uncertainties in demand, we think that semiconductor manufacturers will curtail investment in capacity although technology purchases could continue. DRAM inventory remains in excess although the flash market is slightly better off.In this environment, we would avoid investment in equipment companies, such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ), etc. We particularly discourage investment in Applied Materials at this time because of its exposure to solar, where there is significant oversupply and resultant pricing pressure.The foundry segment will also have a moderate year, with the weaker-than-expected demand for mobile devices dampening growth prospects in the second half of the year. We therefore continue to believe that investors should treat foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor, United Microelectronics, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International with caution.Texas Instruments is also expected to have its own share of problems. The top line will continue to be impacted by the phasing out of the baseband business and it is now saddled with extra capacity that will most likely be under-utilized until demand increases significantly (not expected until 2013).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is up 12.73 to 2,741.27.

The substance is therefore suitable for high-power and high-frequency devices for application in stressful environments, such as in military or space equipment. However, the reaction to Silicon makes the substrate formation a bit tricky, which is the main reason for the smaller wafer sizes.Imec is working toward larger wafer sizes (its research produced 200mm wafers just last year).

The Surfscan SP3 System as it is called is a tool for inspecting the wafer surface with the ability to detect surface quality after deposition and/or etching and create maps of the surface that could facilitate correction.The drive toward 450mm wafers is increasing, with  (  ) putting $4 billion into  (  ) for the research and development of 450mm technology. The transition of larger wafer sizes is a big positive for the chip industry, since it enables significant cost reduction, thereby facilitating the move toward the mobile and emerging markets.Surfscan SP3 450 is the upgraded version of Surfscan SP2/SP2XP. The latest version has thrice the data processing capacity and better sensitivity, as well as higher resolution.All these qualities make it ideal for manufacturers to deliver superior quality wafers to meet the chip manufacturer's strict guidelines. The inspection equipment can be used at the chip level, or substrate level.To survive the cutthroat competition in the semiconductor industry, companies are scrambling to come out with sleeker and smarter devices at lower cost. Chipmakers are therefore under great pressure to provide increasingly complex devices at lower costs. This is playing into KLA's sweet spot, because its equipment is used to increase the efficiency of the manufacturing process.In the third quarter of 2012 and in fiscal 2011, KLAC earned 56.0% and 64.0% of revenue respectively from the defect inspection segment alone.

The nearly-8% surprise was more or less in line with the 8%+ average in the four preceding quarters (note that estimates dropped a penny in the last 7 days). Intel's commentary was also not overly exciting, so shares barely moved in response.Intel's reported revenue was $13.5 billion, in line with management's guidance range of $$13.6 billion (+/-$500 million). This was up 4.6% sequentially and 3.6% year over year.While PC inventories are lean, distributor orders remain conservative, mainly due to macro uncertainties and lower sales expectations ahead of the Windows 8 Launch from  (  ). Intel stated that the Ivy Bridge ramp was faster than expected, reaching 25% of PC volumes in the last quarter.Intel's longer-term strategy is playing out, with data center and enterprise remaining strong drivers. The emerging BRIC countries also continue to grow strongly, making up for the weakness in mature markets.The  segment generated 64% of revenue in the last quarter, up 2.8% sequentially and 4.4% year over year. Overall, enterprise remained the driver of growth, while consumer remained soft, which resulted in a better mix of business. Low penetration and a growing per capita income are increasing the popularity of computing devices in emerging markets, especially the BRIC countries. was the second largest group with a 21% revenue share. Segment revenue was up 14.3% sequentially and 15.1% year over year, as expected. The strength in the last quarter was largely on account of Romley (Sandy Bridge for servers), since customers had deferred purchases in the last quarter prior to its launch.The secular growth drivers here are increasing Internet usage by consumers all over the world, and the ongoing move towards virtualization and cloud computing. The high performance computing (HPC) segment is the fastest-growing segment within Intel's data center business.The  segment generated around 8% of Intel's revenue in the last quarter, growing 3.1% sequentially and declining 20.2% from last year.The  revenue contributed a little more than 4% of total revenue (similar to the last quarter). This was the first quarter that the year-over-year comp did not benefit from the acquisition. In addition to discrete sales, Intel is taking an integrated approach to McAfee's storage solutions, with the intention of further differentiating its products. This helped the very strong growth in each of the last five quarters.The  segment generated 2% of revenue, down 10.4% sequentially and 14.9% from the year-ago quarter.The Asia/Pacific market remained the largest in the last quarter, with a 58% contribution, with revenues growing 5.5% sequentially and 5.2% from a year ago. The Americas was the second largest region, with a 21% contribution, up 12.9% sequentially and down 0.9% year over year. Europe came in third with a 12% revenue share, representing a sequential decline of 7.1% and an increase of 5.6% from the second quarter of 2011. Japan stayed at number four, with a 9% contribution, representing a sequential decline of 1.2% and a year-over-year increase of 2.1%.The pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 64.4%, down 69 basis points (bps) sequentially and up 273 bps year over year, better than guidance of 62% at the mid-point. The sequential decline was related to the increase in Ivy Bridge ramp up costs (22nm). Of course, the positive mix related to higher enterprise and data center business and soft consumer sales in mature markets continued to work in its favor, while the strength in emerging markets remains an offsetting factor.Operating expenses of $4.6 billion were up 6.2% from the first quarter. The operating margin was 30.0%, down 120 bps sequentially and 181 bps year over year. Both R&D and SG&A were flattish as a percentage of sales from the previous quarter. While R&D increased significantly from last year, the increase in SG&A was not so much. Intel expects to contain hiring costs through the rest of the year, which is expected to maintain spending at these levels.The operating margins by segment were as follows-PC Client 39.3% (down 188 bps sequentially), Data Center 49.5% (up 294 bps), Other Intel Architecture -30.2% (down 121 bps) and Software and Services 2.4% (up 116 bps). The Software and Services margin was up 513 bps from the year-ago quarter, Data Center was up 11 bps, while other segment margins declined.The pro forma net income was $3.0 billion, or 22.0% of sales, compared to $2.9 billion, or 22.3% in the previous quarter and $3.1 billion or 23.9% in the comparable prior-year quarter. One-time items included intangibles amortization expenses on a tax-adjusted basis.Accordingly, the fully diluted GAAP net income was $2.8 billion, or 54 cents a share compared to $2.7 billion, or 53 cents per share in the previous quarter and $3.0 billion, or 54 cents in the year-ago quarter.Inventories increased 9.2% sequentially and annualized inventory turns were flat at 4.0X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 29 back to around 24. The cash, marketable securities and fixed income trading asset balance at quarter-end was $13.6 billion, down $105 million during the quarter. Intel has $7.1 billion in long-term debt and 92 million in short-term debt, resulting in a net cash balance of $6.5 billion.Cash flow from operations was around $5 billion. Important usages of cash in the last quarter included $2.66 billion on capex, $1.06 billion on dividends, $282 million on acquisitions and $41 million on share repurchases.Intel guided to revenue of around $14.3 billion (+/-$500 million), up 5.9% sequentially and flat with the September quarter of 2011 (slightly short of consensus estimates of $14.6 billion). Gross margin on a GAAP basis is expected to be around 63% (+/-2 percentage points), while on a non-GAAP basis, it is expected to be 64% (+/- 2 percentage points).Total operating expenses are expected to come in at around $4.6 billion. Management also expects to provide for depreciation of around $1.6 billion and intangibles amortization of around $80 million. Other income/expense and equity investments are expected to be nil. Applying the guided annual tax rate of 28%, net income comes to around $3.3 billion or 22.9% of revenue, which would be up sequentially, while declining year over year.For the year, Intel guided to a revenue increase of 3-5% from 2011, with the GAAP gross margin at 64% (+/- 2 percentage points) and non GAAP gross margin at 65% (+/- 2 percentage points) and operating expenses of $18.2 billion (+/- 200 million). The gross margin guidance was maintained while the operating margin guidance lowered by a $100 million from previous expectations. The full year tax rate is expected to be 28%, depreciation $6.3 billion (+/- $100 million) and capex $12.5 billion (+/- $400 million).Intel's top line numbers for the quarter were good, if not excellent. The company remains the leading producer of microprocessors for the PC market and there do not appear to be any near-term challenges to this position. Its innovative prowess has ensured that Intel is well ahead of its closest rival  (  ). Therefore what affects it mainly is the market itself.Intel's strategy has been correct here and the company has positioned itself strongly in emerging markets, from where most of the growth is expected to originate in the next few quarters. The enterprise segment remains a strong growth area for Intel and there should be continued growth here in both emerging and mature markets.Additionally, the PC client business will see the usual jump in response to Microsoft's new Windows platform. One thing to note here is the relatively low inventory levels at distributors that are the result of uncertain economic conditions.Intel also remains totally focused on the mobile segment, which has the potential of eating into its core computing business. While Intel's ultrabook concept is still a far cry from  (  ) iPad, we may expect some growth this year, with all the new devices from  (  ),  (  ), Lenovo and so forth.Although Microsoft's Windows 8 (to launch later this year) will also be compatible with ARM architecture, Intel is likely to be one of the major beneficiaries, given the level of its support and the broader reach of its products across the world. We think Intel's consistent focus on emerging markets will be a key to its growth in the next few quarters.All that being said, Intel has yet to prove itself in the mobile segment (mainly tablets and smartphones), which continues to weigh on investor sentiments. The fact that ARM devices are also getting into the server segment is also a concern.However, while the server impact could take a couple of years and Intel could have something to counter this threat by then, Intel really needs to buck up its mobile strategy. Failing to do this will see its revenues dwindling, as tablets continue to cannibalize its core computing market.The concerns related to the economy, consumer spending and distributor inventory levels are relatively near-term issues and the reasons behind the Zacks #4 Rank (Sell). We also think the company's fate in the mobile segment is currently hanging in balance, as initial pickup of ultrabooks was slower than expected (likely because of the many new tablets and Windows 8 anticipation).However, we note that Intel has grown revenues at strong double-digit rates in each of the last two fiscal years despite the fact that it is the leading player in a market going through significant ups and downs. Intel's initiatives, such as the recent investment in  (  ) to reduce die costs by 30-40%, are the reasons for its technology leadership. We think that strategic planning and resources are things to consider when investing in a company such as Intel. We remain Neutral on a long term (3-6 month) basis.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions, and so forth.The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This has led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.However, since innovation remains largely within the country, the sector is one of the biggest employers of labor, with a corresponding significant impact on the overall economy.From the earthquake and Tsunami in Japan to the flooding in Thailand, the industry suffered huge setbacks in 2011. The challenges came not just from natural disasters, but also from a generally weak global economy (especially in Europe) and sagging consumer confidence.Global sales of semiconductor devices touched $299.5 billion for the year, increasing 0.4% from 2010, when revenues were up 31.8%. The SIA was originally looking for growth of around 6% in 2011, which dropped a notch to 5.4% by mid-year. However, in December, growth expectations slipped to 1.3%, though actual growth was even short of these expectations.The primary segments responsible for the slight increase from the prior year were optoelectronics (used to improve energy efficiency in mobile devices and cameras); sensors and actuators (used to improve safety and efficiency in consumer electronics, medical devices and automotive systems, as well as smartphones, tablets and other consumer electronic devices); and microprocessors (used predominantly in computing devices).The SIA stated that sales should be more or less steady for another quarter and strengthen thereafter. However, macro concerns may be expected to continue.These two end markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have the ability to significantly influence total sector performance.A number of factors are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. Gone are the days when component suppliers were limited by a maturing market, worsened by commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures. (  ) Windows 7 continues to drive sales at enterprise customers, while Windows 8 is expected to speed up adoption of mobile devices. Even with operating systems such as  (  ) Macintosh platform, and cloud alternatives such as  (  ) Chrome coming to market, Windows 7 adoption rates have held up relatively well.Second, Apple's run of success is a big driver, since the Macintosh OS runs on Apple devices alone, which means more hardware and consequently, more semiconductor devices being sold. Third, with the advent of less sophisticated and ultra mobile devices (netbooks, tablets and now ultrabooks), the market continues to expand. Fourth, increased computerization in emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and Russia are also helping growth.Perhaps the biggest driver of business is the growth in the data center segment, which is currently being driven by the move to cloud computing. The segment has increased focus on servers, storage and networking equipment that consume semiconductors of the high-end variety.Cost advantages are encouraging many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as some large organizations, to transfer either a part or the whole of their operations to the cloud. We expect this change to be a major driver of growth for the industry in the foreseeable future.With ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.The Consumer Electronics Association (\"CEA\") expects global consumer electronics sales to be up 5% this year, driven by strength in emerging Asia/Pacific countries (to grow 18%), Middle East and Africa (11%), Latin America (11%) and Central/Eastern Europe (9%). North America is expected to be flat, while both developed Asia/Pacific countries and Western Europe are expected to decline. The products expected to drive this growth are tablets (up 59%), smartphones (22%), home audio (5%) and mobile PCs (3%).Communications infrastructure spending is currently being driven by China and India. The SIA expects infrastructure spending in these geographies to remain the major driver of semiconductor sales. The domestic market will be driven by increasing data volumes.Medical Devices is an upcoming area, and semiconductors targeted at this market are beginning to do well.The automotive end market is an emerging area for semiconductors. The growing electronic content within this market is a secular trend, as demand for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continue to increase. As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years, although we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy-making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) has started to look up, given the increasing passenger and cargo traffic. Production increases should be a positive for the semiconductor industry.The outlook for defense spending, on the other hand, is not as bright. Moreover, the focus on terrorist activity remains, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry is still strong. A longer-term driver for semiconductor manufacturers is the growing importance of electronic weaponry. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.Given the end markets driving the current strength in the industry, we believe that manufacturers of flash memory (particularly NAND and also NOR) will continue to see strong demand (although temporary periods of over-supply will impact sales). DRAM is likely to see another difficult year, while logic sees improvement.The demand for greater functionality in smaller and more power efficient gadgets is leading to greater integration within the semiconductor device. This is leading to increased demand for the system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is a single device incorporating a microprocessor, digital signal processor or graphics core, as well as memory and logic.Within SoCs, both application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products are expected to do well (ASICs are usually customized for a single buyer, while ASSPs may have multiple buyers).The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs-whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.According to estimates from IHS iSuppli,  (  ) and Samsung remained the top two semiconductor suppliers in 2011, while  (  ) overtook Toshiba Corp. to attain the number three position (helped by the National Semiconductor acquisition).Renesas remained at number 5, followed by  (  ), which moved up from the ninth position in 2010.  (  ) remained at number 7, with Hynix,  (  ) and  (  ) in the eighth, ninth and tenth positions, respectively.  (  ) crept up from number 12 to number 11.Gartner estimates that spending on semiconductor capital equipment increased 13.7% in 2011, on top of a 118.4% increase in 2010. The increase was almost totally driven by wafer fab equipment (\"WFE\"), with other segments declining mid-single-digits.However, the research firm expects the equipment market to decline 19.5% to around $52 billion in 2012, growing 19.2% the following year. The decline is expected to be across all segments -- WFE declining 22.9%, automated test equipment (\"ATE\") declining 16.5% and packaging assembly equipment (\"PAE\") declining 13.5%.SEMI estimates are slightly different. The research firm expects semiconductor equipment sales to decline 10.8% this year, following a 4.7% increase in 2011. The research firm expects all geographies except South Korea to decline in 2012, and rebound thereafter in 2013.The increased spending on technology upgrades during 2011 resulted in sufficient capacity for 2012 and 2013. However, the growing demand for semiconductors is likely to encourage the next wave of spending some time in 2013. At that time, we are likely to see some new fabs, which were averted to an extent in the current cycle through the use of superior technology.Moreover, given that the growth in mobile computing and consumer electronic devices is likely to outpace growth in all other semiconductor applications, memory manufacturing capacity should increase the most.Latest research from VLSI shows that  (  ) surpassed  (  ) to attain the number one spot in 2011. This was possible because of increased spending on lithography tools during the year.Therefore, while the top 15 equipment suppliers grew just 13%, ASML and Nikkon (another supplier of lithography tools) together grew 27%. Tokyo Electron,  (  ) and  (  ) occupied the next three positions, respectively.However, the story could change again in 2012, because of consolidation in the market. This year, Applied will include Varian (currently number 13 from 10 months as an independent company in 2011), Lam will merge with  (  ) (currently number 10) and Advantest (number 8) will include a full year of Verigy.The pureplay Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years although the top five positions have not changed much, according to research from Gartner.  (  ) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based  (  ). GlobalFoundries remains in the third position that it obtained in 2010, pushing the Chinese foundry  (  ) to number four. The only change was with respect to specialty foundry  (  ), which displaced Dongbu Hi-Tech to jump to the fifth position.A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment - Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments' foundries make them two strong contenders with leading edge capabilities.Manufacturing digital ICs is expensive, as it requires state-of-the-art technology and processes. On the other hand, digital products are cheaper, so cost recovery is more difficult. This has led to specialization in the industry and a greater contribution from Asian manufacturers. However, a significant portion of the intellectual property remains with the domestic companies.One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is  (  ), with its power-efficient, low-performance chip architecture that dominates the growing mobile phone and tablet markets. With new versions of ARM chips coming to market, it is likely that the chips will gradually spread to the server segment as well (probably not a 2012 phenomenon).Others would be  (  ), Samsung and Texas Instruments, all of which are big semiconductor manufacturers that use ARM architecture. As such, we remain relatively positive about Samsung and Qualcomm in 2012.We are also optimistic about Intel and AMD, given their new product ramps and focus on the data center segment. Although we are a wee bit cautious about Intel's growth initiatives in mobile and believe that execution will be key to delivering on its plans, the company's market position, cash balance, technology lead and management strategy and execution are positives in our opinion.AMD is also worth watching, as management has been delivering on its promises. Moreover, the company is seeing some real success in its graphics business, which should complement initiatives targeted at rationalizing its debt, increasing focus on R&D and operation of a lower-cost model.The analog and mixed-signal market is dependent on innovation. Consequently, these products generate higher margins than digital products. They are also more customized and have longer life cycles.Most of these companies are seeing somewhat stronger demand right now, although there are some issues based lingering effects of the Thailand floods and economic sluggishness. We are particularly positive about  (  ), given its recent deal wins, product cycles, order rebound and position in the communications market.Companies like  (  ), which has a focus on the automotive end market that should do well this year, or  (  ) and  (  ), which are expected to benefit from growth trends in the computing end market.We believe that 2012 will be a transitional year, with inventory rebalancing and adjustment. Given the uncertainties in demand, we think that semiconductor manufacturers will curtail investment in capacity although technology purchases could continue. DRAM inventory remains in excess although the flash market is slightly better off.In this environment, we would avoid investment in equipment companies, such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ), etc. We particularly discourage investment in Applied Materials at this time because of its exposure to solar, where there is significant oversupply and resultant pricing pressure.The foundry segment will also have a moderate year, although the second half should be somewhat better. We therefore continue to believe that investors should treat foundries, such as  (  ),  (  ), and  (  ) with caution.We have turned more cautious about Analog Devices, given that nearly half its revenue comes from the industrial market, which appears sluggish.  (  ) is also expected to have its own share of problems. The top line will continue to be impacted by the phasing out of the baseband business and it is now saddled with extra capacity that will most likely be under-utilized until demand increases significantly (not expected until 2013).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.

Specifically, Novellus shareholders will get 1.125 shares of Lam stock for each Novellus share, or roughly a 28.0% premium based on Lam's closing prices yesterday.The agreement gives Lam shareholders a 59% share of the combined entity, which will continue to be called Lam Research Corp. The remaining 41% will go to Novellus shareholders.Lam will also spend around $1.6 billion for share repurchases over the next year utilizing the existing domestic cash balances of both companies. This system is more beneficial for Novellus shareholders, as it makes the distribution tax-free. It is also positive for Lam, since it would not have to fork out any cash right away (as could have been the case if it was a cash-and-stock purchase).The transaction, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012 subject to statutory closing conditions and shareholder approval of both companies, is a no-brainer, since the companies complement each other in many respects.Most importantly, they sell complementary front-end equipment. Novellus specializes in thin-film deposition and surface preparation equipment, while Lam is a leading provider of etching and cleaning equipment.Semiconductor manufacturing refers to the deposition of several layers of materials on a silicon wafer in specific patterns using photomasks, or reticles (held down like a stencil). However, after the deposition of each layer, the excess material deposited is etched (or \"cleaned\") away and the remaining material is exposed in a manner that changes the chemical properties of the wafer.Therefore, after the merger, Lam's product line would be considerably broader, taking care of a greater portion of key semiconductor manufacturing processes.Combining resources would also be beneficial for the R&D teams, which could put their heads together to develop solutions for 450mm wafers and three dimensional chip architectures. A focus on advanced technologies is a must in the current environment, where newer generations of computing devices and phones are increasing chip complexities, while growing demand from emerging countries is a constant pressure to lower costs.Naturally, the combination would also enable significant cross-selling opportunities for both Novellus and Lam sales teams, helping to drive penetration at existing customer accounts.In addition to these advantages, the merged company would be able to eliminate $100 million in costs a year (starting from the fourth quarter of 2013). The companies have also stated that the transaction would be accretive to non GAAP earnings within the first year after the deal closes.Lam's competitive position also improves, with the company now moving to the fourth spot among semi equipment makers, behind  (  ), Tokyo Electron and  (  ).There have been a number of big consolidations in the semiconductor sector in recent times and we are reminded of Applied Material's acquisition of Varian Semiconductor and  (  ) takeover of National Semiconductor.We think that the primary concern for semiconductor companies is the uncertain economic climate and weak consumer spending that has increased the need for cost control. For example, in the last reported quarter, Lam and Novellus saw their profits shrinking 63% and 30%, respectively. The fact that this concern has also kept a lid on prices is a bonus, because it means that acquiring companies have to pay relatively less.For equipment makers, the outlook is decidedly murky, with Gartner projecting a 23% decline in wafer fabrication equipment in 2012, following an expected 10% increase this year.Lam and Novellus have entered into a mutually beneficial agreement in particularly trying times. We believe that the deal makes sense because synergies look significant right now. Also, considering the fact that the premium is not too high, Lam shareholders are likely to approve.The fact that it is a tax-free distribution is likely to appeal to Novellus shareholders. Since the combined entity strengthens competition, legal hurdles are also likely to be limited. Therefore, the deal should go through smoothly.Both Lam Research and Novellus have a Zacks Rank of #3, translating into a Hold rating in the near term (1-3 months).Want more from Zacks Equity Research?

Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions, and so forth.The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This has led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.However, since innovation remains largely within the country, the sector is one of the biggest employers of labor, with a corresponding significant impact on the overall economy.From the earthquake and Tsunami in Japan to the flooding in Thailand, the industry suffered huge setbacks in 2011. The challenges came not just from natural disasters, but also from a generally weak global economy (especially in Europe) and sagging consumer confidence.Global sales of semiconductor devices touched $299.5 billion for the year, increasing 0.4% from 2010, when revenues were up 31.8%. The SIA was originally looking for growth of around 6% in 2011, which dropped a notch to 5.4% by mid-year. However, in December, growth expectations slipped to 1.3%, though actual growth was even short of these expectations.The primary segments responsible for the slight increase from the prior year were optoelectronics (used to improve energy efficiency in mobile devices and cameras); sensors and actuators (used to improve safety and efficiency in consumer electronics, medical devices and automotive systems, as well as smartphones, tablets and other consumer electronic devices); and microprocessors (used predominantly in computing devices).The SIA stated that sales should be more or less steady for another quarter and strengthen thereafter. However, macro concerns may be expected to continue.These two end markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have the ability to significantly influence total sector performance.A number of factors are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. Gone are the days when component suppliers were limited by a maturing market, worsened by commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures. (  ) Windows 7 continues to drive sales at enterprise customers, while Windows 8 is expected to speed up adoption of mobile devices. Even with operating systems such as  (  ) Macintosh platform, and cloud alternatives such as  (  ) Chrome coming to market, Windows 7 adoption rates have held up relatively well.Second, Apple's run of success is a big driver, since the Macintosh OS runs on Apple devices alone, which means more hardware and consequently, more semiconductor devices being sold. Third, with the advent of less sophisticated and ultra mobile devices (netbooks, tablets and now ultrabooks), the market continues to expand. Fourth, increased computerization in emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and Russia are also helping growth.Perhaps the biggest driver of business is the growth in the data center segment, which is currently being driven by the move to cloud computing. The segment has increased focus on servers, storage and networking equipment that consume semiconductors of the high-end variety.Cost advantages are encouraging many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as some large organizations, to transfer either a part or the whole of their operations to the cloud. We expect this change to be a major driver of growth for the industry in the foreseeable future.With ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.The Consumer Electronics Association (\"CEA\") expects global consumer electronics sales to be up 5% this year, driven by strength in emerging Asia/Pacific countries (to grow 18%), Middle East and Africa (11%), Latin America (11%) and Central/Eastern Europe (9%). North America is expected to be flat, while both developed Asia/Pacific countries and Western Europe are expected to decline. The products expected to drive this growth are tablets (up 59%), smartphones (22%), home audio (5%) and mobile PCs (3%).Communications infrastructure spending is currently being driven by China and India. The SIA expects infrastructure spending in these geographies to remain the major driver of semiconductor sales. The domestic market will be driven by increasing data volumes.Medical Devices is an upcoming area, and semiconductors targeted at this market are beginning to do well.The automotive end market is an emerging area for semiconductors. The growing electronic content within this market is a secular trend, as demand for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continue to increase. As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years, although we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy-making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) has started to look up, given the increasing passenger and cargo traffic. Production increases should be a positive for the semiconductor industry.The outlook for defense spending, on the other hand, is not as bright. Moreover, the focus on terrorist activity remains, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry is still strong. A longer-term driver for semiconductor manufacturers is the growing importance of electronic weaponry. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.Given the end markets driving the current strength in the industry, we believe that manufacturers of flash memory (particularly NAND and also NOR) will continue to see strong demand (although temporary periods of over-supply will impact sales). DRAM is likely to see another difficult year, while logic sees improvement.The demand for greater functionality in smaller and more power efficient gadgets is leading to greater integration within the semiconductor device. This is leading to increased demand for the system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is a single device incorporating a microprocessor, digital signal processor or graphics core, as well as memory and logic.Within SoCs, both application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products are expected to do well (ASICs are usually customized for a single buyer, while ASSPs may have multiple buyers).The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs-whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.According to estimates from IHS iSuppli,  (  ) and Samsung remained the top two semiconductor suppliers in 2011, while  (  ) overtook Toshiba Corp. to attain the number three position (helped by the National Semiconductor acquisition).Renesas remained at number 5, followed by  (  ), which moved up from the ninth position in 2010.  (  ) remained at number 7, with Hynix,  (  ) and  (  ) in the eighth, ninth and tenth positions, respectively.  (  ) crept up from number 12 to number 11.Gartner estimates that spending on semiconductor capital equipment increased 13.7% in 2011, on top of a 118.4% increase in 2010. The increase was almost totally driven by wafer fab equipment (\"WFE\"), with other segments declining mid-single-digits.However, the research firm expects the equipment market to decline 19.5% to around $52 billion in 2012, growing 19.2% the following year. The decline is expected to be across all segments -- WFE declining 22.9%, automated test equipment (\"ATE\") declining 16.5% and packaging assembly equipment (\"PAE\") declining 13.5%.SEMI estimates are slightly different. The research firm expects semiconductor equipment sales to decline 10.8% this year, following a 4.7% increase in 2011. The research firm expects all geographies except South Korea to decline in 2012, and rebound thereafter in 2013.The increased spending on technology upgrades during 2011 resulted in sufficient capacity for 2012 and 2013. However, the growing demand for semiconductors is likely to encourage the next wave of spending some time in 2013. At that time, we are likely to see some new fabs, which were averted to an extent in the current cycle through the use of superior technology.Moreover, given that the growth in mobile computing and consumer electronic devices is likely to outpace growth in all other semiconductor applications, memory manufacturing capacity should increase the most.Latest research from VLSI shows that  (  ) surpassed  (  ) to attain the number one spot in 2011. This was possible because of increased spending on lithography tools during the year.Therefore, while the top 15 equipment suppliers grew just 13%, ASML and Nikkon (another supplier of lithography tools) together grew 27%. Tokyo Electron,  (  ) and  (  ) occupied the next three positions, respectively.However, the story could change again in 2012, because of consolidation in the market. This year, Applied will include Varian (currently number 13 from 10 months as an independent company in 2011), Lam will merge with  (  ) (currently number 10) and Advantest (number 8) will include a full year of Verigy.The pureplay Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years although the top five positions have not changed much, according to research from Gartner.  (  ) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based  (  ). GlobalFoundries remains in the third position that it obtained in 2010, pushing the Chinese foundry  (  ) to number four. The only change was with respect to specialty foundry  (  ), which displaced Dongbu Hi-Tech to jump to the fifth position.A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment - Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments' foundries make them two strong contenders with leading edge capabilities.Manufacturing digital ICs is expensive, as it requires state-of-the-art technology and processes. On the other hand, digital products are cheaper, so cost recovery is more difficult. This has led to specialization in the industry and a greater contribution from Asian manufacturers. However, a significant portion of the intellectual property remains with the domestic companies.One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is  (  ), with its power-efficient, low-performance chip architecture that dominates the growing mobile phone and tablet markets. With new versions of ARM chips coming to market, it is likely that the chips will gradually spread to the server segment as well (probably not a 2012 phenomenon).Others would be  (  ), Samsung and Texas Instruments, all of which are big semiconductor manufacturers that use ARM architecture. As such, we remain relatively positive about Samsung and Qualcomm in 2012.We are also optimistic about Intel and AMD, given their new product ramps and focus on the data center segment. Although we are a wee bit cautious about Intel's growth initiatives in mobile and believe that execution will be key to delivering on its plans, the company's market position, cash balance, technology lead and management strategy and execution are positives in our opinion.AMD is also worth watching, as management has been delivering on its promises. Moreover, the company is seeing some real success in its graphics business, which should complement initiatives targeted at rationalizing its debt, increasing focus on R&D and operation of a lower-cost model.The analog and mixed-signal market is dependent on innovation. Consequently, these products generate higher margins than digital products. They are also more customized and have longer life cycles.Most of these companies are seeing somewhat stronger demand right now, although there are some issues based lingering effects of the Thailand floods and economic sluggishness. We are particularly positive about  (  ), given its recent deal wins, product cycles, order rebound and position in the communications market.Companies like  (  ), which has a focus on the automotive end market that should do well this year, or  (  ) and  (  ), which are expected to benefit from growth trends in the computing end market.We believe that 2012 will be a transitional year, with inventory rebalancing and adjustment. Given the uncertainties in demand, we think that semiconductor manufacturers will curtail investment in capacity although technology purchases could continue. DRAM inventory remains in excess although the flash market is slightly better off.In this environment, we would avoid investment in equipment companies, such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ), etc. We particularly discourage investment in Applied Materials at this time because of its exposure to solar, where there is significant oversupply and resultant pricing pressure.The foundry segment will also have a moderate year, although the second half should be somewhat better. We therefore continue to believe that investors should treat foundries, such as  (  ),  (  ), and  (  ) with caution.We have turned more cautious about Analog Devices, given that nearly half its revenue comes from the industrial market, which appears sluggish.  (  ) is also expected to have its own share of problems. The top line will continue to be impacted by the phasing out of the baseband business and it is now saddled with extra capacity that will most likely be under-utilized until demand increases significantly (not expected until 2013).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ere are 5 stocks added to the Zacks #1 Rank (\"strong buy\") List today:View the entire  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is down -7.22 to 2,719.7.

Their material is essentially the foundation of modern technology, and many companies in the tech sector work to support and develop its many applications.We wanted to analyze these companies to find those with the most encouraging sales trends over the last year. We did this by comparing quarterly inventory growth to revenue growth year-over-year.Inventory can represent two things: the company\u2019s expectation of what they will soon sell, and also what the company has not yet sold. Therefore, a growing inventory by itself can mean a more positive sales outlook, or the inability to sell products.But when compared with revenue growth, changes in inventory paint a clearer picture. If inventory grows faster than revenue, it probably indicates that the company is having trouble selling its inventory. If inventory grows slower, it may indicate that the company is selling even more than they anticipated.Of course, other explanations can exist such as changes in company policy.We screened the tech sector for stocks in the semiconductor sub-industry. Looking at approx. 150 semiconductors, we compared changes in quarterly inventory y/y to changes in quarterly revenue.To screen for the companies with the most encouraging sales trends, we found growth in quarterly revenue out-pacing growth in inventory, as well as inventory becoming a smaller portion of current assets.Below we list the top 10 stocks based on the difference between revenue growth and changes in inventory.Do you think these semiconductors are selling well?

One idea is to find which reporting companies are carrying the highest amounts of cash \u2013 those with higher cash holdings may be financially healthier and better positioned for a lower-than-expected earnings report.Among the companies reporting earnings this week, we found 12 with high levered free cashflow relative to market cap. We report this percentage, as well as other interesting data on these companies.Levered free cash flow is the free cash flow available after paying interest to bondholders and re-paying any principal as it comes due. From this cash flow, the Board can decide to pay all or some in dividends to shareholders, or re-invest the money back into the firm to support growth. Because both dividends and firm growth are valuable to shareholders, levered free cash flow is a particularly relevant measure to consider.What will you be looking for this earnings season?

Revenue, on an adjusted basis, docked at $25.79 billion. Analysts, on average, were expecting the blue chip to record a quarterly profit of $1.16 on sales of $25.27 billion.

He is now the single largest shareholder in the company.Buffett always said he would not invest in technology because he more-or-less did not understand it, nor how consumers would interact with it in the future \u2013 something he was more confident with in relation to banks or consumer goods like Pepsi and chewing gum.\u201cIn an interview on cable television network CNBC, Buffett said he was struck by IBM\u2019s ability to retain corporate clients, which made it indispensable in a way that few other services are,\u201d reports .

That positive bias has carried over into premarket activity this morning, as futures on the DJIA and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) are trading 29 points and 2.2 points above fair value, respectively. Earnings will be front and center once again, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (  ) picking up where Apple and IBM Corp. (  ) left off last night. Also, December housing starts and building permits could also create some turmoil heading into the open.Technically, the DJIA bulls appear to have their sights set on the 12,000 level, after the blue chip barometer blew past 11,800 yesterday. Still, the Dow must surmount the 11,900 level, which capped the DJIA in the last few days of June 2008, and again on Aug. 11, 2008. Look for support to materialize in the 11,800-11,750 region.

Each one rallied on the reports.Advanced Micro Devices, which makes computer processors, kept the winning streak alive yesterday afternoon when it surpassed earnings forecasts by nearly 100 percent on a revenue beat of $100 million. Like rival Intel, which crushed its numbers two days earlier, AMD also had enough confidence in future demand to provide aggressive guidance.Earlier in the week ASML and Novellus, whose equipment is used to make semiconductors, reported similarly strong numbers.On one hand, the companies are benefiting from the same trend of falling costs that have occurred across most businesses. But the important driver that distinguishes chipmakers from other manufacturers is that we appear to be in the midst of secular boom for their products that could make the 1990s tech revolution look like child's play. One reason is the huge surge in wireless devices, which were still in their infancy 10-15 years ago. The second reason is globalization. In May 1999, for instance, global chip sales totaled $11.3 billion, of which $6.1 billion occurred in the Americas and Europe. Fast-forward 11 years to May 2010, and global sales had more than doubled to a record $24.7 billion, but the Americas and Europe had only inched higher to a mere $7.4 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.Corporate spending is another driver because companies are buying both desktop computers and migrating their applications from in-house servers to cloud-computing services run by companies such as NetApp and EMC, and powered with software from companies such as VMware.INTC's data-center segment, for instance, recorded a staggering 42 percent revenue gain versus last year. Its PC-related business grew a more modest 31 percent.Digital Realty Trust illustrates the strength of the trend. While it's structured as a real-estate investment trust, its property consists of buildings to house the same cyber clouds. This has kept DLR immune from the other problems in the real-estate sector, and caused its shares to rally 13 percent in the last three months while the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index exchange-traded fund (  ) is down 4 percent in the same period. DLR is also trading near its all-time highs, while the average REIT is down by almost half since early 2007.The market does a great job of digesting all of this information, and it clearly sensed the positive developments in semiconductors before the numbers were announced. Over the 20-session period ended last Friday, call volume in the sector was 78 percent greater than put volume. And, the calls were heavily bought rather than sold, which indicates a strongly bullish sentiment.Adtran showed that the bullish trend extends to the networking sector when its second-quarter results crushed forecasts. The shares gapped higher on Wednesday and proceeded to trade at their highest price since late 2005.However, the strength in technology didn't extend to Google, which is showing both weakening top-line performance and a worrying growth in its cost structure. Revenue beat forecasts by less than 2 percent but its earnings badly missed because its headcount surged 6 percent sequentially.The news was similar to the headlines from Infosys, where higher employee costs took a bite out of profitability and caused the shares to gap lower on Wednesday. Given that the whole point of outsourcing work to India is the access to cheap labor, this trend could also prove a new long-term threat to the company's business model--especially with U.S. wages stagnant.Earnings reports will shift to big financials today as investors digest numbers from Bank of America, Citigroup, and General Electric, which has a large financial component.
