In this midst of this success, now seems an opportune time to assess new risks that might impair the company's business model over the next several years.During Copart's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings conference call last month, an analyst asked for management's perspective on the rise of car-sharing, and the potential for a reduction in individual vehicle ownership as car fleets tied to ride-hailing businesses grow more prevalent. The question addressed the risk that declining car ownership could translate to fewer vehicles available for auction.CEO Jay Adair offered the insight that automobile ownership doesn't rest on practical considerations alone. Adair pointed out that at least in America, car owners choose vehicles for reasons extending past utility. We buy cars even where mass transportation is readily available. Many purchasers opt for new vehicles replete with the latest technology when a used, utilitarian car might do. Adair also cited brand attachment as a purchase factor: \"[T]here is nothing practical about buying a Mercedes-Benz or a BMW or any luxury car. It's a personal choice.\"Adair's point is that the appearance of ride-hailing services may increase, rather than decrease, the number of vehicles on the road. I find this reasoning persuasive. Classical economic theory assumes that consumers nearly always make rational choices that benefit their finances over the long term. Yet as Adair argues, consumption is often personal, and non-exclusive. You can be an avid user of Uber and still overspend on a luxury vehicle. Those who predict that we'll ditch personal car ownership once car-sharing options are ubiquitous may be overrelying on textbook interpretations of supply and demand.END", "Investors in Copart Inc (Symbol: CPRT) saw new options begin trading this week, for the May 2020 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 226 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CPRT options chain for the new May 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $75.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $70.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $78.09/share today.\n\nBecause the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.13% return on the cash commitment, or 9.91% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart Inc, and highlighting in green where the $75.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND", "Copart (NASDAQ: CPRT), an online automotive auction company, reported its fourth-quarter results on Sept. 4, with sales spiking 20.8% to $542.6 million.
