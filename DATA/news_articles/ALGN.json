The average 12-month price target for ALGN - averaging the work of 13 analysts - reveals an average price target of $387.38/share. That's a whopping -1.06% below where ALGN has been trading recently at $391.52/share. With this kind of downside potential (should ALGN fall to that price target), one might expect to see a high concentration of \"hold\" or even \"sell\" ratings on the stock.

In the middle, 3 would be a Hold. So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment. The average rating of 1.43 for ALGN leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the ALGN price target paints a different picture. Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at Align Technology Inc. Of course, the average price target is just that - a mathematical average, and is only one metric. There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $456.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $305.00. The standard deviation is $53.787.But the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes - much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close. And so with ALGN trading so far above that average target price of $387.38/share, the -1.06% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good \"signal\" to investors in ALGN to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Align Technology Inc.

The average 12-month price target for ALGN - averaging the work of 12 analysts - reveals an average price target of $322.17/share. That's a whopping -11.66% below where ALGN has been trading recently at $364.70/share. With this kind of downside potential (should ALGN fall to that price target), one might expect to see a high concentration of \"hold\" or even \"sell\" ratings on the stock.

In the middle, 3 would be a Hold. So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment. The average rating of 1.43 for ALGN leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the ALGN price target paints a different picture. Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at Align Technology Inc. Of course, the average price target is just that - a mathematical average, and is only one metric. There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $360.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $250.00. The standard deviation is $36.963.But the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes - much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close. And so with ALGN trading so far above that average target price of $322.17/share, the -11.66% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good \"signal\" to investors in ALGN to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Align Technology Inc.

A big red flag according to Jackson is that a lot of executives use stock buybacks as a way for them to take profits.\"What did  surprise us, however, was how commonplace it is for executives to use buybacks as a chance to cash out. In half  of the buybacks we studied, at least one executive sold shares in the month following the buyback announcement,\" Jackson told the audience. \"In fact, twice as many companies have insiders selling in the eight days after a buyback announcement as sell on an ordinary day.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2020 put at the $240 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $19.10. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 8% return against the $240 commitment, or a 4.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ALGN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $240 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. ( Do options carry counterparty risk? This and six other common options myths debunked ). So unless Align Technology Inc sees its shares fall 30.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $220.90 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $19.10 from $240), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.9% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Align Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $240 strike is located relative to that history:END", "Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts.

After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn't tell you if it has been decelerating.Seasonal fluctuations also come into play. If a company's Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline.

It also could be skewed by a one-time impact to earnings over the last 12 months.Although it's still an imperfect measurement, I think we can use the forward price-to-earnings multiple to compare healthcare stocks to identify the most expensive.

Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Align Technology Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $230.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $335.00. The standard deviation is $34.044.But the whole reason to look at the average ALGN price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ALGN crossing above that average target price of $270.56/share, investors in ALGN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $270.56 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Most economists consider this coming together of two stalwarts - consolidation of CVS Health's pharmacy benefit management (\"PBM\") business with Aetna's large and unshakable insurance base - as a new dimension added to healthcare landscape. However, critics are of the view that the gains from this combined entity will be short-lived for the healthcare society at large to benefit from.Vision in Favor of the DealPeople supporting this proposed integration between CVS Health and Aetna opine that this merger has fair chances to pass the regulatory hurdles. They see this consolidation as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one, thus leading to efficiency gain and a formidable cost-cutting strategy of CVS Health's PBM platform. Notably, a horizontal integration dreads the chances of forming a monopoly powerhouse in the market.An article by Dana Blankenhorn published in InvestorPlace stated that based on this $69 billion deal, insurers will finally achieve the vertical integration they need to control costs. Per the article, the Humana HUM acquisition deal proposed by Aetna was earlier rejected by the Obama administration because of its horizontal acquisition.The economists lapping up the deal are looking much forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put the brakes on America's soaring health-care costs.

In the middle, 3 would be a Hold. So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment. The average rating of 1.0 for ALGN leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the ALGN price target paints a different picture. Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at Align Technology Inc. Of course, the average price target is just that - a mathematical average, and is only one metric. There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $335.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $190.00. The standard deviation is $44.014.But the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes - much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close. And so with ALGN trading so far above that average target price of $250.00/share, the -5.39% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good \"signal\" to investors in ALGN to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Align Technology Inc.

In fact, a research report by CNBC reveals that Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, slammed the new tax code as a \"a big giveaway to millionaires and corporations,\" neglecting the ones who are in real need of it.END", "A lot has been said about the President's latest and most-controversial $1.5 trillion tax move and its impact on the economy once it's passed. So far, the reaction of the hoi polloi has been mixed with people in favor of the Republicans treating the latest move as a big stimulant for economic growth that could offset any financial deficit. According to them, this new system will replace the existing \"complicated, antiquated, and unfair\" tax code that has not been updated for more than 30 years.Opponents, however, slammed the new plan as a 'job killer'. Per a report by The New York Times, \"critics say a deficit-financed tax cut is at odds with longstanding Republican calls for fiscal discipline, including that tax cuts not add to the ballooning federal deficit. The federal debt topped $20 trillion earlier this month and is projected to grow by another $10 trillion over the next decade.\"No Talk on MedTech Tax RepealThere is still lack of clarity in the MedTech space, which is unable to gauge the impending impact of the latest tax bill. In this regard, we note that the community was extremely hopeful about Trump's regulatory agenda as it promised the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device tax.The dreaded tax, commonly addressed as 'fund of the ACA', dealt a heavy blow to the medical device industry since its enactment in 2013. This tax, imposed on the selling price instead of net profit and amounting to a stupendous sum, wiped out almost a quarter of the profit of medical technology companies.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Align Technology Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $140.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $205.00. The standard deviation is $18.678.But the whole reason to look at the average ALGN price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ALGN crossing above that average target price of $185.30/share, investors in ALGN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $185.30 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 858 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ALGN options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $175.00 strike price has a current bid of $26.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $175.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $148.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ALGN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $182.92/share today.Because the $175.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract .

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Align Technology Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $132.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $164.00. The standard deviation is $9.378.But the whole reason to look at the average ALGN price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

Thus, investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.A Detailed Look into Driehaus' StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: \"I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.\" In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus' philosophy.END", "END", "The following companies are expected to report earnings after hours on 11/07/2016.

Proceeding to the last lap of the earnings reporting cycle, we are further assured about this quarter being the first to witness earnings growth after five back-to-back quarters of earnings declines for the S&P 500 index.Total earnings for these 364 companies are up 1.6% year over year on 1.6% higher revenues, with 72.3% beating EPS estimates and 54.7% exceeding top-line expectations.

The sector has witnessed 6% earnings growth on the back of 7.6% higher revenues in the third quarter.What's in Store for the Med-Product Space?Medical product, a niche area under the medical device subcategory within the broader Medical sector, holds a lot of promise at the moment thanks to the temporary two-year suspension of the controversial 2.3% medical device excise tax which took a toll on the entire MedTech industry since its enactment in 2013. In addition, the recent change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the entire healthcare system. This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally invasive surgeries, rising demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model among others.Let's take a look at the major Medical Product stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Nov 7:END", "If you're an investor looking for a market-share leader with a dominant brand name and huge addressable market, one top stock you'll want to check out is Align Technologies (NASDAQ: ALGN) .In this clip from The Motley Fool's Industry Focus: Healthcare , analyst Kristine Harjes and Fool Funds portfolio manager Charly Travers dive into the merits of Align's Invisalign Technology and their market opportunity.A full transcript follows the video.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

To be one of them, just click here .This podcast was recorded on Oct. 19, 2016.Charly Travers : Align Technology is the maker of the Invisalign tooth alignment system. They are the alternative to metal braces. Their core market, historically, has been adults who have decided at some point in their life that their teeth were not as straight as they would like, then they use Invisalign instead of deciding to use metal braces. There's a couple reasons behind that. They're more comfortable to wear; there's no restrictions on the types of food you can eat; you can take them out a little bit at night if you feel like it; and they're basically invisible -- for some people, that's a concern. Invisalign is far and away the market-share leader there. Speaking of, we prefer companies with strong competitive advantages. Align gets it on two fronts. They have to do a lot of R&D. They've been doing this for 15 years to build products that actually work, because the dentists won't use them if they don't. Then, there's regulatory approvals that any new company who wants to do this would have to do that as well. So, they've paired those barriers to entry with creating a brand around their product. Some of the best companies in the world got there because they have a brand that consumers love, and they just built that out. So they have multiple angles around their competitive advantage that we really find admirable.END", "END", "Image source: Getty Images.There have been plenty of smiles for Align Technology (NASDAQ: ALGN) shareholders in 2016.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ALGN options chain for the new December 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $43.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ALGN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $49.01/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 72%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract .

The sales growth was weaker than anticipated due to 44.6% and 3.9% sales decline in Korea and the U.S., respectively.The company continues to face challenges on the margin front. STAAR Surgical's gross margin was negatively impacted by higher distribution costs, increased inventory reserves, ICL unit costs and preloaded acrylic mix.

When the company reported its second-quarter results in July, things were looking up, with momentum expected to continue through August.On the other hand, many North American dentists and international doctors take vacations during those same summer months.

The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist.

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Henry Schein's adjusted EPS of $1.43 in the fourth quarter of 2013 increased 13.5% year over year beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%. Revenues rose 4.9% to $2.53 billion, exceeding the same benchmark by $1 billion.Henry Schein is well positioned to gain from its extensive global foothold and diverse channel mix.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ALGN options chain for the new October 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $45.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ALGN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $53.67/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

I also mention a few strong stocks among the pharmaceuticals, financials and builders that look good now.---The Stocks That Got Away: 2013 EditionThe transition from December to January can be a tough one, especially if you live in New England. All of the 2013 holiday good cheer is just a memory, the Christmas tree is lying on top of the remaining 12\" of dirty snow by the street and the thermometer read 7 degrees F when I got up. Welcome to the reality of the New Year.Fortunately, I have my usual way of cheering myself up in early January. I always spend a little time researching the top-performing stocks of the previous year. The irritation I feel from looking at all the stocks I didn't own that blew off the charts makes me forget all about the frigid temps, slick roads and gray skies.If you enjoy the same kind of wallowing in stock-market regret that I do, here's what we all missed.#1 The top-performing stock of 2013 (drum roll) was Canadian Solar ( CSIQ ) , a Chinese solar company based in Canada. CSIQ soared a staggering 777% during the year, from 3.5 on January 2 to 29.82 on December 31.Like many stocks that make big gains in any given year, CSIQ is a rebound story. The stock was trading at 34 when 2010 dawned, but fell over the next two years to below 5. The stock spent all of 2012 trading under 5 on sparse volume. And it even got a late start on its big 2013 run, waiting until May to get above 5, which is also when volume began to pick up.[Note: CSIQ probably wasn't even the top-performing stock of the year in absolute terms. But I'm not interested in the monumental moves made by inconsequential stocks. So I screen for stocks that trade at least 50,000 shares a day, on average, and that finished the year trading above 10. This isn't any guarantee of institutional quality, but it does eliminate most  penny stocks and other mayflies from the pool.]#2 The second-best performer in 2013 was VisionChina Media ( VISN ) , a Chinese advertising company that delivers ads via monitors on mass-transit systems in 19 cities. VISN made a 680% gain during the year.But the chart for VISN is a bit bizarre, with almost zero investor interest from the beginning of the year (where it opened at 3.2) through early October. The stock was still trading at 2.45 on October 4, but blasted off to 4.5 on October 7 and rode a wave of big-volume buying to as high as 18 later in the month. But a sizable correction pulled the stock back to earth, and when December dawned, VISN was flat as a pancake at 9. Then came another rocket shot that peaked over 30 in late December, before a selloff on December 30 that scrubbed of a full six points. VISN finished the year at 23.8.Just btw, VISN is continuing its volatile ways, dipping below 20 on January 8, then tacking on a couple of points on January 9. Volatility cuts both ways.So, what conclusions can I draw from these two stocks?Well, first, it's good to start from a very low base. Low prices attract a more speculative kind of investor, and aggressive players can make for big gains. Then, when a stock gets into the low double digits, the bigger sharks start to take notice, which can give a hot issue a new tank of fuel.Am I surprised that both of the top performers were stocks of Chinese companies? Not at all. Chinese stocks have been out of favor for Western investors for at least a couple of years, so conditions were ripe for a shift in sentiment. In all, four of the top ten performers for 2013 were Chinese stocks.It's also worth noting that when I did this research last year, I found just 12 stocks that met my price and liquidity requirements that had topped 200% gains. This year, I had to cut off my list at 16 stocks that had booked gains of over 400% for the year!As I did last year, I'll be working on a report on all 16 of the top performers for the year. I'll be happy to send it to you when it's finished, probably some time in the middle of next week.To get the report, just email us at timothylutts@cabotwealth.com and I'll send it when its finished. And you can join me in torturing yourself with the ones that got away!---Here's this week's Fortune Cookie. Remember, you can always view all previous Fortune Cookies here and  Contrary Opinion buttons here.Tim's Comment: Up close, everything about investing is different these days, with technology playing a huge part. But if you step back and look at the patterns of stocks, you see the exact same patterns that existed a century ago-and the reason is simple. Human emotions play a huge part in investment decisions, and always will. Today, sentiment is improving everywhere, thanks to growing productivity and falling unemployment, and thus stocks are rising. But when sentiment peaks, watch out!Paul's Comment: Lots of people use this French aphorism as a cynical dismissal of the idea that anything can ever change for the better. But I love it for its wry take on history, just as I flinch when I hear anyone say, \"It's different this time\" about anything at all. The fundamental things apply, as time goes by, no matter what. And the more you learn about the history of the stock market, the more you appreciate the market's ingenuity in finding new ways to produce the same results, over and over.In case you didn't get a chance to read all the issues of Cabot Wealth Advisory this week and want to catch up on any investing and stock tips you might have missed, there are links below to each issue.Cabot Wealth Advisory 1/6/14 - The Year AheadIn this issue, Cabot Stock of the Month editor Tim Lutts disposes of his predictions for the year in a few sentences.

Henry Schein expects the acquisition to be dilutive to its earnings per share by 3-5 cents in 2014 and 3-4 cents in 2015.Recent investments made by Henry Schein reveal the company's strategic intentions to tap lucrative opportunities in the dental implant market in regions like Europe and the United States. The company seeks to expand its footprint in the dental implant market that is expected to rise to $1.5 billion in 2016 from $1.0 billion in 2012, taking into consideration U.S. and Canada alone.Alongside increased consumer awareness, and high success rates in implant procedures have helped accelerate growth in this market.

Banking on its core product Invisalign, the company witnessed balanced sales growth across all its channels. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?Align's preliminary third-quarter 2013 results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Along with revenues, earnings per share (EPS) remained above the guidance range. This has led the company to provide a strong fourth-quarter guidance, which further boosts investors' confidence.Align witnessed balanced sales growth across all its channels during the last reported quarter. There was strong Invisalign volume growth in all product segments, customer channels and geographies, reflecting continued increase in its utilization.Total Invisalign revenue surged 21.2% year over year on increased Invisalign shipment and higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs). This was primarily due to strong volume growth in Asia-Pacific coming from traditional direct country markets of Japan and China, as well as new direct country markets in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. Collectively, this region continues to represent a strong growth opportunity for Align.END", "AxoGen, Inc.

The results also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3%. The company delivered a strong top line as well, beating the revenue estimates.Though Align Technology delivered impressive growth during the quarter, persisting global challenges remain an area of concern. Moreover, we believe the large competitive landscape might compel the company to lower prices of some of its products going forward. This can potentially impact growth prospects for the company in the near term.Furthermore, the general slowdown in the US economy can tamper the future revenue figures.

Consistent solid overseas growth amid several macroeconomic uncertainties in the European market is encouraging. The pipeline development also bolsters confidence. Meanwhile, Cyberonics has been rewarding its shareholders with attractive share repurchases.However, the CMS decision on TRD indication was a major downfall for the company.

This imaging and interoperability solutions provider carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Why the Reiteration?Merge's third-quarter 2013 adjusted earnings per share of a penny marked a slight improvement from the loss incurred in the year-ago quarter. Revenues declined 5.2% to $57.2 million. Dismal performance over the past few quarters and the recent exit of the company's CEO and chairman raised our concern. Notably, the growth prospect of the company is highly dependent on the capital investment environment at hospitals and reimbursement rates.The business of Merge Healthcare depends on the capital investments for advanced imaging solutions made by hospitals. Its business is also susceptible to the Medicare reimbursement rates for advanced medical imaging that could adversely impact hospital and imaging clinic revenues, thereby reducing demand for imaging-related software and services offered by the company.END", "On Dec 13, we maintained our long-term Neutral recommendation on Henry Schein Inc.

Revenues increased 5.3% year over year to $2.34 billion, but failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 billion.The year-over-year growth at both the fronts is indicative of the company's consistent growth via organic and inorganic means. The company continues to gain from its broad footprint in the fast growing animal health market. Growth in its core dental business also bolsters confidence. Henry Schein is well positioned to further gain from its extensive global foothold and diverse channel mix. It also stands to gain from attractive market dynamics and favorable demographic trends.We are encouraged to find that in spite of the austerity measures in Europe, HSIC continues to garner market share in the Dental segment.

Despite that, Mike says there are still many \"dependable growth\" stocks acting well, and highlights a few that could be bought during this weakness. Click below to watch the video!---We're at an interesting point in the stock market. And by interesting, of course, I mean threatening as hell.Many of the growth stocks that made it such a fun summer have gone into retreats. The major indexes, while they haven't really turned down, have shown a couple of weeks of increased volatility and took a vicious left hook to the nose on Thursday.As always, Cabot remains obdurately silent about what might happen to the market in the future. It's possible that markets will reel around like a linebacker with a concussion for a while longer. Or we may be at the beginning of the 15% correction that so many commentators love to predict. Or markets may pull up their big-boy pants and get back on the upward path.I don't know. Cabot doesn't know. And we doubt that anybody out there knows, although whatever happens, someone will take credit for predicting it and brag about it for years to come.I think Hamlet was probably the best commentator for the present circumstance. He said, \"If it be now, 'tis not to come. If it be not to come, it will be now. If it be not now, yet it will come.\" (Translation for today's market: We're going to get a correction sometime, but we don't know when.)But it's what Hamlet says next that makes him look like the historical predecessor to a Cabot growth analyst. He said, \"The readiness is all.\"I couldn't have said it better myself.Bull markets are easy: you buy. Bear markets are easy: you sell.But the transitions from one to the other and back again can send strong men in search of the Xanax bottle. Or a bottle of something else.And that's because change is difficult for everyone. It's emotionally difficult to give up the rosy glow of a brokerage account in an uptrend and prepare your portfolio for foul weather. It's like the scramble when a sudden thunderstorm interrupts a pleasant picnic.It's equally difficult for people to leave behind their depression and lethargy after a long bear market ends and there's a new bull in town. Too many people miss the opportunity to grab those early gains when markets turn up. Bear hangovers are hard to cure \u2026 and expensive, too.The key to managing markets in transition is planning ahead. Follow the Cabot timing disciplines to see clearly when markets change character. Know your loss limits for each of your holdings and follow the selling rules when market turn down. Have a watch list and be ready to buy when markets turn up.Market transitions-and I'm not sure whether we're in one now or are just getting faked out again-only cause major damage if you just sit there, either because you don't have a plan, or you don't have the emotional resources to take action.The readiness is all.
