The company owns the rights to\u00a0Monopoly and\u00a0G.I. Joe, among other assorted brand names you might remember from your childhood. The company also has strong ties to\u00a0Disney\u00a0and produces\u00a0Star Wars action figures, not to mention toys for the Marvel cinematic universe. You want a Baby Yoda? Hasbro will be making it.While the association with Disney is a huge positive for this stock going forward, there are a couple of major headwinds that investors should consider before buying. One big problem is that young people aren't having as many kids. The U.S. birth rate has been shrinking for years, and it's kids who create demand for toys -- fewer kids equals less demand.That's not the biggest problem, however. The biggest challenge is that Hasbro is competing with the likes of Activision Blizzard, Nintendo, and Take-Two Interactive, among others. The toy industry risks being stuck in the past and missing out on the future -- and the future for children's entertainment is digital.END", "The video game industry has always been intensely competitive, but in recent years, new game formats such as mobile and free-to-play have shifted the landscape. Traditionally, companies would focus on selling games for consoles and charge as much as $60 upfront. Today, one of the most popular games in the world is Fortnite, which is completely free to play.Some game publishers, such as Take-Two Interactive,\u00a0have been slow to adapt. The company has extraordinary game franchises but little progress to show in mobile gaming or esports.Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) is an example of a video game company that has done a great job expanding into the new frontier of gaming.

Since then, EA stock has traded largely sideways around the $115 level amid broader market turbulence and a lousy fourth quarter earnings report from the company.END", "The stock sell-off we have experienced in recent weeks has probably led some to look for bargains on the stock market. As most investors know, a low nominal stock price does not necessarily mean a stock has become a bargain. A lower stock price can change the value proposition of many stock investments.Moreover, the economic downturn induced by coronavirus has altered the dynamics of our economy. This has become most apparent in the country's changing consumption patterns.Furthermore, the crisis has changed the U.S.'s relationship with China. Both of these changes will bring new opportunities in some areas, while closing the door in others. This includes many stocks that trade in the single digits. Given this new reality, investors should consider taking a look at Nokia (NYSE: NOK), PBF Energy (NYSE: PBF), and Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA).END", "Amid COVID-19 lockdowns, one area that has fared well is video game stocks. With millions of Americans unable to leave their homes or go to work, video games have become an easily accessible distraction.Video game stocks fell along with the rest of the market in March. However, most have already recovered the losses from their pre-pandemic highs. As workers return to their jobs, some investors may be concerned that these stocks might not have reason to go higher.However, both Sony and Microsoft will release new consoles next year, and hardware is still a critical component in this industry. Given the original game and product releases, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA) could provide the industry with an additional boost even if many gamers have less time for their hobby.END", "Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel, one standout is the The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR\u2014 Fund (Symbol: XLC) where we have detected an approximate $86.6 million dollar inflow -- that's a 1.1% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 152,800,000 to 154,500,000).

(Symbol: EA) saw new options become available today, for the June 26th expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EA options chain for the new June 26th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $110.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $106.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $115.05/share today.\n\nBecause the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
