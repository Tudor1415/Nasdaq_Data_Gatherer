We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  \n\nIn the case of Fastenal Co., the RSI reading has hit 29.8 \u2014 by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 24.1.  A falling stock price \u2014 all else being equal \u2014 creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield.  Indeed, FAST's recent annualized dividend of 1/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.86% based upon the recent $35.02 share price.\n\n\nA bullish investor could look at FAST's 29.8 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.  Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on FAST is its dividend history.  \n\nIn general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.\n\n\nEND", " A year ago, I wrote an article about  that had announced a dividend increase in the first 64 days of 2019.\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0To make the exercise even more useful, I tried to diversify my picks by selecting one stock from seven different sectors.

The table below details the recent insider buying activity observed at LLY:END", "There are two really big questions that investors in the industrial sector are asking themselves right now, and they both relate to the second half of 2020. The first is whether there's any validity in the thesis that there will be a recovery in the industrial economy in the second half. That idea has been tossed out there by several management teams so far this year. On a related note, the second question is when exactly the Boeing (NYSE: BA) 737 MAX will return to service (RTS). Let's take a look at what these questions mean and what stocks you should follow to try and find the answers.END", "In trading on Thursday, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) touched a new 52-week high of $38.24/share.  That's a 34.74% rise, or $9.86 per share from the 52-week low of $28.38 set back on 08/07/2019.  That means at today's intraday high, any investor who purchased FAST stock any time over the past 52 weeks has an unrealized gain, including company insiders.\n\n\nOver the past six months, insiders have been scooping up shares, and those bets are now paying off handsomely.  As summarized by the table below, FAST has seen 2 different instances of insiders buying over the trailing six month period.\n\n\n\nEND", "The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 04/15/2019 settlement date, and Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) is the #35 most shorted of the S&P 500 components, based on 9.44 \"days to cover.\"  There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the \"days to cover\" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.  The number of shares short is then divided by the average daily volume, to express the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.  \n\n\n\nIn the case of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), the total short interest at the 04/15/2019 settlement date was 22,224,359 shares, which compares to the average daily trading volume of just 2,354,139 shares, for a \"days to cover\" ratio of 9.44.  \n\n\nWhen short sellers eventually cover their positions, by definition there must be buying activity because a share that is currently sold short must be purchased to be covered.  At the present levels of short interest, if from this point forward every single FAST share traded represented a short position being closed, then at the average daily volume of 2,354,139 shares it would only be during the 10th trading day that every short position would be closed.  \n\n\nSo it would stand to reason that should some unexpectedly good news come out, and short sellers did not have 10 days of patience but instead wanted to cover their short positions very suddenly, that situation could result in sending the stock higher until the higher price produces enough sellers to generate the necessary volume to close out those positions quickly.\n\nEND", "Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 1/30/20, Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), Signet Jewelers Ltd (Symbol: SIG), and Alliant Energy Corp (Symbol: LNT) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends.
