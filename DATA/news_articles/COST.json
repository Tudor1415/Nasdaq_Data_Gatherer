Customer traffic posted a rare decline in the period despite surging demand in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic containment efforts.The warehouse retailer also noted a slightly lower core gross profit margin, as it maintained low prices on in-demand products like consumer electronics.

At the same time, its reputation for bulk goods at rock-bottom prices continues to bring in customer in droves, and it consistently racks up strong same-store sales growth. No other warehouse chain has come close to the level of sales that Costco does, which has given it a competitive advantage in the subsector.\u00a0However, the pandemic has brought about rapid change in the retail sector. In addition to the bifurcation between non-essential and essential retailers, and pressure in categories like apparel, e-commerce has boomed as shoppers who have been sheltering in place or are simply reluctant to visit a store are now shopping online.\u00a0That's driven a spike in e-commerce with a number of online retail channels reporting Black Friday levels of traffic in April.\u00a0Adobe\u00a0Digital Economy Index reported domestic e-commerce sales up 49% in April from March, while online grocery saw\u00a0an even bigger boom, jumping 110% from March to April.\u00a0END", "EnWave (TSXV: ENW)\u00a0(OTC: NWVCF)\u00a0reported fiscal second-quarter 2020 results on Friday, May 29, before the market open.
