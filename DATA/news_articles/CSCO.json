But the cybersecurity specialist has grown even more popular amid the pandemic.

The company is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2020 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday.\u00a0Ahead of Thursday\u2019s results, Rosenblatt Securities analysts Yun Kim upgraded Zscaler from Hold to Buy while increasing the price target from $58 to $75.

In fact, some well-placed bets on certain technology growth companies can also lead to mouthwatering returns, right there in the public markets.Of course, not just any new company will go on to generate this kind of performance. It has to be the right company that delivers the right kind of solution to the right kind of market (preferably, a big one).The following three companies have each demonstrated that \"secret sauce,\" allowing each to generate tenfold returns in less than 10 years, turning a potential $10,000 investment at their respective IPOs into $100,000 or more.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CSCO options chain for the new July 2nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $42.50 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $42.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $42.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CSCO, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $45.25/share today.\n\nBecause the $42.50 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.24% return on the cash commitment, or 2.04% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cisco Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $42.50 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nEND", "In this episode of MarketFoolery, Chris Hill and Motley Fool analyst Bill Barker go through some of the latest earning reports and market headlines and talk about a company that is well-positioned to succeed in a work-from-home culture.
