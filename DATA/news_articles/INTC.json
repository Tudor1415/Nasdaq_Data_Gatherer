The same principle helped power the rise of cloud computing over the past two decades and helped Intel build a massive data center business.When software developers turn to a cloud computing provider such as Amazon.com AMZN.O or Microsoft Corp MSFT.O for computing power, they do not rent a full physical server inside a data center. Instead they rent a software-based slice of a physical server called a \"virtual machine.\"Such virtualization technology came about because software developers realized that powerful and pricey servers often ran far below full computing capacity. By slicing physical machines into smaller virtual ones, developers could cram more software on to them, similar to the puzzle game Tetris. Amazon, Microsoft and others built profitable cloud businesses out of wringing every bit of computing power from their hardware and selling that power to millions of customers.END"]}
