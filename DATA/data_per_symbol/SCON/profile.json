Superconductivity is the unique ability to conduct electricity\r\nwith little or no resistance when cooled to \"critical\" temperatures. HTS\r\nmaterials are a family of elements that demonstrate superconducting properties\r\nat temperatures significantly warmer than previous superconducting materials.\r\nElectric currents that flow through conventional conductors encounter\r\nresistance. This resistance requires power to overcome and generates heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f30%2f0001193125-20-090986.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Jeffrey A.
