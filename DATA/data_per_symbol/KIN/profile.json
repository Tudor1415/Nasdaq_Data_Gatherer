Our mission is to bring to our pets the\r\nsame kinds of safe and effective medicines that our human family members enjoy.\r\nOur core strategy is to identify targets that have already demonstrated safety\r\nand efficacy in humans and to develop therapeutics based on these validated\r\ntargets for dogs and cats. We believe that this approach will lead to shorter\r\ndevelopment times and higher approval rates than pursuing new, non-validated\r\ntargets. Our current portfolio includes two approved products and over 20\r\nproduct candidates in development, predominantly biologics. We also have\r\nstate-of-the-art biologics manufacturing capabilities and a broad intellectual\r\nproperty portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f16%2f0001561743-20-000009.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Denise M.
