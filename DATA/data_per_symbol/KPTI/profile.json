Our scientific expertise is based upon an\r\nunderstanding of the regulation of intracellular communication between the\r\nnucleus and the cytoplasm. We have discovered and are developing and\r\ncommercializing novel, small molecule\r\nS\r\nelective\r\nI\r\nnhibitor of\r\nN\r\nuclear\r\nE\r\nxport\r\n(\r\nSINE\r\n) compounds that inhibit the nuclear export protein exportin 1, or XPO1. These\r\nSINE compounds represent a new class of drug candidates with a novel mechanism\r\nof action that have the potential to treat a variety of high unmet medical need\r\ndiseases. Our SINE compounds were the first oral XPO1 inhibitors in clinical\r\ndevelopment.
