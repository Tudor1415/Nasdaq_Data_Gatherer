We combine proven scientific expertise with a\r\npassion for developing novel small molecule drugs that target disease pathways\r\nfor potential applications in oncology. We are focused on advancing IPI-549, an\r\norally administered, clinical-stage, immuno-oncology product candidate that\r\nselectively inhibits the enzyme phosphoinositide-3-kinase-gamma, or PI3K-gamma.\r\nWe believe IPI-549 is the only inhibitor of PI3K-gamma currently being\r\ninvestigated in clinical trials.\r\nSelective inhibition of PI3K-gamma by IPI-549 has been shown in preclinical\r\nstudies to reprogram macrophages from a pro-tumor, immunosuppressive function,\r\nto an anti-tumor, immune activating function and to enhance the activity of, and\r\novercome resistance to, checkpoint inhibitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f03%2f0001113148-20-000004.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Adelene Q.
